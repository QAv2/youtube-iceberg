            <p>After a unit was wired either by Hendershot or other experimenters he would sit down at the device with a length of insulated wire bared at each end and begin making connections to various terminals of the unit until the solenoid magnet combination would buzz and the output load, if it was a standard 110 volt light bulb, would glow.</p>
<p>He then would adjust the air gap between the magnet and solenoid coils until full brilliance was achieved and the buzzer produced a steady tone. This procedure would take from a few minutes to several hours.</p>
<p>On one occasion he adjusted the unit for 10 to l5 minutes and only achieved a flash of light from the output. Several hours later he found it necessary to rebuild the capacitors before any further tests could be made. Either the unit would work immediately or</p>
<p>not at all, depending on the unknown characteristics of the phenomena. It may be noted on the schematic that capacitor C6, which is one half of a dual Pyramid TM58, the positive terminal is connected to one side of the output load. This connection places an electrolytic capacitor</p>
<p>in an AC circuit. A polarized capacitor will not work in an alternating field and will overheat. The schematic diagram as shown in Fig. 1 did</p>
<p>operate for ten to fifteen minutes before the capacitor began to boil and blow out. If an experimenter should be fortunate enough to achieve success in producing power it may be advisable to connect this capacitor the same as C4. Experimenters who have worked with Hendershot</p>
<p>may have other circuit diagrams that also produced results, but this story has been this writer&#x27;s experience in a true story of Free Energy Phenomena. If you want more about the Hendershot Generator please click the link below</p>
