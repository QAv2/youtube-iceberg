            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Well, good day and welcome to this week&#x27;s Q&amp;A. Hard on the heels of the quite extraordinary and I think intriguing James Fox Vajinha Brazil UAP UFO crash press conference that was held at the National Press Club just last Tuesday the 20th. And here to help me through it, of course, is Megan Midik, who was our reporter on the ground in DC. How did it go, Megan? Tell me some of the I guess the feeling that you had on the floor on the day. What was the sentiment, &gt;&gt; Ross? I just think the best word to describe it is extremely emotional and it was a wide range of emotions.</p>
<p>When these witnesses were speaking, the room was like eerily silent and everybody was captivated and locked in on what they were saying. And then, you know, there would be funny moments and people would laugh, it just it it almost was like everyone was kind of sharing emotions together and exploring something together. And um even though some of the testimonies, you know, we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve heard this before in Moment of Contact um and and over time, but hearing it again in person just felt so real. Um but it kind of felt like everyone was experiencing it together. So it was emotional and great.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; From where I was sitting, I I found it quite moving to see the emotion in people like Dr. Italo Venturelli and Dr. Armando Finato. two two men who obviously struggled with the decision about whether to come forward. It was obviously an emotional thing for them at times during their speeches.</p>
<p>Both of them teiered up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Carlos as well, you know, I I went to the rehearsals for the press conference the night before. So I actually got to see everyone go up and practice before and there was crying and emotion then and you could you could feel it was going to be so strong on the day and on on the day there was actually more crying but I I had seen it. I knew what was coming and I still was tearing up and putting my hand on my heart and really connecting with these with these men.</p>
<p>So um yeah was I mean I don&#x27;t know if beautiful is the word but um I mean they really poured their souls out up there. &gt;&gt; [gasps] &gt;&gt; So, Megan, I think a woman is a good judge of moral character and truthfulness. What did you think? Did you see any trace of guile, uh, evasion, deceit? Were these people telling the truth? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. Ross, I have to say these were some of the kindest, most welcoming people I have ever met.</p>
<p>When I met them the night night before I walked in, I am a total stranger to them. They hugged me. They were kissing me on the cheek. They were saying hello. They were engaging.</p>
<p>Um, I would I would think that 30 years, that&#x27;s a long time to keep up a lie. And if you&#x27;re going to tell a lie for 30 years, and then the person who&#x27;s been interviewing you for decades, James Fox, says, &quot;Okay, we are going to take you to America and we&#x27;re going to stand up at the at at the capital and we&#x27;re going to do all this.&quot; Don&#x27;t you think that would kind of be the time where you&#x27;re like, uh, actually, like I don&#x27;t want to do that anymore. You know, like that kind of would have been the time to bail on your on your tail or make some excuse. But these men are standing by the their stories. They&#x27;re putting their hand on the Bible.</p>
<p>And to me, it was unbelievably believable. Now, Megan, the thing that I&#x27;m shocked by, not just disappointed, but shocked, is NewsNation&#x27;s camera from a major news network was, I think, the only network that was broadcasting from the room yesterday in in the press conference. There were no none of the mainstream media. No CBS, ABC, NBC, no PBS, no Fox. I think Newsmax had a camera there, but I&#x27;m really shocked that this press conference didn&#x27;t get any coverage at all from any of the other media.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Ros, I I agree with you and a part of me, you know, wants to sit back and put myself in, oh, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a news director of a network. um when I put myself in those shoes of what to cover and I see virginha Brazil this this this and this maybe it&#x27;s just too complicated of a story and you&#x27;re like oh people won&#x27;t get it nobody knows but then you&#x27;re just you&#x27;re missing out on an entire community of people who do know and do care and by the way we broke the record yesterday for the amount of live comments dur live during a live stream for the network if that doesn&#x27;t show you that there is a massive amount of interest in this topic that I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what could. But it&#x27;s disappointing that other networks aren&#x27;t picking up on that and not giving the people what they want because as a news producer that&#x27;s your job to give people the stories that they want. &gt;&gt; So I understand you did some interviews after the press conference with some of the key witnesses and I&#x27;m really excited to hear from Dr. Italo Venturelli.</p>
<p>You got a chance to speak with him and his wife, I understand. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yep. I will pull that up for you right now. Let me add it to the stage.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; How are you feeling now that the press conference is over? &gt;&gt; That he was able to say a little bit that he&#x27;s not able to say everything otherwise people are going to think he&#x27;s crazy. I promise I will not think you are crazy. &gt;&gt; Give me the goods. &gt;&gt; No, forget. I really like the Americans because Americans are very sincere.</p>
<p>In other countries, people usually say things with second intentions. Americans are more frank. They say what they&#x27;re saying. They say what they&#x27;re thinking and they disagree if they need to. And that&#x27;s very good because the questions he&#x27;s asked, it shows that people are really interested in what he has to say.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s people and these are people that have read things. They&#x27;ve understood. They&#x27;ve studied these things. So, they&#x27;re genuinely interested. &gt;&gt; Well, we are blunt and bold and very interested.</p>
<p>I can promise you that. &gt;&gt; So, I have a couple of questions for you. The first question is, I&#x27;m very curious as to who brought these beings to the hospital. If they were not in an a military capacity or an officer um captivity, how did they get taken to the hospital in the first place? &gt;&gt; He doesn&#x27;t know how they got there. &gt;&gt; When he was called to see it in the room, &gt;&gt; it was already there.</p>
<p>And when he got into the room, he was actually his mind was with this other child that he had performed surgery on earlier. So he was really wanting to check on this other child. So his time with the being was limited. &gt;&gt; That being was all right and it didn&#x27;t need him. So he had to go over to attend to the other child.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No militaries. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He didn&#x27;t see military personnel at that time. Did you perform any kind of medical technique at all on this being um like a like a physical or check for breathing or a heart um a heart monitor. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s very trained as a doctor to do a visual assessment of what was going on. There was no monitor like monitoring this being&#x27;s like vitals or anything.</p>
<p>So all of his interaction was assessing the being visually. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s called the Glasgow scale. &gt;&gt; Glasco the eyes. &gt;&gt; The eyes &gt;&gt; the breathing &gt;&gt; of how it&#x27;s swallowing &gt;&gt; the movement &gt;&gt; orientation. And so he went on that checklist.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s called ectoscopy. Ectoscopy. &gt;&gt; So you had no physical contact with the being. Do you know? &gt;&gt; No. No.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No. No touching. &gt;&gt; And do you know how that being got into the room? Was it someone on on your team? Did they have physical contact with the being to bring them in there? &gt;&gt; The doctor that brought him into the room, that doctor had physical contact. Unfortunately, he passed away &gt;&gt; already. &gt;&gt; He potentially um stitched up this being&#x27;s head &gt;&gt; and no and no harm came to him because we know the 23-year-old Brazilian officer who died had received a a scratch.</p>
<p>So that could potentially received a scratch. So that would be the difference here. smoking and &gt;&gt; yeah know this this other doctor who operated he&#x27;s no longer with us because he had a different lifestyle he smoked a lot so he he left of a heart attack but he died of natural causes and not because of the being &gt;&gt; and he had gloves and stuff so I guess at the hospital there was more care around handling the being &gt;&gt; yeah okay great that yeah that was my question like gloves not bare hands mask etc okay I I would love to talk to you about the feeling of the being because you said that you felt when you were in the room that the being was the elder and you were the child. Can you describe that to me a little bit &gt;&gt; through the eyesight and gaze? So the being was more like an elder. When you&#x27;re talking to a child, the child&#x27;s attention goes everywhere and goes way over here, over there.</p>
<p>And this was the gaze of an elder that was fully aware of where it was, what was happening, and that focused attention of an elder. So it almost had seemed like he had studied humans and just kind of said, &quot;Now here I now here I am.&quot; He didn&#x27;t seem surprised like, &quot;Oh my gosh, they got me.&quot; absolutely sure that this being knew where it was, knew what was happening, and possibly knew what was about to happen after. &gt;&gt; There was no logical time like the time you see on the clock. &gt;&gt; It was a different type of time as in the being was looking at him as if it had been looking at him for hours. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>Just like I am looking at you right now. But at that moment time stretched. &gt;&gt; So you have enough time to understand. It&#x27;s not time ticking on the seconds. It&#x27;s a different type of time where everything can be understood.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like an enlargement of time. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like it gets inside of time. Time stops. You get in, you understand everything, and then time goes on. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s incredible.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m I&#x27;m gonna just ask you one more question about your family. Has this taken a toll on your family, your wife, your children? Oh. Is this your wife? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question? &gt;&gt; You know, this has been one of the biggest things on my my mind. &gt;&gt; Oh, so sorry.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh. Oh my gosh. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I will talk.</p>
<p>I &gt;&gt; Okay, so let&#x27;s all &gt;&gt; Okay. I don&#x27;t even need to be I don&#x27;t even &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t not me. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s fine, Megan. I love it. I love the fact that you got the wife.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s fantastic. &gt;&gt; So, one of the biggest things on my mind is people, you know, believing this. Um, on our show we have whistleblowers coming forward and accounts and people emailing us every day about different things that they&#x27;ve seen. So if you are not telling the truth, the the facade that you put out in the public after 30 years has to come down sometime. So you are home with him every day for 30 years.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; For 23 years. &gt;&gt; Okay. They&#x27;ve been You&#x27;ve been married for 23 years. What is it like with him at home outside of the public arena of coming forward with this case? No, nothing changes in the h in the home space to her. It&#x27;s all the same.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t change. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you. I appreciate you. My pleasure. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You guys are great. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s fascinating, Megan. The the the thing that leaps out at me about that is Dr. Italo Vincentelli. He&#x27;s just so matterof fact about what he says he saw.</p>
<p>This is not somebody who&#x27;s having to when you&#x27;re meeting somebody who&#x27;s making up a story, they often have to remind themselves about the story in the back of their head. They have to they have to go back and rethink. He&#x27;s just very very matter of fact and so is his wife. I mean this is obviously an incident that had had a huge and profound effect on him. I think the most interesting thing in that exchange was the way he talked about how time changed when he was talking or at least communicating in some way with the being.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I just have to remind myself we&#x27;re talking here about a professional doctor, a neurosurgeon saying he was having a one-on-one communication exchange with a nonhuman advanced being. I mean, that&#x27;s mind-blowing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I find it incredibly uh and he&#x27;s an extremely convincing witness.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. And he&#x27;s also saying in there that it is clear that they have studied us, are studying us, knew where he was, and knew what was going on. Um, wow. &gt;&gt; And yet, and yet a witness like that was available for the entire press corps of Washington DC to come and talk to and they ignored him. I I just find that reprehensible.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go on now to I think Dr. Amando Fortunado who was the pathologist who did the autopsy on the poor 23-year-old Brazilian military policeman who suffered the scratch and the bacterial infection. The key issue obviously that we were going into with this interview with was he suggested in the press conference that there should be an exhumation of the body of this young soldier to see whether the bacterial infection that came allegedly from the alien being could be in some way sampled DNA tested to see what we could find. Is it alien bacterial DNA? And you had the opportunity to ask him that. Let&#x27;s see what he said.</p>
<p>about it. Here it comes. &gt;&gt; How are you feeling now that it&#x27;s over? &gt;&gt; He said he&#x27;s he&#x27;s very he&#x27;s very satisfied. There are many interesting people and questions and even people from the military and from official official circles. There must be a deeper uh investigation of what happened in Virginia both by Brazilian and US authorities.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So something that you said today that really stuck out to me is the possibility of exuming the body of the 23-year-old who died. So if the judge [snorts] of the city, the judge of that part of of that authorizes the exumation, there will be only probably uh bones left. Of course, there&#x27;s no body anymore. &gt;&gt; So what it can be done is the study of the DNA of the bacterium if you can find it still in the bones in &gt;&gt; because according to Dr. Janini, there is a possibility of an extraterrestrial origin for this bacteria.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So this bacteria though, would you want to be wearing some kind of a special suit or would there be a possibility of a pandemic epidemic type situation with this bacteria? &gt;&gt; No, not at all. Not at all. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, what are you looking forward to about going home? &gt;&gt; He he he&#x27;s he already he wants to go back home and see his children and his wife and everything &gt;&gt; with with your family. Has this been hard on them? You speaking out on this topic? &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes, it wasn&#x27;t difficult. Although some are do not believe at all, &gt;&gt; but he&#x27;s very respected and well known there. uh they they they take it seriously. &gt;&gt; Well, you&#x27;re definitely extremely credible and we thank you for your story and your bravery and telling us about the biologics. I think that absolutely changes the narrative on this phenomena.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We go through life in this universe very very in a very uh it&#x27;s very quick. It&#x27;s like 80 90 years and we have to try to make a little contribution to to make this world a better place. But do you do you think that it&#x27;s something to be feared? You know, this this young man did die from this unknown bacteria. So, is that something that people should say the phenomena is scary? Because we hear other accounts, you know, the doctor right behind me saying it&#x27;s very peaceful and and tranquil. &gt;&gt; Uh he doesn&#x27;t see any evil in them at all.</p>
<p>But in regards to the bacteria, &gt;&gt; this bacterium has to be studied, but it already exists on our planet. So it&#x27;s not it didn&#x27;t come from elsewhere. &gt;&gt; We have to just continue to study and research further. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for your time. &gt;&gt; Thank you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; You got a kiss out of him there. &gt;&gt; Oh, you know I did, Ross. little [laughter] lucky lady. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re smooth guys, these Brazilians.</p>
<p>They move in quickly. Um [snorts] I I&#x27;m very I&#x27;m very impressed though by again the cander and the dignity of uh Dr. Amando Fortunado. I mean, he&#x27;s apparently I was impressed to hear in the press conference that he&#x27;s a a police pathologist. He&#x27;s got a long history and quite a respected history as a very respected pathologist in that part of Brazil.</p>
<p>This is not somebody who makes assertions lightly. I guess the big question is going to be whether there&#x27;s the political will in the regional government there to allow the exumation of this young man. I suspect his family would agree because they are obviously concerned that he died in unusual circumstances and they want that investigated. So, we can only hope that the regional government gives the approval for the exhumation so that this extra DNA study can be done to see if there&#x27;s anything anomalous about the bacteria that was uh responsible for killing this poor young man. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, Russ.</p>
<p>I I agree. It just the one thing I&#x27;m just not understanding is, you know, if this bacteria is the cause of death and we we don&#x27;t know what it is. If it is exumed and studied in a lab, who do we trust to control that? I&#x27;m just having like Wuhan back whiplash back, you know, like what&#x27;s going on here? like this is got it&#x27;s got &gt;&gt; I think that I think the point he made was that this is a bacteria that has been found elsewhere in the world. It&#x27;s just that it was extremely unusual that it it got into a human the way it did. Uh so I I guess it&#x27;ll be very interesting to see if they can isolate anything that shows it to be anomalous.</p>
<p>In the sequence of interviews you&#x27;ve got, I understand you actually did manage to corner representative Eric Berles, one of our heroes from the UAP caucus in Congress. And obviously the politics of this event are very important. The big question in my mind is sure here are all these witnesses. They&#x27;ve come all the way to Washington. Was there any effort for them to speak directly with any of the members of Congress or senators? And if so, what&#x27;s going to come of it? What did you manage to ask Representative Berles? &gt;&gt; You know, I I will play the sound, but um I quickly ran over and grabbed him.</p>
<p>There was like a short short tiny break in in the press conference and I just got up and ran over and I grabbed our photographers&#x27;s stick mic and I was like, &quot;Just get me if you can.&quot; Um it was a Ross, it was a hustle, but I&#x27;m going to play you what I got to ask him. They they said &gt;&gt; we we call it We call it on the run, Megan. So, don&#x27;t worry. It&#x27;s as rough as guts. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s real news gathering on the floor in real time.</p>
<p>Here we go. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re experts on it. &gt;&gt; How do you feel about the evidence being presented so far today? &gt;&gt; You know, it&#x27;s there&#x27;s it&#x27;s further compelling testimony. Um I&#x27;m eager to get my hands on any kind of physical evidence before I again I&#x27;m I remain skeptical until I get my hands on anything that&#x27;s substantive and real. But I&#x27;m I&#x27;m at the end of the day, there&#x27;s something going on.</p>
<p>Um, our pilots are reporting these things. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re reporting that they&#x27;re having near miss events and and I think they should be taken seriously. So, uh, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m taking this subject seriously. It doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m jumping to a conclusion that I believe that there&#x27;s that there&#x27;s aliens from another planet, but but it certainly is something going on. &gt;&gt; Well, your presence here today means a lot.</p>
<p>So, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; So, obviously he&#x27;s hedging his bets. Um, the other person of course who was responsible for putting this press conference together was our dear friend and colleague James Fox. And I can imagine for James this has been a logistical nightmare.</p>
<p>How did he feel at the end of the press conference you got the chance to ask him the question? &gt;&gt; Yep. Here we go. No, &gt;&gt; your hair looks better than mine. Just so you know. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you [laughter] so much, James.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m I&#x27;m honored. I&#x27;m honored for the compliment. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been brushing it a lot. You know the usual. &gt;&gt; He complimented my hair.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Are we good? &gt;&gt; Stay right there. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I want to be like this. &gt;&gt; Okay, I&#x27;m good. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Okay, James, first question is a pretty obvious one.</p>
<p>How are you feeling now that it&#x27;s over? You guys prepared for decades and then for hours and hours into the night. How are you feeling now? &gt;&gt; I would say if I was Brazilian, I would say mucho much mayor. Much much better. Um, at some point I&#x27;ll come out with just how complicated and how difficult it was to put this event on because I was dealing with so many things that were outside of my control and um, and it&#x27;s already hard enough when you have committed people to participate, but when you have people that can&#x27;t get the visas or they have to find people to replace them at work, particularly a neurosurgeon, there were so many things that were going sideways. I I at one point for a 24-hour period I couldn&#x27;t even look at my phone because if I have one more piece of bad news, my heart&#x27;s gonna stop.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, just from a personal aspect, I think you did an absolutely fantastic job and you were extremely responsive and so amazing and generous with your time and the access that you&#x27;ve given us to this event um before, during, and now after. So, you should be very proud of that. &gt;&gt; I think I&#x27;m going to Thank you, by the way. I appreciate that very much.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;re in this together. We&#x27;re all in this together. And it&#x27;s one of the things I really appreciate about News Nation. It&#x27;s like one news channel that&#x27;s like, &quot;Hey man, people want to hear about this. We&#x27;re going to report on it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s what they want. Give them what they want.&quot; You have like the New York Times and you have 60 Minutes. Some of their biggest stories in the history of ever have been related with UAP issues, right? Exposing the, you know, previously classified, you know, Pentagon program or secret Pentagon program. Um, just all of those things have been incredibly popular and it&#x27;s just unbelievable to me that peop that other news stations just can&#x27;t can&#x27;t wake up and smell the coffee. So, I appreciate what you guys are doing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, I hope they don&#x27;t. We want a monopoly on you. &gt;&gt; I know. [laughter] Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&#x27;re getting it. But &gt;&gt; so, I did grab Rep. Berles um in the short break that we took. I ran over and I grabbed him and I asked him uh his feelings on the press conference so far. And what he said to me is we still need hard evidence.</p>
<p>He want he wants to see &gt;&gt; hard evidence. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times we hear that in the comments from the viewers from the trolls on the internet to the actual fans of the phenomena. &gt;&gt; What is the likelihood of that happening if the government has hard evidence in their hands and we can&#x27;t even get them to do disclosure, the UAP disclosure act or the whistleblowers protection act. How do you get hard evidence? Yeah, I mean it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating for me as well, right? Because but I I will remind the audience that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard to go after something if you don&#x27;t know it exists. So bringing this case to the light of certain me members of Congress, let&#x27;s see if we could track down that flight, right? We know that a plane probably came in with high likelihood came into campus on or around the 20th of January 1996.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s one of the reasons why I had Colonel Clausen present. He was like, &quot;Hey, you know what? There&#x27;s going to be paper trails. there&#x27;s probably 30 or 40 people that are on that flight. Let&#x27;s go after it. Encourage other people to come forward.</p>
<p>You know, u just seeing the courage of Dr. Elo who&#x27;s a sitting, you know, neurosurgeon that should be infectious. We have the 30th anniversary of the case today. Maybe there are more people there that are encouraged to see power in numbers. So, I feel the frustration.</p>
<p>I want the evidence. Who doesn&#x27;t want the evidence? But you have to go after it. you fail 100% of the time, you don&#x27;t try. So, all we can do is try, right? &gt;&gt; And the evidence that you have brought forward is very hard to refute. &gt;&gt; So, we thank you for working so hard on this and bringing this to light.</p>
<p>And we also thank you for all of your time. &gt;&gt; Oh, I appreciate it so much. Thanks for having me on. Appreciate it. Thanks.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Good on James. He&#x27;s such a gentleman. I mean, the simple fact is none of that would have happened without James Fox&#x27;s tenacity and just incredible commitment to getting to the truth of this whole story over many, many years. It&#x27;s been his dogged persistence, his tenacity that&#x27;s helped get to this level of truth. And frankly, I think we got to a high level of truth, Megan.</p>
<p>I mean, those were firsthand witnesses from the guy who saw the the object crash right through to the three young women who say that they actually saw the being themselves, their mother who described the bribe, the threats, the suitcase of money that she was offered to shut up about what she saw. Um, Dr. Italo Vincerelli, the neurosurgeon who described his telepathic communication with a being right in front of him. Dr. Armando Fortunado, the pathologist who described the autopsy results on the poor young soldier who died from the bacterial infection.</p>
<p>These were all compelling witnesses and they should be heard. The one thing I I will admit privately to some concern is we don&#x27;t know and hopefully there is something happening behind the scenes, but I sincerely hope these witnesses get the chance to testify under oath and give their evidence to the Congress&#x27;s oversight committee so that this can be properly investigated. &gt;&gt; Yep. I agree 100%. And the more people that speak up, the more people that speak up.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s kind of a domino effect. So, hopefully that that takes flight. So that&#x27;s the press conference from the National Press Club on Vajinha. We also had a very interesting NewsNation interview this week with President Trump. Uh uh one of the new hosts of NewsNation came and one of the first shows she presented was an interview with President Trump and this is what President Trump was asked.</p>
<p>Speaking of Venezuela, there was a weapon used, a sonic weapon that took out many of the Cuban bodyguards that were used to to defend Maduro. Uh, lots of people saw the details about that weapon and were concerned. Is that something that Americans should be afraid of? Something the United States is combating? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Something I don&#x27;t want to Nobody else has it. We have weapons that nobody knows about.</p>
<p>And I say it&#x27;s probably good not to talk about them, but we have some amazing weapons. That was an amazing attack. Don&#x27;t forget that house was in the middle of a fort, an army base, a big one, a lot of soldiers. And they came in and they did their job. We had We lost nobody.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s uh from I think Megan Pavlich. Is that correct? Her her name &gt;&gt; Katie Katie Pavlich her new show is called &gt;&gt; Kat Katie Pavich. I apologize. &gt;&gt; So Katie Kat Katie Pavlich got that admission from Trump. It&#x27;s very interesting because there&#x27;s been a succession of statements by both Trump and indeed Vladimir Putin over in Russia.</p>
<p>Both countries suggesting that they&#x27;ve got weapons that the other doesn&#x27;t have, super weapons of some kind. And I I guess the thing that intrigues me, Megan, is is it possible that those weapons are derived from the technologies that we&#x27;re talking about here today? Retrieved nonhuman technology. You know, obviously uh uh Katie asked about some kind of sonic or acoustic weapon, but in some of the accounts, there are even claims from one of the one of the u uh Venezuelan uh people who survived the Delta Force attack that their weapons wouldn&#x27;t work, that for some reason they were, as well as being incapacitated by the acoustic weapon, it seems like perhaps some kind of electromagnetic technology was used to disable their weaponry. So, there&#x27;s a big question mark over the weaponry that was used in that incident. And I wanted to put it on the record that President Trump yet again made another statement about weapons that nobody else has.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yep. Absolutely, Ross. Well, I want to thank you for your time today and doing a little recap with me. Uh, that is all I have for you. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much, Megan, and it was great to have you on the road.</p>
