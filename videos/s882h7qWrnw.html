            <p>foreign hello welcome to my channel I do educational videos on so many different topics but we&#x27;re locked in right now on working on the reciprocal system of theory this is a theory derived by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century uh he died back in 1990 um and shortly after that uh his final book was published called beyond space and time it&#x27;s a book that we&#x27;re uh going over right now uh we&#x27;re in chapter 20 called um moral values and uh the basic idea behind Larson&#x27;s uh system of theory a system of theory it&#x27;s a Theory of Everything a system of theory meaning that if you if you get the theory it&#x27;s a system you can apply it to anything uh you could apply it to any subject and uh but you have to unders kind of understand the basic uh way it works and uh to start with that basic understanding you just uh in Larson&#x27;s system the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion in particular uh most basically it&#x27;s kind of motion that he calls scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that has uh a magnitude but it has no Direction no specific Direction you can think of a scalar motion as taking a balloon putting a bunch of dots on the balloon and blowing up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other if you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other that&#x27;s a scalar motion there&#x27;s no particular direction but uh but there is a magnitude away or toward and that scalar motion even though it takes three dimensions of space to represent that motion that&#x27;s a one-dimensional scalar motion and there are three dimensions uh three scalar dimensions but really mainly we&#x27;re dealing with just one dimension of the scalar motion and that is uh okay so the motion universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time that basically means a fraction or a ratio and it basically means that the space and time are reciprocals of each other just in the same way that two-thirds the reciprocal of two-thirds is three halves um one is on the top and one is on the bottom and then if you invert it then the other one is on the top and the other one is on the bottom but they still have the same basic qualities of two and three and um so too with time and space the thing we know about space is that it&#x27;s three dimensional uh now those are really vectoral Dimensions direct Dimensions with a direction x y z coordinates it takes three of those Dimensions just to make up a scalar one scalar dimension uh but uh x y z coordinates um and you could also uh think of it in terms of four dimensions but we&#x27;ll get into that later um and so time also has three dimensions by the same logic of the reciprocal uh the same qualities adhere to both at time what we know about time is that time is progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later uh in the same way space is progressing the flow of space it&#x27;s always getting further and further apart and we have perceived that through the Hubble telescope way back in the 1920s even all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other no particular direction but um just like the um balloon example or perhaps you could use a more uh not just a surface example but a true three-dimensional example would be something like raisin bread all the raised you know as you cook the bread and it rises all of the raisins are moving away from each other the other thing about space and time uh is that they are uh in discrete units okay there&#x27;s a a quantized there there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space and you can&#x27;t get below that one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light the speed of light is not the fastest speed in the universe as Larson as as Einstein contends but as Larson contends the speed of light is the midpoint of the or the null point of the universe the neutral point half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls this the cosmic sector or sector two half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light that&#x27;s the part that we&#x27;re used to and that is called the material universe or sector one sector one builds up by aggregation up to its most complex level which is DNA uh at that point DNA becomes eligible to be uh made it up with a um Cosmic unit from sector two and when that happens the cosmic unit controls the sector one unit and uh we the toe the total sum of them is the life unit the life unit is a combination of a sector 1 and sector two unit R element and um then uh this life unit also develops up until its most complex form which Larson said it says is the intelligent human being at that point the intelligent human being is eligible to be controlled overall by a sector 3 entity now sector 3 is the area that is outside of space and time independent of space and time beyond space and time or the metaphysical uh other people might call it God or the gods or the spirit world or the religious or uh what have you uh Larson calls it sector three sector three whereas sector two is Guided by evolution by um survival sector 3 is Guided by uh I guess you would say spiritual Evolution or by ethical Behavior so that is really what this whole book is about it&#x27;s about phenomena from sector three from this metaphysical that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called beyond space and time it looks into the metaphysical now the metaphysical can communicate uh with the human being with the intelligent human being under the control of sector three through various things such as intuition uh ESP um religious Revelation uh scientific insight and um those messages that we receive from sector three are all correct our ability to translate those messages varies depending on our level of preparedness so any mistakes that we make coming from sector three I uh is because of our limitations not because those messages are not correct and uh so now he&#x27;s in the middle of chapter 20 talking about moral values and uh the last part that he was just saying here uh are finding that such information uh the information you know about the ethical code um can be obtained by direct communication from sector three through the process we call by various names such as intuition Revelation or Insight now clears a way for a systematic approach to this problem analogous to the procedures of science so he&#x27;s really attempting to kind of turn religion into a science um and that&#x27;s been done before you&#x27;ve probably seen uh you may have seen some of my videos on the Tree of Life uh the tree of life is also I would say an attempt to turn uh religion into a science where you are um you know you have a kind of a hierarchy of spiritual values it&#x27;s a map of um a map of our spiritual uh evolution for lack of a better word our Spiritual Development and um so lar uh let&#x27;s take let Larson take over from here uh the traditional moral value systems were derived from religious sources and in view of the revelatory nature of the original religious doctrines the basic elements of these systems applying as they do to relatively simple ethical issues should be for the most part part authentic okay so when we get these intuitions on simple matters uh we are able to translate them correctly for the most part over the years however the items derived from the original Revelations have been subject to numerous extensions and modifications and the authentic moral principles have been buried in a mass of ritualistic and secular Editions a growing recognition of the absurdity of much of the present content of religion-based moral codes has weakened confidence in their validity and this together with the general decline of religious influence is now responsible for the value crisis in modern society the term that is now commonly applied to the lack of any generally accepted system of moral values crisis now that we have identified the source of the code and the means whereby information concerning its content is transmitted to the human race and have outlined the methods by which the validity of that information can be tested the obstacles that have either two stood in the way of arriving at definite conclusions on moral issues have been eliminated we are now in a position not merely to construct a code but to ascertain the provisions of the code the rules of sector 3. like the analogous task of developing the details of physical the physical Universe from theoretical premises uh just like he did in the reciprocal system when he was dealing with physical things like science like chemistry and physics and astronomy now he&#x27;s plugging this into the metaphysical the task of developing the moral code in full detail is a colossal undertaking and it will not be complete for a long time if ever but it should be possible within a reasonable time to produce a body of ethical knowledge comparable to the existing state of knowledge in the physical world physical field this will accomplish all that is currently expected of a system of ethics to demonstrate this point let us check the general characteristics of the sector 3 code as seen in the light of the discussion in the preceding Pages against those which the philosophers consider essential the requirements which traditional ethics as well as its critics have believed it incumbent upon any ethics to adopt are listed by Evelyn shirk as follows one it must present A single standard or principle in terms of which ethical acts are to be judged two the standard must be Universal applicable in all contexts and at any time or place three it must be precise and unambiguous four it must be acceptable on site and require no extended justification or defense five it must be immune to error and six it must resolve all ethical questions shirt puts out these uh you know these requirements but then she says she calls the requirements silly and totally unrealistic um silly effort to gain Simplicity and she calls it nonsense burden&#x27;s so heavy she says that are they are certain to break the spine of any inquiry into rational practice but Larson says the code of sector 3 has all of these characteristics however unrealistic they may seem to those who are baffled in their attempts to derive a moral code from sources within the physical universe and he makes the following statements about those six uh standards that shirk put up one A single standard the sector 3 code is applicable two the standard is universal it applies at all times and in all places three natural laws are inherently precise and unambiguous if correctly expressed four the statement that ethical man will act in accordance with the natural laws governing the behavior of ethical men requires no further explanation or justification five the code is never wrong but we have a great deal of work to do before we will know it in detail 6. the since the moral objective is total compliance with the sector 3 code a full knowledge of this code is all that is necessary in order to drive a 2A ride at the proper action in any situation that may arise the true basic basis of Ethics then is just the kind of a thing that uh traditional ethics and its critics have always insisted that it must be the individuals so described have had an intuitive understanding of the true situation that has caused them to hold fast to their Viewpoint in spite of its lack of empirical support Intuition or Insight not only gives us the answers to most of our simple ethical problems but also defines the general nature of the moral code upon which these answers are based what this present work has added is the identification of the code as the set of natural laws and principles that govern sectors that govern sector 3 of existence as a whole and then he goes off and starts criticizing shirk uh for her um fallacies um these answers are back to Larson these answers are not all available to us at present but this is not because of Any imperfection of in the physical laws it is because we do not as yet have a full understanding of them the same kind of a situation exists in the ethical field the moral code itself is complete and correct and it is capable of providing the answers to all of our moral problems but we are still in the early stages of developing an adequate understanding of the natural laws that constitute the code a development that necessarily proceeds slowly while we have to contend with those like the author quoted and the various schools of philosophical thought who deny the existence of a fixed moral code uh now he&#x27;s uh he&#x27;s quoting Michael Walser uh who disagrees uh and thinks that uh morality is not a body of factual knowledge uh our findings are in direct conflict morality is such a body of factual knowledge in its entirety is beyond the scope of one year college course but instruction in its essential requirement certainly belongs in the college curriculum um one of the best ways of ensuring a Content continuation of this interest is to emphasize the fact that the moral laws are no different from the physical laws in anything but their subject matter and they are equally susceptible to precise definition the continuing development of the details of the true more moral code that is now possible because of the clarification um will ultimately have some very significant effects it should sooner or later result in purging the religious regulations of the non-moral additions and embellishments that have been accumulated over the years or at least clarify the status of these items enough to deprive them of their mandatory character as matters now stand a vast amount of unnecessary distress is caused by conflicts in which individuals are torn between following a course that they believe is right and obeying an injunction of their church that prohibits it elimination of the non-moral items from the religious regulations will go a long way toward minimizing these conflicts in as much as these non-moral rules are the ones that are most commonly broken or just regarded their elimination from the religious codes will also tend to enhance the authority and increase the observance of the genuinely moral regulations that remain in effect it should also help to counteract the widespread belief that a living that living a moral life is an arduous and disagreeable task uh he quotes a few other people uh that um feel that way uh that&#x27;s too onerous to be moral and he says adapting the moral point of view involves acting on principle it involves conforming to rules even when doing so is unpleasant painful costly or ruinous to oneself now Larson goes ahead many of the organized religions reinforce this impression by portraying Conformity with their directives as religious labor for which recompense is of some kind will ultimately be received but these organizations do not distinguish between moral directives and directives of other kinds uh those are which are ethically neutral and it&#x27;s doubtful if any substantial number of these painful or ruinous consequences uh have resulted from tenacity and upholding moral principles the martyrs in all ages have suffered for the religious or political views not their moral views the Holy Wars and schisms that create so much turmoil in the world are concerned with doctrinal issues not moral issues unless a person takes a fanatical stand on some particular point and insists that his interpretation of this point must take precedence over all other considerations it is not likely that he will have to pay any price for the inner peace that accompanies the knowledge that he has done the right thing perhaps he may have to pass up some opportunities to make dishonest gains but this can scarcely be regarded as a serious hardship as we will see in the next chapter um the common view in which moral behavior is seen as a heavy burden is a gross Distortion of the true picture and so that&#x27;s kind of the point Larson&#x27;s going to get at here I guess in the next chapter chapter 21 called the personal aspect of Ethics a person under the influence of sector 3 an ethical person uh enjoys being ethical doesn&#x27;t see it as a burden um you know it&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s what they want to do not because they&#x27;re compelled to okay we&#x27;ll take over there starting with chapter 21 tomorrow thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
