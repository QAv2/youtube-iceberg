            <p>alrighty hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is uh for educational purposes and uh we look at on this channel we look at uh great theories of everything all-encompassing theories um Paradigm shifters anything that you probably don&#x27;t know about that uh would help you with your Awakening to 5D Consciousness today is the 493rd video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and um Mr Larson was an American engineer back in the 20th century around 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how he believed the universe operated and then he elaborated his postulates through a process of deduction if this than that and uh arrived at a theoretical Universe a universe that uh described what you know what his Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then he compared his theoretical Universe with the observed universe of the Legacy scientists and uh in books like uh basic properties of matter which is the book that we&#x27;re looking at today he uh makes these comparisons uh Larson arrives at various equations for the basic properties of matter and then he Compares them with the scientific tables that have already been published uh you know I think it&#x27;s somewhat telling that Larson is able to uh in many cases almost recreate the scientific tables just from Theory and uh I think that should wake people up enough to recognize that Mr Larson uh maybe isn&#x27;t completely right about everything but that uh something is on the right track with his theories and today we are about to start chapter 15 of this book called electrical storage now if you want to get the ins and outs of the reciprocal system uh you want to check out any of my first 474 videos on the subject where I go at least in a small amount of depth into how the reciprocal system works and what it can be how it can be used and you know the basic uh principles that you probably uh need to know to be able to follow along fairly closely with this book but for the purposes of this video and subsequent videos I&#x27;m pretty much just going to assume that you have some type of working knowledge of the reciprocal system I&#x27;ll stop along the way and try to explain in certain things um but also you must recognize that the reciprocal system is pretty difficult and I don&#x27;t have all the answers myself Larson didn&#x27;t even have all the answers himself and um you know it&#x27;s a work in progress unfortunately Mr Larson died back in 1990 and uh there are uh few people alive who um you know um who are still you know working on this and still writing still um researching and uh you know it needs to be brought back to life because it is a uh you know is a generalized Theory it&#x27;s a theory that you can apply to every subject and uh it has great potential but there is a learning curve that&#x27;s pretty steep and so you know we need to kind of lower the uh gradient of that of that learning curve and uh encourage other people to get along uh get get into it and you know do some things uh as far as pedig pedagogy is concerned uh to to make it uh easier to learn so that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re uh covering this in such detail okay we&#x27;re going to start here with chapter 15 electrical storage uh we now turn to a consideration of the storage of uncharged electrons or what is known as electric current a subject that was not considered earlier because it was more convenient to wait until after the nature of the electric charges was clarified now just keep in mind recall from uh earlier chapters that uh in Larson system the electron is uh uncharged in its natural uh State there is a charged electron and an uncharged electron the uncharged electron is electric current the charged electron is static electricity and the charge on the electron is the same is the charge that is uh can be applied to other particles and like everything in Larson system everything is motion everything is a motion and the electric charge is a rotational vibration U kind of like this and while the electric current or the electron is a rotation the electron is a rotating unit of space okay the basic requirement for storage is a suitable container any conductor is to some extent a container let us consider an isolated conductor of unit cross-section a wire this conductor has a length of n units meaning that it extends through n units of extension space the space represented in the reference system each of these units of the reference system is a location in which a unit of actual space that is the spatial component of a motion may exist in the absence of an externally applied electric voltage the wire contains a certain concentration of uncharged electrons or actual units of space the magnitude of which depends on the composition of the material of the conductor as explained in chapter 11 if this wire is connected to a source of current and a very small voltage is applied more uncharged electrons flow into the wire until all of the units of the spatial reference system that constitute the length of the wire are are occupied unless the voltage is increased the inward flow ceases at this point when the wire is fully occupied the aggregate of electrons could be compared to an aggregate of atoms of matter in one of the condensed States in these states all of the units of extension space within the limits of the aggregate are occupied and no further spatial capacity is available but if a pressure is applied either an internal pressure as defined in chapter 4 or an external pressure the interatomic Motions are extended into time and the addition of the spatial equivalent of this time allows more atoms to be introduced into the same section of the extension space represented in the reference system increasing the density of the matter the number of mass units per unit of volume of extension space beyond the normal equilibrium value this ability of physical phenomenon to extend into time when further extension into space is prevented is a general property of the universe that results from the reciprocal relation between space and time the scope of its application is limited however to those situations in which a spatial response to an applied force is not possible in the example just discussed the compression of solid matter the obstacle to further inward movement in space is the discret UN limitation on subdivision in a wide variety of astronomical phenomena that will be considered in volume three the obstacle is the limit on one-dimensional spatial speed here in the electrical storage process the obstacle is the fixed relation between the unit of actual space and the unit of extension space an n unit section of the extension space represented in the reference system can contain n units of actual space and no more if a voltage is applied to force additional electrons into the fully occupied section of the wire the excess electrons are pushed out into time where they occupy positions in the spatial equivalent of that time this penetration into time can only be accomplished by application of a force as the concentration of uncharged electrons in time is already at an equilibrium level if the voltage is reduced or eliminated the restoring Force tending to bring the electron concentration back into equilibrium reverses the flow and the excess electrons move back out of the w application of a positive voltage similarly withdraws electrons from The Wire and from equivalent space as we have seen in the preceding pages of this and the earlier volume the region of time beyond the unit of space is two-dimensional the concentration of excess electrons and the effective voltage therefore for decreases in direct proportion to the distance from the wire at a rate determined by the basic physical factors and the dimensions of the wire or the conductor reaching the zero level at a specific uh distance let us consider a case in which a conductor is subject subjected to a voltage differential of 2v and the voltage in equivalent space surrounding each term Minal reaches zero at a distance from the terminal terminal as long as the terminals the electrodes are separated by a distance greater than 2s the electron storage the quantity of current that can be withdrawn at the positive asterisk terminal and introduced at the negative asterisk terminal is independent of the location of those terminals I just remember those asteris basically mean that uh these are um positive and negative um according to the conventional usage of the term but they would actually be the reverse of that if um kind of Larsson had is a Dr others but he can&#x27;t really call these things negative and positive when the conventional usage is positive and negative so instead he uses the asterisk however if the separation is reduced to less than 2s a portion of the volume of equivalent space from which the electrons are being withdrawn coincides with the volume of equivalent space into which El are being introduced the excess and deficiency of electrons in this common volume cancel each other decreasing the net excess or deficiency at the terminals and thereby reducing the voltage this means that where the separation of the terminals is reduced below 2s the same amount of storage that will take place at a lower voltage or alternatively a greater amount of storage will be possible at the same voltage the relations involved in the storage of current or uncharged electrons are Illustrated uh in the figure figure 21 so I do not have access to here when the terminals are separated by the distance 2s the full Vol voltage drop V takes place at each terminal the electron excess at at the negative terminal which we will call E is proportional to V if the separation between the terminals is decreased to 2xs there is an overlap of the equivalent volumes to which the excess and deficiency of electrons are distributed as indicated above the effective voltage then drops to XV at this point the electron concentration corresponding to XV is in the equivalent volume at the negative Asis terminal while the balance of the total electron input represented by E is in the common equivalent volume where the net concentration of excess electrons is zero if the voltage is reduced the electrons from the common equivalent volume and from the volume release to the negative asteris terminal only flow out of the system in the same proportions in which they entered thus the storage capacity at a separation 2xs and voltage XV is the same as that at a separation 2s and voltage V generalizing this result we may say that the storage capacity at a given voltage of a combination of positive and negative electrodes in close proximity is inversely proportional to the distance between them okay now if you are feeling lost join the club uh but uh you know lson is writing unfortunately for a scientifically uh Advanced audience and so if some of the algebra and just the a terminology kind of gets you uh confused um my only recommendation is just to go over the material again and again again slower and slower and slower uh one sentence at a time until you kind of figure out what he&#x27;s talking about I need to do the same thing with this chapter uh Larson stuff on electricity in particular is uh conundrum to me um I uh feel like that is kind of my weakest area of understanding in terms of the reciprocal system um and I honestly think that it&#x27;s also larsson&#x27;s weakest area of understanding and so that doesn&#x27;t help uh Dr Bruce pet has come along um and he has um revised much of Larson&#x27;s work especially having to do with electricity and um so that uh confounds the matter even more uh but it&#x27;s useful to learn Larson&#x27;s system um I guess before you learn Pet&#x27;s system uh just to see you know the historical Evolution here uh we will be looking at some of the uh work that Pet&#x27;s done as well we already have but we we&#x27;ll be looking at some more um but you know that&#x27;s the nature of the reciprocal system is that you um you know it&#x27;s not going to be on the red carpet for you um you have to do some digging you have to do some uh hard thinking and you have to go over it um multiple times you might have to um read a sentence over again 20 times before you understand what it says um hopefully uh in the future you know the uh ped ogical sit situation will improve to the point that uh you know there&#x27;s a textbook or something that uh has everything you know right in front of you and it makes it easy but uh you know that&#x27;s kind of not the nature of uh revolutionary new theories Mr Larsson had to come up with an entirely new language and New Concepts to express and they&#x27;re just not in general usage and and so they conflict with you know the way that uh most people approach these subjects and um that&#x27;s just the way it is so let&#x27;s keep going the uh uh the uh I would just say that you know it&#x27;s worth it you know the the uh Journey that I&#x27;ve been on in the reciprocal system has been longying and frustrating but with each um you know confusion uh um most of the time it eventually clears up and it is very rewarding when you do actually kind of solve one of the problems that you were um beset with originally okay uh and it&#x27;s also very rewarding that you can also apply this knowledge to other subjects every other subject and that this is a generalized Theory and that you know everything fits together you know you don&#x27;t have a separate theory for electricity that you have for astronomy that you have for economics that you have for religion they&#x27;re all the same Theory okay the ability of the of a conducting wire to accept additional electrons when subjected to a voltage makes it available as a container in which uncharged electrons units of electric current can be stored and withdrawn as desired such storage has some uses in electrical practice but it is conven it is inconvenient for General use more efficient storage is made possible by a device that contains the necessary components in a more compact form in this device a capacitor two plates each with an area of s to the second power are separated by a distance S Prime each plate is equivalent to s s conductors of a unit cross-section thus the storage capacity of a capacitor at a given voltage is directly proportional to the plate area and inversely proportional to the distance between the plates this storage capacity is called the capacitance symbol C since it has the dimensions of space uh s^2 over S Prime equal s it can be calculated directly from the geometrical dimensions of the capacitor the centimeter has been used as a unit Al although the present practice is to use a special unit the farad now this has been really a problem in the reciprocal system um one of one of Dr Bru Bruce Pet&#x27;s Associates Dave uh uh derived a different value for the farad or farad um which was s to the3 power over t uh whereas lson is using the units just s um I believe these Larson units s work in some applications but they kind of fall apart in certain other applications and the the term s to the3 power over T seems to work better now I don&#x27;t quite remember the derivation that Dave used to ended up end up with the S the3 over T you know Larson here is using um you know the area of the plate over the area between the plates or over the distance between the plates uh I think it&#x27;s possible that Larson is dividing these things where he should be multiplying them and then putting them over a Time Factor um but uh just keep that in mind that l um is using this uh farad as um units s but um keep in mind that there is an alternate version where the farad is uh units s to the3 over T and also that Larson claims that really no units should be um where the uh term in the numerator is of a higher exponent than the term in the denominator uh in some places Larson claims that that um defies the discrete unit postulate which I don&#x27;t understand either so this whole um business here with this electrical storage is uh one of the areas of the biggest mystery here here in the reciprocal system or you know not the only but one of the uh most difficult U to teach and difficult to understand areas because there is a lot of contention and a lot of uh frankly inconsistency um but you know uh it will feel great uh when the issues are eventually resolved and um we can move forward in a kind of a more coherent manner right now there&#x27;s you know there&#x27;s more conflict um and perhaps other people have worked this out um you know to their Satisfaction by now but for me I&#x27;m not um I&#x27;m not completely getting um Larson&#x27;s theory on electricity if a capacitor is connected to a current Supply the effective voltage a force t/ s^2 pushes the uncharged electrons that constitute the current into the capacitor until the concentration corresponding to that voltage is reached the SpaceTime dimensions of the product are t/ s^2 * s = t / s this is inverse speed or energy now what would you get if you plugged in s the3 over T instead of just s well s the 3 over T then you would get um just s and that is electric current and that is just space so Larson is deriving this as space or energy but um the rs2 two version is deriving this as electric current for um the combination here of um uh the voltage um and the in the capacitor it is not a charge okay this is inverse speed or energy t/s it is not a charge on the basis of the definition of charge given in this work um which maybe should have been a hint to lson that he&#x27;s kind of starting to do contortions here it is not a charge on the basis of the definition of charge given in this work but since electric charge has the dimensions of energy t/s the quantity stored is equivalent to charge and I think Larsson has said over and over again that the capacitance is all about uncharged electrons so we&#x27;ll continue the to minimize the deviations from currently accepted terminology we will call it a capacitor charge which strikes me as a contradiction in terms the magnitude of the storage can be expressed by the equation qal CV where Q is the capacitor charge C is the capacitance and V is the voltage differential across the ples across the plates of the capacitor so in rs2 this Q would be uh units of space whereas in Larson system this Q is units of time over space or energy or charge um the unit of capacitance the farad is defined as 1 Kum per volt the volt is one Jewel per Kon these are units of the SI system which will be used in most of the subsequent discussion of electricity and magnetism rather than the CGS system of measurement that is in general use in these volumes the reason being that a substantial amount of clarification of the physical relations in these areas has been accomplished in very recent years and most of the current literature relating these subjects utilizes the SI system unfortunately this recent clarification of the electrical and magnetic situation has not extended to some of the most fundamental issues including the many problems introduced into electrical Theory by the failure to rec recognize the existence of uncharged electrons and the consequent lack of distinction between electric quantity and electric charge as we saw in chapter n the unit of electric quantity is a unit of space or S we find that the unit of electric charge is a unit of energy or t/ s in current practice both of these quantities are expressed in the same measurement unit ESU in the CGS system or kons in the SI system now that the electric charge has been introduced into our subject matter we will have to make the distinction that current theory does not recognize um and I think he&#x27;s talking about current as of now as opposed to current as of electron electric current okay the distinction that current theory does not recognize as instead of dealing only with kums we will have to specify kums s or kums t over s uh Larson is doing um contortions right here he&#x27;s torturing his theory to fit it within his erroneous uh uh assignment of units uh that&#x27;s certainly what it looks like to me um where he&#x27;s having to specify between one kulum and another and one of them is the units of s and the other one is s over tan or t over s meaning that one of them is charged one of them is uncharged in this work the symbol Q which is currently being used for both quantities will refer only to electric charge or capacitor charge measured in kums t/ S Electric quantity measured in kums s will be represented by the symbol lowercase Q um yeah so this just shows that I mean to me I could be wrong uh but you know just looking back from 30 years ago that he wrote this in 1987 30 37 years ago that um you know Larson uh wasn&#x27;t really always able to recognize when he he making an error and um his his um but and he recognized that he he did say that you know um my theory is</p>
