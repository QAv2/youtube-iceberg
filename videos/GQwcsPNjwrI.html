            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel and um this channel is for educational purposes we try to focus on theories of everything that have been important to me uh and that I&#x27;d like to spread around um usually things that are pretty obscure that you probably wouldn&#x27;t have run across and uh hopefully they can help you out as well um some of these theories of everything are very challenging you have to apply yourself a little bit um so I&#x27;m hoping to they&#x27;re they&#x27;re challenging for me as well you know so I&#x27;m not uh coming to you as the authority on the matter but maybe as kind of a guide okay I&#x27;ve been in this a little bit longer than you have I um you know haven&#x27;t learned uh I&#x27;m not an expert on the theory but I um can at least guide you to um show where you can maybe dig in a little bit and study up yourself but ultimately you&#x27;re going to have to do the work yourself um today is our 359th video on Dey be Larson and his reciprocal system of theory and Mr Larsson was an engineer in the US in the 20th century he passed away in 1990 and for the 60 years before that he was working on chipping away at um his Theory of Everything which is called the reciprocal system of theory not just a theory but a system of theory so it&#x27;s kind of like if you can figure out how the theory works you can apply apply it to any subject that you like um you know uh and he applied it to many different um many different subjects including uh physics chemistry astronomy um economics and also uh various uh chapters on metaphysics e uh religion philosophy ethics biology um and some of his followers have applied the theory uh even further a field but um and we&#x27;re going to be looking at one of those uh authors today Dr Bruce pet and we&#x27;re going to look at his uh this is the fourth installment on his article rs21 107 uh which is called mass and gravity and um Dr pet was uh one of the uh chief revisers of larsson&#x27;s theory who took um the spirit of the theory and most of the findings but made a few tweaks here and there uh in the days since uh Mr Larson passed away and unfortunately Dr prto also passed away back in 2020 but he left behind a all a phenomenal cach a or cash of uh great work to dig into but uh there&#x27;s still a ton of work to be done because very very very few people know anything about the reciprocal system whatsoever and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anybody on the internet talking about it in any type of depth at all so there&#x27;s me and um that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m uh that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m out here trying to do um I know it&#x27;s a struggle it&#x27;s hard and it&#x27;s hard for me and I you know wish I was able to uh put more time in this but I&#x27;m all maxed out and I have a budget of zero and um if anybody&#x27;s been making any comments in the comment section I will be reading those sometime soon um I uh I&#x27;ve been neglecting uh reading the comments for the last month or so so I will get uh get to that at some point soon okay now uh the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that well he has two fundamental postulates which you put out in the late 1950s and they basically describe the parameters of the reciprocal system the first postulate is U more or less that the universe is composed entirely of one thing which is motion which exists in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time and um motion space and time all have three dimensions and uh they exist only in discrete units and they also are uh scaler or they are progressing now uh I&#x27;m not sure why Larson doesn&#x27;t include the word scaler in his uh description of motion but that&#x27;s really what he&#x27;s talking about is that the universe is composed entirely of one component scaler motion a scaler motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction um and um he Larsson refers to this as the clock the clock time and clock space uh the clock is always getting later and later and later and later uh this is a motion that has a magnitude but has no specific Direction um more clearly in space uh that concept would be that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and um that&#x27;s something that actually was observed by uh the scientists with their telescopes all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and if we aren&#x27;t so uh you know egocentric to think that our galaxy is at the center of that that amalgamation then we would also say that our galaxy is also participating in that movement away from all of the other galaxies and uh that is something that you can Envision uh using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction that is what Larson calls clock space so he&#x27;s got the M the main motions uh the progression of uh this universe is um in space and in time um and space uh the relationship between space and time is motion um and then he has what you would call coordinate space and coordinate time and coordinate space is uh what you&#x27;re accustomed to the three-dimensional uh nature of space XYZ coordinates volume and um but since time and space are reciprocals of one another what whatever quality one has the other also has so we can see the three dimensions of space and from there he posits three dimensions of time what he calls coordinate time and then space and time only come in discrete units there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if and therefore a minimum unit of motion if you do not have a full unit of space or time you don&#x27;t have anything you have to have a full unit these units are very small but nonetheless um you have to have a full unit before you have anything and if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have uh space over time being speed such like uh the bike is moving 15 mil hour 15 miles of space in 1 hour of time that&#x27;s speed if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light and uh Larson refers to that as unit speed 1 over 1 equals 1 this unit speed is really the background of this universe of motion it is what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system it&#x27;s the null point the state of rest the origin The Ether of this universe and um it is always there um the present and um its modifications are or displacements are where the um manifestation of in the universe occurs that&#x27;s where we get things but this um motion outward at the speed of light in all directions uh is seen by us as nothingness uh uh one of Larson&#x27;s followers calls it a featuress uniformity but once it becomes modified or displaced then it turns into various manifestations okay that&#x27;s kind of Larson&#x27;s first postulate his second postulate is more in dispute um and more just kind of uh rud routine the universe is composed uh I mean the universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian uh now Dr pet for one uh challenges the ukian geometry the commutative mathematics and the primary magnitudes that Larson discusses in that um and uh does some pretty good work in uh showing that those things are unnecessarily in larsson&#x27;s second postulate and that by getting rid of them uh it uh kind of frees up um the reciprocal system to be able to be uh applied um more broadly now the reciprocal system applies those two postulat apply for the physical universe but paret is really saying that uh if you modify those postulates then they would also apply to the metaphysical Universe to mental phenomena to life phenomena to ethical phenomena as well so that uh we looked at that a little bit um a few weeks ago and we&#x27;ll look into that some more coming up but today we&#x27;re looking at Pet&#x27;s paper called mass and gravity and this is the fourth installment of this paper so if you want to go back to the start uh you want to go back about three episodes and uh check out the second half of those videos okay now this section is called rotational Dimensions our physical senses are designed to inter interpret the world around us in simple one-dimensional relationships such as moving in a straight line or spinning with a constant angular velocity this creates a conceptual challenge with the reciprocal system because the reciprocal system is a threedimensional system that cannot be directly expressed in a single length or angular measurement these visualizations can assist in understanding the concepts two-dimensional magnetic rotation so this is a visualization to help you understand a two-dimensional magnetic rotation generally when they&#x27;re talking about two-dimensional rotations they call them magnetic when it&#x27;s a one-dimensional rotation it&#x27;s called called the electric uh so the visualization that he uh uh prescribes is a cone with the wide end expanding across the surface of a sphere this is known as a solid rotation that takes 720° or 4 Pi radians to complete in physics the this is measured as a particle with spin 1/2 because it appears to take two 360° rotations to complete they assume it is going at half speed okay for your onedimensional electric rotation uh you would visualize a common spinning disc disc that Tak takes 360° or 2 pi radians to complete so that disc is it&#x27;s not spinning um parallel to its axis such as like if you had a a record on a record player but it&#x27;s spinning perpendicular to its axis um in physics these are the integer spin particles the spin one on which they base relative measurements and then onedimensional vibration two opposing electric rotations the second rotation undoes the first rotation resulting in a cosine waveform take a rod with a flexible elbow rotate um one end of the rod one way and then rotate the pivot of the rod in the opposite direction the far end will trace a sign wave a sine wave in one Dimension and this is I guess um what NE calls a by rotation um when you have two counter rotating systems um their interference pattern is a sine wave and that&#x27;s what nou uses to to um model the photon um whereas Larson used a different uh a combination of motions a translational motion and a vibrational motion to model a photon uh neru uh is revising Larson on this and pet is also accepting n&#x27;s revision that the photon is a by rotation okay and then a rotational vibration which uh is generally known as a charge in the reciprocal system a rotational vibration combine a vibration with a rotation in one dimension you get the washing machine agitator motion you know kind of like if you&#x27;ve ever looked at your washing machine um with the lid off or whatever um where the rotational direction is constantly changing in two Dimensions you get a similar effect except the washing machine is flipping itself upside down and back again at the same time that&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of a rough little visualization there uh and then you have onedimensional rotational vibration is electric charge or electric field a two-dimensional magnetic vibration is magnetic charge and that&#x27;s all you need to construct a universe of motion and uh I believe that is the end of this paper here um now there&#x27;s a couple footnotes here um Larson only considered the inverse relationship between space and time and Inward and outward being unfamiliar with projective geometry he never considered the linear angular or Point volume inverses these are a feature of rs2 so that is you know another uh area where Dr pet kind of extended Larson&#x27;s Spirit of the reciprocal system when Larson is thinking of the reciprocity he&#x27;s thinking in terms of space and time um and um Inward and outward motion basically you know the inward the outward motion of the progression of the natural reference system or the surface of the balloon expanding with dots on it um and then its inverse is the you know that the balloon is now being sucked in and it&#x27;s Contracting balloon all of the all of the dots are moving toward each other and this is kind of the inverse motion of that which Larson refers to as gravity so um Larson starts out with those two uh inverses space and time and you know the progression and gravity but pet adds in the concepts of linear versus angular acceleration and or I guess linear versus angular motion and uh also geometrically uh a point uh is the inverse of a volume and um pet has a few other uh different forms of inverses as well in his um rs2 Theory okay let&#x27;s see other than that I think his uh footnotes are yeah that&#x27;s about it okay so that is the end of RS 2107 mass and gravity uh tomorrow we are going to be getting into RS 2108 which is called the lorence factor um and so you know the Lorent Factor has to do with the relativistic excuse me uh the relativist relativistic equation um that is used to describe the um attenuation or the um reduction of time in um bodies that are moving close to the speed of light and um it is interesting how uh Larson comes upon that same equation through just his deduction from the postulates um and so he really is kind of showing how um Larson his uh derivation is conceptual Einstein uses the lorence factor but he doesn&#x27;t really explain why he just uses it we&#x27;ll get into that tomorrow though and um thanks for tuning in today hope to see you tomorrow have a great night</p>
