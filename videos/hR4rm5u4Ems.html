            <p>all right hello out there uh my name is Thomas and I do educational videos on this channel of uh mainly obscure and esoteric stuff that I think is important and it needs to be just kind of fleshed out made more accessible and exposed more or less and uh we have been doing uh many videos uh in the last month or so on the reciprocal system of theory which is a system of theory or Theory of Everything developed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century up until his death back in 1990 and then um forwarded more by uh Dr Bruce Perrette Dr kvk nehru Dr Gopi Krishna and others up until the present day uh it&#x27;s still a very you know unknown Theory very few people I&#x27;ve never actually personally met another person who&#x27;s ever heard of any of this so uh and but it&#x27;s wide open it&#x27;s right out there Dewey Larson has books on physics astrophysics chemistry astronomy economics and we are looking at his final book that is on metaphysics which actually came out after he died uh into the realm of the religious uh the um psychological um philosophical things like ethics and Free Will and so on um and um we&#x27;re uh in we&#x27;re about to start chapter 10 which is called revelation and uh just a little more background is that the uh so Larson uh had a revelation uh back in around 1930 that pointed him to this Theory and he developed uh that revelatory uh encounter uh for the next 20 years or so uh until he arrived at his two pot two fundamental postulates and then from there he took those postulates and he created through a process of deduction he created an entire theoretical Universe about how the universe uh theoretically should be according to his postulates and uh he found that his Universe compared uh pretty uh closely with the actual universe that the scientists had developed through observation measurement and hypothesis and so on um experiments uh but that it did differ uh markedly in the Realms of the very small the very large the very slow the very fast and uh so he he attempted to kind of uh Shore up those uh discrepancies and um so the gist of the theory the First Fundamental postulate the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and the second fundamental postulate is that the physical Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolutes and its geometry is euclidean now there are a lot of Larson&#x27;s followers have had problems us with the second postulate but the second postulate is really not that important because it it really is just almost axiomatic in order to really even be a scientist and to engage in these conversations uh you need to you know conform to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics and believe in absolute magnitudes um now the euclidean geometry is the sticking point uh Bruce Perrette has come along and really said that he believed that the geometry of the universe is projective of which euclidean geometry is a subset so he&#x27;s not he&#x27;s not uh specifically um negating what Larson is saying he&#x27;s just broadening what Larson is saying he&#x27;s saying that euclidean geometry is part of it but in certain other Realms um the euclidean geometry gives way to a more inclusive geometry uh it&#x27;s a Cascade of geometry euclidean geometry to metric geometry to a fine geometry and then to projective geometry and possibly even beyond that to topology so um so anyway these are the fundamental postulates and then he developed his whole theoretical Universe out of that which includes the um book that we are looking at right now um uh beyond space and time which are on metaphysics and in order to arrive at the metaphysical uh book he had to arrive at about four new postulates um because the metaphysical um deals a lot okay so if Einstein is saying that the speed of light is the max maximum speed of the universe Larson is saying that the speed of light is the midpoint or null uh neutral point of the universe and that there&#x27;s a half of the universe that&#x27;s actually moving faster than the speed of light which doesn&#x27;t really register with the scientific folks and then there&#x27;s the half that moves slower he calls this sector one and that is the realm of the scientific you know the uh chemical the atoms and the molecules but once an atom or a molecule a molecule moves into Aggregates into its most complex form which is the DNA molecule then it is eligible to be taken over and controlled by a unit from the uh sector two which is the faster than light speed unit and so that is where life comes from he Compares that to a thermostat even though that the um the sector 2 unit is just a minor part of the overall uh life unit it is controlling just like a thermostat controls the environment of the room the sector 2 unit controls the entirety of the life unit even though it&#x27;s primarily made out of that very complex molecule DNA and then from there the next level is going to the sector 3 and the sector three is really kind of like this neutral point this speed of light where space and time resolve each other because remember space and time are reciprocals in the reciprocal system they are uh and they exist in a relationship all kinds of motion or relationships between space and time but when you get to the speed of light it all resolves into one because the speed of light is one unit of space per one unit of time and So eventually you get one over one equals one and so the space and time resolve each other it&#x27;s just in the same way that dualities resolve and um that is he calls sector three or uh or God I doesn&#x27;t call it God I&#x27;m just saying that that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s um dealing with and um the sector 3 unit can take control of the life unit the most complex life unit is then eligible to be controlled overall by this sector three uh God unit country calls it control unit and um that is the intelligent human being uh or maybe humanoid that is the most complex form of life and um so uh once the sector 3 unit begins to take control it becomes like a competition between sector two objectives and sector three objectives which he terms as sector two objectives are survival based life life is bent on Survival uh whereas sector three is bent on ethics ethically based So within the human being uh is this kind of tug of war that is uh occurring between um survival motives and ethical motives at times those motives work together but at other times they work uh separately and the human being has to decide which one is um you know gonna win out uh this all looks like if you&#x27;ve watched any of my tree of life videos uh this is a six sphere thing this is going on at the sixth sphere of the Tree of Life okay um now we&#x27;re we&#x27;re looking into chapter 10 here on uh Revelation and Revelation is kind of a continuation of the two previous chapters on communication local in general where we got into intuition and scientific Insight that are communicate Direct Communications from the sector 3 unit so the sector three unit is communicating with us we can&#x27;t detect this as as a physical thing this is not a physical thing but it&#x27;s something that occurs um and that there are levels you know there&#x27;s intuition uh Insight or intuition on a general level is tends to be very accurate um because it&#x27;s just you know is this right or wrong um should I do this or not how do I feel about this just general level but then there&#x27;s also on a scientific level and that is a higher level of of sector three communication and it&#x27;s much more specific and it&#x27;s much more difficult to decode the general idea is that all of our all of our Communications with sector 3 the information that we&#x27;re receiving is correct but the question is are we able to decode the information or translate the information correctly so I&#x27;m taking over here at the beginning of chapter 10 of a paragraph in or two we&#x27;re talking about um uh we&#x27;re we&#x27;re talking about um revelation accounts of sudden illumination of scientific issues under intense study frequently stress this resemblance to religious revelation for example Henri poincare the great French mathematician was particularly interested in phenomena of this kind because of a striking experience of his own often cited in scientific literature he had been engaged in studying a certain problem with little success I&#x27;ll just point out that Larson could have just put himself into this story because his story was quite similar um sometime later as poincare was boarding an Omnibus with a friend the solution to a problem came to him instantly it was as though he were standing on a mountain overlooking the dark Valley which was illuminated for an instant by a flash of lightning in that instant the whole problem became clear to him although it took him many weeks to write down and derive all the relations if poincare had been a Mystic he would have regarded the event as a revelation actually he ascribed the occurrence to his subconscious mind which he believed had continued to work on the problem after the conscious mind was otherwise engaged it later developed that men involved in Creative work in many fields encountered the same sort of event many of them compared the occurrence to a blinding flash of light okay now um so um he&#x27;s he&#x27;s pointing out how scientific Insight uh has a strong resemblance to religious Revelation and he really says that in our fine our finding is that scientific Insight ESPN intuition are merely different manifestations of the same process communication with sector 3 and the control units it is now clear that the miraculous flashes of light in science and philosophy and in other fields are not only akin to Revelation in religion they are identical with Revelation and religion okay now he says ethical Theory like scientific theory seems to have originated in the minds of profound thinkers who fell back for justification not merely on experience but on their own imaginative powers in the case of Ethics the latter has often been termed illumination or revelation it can hardly be considered essentially different from the stroke of inspiration at the basis of the invention of a new scientific theory he&#x27;s quoting there R.B Lindsay okay now he&#x27;s going through more uh other ex so-called experts um it is true that there are a host of contradictions between the revelations uh which the various religions claim to have received while many more of these purported Revelations contradict observe facts but such contradictions are the rule rather than the exception in human testimony experiencing courts of law shows that even eyewitnesses eyewitness accounts of different by different individuals often give totally different versions of the same event a little serious reflection over the history of the nuclear atom concept um should help to give the scientists a better understanding of why contradictions exist how easy it is to misread the message from sector three when it first arrives whether by scientific Insight or revelation and how tenaciously the human mind be it scientific or non-scientific clings to a misinterpretation once it has achieved General Acceptance in the community where it originates as this Atomic experience shows the priests of the scientific establishment are just as dogmatic in their adherence to current Doctrine and just as prone to close their eyes to unwelcome facts that disturb the doctrine as the priest of the religious that establishment so that is and that&#x27;s you know if you read uh Thomas Coons structure of the scientific revolutions um you know it shows how you know scientists will bend over backwards to hold on to their trusted theory that they grew up with that they learned in school um in spite of mounds of evidence to the contrary and that It ultimately it really even takes new generations of people to um it&#x27;s a rare scientist indeed who will um you know turn their back on their favored Theory to support a new theory that has more evidence and observation backing it up um and looks mainly at the heliocentric world problem and Copernicus all the way through Newton I have no comment on the validity of any of those doctrines but um it does show how um we cling to the theories that we that are in general acceptance as we are growing up and that we&#x27;re taught by in school um okay Revelation is a source of information co-equal with experience although this is the traditional religious Viewpoint and is strongly emphasized in most of the Eastern religions it is contrary to some present-day theological views just as our knowledge of um well no no the religious Retreat toward naturalism that has been taking place because of the growing Prestige of science under pressure from science those who share this non-propositional view have abandoned the concept of direct communication from a source outside the space-time Universe on which all of the major rest Western religions were originally based and have fallen back to the position that any communication from such a source must take place indirectly by means of some kind of an effect of on event the events of History and that&#x27;s kind of you know getting at you know uh we look at say the Bible and you know it was common for God uh so-called God one of the Gods of the Bible to talk to you know Moses or whoever uh the Patriarchs back in the day uh in ancient times but if if such a thing were alleged to happen now it would be like you know it&#x27;s time for you to go to the uh you know to the insane asylum you know that um that&#x27;s something that you know used to happen but it doesn&#x27;t happen anymore so that&#x27;s kind of what he&#x27;s saying there and that&#x27;s because of the uh you know the emergence of the scientific uh viewpoint ironically our present in the investigation demonstrates that this retreat was wholly unnecessary this Retreat of the religious uh of the sector three direct contact scientists never did have any actual evidence to indicate that there are no metaphysical sources of information but they have forced the ecclesiastics to retreat from one untenable position to another and by this time have succeeded in intimidating the theologians to the point where essential religious positions are being abandoned once it is conceded that nothing can be communicated to the human race except through Human Experience it is only one short step to the naturalistic conclusion that there is no Source other than human experience but now a further extension of scientific knowledge has shown that the previous scientific assumption that the whole of existence is encompassed within the physical universe is wrong and that the original religious concept of Revelation from an outside source is correct okay I&#x27;ll stop there um next time we&#x27;ll uh go further into this chapter 10 on Revelation and um I hope everybody out there has a great day and I hope to see you back here uh next time</p>
