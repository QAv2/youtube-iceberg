            <p>The other thing that really caught my attention, like they would fall like this and just bounce off of nothing. He literally asked verbally out loud, &quot;If you have something to show me, show me. If you have something to tell me, tell me.&quot; And in that instant, the screen morphed, melted, [music] and digitally composed letters. &gt;&gt; Were you able to translate it into anything? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it essentially had the simple response instantaneously [music] of I living. I want to get into the to the triangle section of Skinwalker Ranch where there they say is a possible wormhole or black hole or portal or what do you think it is? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Um the honest answer I&#x27;m not sure exactly what it is other than there is obviously an anomaly. There is something in that area, in that region, and in that airspace that causes GPS to malfunction. I mean, when you say GPS malfunctions, you&#x27;re talking the GPS is telling you you are in one location, but you&#x27;re actually in a in a it&#x27;s not even close &gt;&gt; or it just completely malfunctions and does not operate. Think about it. We&#x27;ve had instrumented balloon, helicopter, airplane, and advanced rocketry experiments with sensors along with drones, sophisticated drones that have all malfunctioned above the triangle in that region of the property.</p>
<p>Luna who is a you know a defense contractor has a very sophisticated platform in in looking at that area even saw anomalies in that region of the triangle in the mesa um there have been instances where time has been manipulated where we&#x27;ve seen um you know the the time itself there&#x27;s been a shift by a quarter a second where the data ends up being altered or manipulated &gt;&gt; to to a degree that is not easily explainable. I mean it&#x27;s it is baffling to all of the experts. Everyone who comes out to the property and sees sees what unfolds ends up scratching their heads and and and to have the best LAR photoggramometry and other experts that continuously see these strange things occur and occur somewhat simultaneous with UFO or UAP activity as well. Well, I mean, we had we had a a situation above the triangle where we were launching rockets. of course, one of numerous occasions and uh a prominent UAP unidentified aerial phenomena ends up uh appearing and then what happens within minutes following the Blackhawk helicopter comes right over the mea, descends over the property and just hovers right over the Southfield.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t above the men. This is right there, low hover above the field south of Homestead 1 and the command center. This is late night, unmarked, not transponding, and as the men would describe it, I mean, it was a menacing presence on that property immediately following a UFO sighting. For whatever reason, that region of the property, that region of the triangle, which is not far away from where I saw the UFO, the 40 to 50 foot long gray silverish disc appear and maneuver in extraordinary ways. Seems to be a a hot spot.</p>
<p>seems to be a center of gravity for activity within a an expanse of property that is hosting a diversity of incidents and activities. So I that&#x27;s what I think drives a lot of our investigation and a lot of the experimental activity is it&#x27;s the data that we continue to gather from the triangle from the homesteads from the mesa that is driving us forward. How would you [clears throat] So, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s been there&#x27;s been a number of events that have happened uh through your guys&#x27; experiments within the triangle, and it sounds like the triangle well, it&#x27;s an actual triangle on the ground, and then and then it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it seems to be some type of an invisible force field, maybe call it. No, that region of the property. I mean, you you see kind of this triangular um formation or really really the triangular roadway system that kind of &gt;&gt; comes together at that point.</p>
<p>Uh but it it does seem to be a focal point there along the Mesa Plateau and it is a central point as as you look at the ranch relative to the you know where the the command center and the home and homestead one is in relation to the homesteads out on the out on the far west side of the property. um the anomaly that we&#x27;ve seen the people call it the blob but this this thing that they&#x27;ve caught on camera and it&#x27;s not just from one point of view it&#x27;s been from multiple camera points of view and different types of recording devices different types of cameras that have recorded this this thing this this anomaly as Travis as Dr. TA Taylor would call it, uh appears to to disrupt the experimental activities that occur. Um it deflects. We&#x27;ve seen we&#x27;ve seen rockets deflected.</p>
<p>I mean in that area we saw I mean we launched balloons and you probably remember um early in the docu series effort we had a professor from the university uh Alabama at Huntsville that came out who is who is an expert uh instrumented balloon experimentalist and operator um and he we never recovered the primary balloon. the primary balloon they set up right above the triangle. It literally disappeared. And it disappeared right at the moment that it started registering elevated activity. When the the meters started going off, all of a sudden it disappeared and it has never been recovered.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;ve searched, I mean, we&#x27;ve conducted exhaustive searches of the area, looked at all the surrounding property, you know, via the helicopter, even on the ground, and have never found a trace of where that where that that balloon could have ended up. And &gt;&gt; well, I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t real I didn&#x27;t realize that you guys never found it. It seems to be that &gt;&gt; it just disappeared &gt;&gt; from 31 ft to what 300 ft seems to be the &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it&#x27;s but it&#x27;s transient. Uh it&#x27;s not constant.</p>
<p>I mean it comes and goes. There&#x27;s something &gt;&gt; very unpredictable in some respects. Uh but the fact that we&#x27;ve had uh even lasers bend, you probably remember when they were conducting the the experiments and actually had a laser pointed up and the laser was documented as bending as as essentially uh being deflected off a space to to this day. Those who were who who have looked at that footage, looked at that data remain just baffled by what they&#x27;ve recorded. Even the again the UFO sightings that have occurred above the triangle in tandem with some of these experimental activities not only continue, but they&#x27;ve been they&#x27;ve been prominent.</p>
<p>Um, yeah. I I I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not lost on anyone that the the the object that was seen coming out of the base of the mesa that um large orb or whatever unidentified aerial phenomena that exited the mesa was not far from that region. I mean, it all is essentially interconnected. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, so I it it&#x27;s an interesting center of gravity for a lot of the phenomena and that&#x27;s why we continue to launch rockets and experiments even focus the helicopter and other craft in that area with the instrumentation and we&#x27;ll see what we are able to ultimately uncover.</p>
<p>I think taking all of that data cumulatively and and having that essentially paint a picture or or pull together this grand tapestry that we can then step back from and look at, you know, the patterns. You know, one of the things we brought Omnitech on for is is their artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. I mean, they have AI and ML patterns or AI and ML platforms that will be able to better identify potential patterns that are occurring that&#x27;ll help us, I think, weed out, I think, you know, separate the signal from the noise, separate that which may be a a a foreign adversary or or even a, you know, some naturally caused phenomena from something that is truly unusual. You know, the the so many things have happened above the triangle and the I think the the first thing that I saw that really that got me was I believe it was your brother was flying the helicopter over it and I can&#x27;t remember what altitude he was at but it said his alttimeter said he I believe was 40 ft. &gt;&gt; He was several hundred feet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, it say it essentially was bouncing. The radar altimeter was identifying something 40 to 50 feet below the helicopter when he&#x27;s thousands of feet up in the air when he&#x27;s 5,000 ft above the triangle. &gt;&gt; And it was tracking with the helicopter. And a lot of people have tried to either debunk or try to explain what was documented during that exercise.</p>
<p>There really is no there is no satisfactory explanation for it. I mean, we&#x27;ve consulted with the manufacturer. I mean, he&#x27;s called his resources. My my brother, he has more he has over 9,000 hours of uh flight time, is one of the most seasoned uh aviators in the region. And he knows this equipment inside out.</p>
<p>I mean he consults with the experts relative to how it operates and what he should expect and what is you know what is to to to to really what what could be involved and there&#x27;s really no explanation exactly for what what occurred there and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s disturbing it well after that flight Cameron was really hesitant as to whether he wanted to come back on the property again &gt;&gt; really because just the danger associated with you know the the instruments with the fact that there&#x27;s something up in the air tracking with the helicopter that is unseen well and we saw you know most recently you know the high-speed camera operator captured a big silver looked like a metallic object but some type of silver spherical object that was tracking behind the helicopter with one of the more recent exercises being conducted. And a lot of people say, &quot;Oh, well, you know, they were applying a filter because there was a filter applied in order to to bring out some of the features of that a little bit more prominently.&quot; But it it doesn&#x27;t negate the fact that it was there. I mean, I&#x27;ve seen unfiltered, you know, footage of that and there is definitely an object. There&#x27;s a round spherical object that is tracking with the helicopter during that exercise. And there&#x27;s this is not a drone.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t something that we can we can assign some either natural cause to or point to some known technology. It&#x27;s it seems it seems very unusual. The other thing that really caught my attention probably more than probably more than anything is the GPS trackers that um that they were dropping out of the helicopter, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; with the streamers. And it seemed to be almost bouncing off an invisible object. Like they would fall like this and just Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; bounce off of nothing. Yeah. End up in a completely different region of the the ranch. Yeah. And they&#x27;re they&#x27;re being deflected off of something.</p>
<p>And that that speaks to the fact that we believe that there is some anomaly. There is some there is some irregular whether it be an object or field or something something that we truly can&#x27;t explain but is real that has a tangible impact on the experiments uh whether it be the rockets whether it be you know the the sensors the GPS the the bottle drop experiment for example &gt;&gt; the flamethrower &gt;&gt; yeah the flamethrower that went around nothing. &gt;&gt; It It the flame turned into a horseshoe. Went around nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean, it&#x27;s the rockets, the laser beams, the LAR. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How do you explain that? &gt;&gt; The helicopter being pushed around. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The plane.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; the drones the drone was 250 drones you guys lifted up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Over 200 drones fully charged, carefully calibrated with over 20 experts from Sky Elements who conduct more of these drone exercises across the country than any other company. I mean, they are the experts. They are the gold standard.</p>
<p>Left completely baffled. And they&#x27;ve they went on record with the fact that they&#x27;ve never seen anything like this occur. that the their equipment completely malfunctioned in the area of the triangle and on the ranch. Um, we&#x27;re going to be bringing them back. What do you do when you&#x27;re conducting a scientific investigation? When you&#x27;re trying to follow the scientific method, you repeat.</p>
<p>You repeat the experiment. You gather more data. We&#x27;re trying in in service to coming to some conclusion or drawing a more I I think a more accurate uh hypothesis. We&#x27;re trying to gather more data and repeat these experiments to see if we we observe similar phenomena or or other anomalies that occur and we&#x27;re active with that. You at first I was hesitant to deploy the helicopter.</p>
<p>You have a very expensive piece of equipment. I have my brother who I love. I don&#x27;t want him in harm&#x27;s way, you know, but he he&#x27;s become much like Thomas Winterton who when faced with danger, when faced with the risks and even having a personal um personal set of experiences dealing with this, instead of running away or deciding to sit this one out, he&#x27;s saying bring it on. He&#x27;s saying, you know, this is this is discovery. This is frontier science discovery.</p>
<p>Only only the bold end up being able to to really pierce through and to realize extraordinary results. I said earlier in our interview, I mean, in order to get extraordinary results, you have to put forth extraordinary effort. I was using that as a business reference that it takes sacrifice to get results. And this ranch investigation is no different. I think we&#x27;re all sacrificing.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re all locking arms and trying to determine the nature of what is happening. It isn&#x27;t a function of proving that there&#x27;s something happening. That&#x27;s already done. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s being able to identify the origin and the identity associated with the phenomena that drives me. And I think you can expect to see in the future hopefully some communication.</p>
<p>I think whatever we&#x27;re dealing with is highly intelligent. I will not be surprised if at some point we are able to somehow determine how to communicate or at least um see I think more intelligent interaction. &gt;&gt; So you think this what do what do you call this? Well, those who came before me with the Bigalow team called it a precognitive non what do they there&#x27;s a term they call they refer to the phenomena at Skinwalker Ranch as a precognitive sentient nonhuman intelligence. So, so there&#x27;s &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s an intelligence &gt;&gt; based on the data. There is an intelligence operating on that ranch that has command over space, time, over consciousness.</p>
<p>Can manipulate closed systems in a split second without leaving a trace. and I believe has the ability to communicate if we can understand or develop a common language at some point to be able to interact. Eric Bard in particular has had communication with at least one of these entities involved with manipulating the systems that has command over the technology and the platforms and has expounded on that a little bit. Um he&#x27;ll be I think addressing that a bit more in the future. We&#x27;re going to be discussing it on the docue series uh this next year.</p>
<p>But he&#x27;s definitely seen and and documented evidence that we&#x27;re dealing with an intelligence that does have the desire to communicate. What can you go into the communication a little bit more? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean in in his case uh when he asked out of frustration for a sign when he commanded the when when the systems were being manipulated and he was dealing with security violations that were occurring repeatedly with our with our surveillance cameras. He he literally asked verbally out loud, &quot;If you have something to show me, show me. If you have something to tell me, tell me.&quot; And in that instant, the screen morphed, melted, and digitally composed letters.</p>
<p>He had the presence of mind just as he did in October 2016 to screen capture what was happening with his iPhone. Thank heavens. He proceeded to record and screen capture in real time what was happening with the the equipment. And what was revealed was what I believe to be compelling evidence that we&#x27;re we&#x27;re dealing with with an intelligence that is at least willing to acknowledge and wants their presence known. &gt;&gt; Were you able to translate it into anything? Yeah, it&#x27;s you&#x27;ll it&#x27;ll be shown on television, but uh but it&#x27;s it it essentially had had the simple response again instantaneously of I living.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re me. &gt;&gt; So, Eric Bard in response to a host of issues with the security with the security cameras registering that there was something triggering the motion sensors that there were countless events occurring. Upon giving that command saw the entire screen morph and form the letters I living and then snap back. all documented, all called on all caught on camera. That has yet to be fully addressed on the docue series, but is going to be addressed in the future.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s really his story to tell, but I if he were here, he&#x27;d be telling you the same story. It was compelling evidence that we&#x27;re dealing with a an intelligence on the ranch that has the ability to manipulate technology and systems instantaneously and um and has the ability to communicate and is has intention. There&#x27;s volition. Wow. That is uh that is uh &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s spooky.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; You know, when you see the image, it&#x27;s spooky.
