            <p>Einstein said the field, the wave, the energy is the sole governing agency of the particle. Energy controls matter. He didn&#x27;t say the particle controls the particle. He said the field controls the particle. If you change the information in the field, can you change the projection the particle in three-dimensional reality? This is a holographic universe.</p>
<p>So if the quantum field is an invisible field of energy that exists beyond our senses, beyond our body, our environment and time, then the only way we are going to connect to it is to take all of our attention off our body, all of our attention off the environment. What&#x27;s the environment made of? People, objects, things, places, and take all of your attention off of linear time, the predictable future, and the familiar past, and find the sweet spot, the generous present moment. That&#x27;s the unknown. That&#x27;s the door. That&#x27;s the moment you become nobody, no one, no thing, nohere, and no time.</p>
<p>That is the moment you are pure consciousness. And that is the moment you&#x27;re walking through the door to the quantum</p>
