            <p>and hello there youtubers is collective tooth 5 this time I&#x27;ll be talking about the vimana Shastra and the mercury vortex engine now if you know the vimana Shastra is whether you&#x27;re a scientist or a hindu script writer or if you are a if you&#x27;re just seeing my videos before and have watched ancient aliens well then I am glad and you probably know all about it then well you don&#x27;t have to watch this video but please watch it anyways if you don&#x27;t know what it is then please watch the ancient aliens episode that&#x27;s dedicated to bommana chest drop link in description below or link in description below anyways ancient aliens is a pretty good show and they will explain it pretty well um I&#x27;m onna Shastra is let me just sum it up for you it is a scripture written about 3,000 years ago by Hindu priests that um that described ancient space travel now if you know my channel you know that this well this probably won&#x27;t come to in surprise because I talk about stuff like this a lot if you if this is the first video we&#x27;ve seen on my channel then you will probably be surprised and you&#x27;ll probably think I&#x27;m crazy which I might be because I sure anyways um so the varnish Astra is a pretty big book and it has tons of in illustrations and it&#x27;s been translated to English thankfully because I don&#x27;t want to learn Hinduism anyways and and crazy thing about this book is that well people at NASA and people like JPL and people and pretty well-known scientists today they look at these illustrations they study them and these illustrations are pretty sound they&#x27;re pretty they would make sense and they would work in space which is very crazy because how did people 3,000 years ago know about space now there are two theories that are that I believe in or not believe in two theories that I think that might be true first of all the civilization back 3,000 years ago or earlier were very advanced such as the Atlanteans Atlantis of the Murray Lemuria those are two fictional sort of Navy fictional that are based on maybe true civilization and maybe there were so advanced they travel to Mars or travel to or lease to space now the other theory is that aliens gave us this technology and told us well what it was like up there and they the advance our civilization by giving us information now this just is an app this is the ancient alien theory which is what ancient aliens is about to support it and to bring a lot of evidence that you will never have seen to a surface to light now if you are not scientist you still will be surprised at the stuff that they will be talking about and they will show you some crazy things that we will never heard about and you&#x27;ll be wondering why such as oh why are they hiding it by the I mean mainstream media mainstream scientists why are they hiding some of the stuff or if they are or if they&#x27;re not hiding it then well how come they&#x27;re not saying anything about it now that&#x27;s another reason you should watch engine aliens anyways like it&#x27;s a point on the planet Asura has some very accurate of drawings of sketches another thing is that you have an engine called the vortex engine the mercury vortex NP now let me it might be that the vortex engine was actually in fact made out of mercury or it might not have it could it could have been lost in translation but it is most likely mercury because mercury well against the description of solid and liquid in room temperature also the ancients had an obsession with mercury uh limits like I don&#x27;t think about the ancient Pharaoh&#x27;s of Egypt a lot of it tombs had mercury whether in glass veils or or in tubs or on offerings or on jewelry they had a lot of mercury and a lot of times people have stopped digging through tombs because of high mercury content now that&#x27;s just one example the other one is the first emperor of China which whose name is impossible to pronounce in here&#x27;s a first emperor the first unified enter of China so that is not the Yellow Emperor of the motor famous one I believe I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the yellow ever anyways um he built a mountain to store his body and the rest of his army that died yeah he was a rich guy anyways he built a mountain that is exactly not exactly but a little bit under one square mile imagine that imagine your tomb being a mountain a square mile long I mean the square mile one almost a mile long by almost a lot mile wide to put that into perspective that is about four times the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza um it&#x27;s not as tall and using the same amount of mass stones but the crazy thing about this is that according to a lot of strips of bacon Chinese the mountain is supposed to be hollow and they&#x27;re supposed to be rivers of mercury surrounding the main central tomb and there are supposed to be armies and the souls of the armies are supposed to protect central - another thing is that there is a ceiling because it will hollow there has to be see there is a ceiling and supposedly there is a very accurate description of a not a very accurate model of the night sky now I&#x27;ll be doing a video about this so don&#x27;t worry uh I will be doing a video about the Yellow Emperor and the Emperors of China and their mysterious things that they have done there&#x27;s whatever that lifts like Patrick years old there&#x27;s another guy you know stuff like that anyways that&#x27;s for another video um anyways uh so mercury is obviously being obsessed over back then also if you&#x27;re wondering why they haven&#x27;t dug through the tomb yet the big ones for mountain socially um it&#x27;s because well first of all the high mercantile content we have detected primary content so they&#x27;re gonna be careful and also any form of excavation that we know now to destroy the whole tube because it&#x27;s very fragile and hopefully they they could unlock the inside very soon that would be great I&#x27;d love the soups inside it might be the next biggest discovery in human civilization now a very vortex let&#x27;s let&#x27;s hit let&#x27;s head in say it by the video okay so the amount of Shastra talks about something called the vimana which is basically a flying saucer that the ancient hindus built in order to live in because well sometimes they had great floods anyways um this took place mostly in India and up to Nepal&#x27;s place like that anyways and supposedly the ships were supposedly mainly domed and sometimes they were domes on top of domes on top of domes that were connected and there and the vimana Chester and other Hindu texts said of this Great War and there is supposedly a well Oh air war a war like a dog bite through the air with no mames another thing is that there was a weapon of mass destruction that sounds a little bit like a nuclear bomb you can see that in also the first episode of ancient aliens the one called the evidence making description below um anyways uh the actual blueprints are surprisingly accurate um there&#x27;s some things that are lost in translation and we have no idea what so we&#x27;re still working on not we I&#x27;m I&#x27;m good some people are still working on the translations and wondering what going on and stuff like that um okay mercury vortex a vortex engine is a engine that basic creates a sort of like a sort of like a tornado or hurricane a they have air vortex which basically creates an air of funnel that creates a actual study surrounding vortex basically and it totally turns a turbine in case of electricity that was created by Norman love and Louisville Mike Lodge that was um that was a first actual part where we actually used for Texas our advantage not including Vimanas what they did is that they filled the same exact thing sort of like a cylinder or round ball and you fill it with mercury which nitrogen is both solid and liquid at room temperature and it creates a vortex and apparently at a certain rpm or certain magnetism or certain environment it can cross levitation now how that supposedly works is that well the vortex engine supposedly creates a negative gravitational effect which means it&#x27;s sort of like a positive battery and another positive battery it separates actually now what&#x27;s crazy about this is that if you were put it against other kinds of mass or massive things such as well the earth you would it would repel from the earth creating well levitation now this is pretty cool cuz well as the first actual evidence that we could actually create a hoverboard that well almost never runs out of battery almost almost never runs out of battery probably so look I know the thing about this is that well we we&#x27;ve tried to replicate it well we haven&#x27;t tried yet but what if there is this magical thing in well alchemy that says that mercury causes limitations now alchemy is the sum of different materials putting together into creating crazy things such as well the drug for immortality and turning the regular objects into gold anyways alchemy is a pretty cool science it&#x27;s more spiritual than anything else it&#x27;s not like herbology or witchcraft it&#x27;s just something by its salt it stands by witchcraft in herbology but if if alchemy does apply to the real world then this might actually be a very very accurate well it might actually just work oh I still would rule it out I don&#x27;t think it will work though or if it does and maybe merge in summer degrees something else is another thing something that&#x27;s also magnetic um I just if if it is an americorps text then I just hope that mercury vortex whatever it is it may cause a create a infinite source of electricity because well wouldn&#x27;t that be great only problem is that the different source must come from a source which might be either a black hole or the air or a certain matter and if it is certain matter then it will make it turn into black hole and that won&#x27;t be good yeah uh hopefully this this just works hopefully there&#x27;s more people are looking into this more I hope so I hope I open your eyes please watch the episodes that&#x27;s all I could say I just gave my opinions I know it&#x27;s a long video but I just I think I hope it&#x27;s it&#x27;s true and I just dig a little bit more in depth in that and ancient alien so please visit that link if you have about an hour and a half if you could spare an hour and a half just watch the video it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very interesting it gives off some pretty pretty interesting points that&#x27;s about it for this video please like and subscribe stay tuned for more thanks for watching and I hope to see you in my next video</p>
