            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel where we go over a lot of my heroes who have spent the whole life working on a theory of everything or an all-encompassing Theory and um put out something that was very worthwhile but really didn&#x27;t get the credit that they deserved uh or the wreck any kind of recognition or any kind of money or anything they just did it for the truth of everything and um you know a lot of times they made a mistake or two but uh in general the theory is very solid and it&#x27;s something that I feel that other people would benefit if they knew about it so today is video number 191 on the reciprocal system of theory from Mr Dewey B Larson and Mr Larson died back in 1990 but for about 60 years before that he worked out his reciprocal system of theory which basically says that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion matter and energy are merely two different kinds of motion of many kinds of motion uh all of our basic uh mechanical and um scientific quantities are kinds of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time don&#x27;t really exist except together in motion motion is uh more or less a fraction that has time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator space and time both come in discrete units meaning that there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time and um they&#x27;re not continuous they um you know they come in chunks when they come together they are come as units of motion when you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light so the speed of light is really the one the um the midpoint the reference point or the natural reference system uh even The Ether the origin the uh null point of the this universe and there is a half of the universe that is moving slower than the speed of light and a half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and that&#x27;s where the uh coordinate and clock aspects of space and time also come in uh space and time are both coordinate meaning that they both have three or more Dimensions x y z coordinates and um they also are scalar meaning that they have an aspect that have motion but in no particular direction so you can Envision this by using a balloon putting a bunch of dots on the balloon if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other that is uh the progression of space the flow of space and normally we recognize that uh for time time is Flowing time is always getting later and later and later that is the flow of space What largely calls clock space or clock time clock time and clock space and then coordinate time and coordinate space so in the material sector the sector of the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light we have coordinate space and clock time this is what we&#x27;re used to this is the universe that we live in that we measure make measurements from make observations from so that&#x27;s three dimensions of time three-dimensional sorry three dimensions of space and one dimension of time progressing but in this half of the universe that&#x27;s actually moving faster than the speed of light the half of the universe that we really don&#x27;t know too much about and that Einstein kind of eliminated when he said that nothing moves faster than the speed of light he was right about that except that he didn&#x27;t know anything about the half of the universe that moves faster than the speed of light and so he just eliminated that generally we see space but we do not see time uh time is really invisible to us and we only see it as it is as it affects space and so uh Einstein didn&#x27;t really know anything about the half of the universe where there is coordinate time and clock space so in this part of the universe there&#x27;s three dimensional time and that is moving through a scalar or clock space uh just the inverse of the material sector so we can extrapolate what&#x27;s going on in the material sector we can figure out we can observe that and the inverse of that where you reverse the roles of space and time that is what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector a quick example of that would be a basically like a magnetic field a magnetic a magnetic force force is time over space to the second power so this is a cosmic aspect and um but we do not see a magnetic field because we don&#x27;t see we don&#x27;t see time we only see space so the magnetic uh so like if you&#x27;ve seen like iron filings uh outside on a magnet that forms kind of a shape around the magnet that is um what you&#x27;re seeing is you&#x27;re seeing Thai um how time we don&#x27;t see time but we see how time uh affects space okay so what we&#x27;re seeing is we&#x27;re seeing the effect of time on space and those and that is the iron fiber so the magnetic field doesn&#x27;t really exist but it we can see that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re able to see Larson usually calls that equivalent space so when something is actually moving in time we see its inverse in space and it calls that equivalent space now we&#x27;re looking at uh Larson&#x27;s book that&#x27;s called Nothing But motion which he put out in 1979 and it&#x27;s generally on Atomic physics and um we are in Chapter 13 of that book which is called the um oh uh I think it&#x27;s called basic mathematical relations something to that effect um and in this chapter he he&#x27;s basically so what Larson does is he goes over um he uses a pro once he comes up with his uh this chapter is called physical consonants and he he goes over um the theory itself and then he takes the theory and he plugs it in uh and develops through the process of in a deduction he develops a an entire theoretical universe okay and so this theoretical Universe he&#x27;s developing it here in this chapter having to do with the uh subatomic particles and the masses of the subatomic particles uh in the previous episode he direct he derived the the basic uh components of uh subatomic particles and then Compares them with the actual observations and measurements of scientists who have tried to measure the same thing so he developed the values strictly from his theory of the primary Mass magnetic Mass a gravitational Mass Electric mass in three dimensions and two dimensions and the mass of normal charge and the electron charge and then uh because for Larson and atom is a combination of motions in particular an atom is two separate two-dimensional or magnetic rotations and then an optional one-dimensional electric rotation and then those that whole thing can also be carrying a charge and so there&#x27;s all kinds of different um basically atomic weight units that could be attached to the various particles and uh we had just gone through how he derived the value of the electron and the positron and so you know one issue is that he develops it in all natural units um uh where you know the speed of light is one and so he kind of goes from there and uh he basically is saying that the the fundamental constants that the physicists use are just kind of fudge factors to fudge over the fact that they don&#x27;t uh know certain things and so they plug in certain numbers but when you use the reciprocal system which has natural units than um you&#x27;re dealing with uh the uh Nat you know you&#x27;re dealing with natural units and so the um you know the basic uh the basic Mass the primary mass is 1.000 and then he derives all these other units and then they add together and then so when he uses uh when he comes up with the electron and the positron um his um his numbers there are for the electron is uh 0.00054874 and then he says the observed value is 0.00054877 so we&#x27;re getting all the way to the eighth decimal place before he&#x27;s making uh there&#x27;s any type of discrepancy between the two measurements um and now he&#x27;s about to derive the massless neutron so uh we&#x27;re gonna start uh reading Larson right from here the massless neutron the m uh one half dash one half Dash is zero and again those are the three rotations of an atom or sub atom um the first is the primary magnetic two-dimensional rotation the second is the secondary magnetic rotation and the third is the electric rotation and the m in front means it&#x27;s from the material sector as opposed to the cosmic sector which is a notation that he uses for only for subatomic particles so the massless neutron which one of his followers actually identifies as the muon neutrino but the massless neutron m one half dash one half Dash zero combination has no effective rotation in the third dimension but no rotation from the natural standpoint is rotation at unit speed from the standpoint of a fixed reference system this rotational combination therefore has an initial unit of electric rotations with a potential mass of 0.00057870 in addition to the mass of the two dimensional basic rotation which is 1.00639205 making the total potential mass of this particle 1.00697075 in this connection it should be noted that the electron and positron also have rotation at unit speed no rotation in terms of the natural system in the two inactive dimensions but these rotations involve no mass as they are independent and are not rotating anything the initial unit of rotation in the third dimension of the massless neutron on the other hand is a reverse rotation of the two-dimensional structure and it therefore adds an electric mass unit the neutrino M one-half dash one half Dash negative one has the same unit positive displacement in the magnetic Dimensions as the massless neutron but it has neither primary nor magnetic Mass because these are functions of the net total displacement and that quantity is zero for the neutrino but since the electric mass is independent of the basic rotation and has its own initial unit the neutrino has the same potential mass as the uncharged electron or positron which is 0.00057870 the potential mass of both the massless neutron and the neutrino is actualized you know not being potential anymore but actualized when the rotations of these particles are joined to produce a three-dimensional rotation the mass of the resulting particle is then 1.00754945 as indicated in chapter 11 this particle is the proton as it is observed however the proton is positively charged and in this condition the foregoing figure is increased by the mass of a unit charge 0.000 4494 the resulting mass of the theoretical charged proton is 1.00759439 the mass of the observed proton has been measured as 1.007600 so 7600 as opposed to seven five nine four three nine consolidation of two protons results in the formation of a double rotating system and this double rotating system is what creates an actual atom as opposed to a sub atom as stated earlier this substitutes one three-dimensional electric unit of mass for two of the two dimensional units reducing the combined mass by is 0.00028935 the mass of the product which is the deuterium atom which is this mass2 isotope of hydrogen which um which is what the physicists would call the mass2 hydrogen isotope is the sum of two uncharged proton masses less this amount or 2.014810 the corresponding Val observed value is 2.014735 so 14735 as opposed to one four eight one zero in as much as the proton already has a three-dimensional status addition of another neutrino Alters only the electric Mass the material neutrino adds the normal two-dimensional electric unit uh 0.00057870 making the total for the product the mass one isotope of hydrogen 1.00812815 the measured reported value is reported as 1.008142 so that&#x27;s eight one two eight one five as opposed to eight one four two the successive additions of neutrinos to the massless neutron that eventually produce the mass one isotope of hydrogen should be given special attention as the considerations which will be discussed in chapter 17 indicate that this addition process plays a very significant part in the overall cyclic mechanism of the universe the following tabulation shows how the mass of the hydrogen isotope is built step by step okay so this chart is saying step-by-step building process for the hydrogen ice isotope first we have the primary Mass 1.000. then we have the magnetic Mass which is 0.00639205 which is the inverse of the inter-regional ratio that he derived in this chapter earlier that number uh 1408 over 9 which is one uh 128 times 11 over 9. and he he explains where those numbers are coming from earlier in this chapter or in probably two episodes ago then we have the electric Mass 0.00057870 and then we have the massless neutron which is uh m one half dash one half Dash zero so when you add those things together you&#x27;re basically adding all three of those earlier particles the primary Mass the magnetic mass and the electric mass and you get 1.00697075 and that&#x27;s potential Mass so then we have the neutrino we&#x27;ve gone over this um I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s going to do any good to go over it again um but he basically direct he has derived the values of the step-by-step building process for the hydrogen isotope so it goes primary Mass magnetic Mass Electric mass and then you get the massless neutron which is one half one half zero then you have the neutrino which is one half one half negative one and then you have the proton which is one one negative one then you have the neutrino which is m 2-2-negative one and then you have the hydrogen isotope the one which is three halves Dash three halves Dash negative two and that&#x27;s where he gets that number 1.00812815 neutrinos are plentiful oh well it looks like we are out of time um and so uh we will resume tomorrow uh discussing the neutrino and uh start from there he&#x27;ll be deriving some other values here in this chapter um and um you know this is kind of stuff that you really have to study to really understand where he&#x27;s deriving these numbers exactly but um he goes over it you just have to if you&#x27;re interested you will have to go over this very very slowly you know listen to my videos over and over again and listen to the language that he uses and you&#x27;d be able to work it out so good luck with that um and um thanks for tuning in and we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow</p>
