            <p>What if your thoughts aren&#x27;t just chemistry, but quantum physics? Some scientists think consciousness might involve quantum effects, tiny probabilistic processes happening inside the brain&#x27;s neurons. It&#x27;s called the quantum mind hypothesis. In 1996, physicist Roger Penrose and anesthesiologist Stuart Hamarof proposed the ORC O theory, short for orchestrated objective reduction. It suggests quantum vibrations occur inside microtubules, microscopic structures in brain cells, and that wave function collapse could be tied to moments of awareness. Skeptics argue the brain is too warm and wet for fragile quantum states to survive.</p>
<p>But new research shows biological quantum effects already exist. Birds navigate using quantum entanglement and photosynthesis exploits quantum coherence. If they can, maybe neurons can too. We don&#x27;t yet know if the mind is quantum, but if it is, consciousness might be more than computation. It could be a quantum event.</p>
