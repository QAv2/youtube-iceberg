            <p>time traveling hypothesis that there&#x27;s some future us who figured out how to time travel and come back and watch their beginnings. So, um, that one&#x27;s been around for a while. I read Van Danakin&#x27;s Chariots of the Gods and that kind of makes sense in the context of this hypothesis and that we are so very much interested in what happened in ancient Greece and all these ancient cultures. We that&#x27;s why we have archaeologists working on them right now. So it is interesting to think that oh yeah maybe in the future we would go back we would go back to study these or somebody else might come here and you know look at us uh and say okay well let&#x27;s let&#x27;s study this primitive society.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
