            <p>we are live who&#x27;s there can you guys hear us let&#x27;s get the chats going I see Nate Lachey hey Ted Pittman um and well we&#x27;re hoping that as well we have a big piece of Teflon it&#x27;s roughly about a quarter inch and then about seven sheets of glass separating eight pieces of copper together all bunched together with a bit of glue I think it&#x27;s a like a crowding a silicon paste holding it all together so the piece of Teflon is on the side of the high voltage and um what we have protecting the ground side is uh you know some of that putty some of the silicone putty um so tonight is actually the eighth night of Hanukkah I don&#x27;t do this too often uh these live streams so uh please bear with me we&#x27;re going to be lighting the uh the menorah over here we tried doing this with a laser uh but it wasn&#x27;t uh didn&#x27;t come out there for quite a while there we go guys it&#x27;s the second night of Hanukkah happy Hanukkah everyone how&#x27;s it going Jared another great day man where are you where are you hanging at it is getting quite chilly here in the northwest all right get a bunch of snow hey so you were saying uh the size of uh the entire apparatus it&#x27;s a couple inches wide you said I would say from looking over here it&#x27;s probably about six inches wide no more like eight I think it&#x27;s about eight by ten that&#x27;s the glass and the uh Argentine walks slowly okay they come past but walk slowly so you don&#x27;t uh disturb it so she just came in um so it&#x27;s about let me let me turn this around and give you guys a view exactly we&#x27;re dealing with dim the lights a bit it&#x27;s basically it&#x27;s basically about um six inch by eight inch of copper and the outer sheet of glass is about one inch wider on all sides that&#x27;s all held together with silicon and here I&#x27;m going to turn the lights back on and when we charge up this uh marks Bank it should hit it at around a million volts and we&#x27;ll see what happens we&#x27;ll see if it gets triggered uh if it moves at all oh you brought up a point earlier about uh having some air streamers around it to account for airflow so I think one of the first things we&#x27;ve got to do get this is set up is a get some of those incense sticks I&#x27;m going to stick them on the ground underneath and hopefully they&#x27;ll see a little bit of a streamer going past it so we&#x27;ll get a view on the airflow so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m working on right now maybe maybe you could do that on like the second or third run so the first run you don&#x27;t have any particles moving against the thing at all oh that&#x27;s a cool idea let&#x27;s try that so I&#x27;m down here by the control arm so team are you up by the high speed yeah okay don&#x27;t forget to uh push the button evenly on both sides so it doesn&#x27;t shake and we&#x27;re gonna power this up I&#x27;ll give you a rough time about when it&#x27;s about to fire okay we&#x27;re about 15 000 at around and it will uh fire twenty five thousand coming up on 30. it&#x27;s about to fire any second oh boy oh and fired let&#x27;s do that one more time you could just push the button again okay um okay I&#x27;m gonna head over to the other computer let&#x27;s start uh viewing you got it you did lose speed first I think yeah okay so we lost the feed for a second when that fire um so we&#x27;re now we&#x27;re gonna try to view exactly what we saw over here that would be foreign oh see a spark around there there&#x27;s right around here somewhere right image search close a little before that I definitely saw something yeah oh there right there it&#x27;s right there oh there it goes wow Jared can you see that yeah can you slow it down for those few frames okay now I&#x27;m going to play each image let&#x27;s go oh that is cool damn that looks nice doesn&#x27;t it I&#x27;m clicking uh one frame at a time you can see the numbers it&#x27;s 44 000 frames a second that&#x27;s right before that is the best frame you got that is so freaking it looks like a freaking UFO man it kind of does now well the real question is didn&#x27;t move so we&#x27;re at 97 43 . I&#x27;ll zoom in trying to get just that piece of data up there right now there&#x27;s the firing oh you can even see the streamer going by here it&#x27;s gonna fire again you see that little streamer yeah you can see a little puff of smoke on the back side yeah that that is pretty cool can you slow it down again so we can watch that backside Puff um we&#x27;re actually we&#x27;re sped up we&#x27;re about a hundred frames a second okay oh there it is can you see what I&#x27;m doing I&#x27;m basically toggling the um the speed that&#x27;s playing back at I wonder if it just vaporized some of the material on the back side oh totally see where it&#x27;s vaporizing it we&#x27;re just basically using the air in this case we&#x27;re using the air as a the air is being used as a tube you know what I&#x27;m wondering what if the um gravity impulse experiment with the superconductors going through it&#x27;s basically a big spark plug a vacuum spark plug what if that changes the uh character of the beam in some way what if it sharpens the uh impulse speed I wonder if we hooked the ground side of that to this what would happen when you use the incense can you make sure that there&#x27;s no smoke going in between the plate and where it arcs so that it doesn&#x27;t give it opportunity to Arc sooner uh it&#x27;s gonna be kind of hard to do we could try like just put the incense on the back side or something or in on the other side of the um uh spark Wireless yeah we&#x27;re gonna have to we&#x27;re gonna have to rig up some sort of uh holding mechanism in order to do that because it&#x27;s hanging up the whole apparatus is hanging up in the air okay so that was the first test and the second test is over here let&#x27;s see what happened with that I&#x27;m not so sure we got it on this one do you think you got it you know I&#x27;m gonna I&#x27;m gonna go while I start setting up the uh intense sticks for this yeah hey Jared you can just take it away if you want while we&#x27;re uh oh here&#x27;s Aiden shaffer&#x27;s joining us there we go conversations going on here hello hello oh Simon Claret has the idea I think that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re gonna do maybe uh some sort of camera tripod and we&#x27;ll put the incense stick on that there you go there we go now I&#x27;m gonna go get that hey Aiden yes question for you ask me no questions and I&#x27;ll tell you no lies um have you ever read Paul La violette&#x27;s book uh secrets of anti-gravity no uh it&#x27;s like you know 20 feet from Mark right now um didn&#x27;t he just pass away or something like that or I just heard from uh Tim last week that uh he hasn&#x27;t passed away yet but that he&#x27;s just very ill maybe Tim&#x27;s info is outdated I don&#x27;t know okay uh no I have not so what do you want to talk about what what&#x27;s uh the burning question oh well I I just got done reading it and it is my new like stick that I&#x27;m on because it&#x27;s just such a great book and it has so much gold in it um he talks a lot about TT Brown&#x27;s work for like the first third to half of it most of the book is about Brown&#x27;s work but he takes it and um he kind of talked about it some in his Apec talks um how like for this kind of stuff especially the asymmetric capacitors uh he talks about how like shrinking the diameter of the wire actually increased the effect um he talks a lot about how besides the asymmetric capacitors um are important he talks about the dielectrics they use and why those are so important and how those had an effect on it um they sit in the disc in like a radio array or so the main thing about Brown&#x27;s work that he talks about is the asymmetric capacitor um where you have a very small negative plate and a very large positive charged Dome over the top separated by dielectrics um and they found a lot of non-linear effects like as you increase voltage the effect goes up not non-linearity because it&#x27;s like what are we talking history this is true so so as you increase the voltage by two the effect goes up by fours you increase the voltage by four it goes up by 16. it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a non you know it&#x27;s not a linear like one-for-one relationship on inputs to outputs as you increase the dielectric you get exponentially more effects thrust effect as you increase the voltage you get exponentially more thrust effect so they were using wires for these asymmetric taskers through only a few thousandths uh of an inch thick yeah right they&#x27;re super small wires and they were running 150 to 250 kilovolts through them which is insane like the current had to be extraordinarily low and some like circles resin rosin some sort in order then explode I think I think they were using uh uh you&#x27;re you&#x27;re muted mark oh you guys probably can hear me now but so we&#x27;re gonna do some smudging I got this uh set up over here yeah give us a stream uh Solstice is like two days away foreign translate what did you say happy Passover that&#x27;s the start of Hanukkah and I think that marks some sort of uh Passover event a long long time ago so um or I&#x27;m totally wrong and I&#x27;ve tuned into Taos time but so the asymmetrical capacitor like I mean we&#x27;ve seen that in the ion lifter that&#x27;s where most people take it but like inside of a disc like a small disc in the middle or and then three so yeah as soon as you see three bulbs on the bottom and a spinner wave guide so he had a slightly different setup for um how the craft to actually worked he used multiple different components in series to show how how they&#x27;re operating and they&#x27;re using phase conjugation combined with uh negative refracting metamaterials to like extract every bit of momentum out of a photon that you can combined with a standing wave uh soliton beam underground I was just reviewing some papers from uh Peroni where they&#x27;re cutting board yeah iron iron Garnet they combine the magnon spin wave with the song We&#x27;ll have to save uh number one spinning Fields somehow attached to the vehicle um hmm well I&#x27;ll type something in this one yeah what marked about the Perez uh patent in the double Hall thing so it was oh yeah do some doodling on cats I think now we can uh at least a lot of fun or the drawing mindsets earlier in the morning for whatever reason but the afternoons I tend to get into like metal shaping and trying to do electronics work yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s seven o&#x27;clock and dark so and then it&#x27;s all the Christmas Vibe is yeah in the air shall we sell yeah yeah are you gonna have a white Christmas or well I just got a text for the weather update here and it looks like we&#x27;re gonna get dumped on in the next couple days I&#x27;m good um yeah [Music] on social media and then chats trying to get involved with the AI double A UAP I&#x27;ve got a paper in progress we were talking about it back in July and um I&#x27;ve got a referee kind of lined up or so let me do another day or so of putting in some equations and stuff I think you have the uh metamaterial book and I&#x27;ll bounce a copy and I don&#x27;t know the lamb waves what was the settings right now bro look take a look is it set for image okay so I figured out the lamb wave thing off until we&#x27;re ready I figured out the lamb wave thing is really just how to guide the plasmons um so really all you&#x27;re doing is you&#x27;re creating these things called spoof plasma it&#x27;s like cheater plasmons some sub-harmonics of the main phase uh basically you&#x27;re normally supposed to get plasmons in the ultra high gigahertz terahertz range but you can get them down to the megahertz range by cheating um okay so these these plasmons they&#x27;re like longitudinal waves which I suspect is strongly correlated to a lot of the stuff that we&#x27;re looking at right now as well as labiolet&#x27;s stuff with the standing soliton wave um as well as Tesla&#x27;s work with and hops work with the impulses yeah yeah it&#x27;s all got to start with the electric field getting the the patterns spinning around the vehicle um yeah 90 degrees and 90 degrees I don&#x27;t know let&#x27;s we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ve got to get into um spin forming lathe anymore yeah I&#x27;m here I was just reading the messages we&#x27;re thinking of uh putting a barrier in between it uh to block that light maybe we could put a black a black piece of plastic I got something are you guys following with what this experiment is about that&#x27;s the flat knob experiment so when you&#x27;re blowing away no this isn&#x27;t this is the impulse gravitator experiment basically the parallel plate capacitors in the base of the arv that&#x27;s kind of what I have built over here a piece of copper piece of glass um eight layers deep which is great because it&#x27;s it&#x27;sotonica and there&#x27;s eight nights of Hanukkah so we&#x27;re gonna emulse it with about a million volts and we&#x27;ll be looking for movement so far we got one impulse through but we didn&#x27;t see any movement we did see a pretty cool streak though um and uh now we&#x27;re trying it with an intense stick and we&#x27;re gonna try to get the best image possible well hey so that like in my box back in the Shelf in the back uh there&#x27;s that half-assed McCandless array does that fit around the solenoid can we see what happens if you it needs to be potted and maybe I don&#x27;t know dimpled on one side those plates are kind of complex from what I got off of McCandless and that they&#x27;re like on one you have like a and b in order I guess we could get them potted if you know the spaces and stuff yeah we could get that done it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh talk about it on uh later in the week we&#x27;ll put it on the to-do list for now I gotta we&#x27;re gonna try firing it just like this Justine are you ready uh one second um is it gonna trigger it&#x27;s gonna be triggering automatically right um um also the trigger needs to be in the beginning of the the trigger point needs to be in the beginning of the video otherwise you&#x27;re not going to catch uh what happens put trigger on the beginning how do you do that you know oh there it is now yeah now it&#x27;s right okay so I&#x27;m going to be uh charging it up right now let&#x27;s nobody touch the camera oh wait yeah you don&#x27;t want to touch the camera now because otherwise it will fire that will trigger uh the image it&#x27;s not I think any sort of is it ready I&#x27;m charging up I&#x27;m at I&#x27;m at 10 000 volts all right it&#x27;s on okay we&#x27;re communicating with each other from other sides of the of the shop we&#x27;re like 35 feet apart charging up for about 25 000 volts uh we might lose the stream for a second when it uh when it fires that happened last time and coming up on 30. it&#x27;s gonna fire any second now get fired yeah they captured it uh two I&#x27;m coming over there to check that out again capture that think so yeah it&#x27;s running right now oh wow this thing&#x27;s so big it the captured it should be somewhere around here right yeah yeah there it is yeah that works nice oh look at that and it even tells you the number of frames from the trigger point there yeah some trigger yeah the trigger triggering worked pretty well should be around now in 10 seconds all right seven six this is high speed cameras yeah can you go full screen when you get a chance thanks oh there it goes full screen oh yeah let&#x27;s pull us up on full screen okay there we go back to let&#x27;s do another back too this is image minus two meaning it took two images at 45 000 frames a second to get this minus one this was the trigger frame and the answer is we did not see anything with that but what we did find out is that we can actually shorten we could uh increase the number of signs that we capture so we&#x27;re gonna do this definitely don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t want that trigger over there you want it to be yeah like it&#x27;s got 100 frames before you know save this on walls okay actually another thing we can do is we could increase the number of signs altogether this way um you can get more shots out of it or you can just erase the ones that aren&#x27;t good that&#x27;s you know these settings are fun just erase the ones that uh um sign number two is what we just used right yep so when I walk faster it&#x27;s going to trigger again or you can just turn it off right now so it doesn&#x27;t happen foreign damn it so so the smoke is um got a little bit weak and also the uh the flare from behind sort of blocks anything that you would have seen with the smoke so we&#x27;re gonna try to put a black background covering the marks generator hold on a second oh they&#x27;re wiggling it foreign come on and then use the Manila to light up our uh nice Sage nice it actually works out kind of interesting like as you can see the um uh Tom you&#x27;re you&#x27;re blocking the light sorry blocking The View there we go so we should be able to see half of the uh the smoke going up and then the other half will have that flash going with this current setup try to get a nice thick block of smoke going on here God does smell really nice in the shop Aiden do you uh Sage your house occasionally uh I have a nice Tibetan incense I like so there&#x27;s many different influences little Sage bundles you have to ask them if they&#x27;re coming down off of heroin or math like foreign bad joke but uh yeah harsh truth beats patchouli oil oh yeah now the um we have something called the Mesa and people are off the grid okay is it uh ready to fire before you see it so people are stinky but it&#x27;s once you get used to it it&#x27;s different like you go by going to the cities and it&#x27;s like oh it&#x27;s ready okay you guys are ready to fire ready okay there we go that&#x27;s perfect Power It Up uh you know what I know a way to make this a lot better I need to move the lights um guys can you turn off the image uh bass trigger I need to turn off I&#x27;m going to move the light so only the um only the smoke part is lit like in Simon&#x27;s comments saying that we&#x27;re exercising the shop foreign foreign it&#x27;s pretty dark okay what do we see there attention [Music] it&#x27;s too dark we&#x27;re not getting the smoke are we we&#x27;re getting smoke but no light can you see this stuff yep just smoke yeah what&#x27;s up oh yeah you can see yeah oh okay I should probably increase the smoke a little bit another thing we can do is lower the frame rate increase the uh if we did this down at twenty thousand and get a little bit more light oh there you go I don&#x27;t know if you guys can see that but there is wow that&#x27;s very that&#x27;s nice it&#x27;s paintballs there when it arcs we should be able to see everything true on the full screen replay oh there that&#x27;s good that&#x27;s at 300 frames a second and how many frames per second was it that we were able to see the arc time for um milliseconds so this is four thousand frames a second uh it was that we were at top speed at 33 000.</p>
<p>oh so at 33 000 barely see anything no you could see it but you only have like less than a dozen frames at that rate yeah so here&#x27;s that 20 000 that&#x27;s how much you see of the smoke there&#x27;s a four thousand I think we should do it at different speeds you gotta always increase that we should do it at different speeds to get different uh sorts of data so we&#x27;ll run this once at a thousand you see how changing it to change both the sample rate and the exposure time maximize exposure time which is the uh yeah they&#x27;re universally proportional um and this will give us well it&#x27;s gonna give us a 14 second um fire d a different computer so this frame rate it&#x27;s gonna it&#x27;s gonna go on for 14 seconds so let&#x27;s try it this way first you can trigger it manually yeah um but you first have to check when the smoke is perfect it&#x27;s good all right let me turn this fan off too good foreign so that was probably me walking through the shop to try to cover my mouth the smoke went up perfectly straight before it&#x27;s straightening up again I&#x27;m gonna wait until it straightens up and then I&#x27;ll start charging up okay here we go we&#x27;re charging up the uh charging up the mark spank you guys have to trigger it within one second of it firing yes [Music] are you guys ready yeah there we go okay okay what was I say capture capture are you guys ready yet it says capture click on capture the camera I can hear you from the computer you can stand by the computer should he do it from the camera or the computer um no he needs to do it through the computer okay oh yes this is all done from the from the computer click capture yeah clip capture again yes there we go all right all right we&#x27;re ready okay we&#x27;re ready okay um the auto trigger is off right correct uh the smoke is going a little crazy over here I&#x27;m gonna yeah let&#x27;s wait for it to calm down before we start again crazy smoke just let everything calm down time to put a glass box around it or something you&#x27;re getting the drafts off of uh the road or okay we&#x27;re charging it up now there&#x27;s smoke as soon as you talk about it twenty five thousand should strike about should uh hit around 30. coming up on 30. letting it sit for a little bit Rising see smoke is very nice there you go got it that might have been a good one so click trigger see okay yeah uh okay do you want to do another one wait oh one second that was continuing we are can you go back to play uh number four there we go uh Planet play that uh record speed you see the check over there uh center right speed so yeah yeah okay there there it is starting interesting it looks like the uh the smoke was following sort of an AC pattern over there right around the firing time was that the firing time where was the trigger time in this I don&#x27;t know one sec I&#x27;m gonna come forward you see where it triggered no no unless it&#x27;s going too fast that was a manual one all these a thousand frames per second oh I see a little glow there didn&#x27;t move for a second glue as well maybe we should set it to trigger automatically foreign okay let&#x27;s try the um the exposure time yeah um the exposure time of 99. yeah um it&#x27;s off so sensing off I&#x27;m Matt back at the control room which is basically just this high voltage power supply which is attached to the marks Bank over there right next to our menorah okay are you guys ready ready [Music] um put the tests the trigger a bit to the left that&#x27;s fine uh move it a lot more to the left no yeah you could also increase the uh resolution a bit if you want no no um yeah you can you can increase the resolution that would just yeah uh click down on that this one yeah yeah okay yeah that just gives you less time okay perfect I&#x27;m gonna start charging it up as soon as we get steady air over here foreign foreign at the center light this is known as the shamash it&#x27;s the candle that you&#x27;re supposed to use for lighting the other lights so it&#x27;s far I&#x27;m trying to increase the heat on the stage so we&#x27;ll get a a sharper uh line yeah I think we have achieved it it&#x27;s cool oh okay that&#x27;s cool wait I would wait yeah fans on this high voltage Supply all right okay we&#x27;ll just give it a minute or two until it straightens up Garrett are you familiar with the uh Old and New Testament Bible and stuff so apparently during the time of the temple there was this instant burning thing in the temple that uh made the smoke go off in a perfectly straight line which is what we&#x27;re trying to achieve right now yeah Old Testament God really liked having that uh that pillar of smoke vertical smoke smoke from sacrifices lots of smoke going on okay we&#x27;re charging up right now that&#x27;s a pretty nice wine are you guys ready continue we&#x27;re ready ready um I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re ready it says capture there um no no you good to go what do we click on are you ready no still on capture which sign are you on uh let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s all for our stored okay so on store one okay the last one or the last one we need okay we&#x27;re back what okay still not triggered look uh it&#x27;s already triggered stop it the image is it the smoke yes it&#x27;s the image based time thing you have to turn that off okay yeah it&#x27;s off okay uh move the trigger time over to the right three seconds that&#x27;s 1.2 we have another well a little bit yeah yeah there you go uh three not necessary but okay ready okay uh when you hear it you&#x27;re gonna trigger it manually I&#x27;m waiting for the smoke to become a column again okay are waiting for the smoke to come account column and then we&#x27;ll trigger it oh we&#x27;re gonna have Bernie here in a few minutes Bernie where you at okay you guys think we&#x27;re ready ready okay so we&#x27;re gonna start charging camera go high voltage go Spectators go smoke it&#x27;s disrupt the gallery go why does the smoke always do that because chaos chaos theory quantum theory quantum mechanics in effect right there you&#x27;re observing it so the smoke got worse Look Away there you go oh for a second it&#x27;s always a Split Second oh that&#x27;s pretty good okay we&#x27;re about to fire there you go oh um okay it&#x27;s recording now [Music] okay there we go we got it uh zoom in on that trigger point can you open up the sign for that trigger point see what happens oh I almost forgot I guess we got oh we got donuts thank you for Hanukkah thank you sir they&#x27;re not blue I don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s like the Hanukkah yeah exactly Justine knows if you get any light of that uh trigger so far no just go to the trigger point oh that&#x27;s right you&#x27;re at minus uh that&#x27;s right it&#x27;s coming it&#x27;s coming it&#x27;s coming yeah here it comes slow down the frames per second now oh there it was pause all right go back to where it was no it&#x27;s too many images okay oh this is a jelly band there it is to us sweet industrophones how many images the whole stripe here let&#x27;s move forward the whole the whole part where you see a flash or just two that&#x27;s it now there&#x27;s a little streamer in the third so they&#x27;re actually yeah still there oh my God you can see it&#x27;s like a it&#x27;s almost like a wire going through the air yeah yeah if you go back so every single frame is one millisecond right uh-huh wow that&#x27;s cool that is freaking cool you want to turn forward look at that it&#x27;s like a a torrid of air it&#x27;s probably because the current is going through it that&#x27;s making the air sort of twist around it I wonder what would happen if we hit a Mercury chamber with that we actually have these Mercury light bulbs what if we uh oh boy he did he did one up accept it you know that that would be pretty cool that would be some cool images there&#x27;s a lot of UVC radiation for sure that is for sure um Aiden have you seen this the latest move on Journal they&#x27;re talking about no Heaven cylindrical UFOs okay just different shapes that people saw and the cylindrical one that&#x27;s basically what we saw in the desert in the Old Testament fire and smoke that&#x27;s literally what they are this is people who&#x27;ve seen him um recently this guy was in 1960 May 4th 1960 hand drawings of it going through a cloud crazy 1989 here&#x27;s another image oh here&#x27;s the actual images that does kind of look like a uh like a submarine yeah you see that see that little uh wine over there it does kind of look like a submarine doesn&#x27;t it Aiden what do you think this is case 12 126 531. the phone case I mean okay uh where&#x27;s the picture right there okay I&#x27;ve seen better in real life of have you seen that that particular design though no there&#x27;s that one poster off of like um it&#x27;s been at the Arizona UFO conference and such uh anyway sorry let me finish one second one thought I think the coolest image we saw was that one right after the strike yeah 370 right yeah up you can see that streamer forming and look at that so there&#x27;s all the energy being dispersed here notice how there&#x27;s like two glowing uh bulbs on either side so at higher speeds we found that it would actually atrocity when it jumps a gap it&#x27;s coming from both sides it&#x27;s not really a positive and negative you know it&#x27;s not really moving One Direction like uh we&#x27;re hoping but perhaps with uh perhaps the superconductor Spark um Spark app experiment over there maybe that changes the shape of these impulses I was wondering if that would have some sort of effect because you see how the there&#x27;s an equal amount of energy coming from either side of the beam if there is any net force to that we need it to be larger on one side um the next image is actually pretty cool check this out you do have the arc on the back side too that kind of imbalances it doesn&#x27;t it right right below the the test lead yeah right there oh you&#x27;re right yeah there is something there it&#x27;s lower than the one that had the puffer you know what&#x27;s pop it&#x27;s possible that the uh the beam The Arc the beam is arcing around as well um so the Energy&#x27;s not all going into the uh capacitor it could be it&#x27;s leaking around the side another possibility I really like how this feels like a Taurus through a glowing air with the streamer in the center in the next image and you can just see the streamer now a little puff of smoke there the brightest spot so this light that you see here this is the color of um those UFOs like when you have high voltage that is strong enough to ionize air this is roughly the color you&#x27;d end up with this is basically what we&#x27;ve got going on over here this is ionized air being charged um the smoke is giving a nice smell in the room but I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;ve seen anything with that Bernie on yet oh here he is burning the man hello hello how are you happy Hanukkah indeed it&#x27;s the first night isn&#x27;t it it&#x27;s the second night second second on the second night of Hanukkah mature will continue I see you guys hanukkah&#x27;s all about the donuts donuts that&#x27;s the dream Dallas how&#x27;s the Apple this is good it actually is pretty good after you got the Apple so uh what sort of tonic uh candle do you have lit here my friend what are we watching oh let me um move the other camera over one sec foreign so we basically have here&#x27;s our hockey candles um the experiment set up over here you&#x27;re looking through the height the high speed camera and a bunch of uh parallel plates of copper and glass mixed together so it&#x27;s a power plate capacitor and we were hitting the marched generator that&#x27;s cool jealous of your setup my friend that&#x27;s awesome equipment so what&#x27;s smoking then the copper it&#x27;s it&#x27;s some Sage oh okay okay um you don&#x27;t want any ghosts bumping into the thing fair enough every time I run the experiment the um my headphones cut off because it gets high voltage basically this is the setup over here we have intense sticks hanging on on the chair that&#x27;s blowing the smoke up I&#x27;ve got a light off to the side uh this is the gravitator over here and then there&#x27;s the mark spank behind it providing the impulse and all the way at the other end of the shop about 40 feet that way is the high speed camera on with a zoom lens on it nice that&#x27;s wicked but don&#x27;t don&#x27;t you want to catch some sort of an entity coming through what do you mean what do you want to catch an entity coming through instead of scaring them away with sage potentially referring to uh the stories of uh CERN and how they supposedly caught some things on camera or something one experiment at a time yeah well the sage is providing the smoke so we can look at the uh airflows is there something else we could burn to bring the demons back I don&#x27;t know if you want to do that I think that I you know what I heard you know what I heard if you take the firstborn uh I think it&#x27;s the firstborn daughter of the firstborn daughter the firstborn daughter in cats and and then you burn the baby or something like that and take its ashes that&#x27;s supposed to bring off the demons or you could just go to Texas and get some of their Devil&#x27;s hair grass that stuff is straight from no Hayden definitely knows all about this Aiden how do you bring the devils how do I bring the Devils um they&#x27;re already there yeah I know why why I don&#x27;t know I mean that the only thing I&#x27;ve got is um when I was in the lab house I had this like I guess quasi-prophetic dream when I was downstairs about Putin falling down stairs and yeah like he had security guards around him it was this really innate three-part dream and I&#x27;m flipping through social media and apparently like he was in his house in Moscow last week and fell down broke his tailbone and shot himself so interesting I dreamed about it before it happened like back in June I don&#x27;t know how do you bring the doubles out blood sacrifice yeah I was gonna say goat&#x27;s blood maybe oh no don&#x27;t kill my goats it&#x27;s really nice they&#x27;re sent they&#x27;re really smart jatin can you turn off the camera to live okay there you go so here&#x27;s what we got going on right now um it looks pretty smooth right now how about we do a a higher speed test yeah because yeah crank it up to like 33 000.</p>
<p>see yeah three or three thousand you said 33 000. okay and do the automatic trigger um oops the stadium Jordan 2464. custom are you ready it&#x27;s not taking 33 000. it&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s just going till 22 000. oh so lower the frames per second I&#x27;d lower the resolution of the resolution that&#x27;s true there we go there you go yeah um exposure time then they&#x27;ll automatic like Auto drag on uh first first uh drop that frames per second so you can see your view more close and and then um increase exposure time how much the exposure time how much Max that&#x27;s 29.</p>
<p>29 is the max yeah this is a for what for for what FPS 33 000 FPS uh lower it to 100 first and then increase the uh the the light so you can actually see what the frame is just to look what the frame is yeah because you changed the resolution higher uh take it back to thirty three thousand no were you able to see the uh The View I couldn&#x27;t see anything down just smoke that smoke that resolution so you need to lower the frames per second and increase the exposure time so we can see what the view is at that resolution Bernie we&#x27;re just figuring out the uh high speed camera over here all good brother yourself you can increase that there we go uh you could you could decrease the size a bit you could cut the uh Side to Side Resolution by that okay yeah that would hey hey Bernice uh friend what&#x27;s your name Amber Amber I just go home from work the hoodie okay yeah it&#x27;s close uh so how does this look uh you could decrease it a little more that would allow you to bring the frame rates up to like 60 000. what&#x27;s the resolution at now you could type it in manually it&#x27;s 320 by 240. uh do 200 by 300 200 by 300 yes oh what&#x27;s it is it on yet I had said 200 by 300. is it showing us live right now yeah yes um okay what&#x27;s the max FPS that you can do so right now it&#x27;s a 300 the max is 66 000 I&#x27;ll take it to 66 000. okay um Now set it for auto trigger so I have to order trigger okay that&#x27;s it okay uh what&#x27;s the percentage for the trigger it&#x27;s at minus five five thirty six oh no what&#x27;s the percent change for the trigger in the trigger settings so just checking it is there an advanced settings no it&#x27;s right there on the bottom of the screen I just can&#x27;t see your screen all the way um let me try doing this [Music] how do I get him let me try this let&#x27;s see area percentage yes the area percentage 26 percent uh drop that to ten turn okay okay that&#x27;s it then okay uh are we in capture yet um no we have to prepare a sign this is not ready yet one second yeah ready we need to delete one delete one delete number one one okay okay and now it&#x27;s ready oh did the settings change oh yeah set them back to what they were 200 by 300 .</p>
<p>6 000. that&#x27;s not there is the name of it okay okay ready go we&#x27;re not sure we&#x27;re not ready not ready yet uh no the trigger should be we can&#x27;t see the picture either I know okay all righty ready yeah it&#x27;s ready we&#x27;re ready what&#x27;s the trigger at it&#x27;s at minus 1331 okay manual trigger we are trigging no it&#x27;s gonna automatic trigger this time it&#x27;s on we&#x27;re good okay I&#x27;m charging up just gonna bring the laptop a little farther away this time 25 000 volts 25 000. I&#x27;m gonna hold it there for a little bit it&#x27;ll trigger any second now okay okay triggered but blacked out wondering okay let&#x27;s analyze that now oh too fast play with uh yeah well no if you bring that down it&#x27;ll go slower employee if you click now just go to the trigger point see that number in the center that&#x27;s the trigger point oh wait oh there it is yeah here you can go to the timeline Zoom you zoom in zoom in keep going now that&#x27;s the number of digits from the trigger you&#x27;re gonna take it around there okay now we need to place uh Plage image there you go all right let me do this [Music] um oh wow that&#x27;s the shot there&#x27;s the show that is the shot one second can you guys see that yep yep you might want to make that screen a little larger though and shrink the rest of us yeah that&#x27;s fine let me see if I can do that hello here can I sit down here how in the world do you do that I did click on just that one option below what um it&#x27;s I think the third or fourth box uh below there that you click on the one that has like a big box and then a bunch of little ones on the right side I&#x27;ll present present yeah just present your screen or that screen but no not present it should be about to present the options of how you have it think about the these options that [Music] um okay now we just gotta remove you guys nope oh yeah okay here we go let&#x27;s move myself okay there we go now that works um okay so now I have to go back to this there we go let&#x27;s remove that image through well you can see the smoke in this image right here yeah I think that&#x27;s the only image you actually get to see the smoke you can see over here there&#x27;s like dendrils it&#x27;s kind of like twisted up kind of like a coil I think yeah I think they are muted I don&#x27;t know how to do this without needing all right fair enough well guys if I had to call it I think these images are probably the images of the night look at that Bernie what do you think of that very nice like electrifying yeah shocking image there we go there we go okay now we can add people back in so when you had it really dark and it&#x27;s like two cups coming at each other it it looks like uh synapses Yeah well yeah that&#x27;s the nature of the fractal nature of Nature and biology but normally it&#x27;s like tree right lightning but this it like cups it doesn&#x27;t treat so these are charged plates and there&#x27;s Smoke&#x27;s coming up and it&#x27;s not the graffitica for a uhnov experiment excuse me but I was thinking there&#x27;d be like a the punch we were looking for like maybe a smoke ring or you see a bunch of rings in the dendrils that are left over from the impulse spot it&#x27;s very interesting how different frame rates and uh light inputs uh or exposure times you see different colors and different aspects of the implosion so a thousand frames a second we were able to see something more akin to like a yellowish Golden Glow let me uh pull that up again this is a really long one this is at a negative 370 that it&#x27;s truck right I gotta zoom in like that here it is so you see that little Golden Glow over there yeah that thing this is what we&#x27;re getting at a thousand frames per second with more exposure um at a higher speed a higher rate we got something this is at four this is at the um she&#x27;s at 66 000. yeah this is that 66 000 okay so we got a couple more images then but you don&#x27;t see that kind of General detail at that big smudge and the light that we saw in the previous image for sure over here you&#x27;re able to see like a nice Taurus of uh smoke that sort of like Twisted in on itself with um I guess the strongest twists are in the center and then there&#x27;s a Twist on top of the twist you see it&#x27;s sort of like it&#x27;s sort of like uh those noodles um that pasta you&#x27;re swelling yeah yeah yeah it&#x27;s kind of what it looks like in the center right there two words of curl and Divergence so A cross B field you&#x27;re just seeing the atmospheric variations and it should be like a clear pulse shouldn&#x27;t it or it&#x27;s a large plate it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not a clear pulse what we&#x27;re getting out of this marks bank is actually just the way lightning runs that it comes up from the ground and comes down from the sky simultaneously they smack each other in the center we really want with this kind of experiments is to see where to see an Impulse where you&#x27;re getting a larger smack in the beginning coming from one direction to the other you kind of see at the high voltage contact coming down the White Post you kind of see like a tornado effect of the smoke around it and you don&#x27;t see that too yeah there&#x27;s a fight on view I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t really see anything myself other than like chaos I&#x27;ve looked into a lot of smoke [Laughter] staring at the fire you learn to look and see how plasma works like the notoroidal pulse pulse or a waveform goes through it&#x27;s definitely like a shock wave like a bullet so it does I mean the de stuff the health stuff when the laser hits the target the target goes point and blows up so I I don&#x27;t know lightning a waveform came out of it some way should the camera be like maybe can we turn the plate other way and like get smoke coming up all around it and see if something comes out radially like we probably could do that it would take quite a while to set this up differently okay I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible to do that tonight that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s probably like a half hour uh setup job right now oh maybe Friday night it&#x27;s Monday Wednesday tomorrow night so Adrian why don&#x27;t we see can you go back right to that keep it on that print for a sec uh why don&#x27;t we see another Dark One uh the as we start to see the ionization it&#x27;s too late right the voltage is broken down the waveform has already hit it so it should be before the bright flash that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re looking for the wave because it&#x27;s that&#x27;s the the impulse is hitting the the background what are we going to call it the zero point field the the Higgs potential and then as you see the light like as the potential goes Super negative and then starts to rebound to the positive side of the peak you&#x27;re gonna the ionization the light is towards the end of it so it should be right before it you see a disturbance of something for can you think of a reason why we see uh the swirl a lot more around the high voltage lead than around the plates all a condensed field more more charge right because um or something uh you know the wire thin wire and the the charges are more condensed on The Wire the whole point of the plate is it&#x27;s spreading it out the area of it allows there&#x27;s a few more charge built up between the various layers on this um maybe if we have like the arv plates they&#x27;re you know they&#x27;re pie shaded right wedged and the charge is coming in at the narrow end and supposedly radiating out um the plates are supposed to be dimbled on one side so they have a biasing speaking about the ARB I had a question for both you and Mark on that in the image it shows like the Stacked plates and then you see like a barrier that goes down around them right what&#x27;s what&#x27;s the charging on those plates is it like one stack of plates is one charge in the next Stack&#x27;s another charge enough of that barriers or is it alternating charge between each plate um I Heard a theory that they were charging those plates in a circular fashion basically a uh static field that was rotating so each segment is each stack is one polarity and you&#x27;ve got this barrier that goes down in the next stack is the next polarity and so it&#x27;s alternating it&#x27;s creating an AC or pulse DC I&#x27;m not really sure but I I do believe that they were rotating the static fields in that setup that would be similar to what van Derek is trying to do that would be a logical reason for having a spherical um a spherical capacitive array like that would be to turn them on I&#x27;ll turn ultimately you know in a circle um one thing that I did notice in this slow motion while uh playing it back is that right around the 139 second Mark there&#x27;s a puff of air that reaches that interrupts the smoke you know we&#x27;ll start it from there&#x27;s the strike now look at look how the smoke is starting to interact like it just hit something so before here&#x27;s the strike again strike right now something hit the smoke right around now to uh interrupt that beautiful streamer that we had going on here it&#x27;s gonna start again we had a beautiful streamer and pop it&#x27;s gone this is probably some sort of airflow moving on the side of the parallel capacitor that need to get like a tube with a bunch of holes and so you can get a whole bunch of them coming up and I want to see it from the other way like this is Edge on can you see get it um the thing is if it&#x27;s front on yeah we have to get what we need to do is uh something like you suggested yeah just very fine streamers of smoke I get what you&#x27;re saying with the the pulse there but it seems to break up chaotically how far across the back side of the plate is the smoke going up it because it looks like all the Smoke&#x27;s in front of the plate um it&#x27;s all in front of it so that it&#x27;s actually probably a foot in front of it so that blockage of air that you&#x27;re describing is up to a foot away from the thing that that seems that explains the amount of time that it takes for that air to reach it so we are seeing something with the air but the smoke is at a distance so we probably should run this again with the Smoke a Little Closer also I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re going to see anything you know what I wonder what the high speed if that if the smoke would actually Club articulates would change the uh the way this thing fires that would be an interesting thing to check can you get a rough estimate as to the amount of time difference between the spark and when we see the block of smoke change um it&#x27;s 130 Fram it&#x27;s 0.137 seconds over the distance of a foot so how fast is that all right seconds so it&#x27;s like 10 meters a second 13 meters a second 30 meters is nothing times I&#x27;ll just take some notes Here yes yes okay there we go that&#x27;s it sign one was signed two did we get anything on sign two oh yeah there we go that happened right around oh this one&#x27;s interesting what do you think of this one what was the settings on this setup measurements Jared do you have a speech for us yet oh this was at 33 000 frames a second I&#x27;m trying to get it there&#x27;s some light head-on probably yeah we would have turned the light off we probably would have seen some interesting stuff in this setup let&#x27;s try it at 33 000. would be better do it fancier this is like stage one I get to the stage three where it&#x27;s a circle okay we&#x27;re just gonna save that to turn around yes [Music] okay there we go number three save to number three get anything but I don&#x27;t think anything though I&#x27;ll just go back to the camera um okay we have to the manager now okay we gotta erase all these and try to make shorter ones so we can do a lot more time next round [Music] so you said it was 0.135 seconds 0.137 seconds yeah so that&#x27;s like five miles an hour five miles an hour 0.137 seconds to move a foot yep in one second so there&#x27;s 3 600 seconds and a an hour 2.2 2 meters per second for our rest of the world how how many how many feet would it go in a second um so we go eight feet in a second eight times sixty is uh four 480 and I&#x27;ll call it five five and now it&#x27;s about 30 miles an hour rough calculation in my head it&#x27;s around 30 miles an hour you should double check that I&#x27;m checking my calculator um files how do we it&#x27;s actually some way to uh them now to change the number of signs oh okay I think it&#x27;s in the light settings okay partitions here we go [Music] okay fine settings okay and I&#x27;ll keep that same let&#x27;s do that 33 000.</p>
<p>three white everything I&#x27;m seeing says five miles an hour really yeah I&#x27;m using like four different online calculators they&#x27;re all saying about something speed distance time calculators 0.13 seconds yep for one foot one tonight as I want probably no one divided by 0.37 okay so it&#x27;s 7.3 feet per second times 60 times 60 divided by carefully 52 25 feet per mile yeah five miles five miles an hour you&#x27;re right um okay so let&#x27;s try that okay [Music] which that&#x27;s just about the speed that somebody walks across the shop I&#x27;d have to guess yeah Tesla Bots are not supposed to go faster than five miles per hour oh wait one it owes me money come on can you see this thing at all no I really can&#x27;t see anything let&#x27;s try dropping that frame rate all the way down all right that&#x27;s roughly what we&#x27;re looking at a little bit um we could do 400 let&#x27;s put it 400. okay probably need some more smoke going on oh we also said we&#x27;re gonna move the smoke in a little bit yeah okay now it&#x27;s ready to run okay so I&#x27;m going to move the smoke in a little bit okay uh and when I&#x27;m ready you just click that for auto trigger okay but guys this is what real science looks like sometimes you gotta like the smoke oh we&#x27;re running out of uh our Hanukkah candles are going down now screw this I&#x27;m gonna get the torch out where&#x27;d that torch go oh here it is cooking there we got some serious smoke going on right now inside ah we got particulates in the smoke this time the fire particulous in the uh fire zone this would be kind of interesting okay change the cap change the air view so what that&#x27;s Shining uh you guys can totally increase the frames per second here uh increase that to four thousand okay perfect let&#x27;s leave it like that okay you&#x27;re ready to uh yeah turn that on okay oh it&#x27;ll already trigger stop it important abort abort recording no um one second yeah take it back to four thousand okay you know what you could go to 10 000 actually perfect okay so now um [Music] may want to send the uh sensitivity down a little bit so it doesn&#x27;t trigger right away are you ready set it down to like seven percent okay area area okay okay here we&#x27;re going up this is ready to trigger the problem uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not saying it&#x27;s very pleasant oh it&#x27;s already sugared it&#x27;s not saying it&#x27;s ready to trigger that&#x27;s because you have to push your capture oh oh okay no but okay there we go that those are the ones all right this is sign two oh this is a 30 000 frame though just leave it just leave 30. just leave it the way it is right now don&#x27;t touch it or at 25 000. foreign [Music] [Music] it&#x27;s blowing away ions there you can see that it&#x27;s charged [Music] it&#x27;s gonna fire any second foreign keep it going don&#x27;t don&#x27;t touch it I&#x27;m going to trigger it again okay okay shutting it down okay you can click abort uh recording I&#x27;m gonna come over there let&#x27;s have a look two and three two and three yeah so what they look like comparative you guys can help yourself to more uh okay finally it&#x27;s usually after oh yeah oh whoa we got we got a spark there at the bottom before wow go back go back look at that there&#x27;s actually a spark before the for the main one there&#x27;s a glow okay go wow it&#x27;s like on fire on the bottom there they continue damn it looks like a tornado okay continue you can see the smoke still whoa look there&#x27;s like vortices within vortices there it&#x27;s like a tornado that&#x27;s swirled in on itself this is crazy Aiden yeah operating fields it&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve been asking for yeah I know that&#x27;s uh you know Jared and I were talking about in this soliton magnon oh whatever the it is we just made it oh man okay cool it looks cool hey I&#x27;ve been up since some cows well there&#x27;s even a light up there&#x27;s like a a gold and blue light up on top there oh that&#x27;s from inside the marks Bank look at those swirls just come in on each other that is really cool I would love to get a better resolution shot of that you have to move the camera up closer to possibly you know lose the image because that let&#x27;s see signed three let&#x27;s see what that caught oh wow oh there you go something at the top and the bottom yeah back it up a couple friends somewhere um oh I mean so you&#x27;re getting a pulse of I can see it at the top and the bottom of the line at the same time and the plate it says there&#x27;s something reflecting right in there there&#x27;s a couple SEC milliseconds that you get a you get to see the double the the chlorides at the top and bottom of the column there is a thin wire between the plates and the or is that just transmitting straight down that is falling along the wire s and they&#x27;re a little bit earlier it&#x27;s there there for a second very faint starting there you go top and bottom there you go stop stop definitely down by the bottom of the plate but you can see The Eccentric Rings along the from along the wire and then up at top as well and then it seems like disturbance is causing it pack it a wave packet it almost seems like that uh disturbance is detached from the wires themselves the wire ends here but that disturbance is like I don&#x27;t know eighth of an inch out and that&#x27;s on both sides that&#x27;s the external feel that&#x27;s the Rings right that&#x27;s where they sh that&#x27;s why they draw it in the physics books like here are the rings outside of the or the charge is moving and then you get the dielectric breakdown and the light somewhere in there should be the voltage potential is tapping into the background energy the zero point field just a random thought Mark I wonder if you took your microwave generator and you shot some microwaves at this thing at different frequencies when it Sparks like that which you might get any different results and you know what you&#x27;re welcome to come down here we even have like special guards to protect you from the radiation I would love a trip you could do the day shift okay keep a notepad of all the frequencies you tried right inspiring it Non-Stop how many um elements do you have in the marks generator um so me and Jeremiah built this back in 2020 when he was here um so basically the 30kv Caps um in uh in uh parallel and then I think there&#x27;s like 30 years so 30 something uh stages so it&#x27;s 30 000 times 30 would be around 900 000. well I&#x27;m I&#x27;m getting to like 35 now before it fires so it&#x27;s definitely at a mega Volt there everyone&#x27;s firing I think it&#x27;s about 30 stages it might be more seven feet tall very tall yeah where is Jeremiah we invited him to the uh to the Stream Bernie are you still there uh he said he had to check out and give his girlfriend a ride home so anyways what do you guys think of this Space Case over here Space Case would you like to join the uh I&#x27;d like to join the call I&#x27;m just going to open this up and allow everyone in see what we can bring on um I&#x27;m still learning how to use this thing more smoke everywhere bigger smoke machine can we get a like one of those little fog machines and do it sideways and see if anything comes out the side of the plates and we got to try to shape the plates and then get that circular array Beef It Up there&#x27;s enough copper and machining in the shop that should be able to make a decent replica of the segmented bottom array you know the it has to be like 16 plates for 32 plates you know and then you&#x27;re they&#x27;re biased so you can make all 32 plates the same way but when they stack them in they&#x27;ve got to be like like the poly Exclusion Principle so the biasing is up down up down up down you know whatever the biasing is in it like I&#x27;ve read in the early stuff um you know it&#x27;s the main it was uh putting dimples and in the copper plates and then you like get quarter inch thick plates and then um they have very weak capacitance but something about uh the dimpling in it uh is important so Aiden is that your next project you want to do you want to make it some dimple plate capacitors we need to order very thick yeah thick copper plate I guess we can start with something like eighth inch I have a lot of copper plate here that&#x27;s like 16th of an inch do you think that you can do it with that problem technically plate is over a certain thickness under that it&#x27;s either a um leaf or a sheet yeah speaking speaking on the dimpling though um I just got my textured rotors in for the gravel flyer thing and I was testing the difference between smooth and dimpled or textured uh capacitances um I had a smooth plate on bottom with a small dielectric separator and then either smooth or textured on top and unfortunately I can&#x27;t replicate um Alexi&#x27;s difference in capacitance between smooth and dimples he showed um texturing double the fastness but I&#x27;m saying the exact same capacitance between um both so I have to imagine that there&#x27;s a certain amount of surface area change that is required to actually get it Jeremiah mentions doing some acid etching um with an angle he was looking at doing and I think that&#x27;d probably be a heck of a lot better because now you&#x27;re getting you know molecular size dimples uh let me tell you this about acid ashing do it outside with a mask don&#x27;t rely on your during the summer you&#x27;re going to want like full out environmental masks or take it outside so yeah yeah that&#x27;s what we did that&#x27;s what we ended up doing at least there&#x27;s a technique used by chocolatiers of all people where uh they can make images on chocolate by having a textured material that they then pour the chocolate onto and when they de-mold it transfers you could potentially do the same thing I&#x27;m good any arbitrary texture you want that has to be some very fine like spikes or something that you pour it onto yeah I don&#x27;t know about uh doing molten copper like that it&#x27;s pretty uh that&#x27;s pretty tough um we might be able to machine some dimples out of a sheet um are Aiden are you talking about dimples as in what you have on a uh golf ball yeah stippling is what that&#x27;s called I think the right the the reference that McCandless was drawing to or from was early magnetic patterning patterning um I don&#x27;t know is that time we could probably just take a uh a rounded End Mill and go straight into the uh 16 pitch copper just over and over again all right do you have a laser engraver no we don&#x27;t have one of those again another tool I&#x27;ve been saying we need that I&#x27;d like to what is it a CO2 laser yeah or a fiber fiber laser and then you&#x27;d be able to do you can get hybrids that have both then you can cut basically anything or get down to molecular we just got to figure out how to make beetles grow copper Wings what about the plasma sputtering um that&#x27;ll get you something like pyrolytic carbon it&#x27;ll be actually that might be something that that is a way um so we do like some sort of plasma sputtering on the on the thick copper sheets I mean the the capacitors we we all know it&#x27;s a skin effect that&#x27;s going through the layers in the capacitors so I don&#x27;t know I mean combine it with um that&#x27;s the whole magnon thing like can we get a full body Resonance of the stack and then you&#x27;re passing the voltage through it um an acoustic resonance as well as a electric field electric resonance or it&#x27;s ringing because I&#x27;m pretty sure you can apply like the copper directly to whatever textured material um using the technique in the video I posted a link to in the private chat um I I think that&#x27;s probably your best bet for really thin layers I&#x27;ll Mr thought Emporium oh this guy&#x27;s and yeah Simon are you on the Apec channels as well the what&#x27;s up groups and all that I&#x27;m on the Discord I haven&#x27;t really done it I&#x27;ll send a link Mr Ventura any TV did you who is on that Discord okay uh it&#x27;s not Super Active from what I see the WhatsApp group is extremely active uh mostly Phil Bouchard these days mostly it&#x27;s Phil Bouchard and his finite Theory do you see the AI um story that we made about filter charts finite Theory no I know so so there&#x27;s this new uh program that uh aigpd or something that allows you to make stories and stuff and we asked to make a story about the Phil Bouchard and his finite Theory and it just it gives continued rambling on and on and on about uh Phil Bouchard and how they made such a contribution to science and blah blah blah and and then he died at the age of 93.</p>
<p>and then uh a movie was made in his honor and then a friend of mine uh who also had the same program he picked up the story at that point and so and talked about the uh the movie that the Hollywood um Hollywood got involved and they made a movie about uh Phil Bouchard in his life and then there was a sex scandal in the movie and how it changed Hollywood it just went on and on landline it was hilarious oh by the way we love you Phil just so you know the description in this video that you guys are on right now was generated by AI I basically just gave it all the parameters of what we were doing and it spat out a description oh here it is Simon sent us a link to the Discord what the hell do we have a Discord guys I&#x27;m gonna copy this so what exactly happens in this Discord like it&#x27;s nice just got it oh it ties into like video gaming stuff doesn&#x27;t it or oh initially but uh no you can use it for basically any subject um but yeah it is very good for like embedding stuff uh it is an apex if somebody&#x27;s using the logo okay I think it was started a while though but uh Space Case claims that he&#x27;s uh hear his uh their server is compatible with this phone WhatsApp is uh Facebook isn&#x27;t it it&#x27;s owned by Facebook now yes we got 11 viewers who&#x27;s viewing and isn&#x27;t smacking a like on this come on guys let&#x27;s get like share subscribe um oh wow we were pulsing it this is a megavolt marks Bank pulsing [Music] you should scroll back a little bit we uh fired this thing quite a few times I&#x27;m gonna I&#x27;m gonna show off my screen for a second here and show you guys exactly what we saw so there this is a million volt with the light we got quite a few different uh shots of this thing this one was actually pretty interesting because look at this before it fires there&#x27;s already a spark that spark is towards the center so how in the world would this happen you see there&#x27;s a little bit of a glow over here okay now that that that&#x27;s continuous that that&#x27;s an artifact the glow in the center there is an artifact but moving along the frames there&#x27;s a spark inside the capacitor I think I see one on top as well yeah there&#x27;s a spark inside the capacitor before the marks Bank triggers which means I believe correct me if I&#x27;m wrong if you think I&#x27;m wrong there was some capacitance being stored some power being stored inside this capacitor plate and the potential voltage on its plate um played a part in the triggering alternate hypothesis you were saying you were saying that the glows that we see on the back side were because the charge is going around the thing I wonder if you inspect which like just your eyes closely that part of the device if you can see if any of the epoxy has kind of deteriorated and maybe it was um allowing arcing between the actual metal well the question is why is that over here you see it on the bottom left there discharged because it&#x27;s already shooting out electrons and the charge is collecting on the sharp spot but you&#x27;re right we should probably see like a little glow on the tip of the uh high voltage electrode at the same time we should see the tip on the globe electrodes first if anything we should not be seeing it here before we see it on the tips of the electrodes is the thickness of the plates uh thicker or thinner than the width of the electrode uh thicker oh then yeah definitely yeah and look in the second image you can see the spark where that Sparks started is actually a lot stronger it kind of looks like a penis it does look and funnily enough in sign three over here so there is a light in that same general spot but we don&#x27;t see this is this is afterwards we don&#x27;t see that pre-shot in that area now we can go to we have some signs that were already saved so let&#x27;s open those up oops I wonder if that pre-arc was occurring on the opposite Edge at the same time that would be that would be interesting for now I was thinking of um raising the speed and so that you&#x27;d get less like per frame but you get more images overall and putting a a mirror on the back side with a convex like a focusing lens yeah so we can get more light in and then we could have to bring the camera perfect distance of being Focus really cool now now I saw the previous images we saw over here um oh what was this safe guys okay so anyways this this is what we got out of those images and the previous ones were played earlier but over here you can see there&#x27;s a sort of a Taurus it&#x27;s like two um tornadoes Twisted in on each other any idea what&#x27;s doing that Jared you know I like the only thing I can think of is like what Amy was saying how you have you know curl you have you have your right hand rule going on so as that thing&#x27;s working you&#x27;ve got a lot of current so a lot of magnetic field and it&#x27;s charged up all smoke particulates so now they&#x27;re orbiting around it the cool part though is the coolest part is where you have like the Hat Oak coming off each one and and that&#x27;s where you can really see the the effect of that uh magnetic curling okay the pasture plates are in a foil alloy bonded and molten bismuth oh sweet we can make that here so include Herkimer diamond a left-handed spin version of quartz capacity clothes put more diamond is just quartz with uh imperfections quartz is useful since it demonstrates um pyrepringence you think that means that you&#x27;re getting uh two different speeds for your your waves your light going through it which that you&#x27;re getting really close to to um one of those having a negative pointing Vector with relation to the other or would be a good spot to get Quartz the ground doesn&#x27;t no I mean as in sheets of it so we can make this ah oh then your best bet is actually growing it um so buying it from the people who make it for like watches and computers and stuff but then I guess I wouldn&#x27;t be Herkimer uh Herkimer is basically when it&#x27;s like um two pyramids one upside down like Base to Base right um I heard that Herkimer is just dirty quartz it has I believe uh carbon inclusions watching that Tom ev&#x27;s Pursuit spark David are you talking about evos double terminated crystal that&#x27;s the term double terminated Crystal [Music] yeah McCandless went off about that quite a bit right what what does it matter we know better it&#x27;s you&#x27;ve gonna laminate it between these it&#x27;s the Miller index it&#x27;s not this double laminated stuff the Miller index of the lattice and how you polish the Crystal and how it&#x27;s oriented between the sheets that may or may not give you a greater dielectric capacity so the plates can hold more charge uh yeah that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re like went down into barium titanate and calcium copper titanate all the stuff that Jeremiah was trying to bring into the lab last year it just it has to be polarized and then you have to grind it and it&#x27;s a like that stuff gets stupid expensive because you&#x27;re trying not to fracture the ceramic as has been oriented or cured and oriented correct can you um could you just make quartz into a uh an electric just regular chords supposedly that&#x27;s yeah I mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s optically clear because that way it transmits the electric or the photonic field as well as the electric field but that&#x27;s just Word of Mouth from on the late and great McCann Bush again uh so yeah you can but it has to be optically clear yeah so you&#x27;re gonna have to buy like a mono Crystal or a slice of one basically oh the Russians were playing around with stuff they were growing huge freaking quartz crystals and then some reactor back in the 80s I guess or um it&#x27;s online there was some weirdo some super perverted guy that was had like had it on a an obscure YouTube channel but the tubes got any good chemists that knows how to grow crystals and you just make very large bats and control the temperature and then you put in a little string you know you&#x27;re the Cedar uh it&#x27;s really turn the camera on I should get a film anyway a large bat and then you run a string down and you have a seed crystal in the middle that&#x27;s very clear remember that is you know these things were they&#x27;re pulling out crystals that are like literally this big yeah and like a foot in diameter is ridiculous yeah somewhere deep in Soviet Russia it&#x27;s more in the 80s I think South Korea produces a lot of uh courts as well right I mean so they&#x27;ve gotten into um the radiation hardening for cubesats or Mill sets I&#x27;m actually reading an article that says that a quartz is a naturally occurring Electric so he specifically said left-handed courts which is only one percent of the ports out there chirality of what you mean by left-handed so quartz comes in two flavors right-handed or left-handed but it looks like it naturally only happens about one percent of the time so we know from the metamaterial books where do we get uh left-handed courts from I&#x27;m looking for some I&#x27;m not finding I found okay here I&#x27;ll put one in the link you can get a 40 millimeter wide bits for 460 bucks it&#x27;s it&#x27;s expensive because it&#x27;s rare but if it&#x27;s left-handed that means that it&#x27;s actually got negative refraction going on which that&#x27;s the secret sauce and everything yep all right so quartz is a naturally occurring Electric hmm I guess you can easily make an electrod out of quartz there was supposedly a UFO built a long long time ago that was built using ports we actually made a couple electrics here this isn&#x27;t interesting you were using the waxes though right yeah we were doing the wax method so if we being electrod out of Courts I&#x27;m just thinking of how to do that temperatures where you probably have to go to um the glass making factory bring our high voltage power supply over and uh charge up two plates Place molten salt in between them and allow them to cool inside the field unless you grow the crystal inside the field from like uh like in the same way that you grew up quartz crystal yeah yeah I mean that&#x27;s what Jeremiah was talking about with polarization um I was supposed to pour some bismuth or some of these resins between polarized plates it&#x27;s had like some wax or silicon on the top and bottom hope that they you know if it&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re playing around with Dynamic nuclear orientation like an applied electrostatic field to get a polarization potential well I guess from a practical standpoint in order to make a decent electorate out of uh quartz we need to work with a glass company there is one nearby that I was thinking about reaching out to morning morning resolver defense Contracting what warning glass they make yeah I was there they&#x27;re pretty far away but there&#x27;s a place of Closer by about a half an hour from here they do they make they have like ceramic body armor plates I I was there I actually went there uh last last summer okay this past summer I was at Corning it&#x27;s pretty pretty cool we saw a demonstration but there&#x27;s a place closer by they&#x27;re about a four hour drive there&#x27;s a place about a half hour from here that does uh the business structure and then the security clearance hey Jared you want to jump ship you got a security clearance don&#x27;t you no it just lapsed last year oh you&#x27;re well I know I&#x27;m on clearance jobs all the time or it used to be because you get six figure gigs left right if you got even a secret get on the other side of the fence uh just so you know it looks like uh for the the left-handed courts um the the direction that it gets cut really matters um if you want to pass a beam through it it needs to be cut in the z-axis versus if you&#x27;re gonna pass through and John it&#x27;s going to cut X or Y hmm if you need a slice that&#x27;s perpendicular to what every other industry wants then you&#x27;re going to be screwed some Optics places use these left-handed ports z-cut um discs plates [Music] why why do they only cut it on the Z uh because it maintains the polarization right so if if you have it cut this way and it&#x27;s a left-handed material your polarization isn&#x27;t going to be constant throughout but if you use it like this what your polarization is going to be all jacked up if it&#x27;s not cut on the proper axis yeah a fractal Thing Mark and like start rotating it around it&#x27;s called the Miller index it&#x27;s like zero zero zero zero one one it&#x27;s either zeros or ones and it tells you which way the points of the lattice are oriented in x y and z it&#x27;s either it&#x27;s on or off and so these some of these crystals like a highly of a really nice variant titanate has this like fishbone pattern in it along a certain direction and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re using in order to get it to be a better dielectric material because a lot of the stuff that we&#x27;ve tucked around with in the lab has been chaotically oriented so it is they get down to like it&#x27;s a thousand dollars first for a square centimeter that&#x27;s some of the highly fancy stuff a couple hundred bucks per square centimeter for the stuff that&#x27;s ground correctly it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s we&#x27;ve got to get into like Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs where we are on the pyramid or that stuff is some of it&#x27;s yeah you know if you need a visual if you have a pyramid stacked butt up to another pyramid right you want to be able to have your light Ray go from the bottom point to the pyramid up through the top but if it&#x27;s cut wrong you&#x27;re going to be going through in between where the pyramids are and so you&#x27;re not going to be getting that that twist that each pyramid gives it right you&#x27;re you&#x27;re going to be snaking between them so if you want to make sure they&#x27;re all cut in the same direction so that every light beam is going through every single one of these vertically stacked pyramids it might be a different orientation but but the gist is there it&#x27;s the because we&#x27;re not dealing with you know circles we&#x27;re dealing with like polygons the direction of cut matters and then it resembles the uh the wings on those beetles with all the little pointy bits sticking out yep there we go we&#x27;re back to the Beatles Simon and Jared were kicking the same topology slightly different materials but so RF simulation of the atmosphere and I guess the microstructure on the Beetle wings is interacting with the electric potential with the oxygen and hydrogen whereas the crystals are dealing with phonons electric spark hits the anode and it keeps traveling through it okay so here&#x27;s a question for everyone who just joined check this out the results right next to me are showing something pretty anomalous you see that spark over there on the left bottom left bottom there&#x27;s a tiny little spark this is the next image moving forward in time now why in the world with this Marx thing before the uh before it even fired a spark is forming on the capacitor previous image it&#x27;s gone one image forward there is a spark there before the March being fires how is that possible and why is it there maybe it&#x27;s the rise time maybe maybe you have like at the base of the rise there&#x27;s enough juice that&#x27;s already come out that for whatever reason that spot wants to Arc but then once the marks actually fires or far enough up your eyes time that the big chunk of electrons are all now shooting down into it and so now you get the actual firing but oh sorry go ahead I&#x27;m I&#x27;m done okay I was going to say that uh it could also be smoke particles that are being ignited by it if anyone wants to join I just posted the stream yard link again I don&#x27;t see that how could it be igniting like what in the world is igniting over there this is the spark before the marks Bank fires the next firing some of it&#x27;s going to be unburnt right some of the smoke no I mean that&#x27;s the the impulse coming through and that&#x27;s the start of the dielectric breakdown mark but why is there a dielectric breakdown there before the Mark&#x27;s been fired I understand that there&#x27;ll be Mark there will be dielectric breakdowns but they&#x27;re all over the place and you see them everywhere and they&#x27;re still very in the next image but why would it happen before it gets hit so the color if you look at the color of the two sides of the arc there one is bright white violet and the other is dark red uh and one of your other shots um we can see that the anode is like bright blue and the cathode of the plate is that darker red herbicum inverted thing and backwards but either way yeah that one so you can see that the the top of the plate gets bright white and the high voltage lead is like red it looks like that&#x27;s inverted from that like it&#x27;s drawing all of the electrons to one side from the other is it attached to ground in any way and there&#x27;s there&#x27;s the ground is on the left in this image so are we starting to have uh like in lightning you have upward streamers from ground and then the downward streamers from um in this case we&#x27;ve seen with the super high speed images we&#x27;ve seen the exact same thing they&#x27;re coming from both directions but in this image this image in particular we&#x27;re not seeing any discharge coming from the uh from the marks thing we&#x27;re not seeing any spark coming out of the capacitor yet there is a spark between plates of the capacitor how is that possible why is it doing that it&#x27;s for the dielectric the field starts to break down it&#x27;s yes we know that but why is it breaking down over there before it&#x27;s breaking down over there why is it why is it breaking down between the capacitor plates before it breaks down and gets uh fired wait wait go back one friend right there all right so at the very top of the disk on the marks generator watch that as you go forward one frame yep I see that so there is charge moving through the marks generator at that same exact moment that we see that breakdown it&#x27;s not the full charge but it&#x27;s some of the charge ah okay that&#x27;s a good point yep good catch Jared so there is some charge it&#x27;s starting to spray electrons out the spray of electrons was enough to make the capacitor plate ah I see a potential problem now with the experiment so we&#x27;re impulsing this experiment and we don&#x27;t realize is that before it even arcs over the capacitor is already fully charged that&#x27;s what that tells us because if it was able to start arcing over when the marks Bank hadn&#x27;t even fully charged uh fully sparked yet there&#x27;s probably a static flyover from the tip at 30 KV that&#x27;s enough to charge up all those plates or or it&#x27;s just charging up the smoke in between that&#x27;s no good yeah it could be it&#x27;s the smoke that&#x27;s uh transferring charge or it could be telling us that the charge plate is all the uh the high voltage end of that capacitor play is already been charged in which case we probably need to attach um some sort of uh some sort of way to discharge that support fires vacuum hey pinky pinky come here guys I had a pinky Pinky I think he wants to play ball let me come here you go all right Mark this has been an awesome night thanks for sharing your experiment no not a problem got any recommendations for uh thank you for the next uh iteration yeah I get that that thing I left there a couple years ago that&#x27;s like pretty simple it&#x27;s in my box it&#x27;s a bunch of copper plates maybe make some of them bigger and smaller and try the uh 37 degree angle on them I&#x27;ve cut some more out because there&#x27;s a bunch of copper sheet how do you make them bigger or smaller are you the cad file I I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ll send you the email to effin CAD file and scale it or I get off my button because there&#x27;s there&#x27;s got to be a 37 degree angle on the edge right 37 35 Point something I don&#x27;t know what the hell you&#x27;re talking about but okay the edge of the the arv the side oh you know I actually have a pet a uh T um a Teflon disc with that angle on it is that important for the capacitor plates apparently as it kind of ties into like the shape of the the field and uh I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s a good argument on the slopes of the pyramid between like the Russian pyramids and the Egyptian ones and like how they&#x27;re shaking when you get some quartz for next time we&#x27;ll get some quartz uh quartz glass rounded and we&#x27;ll just have larger plates going into smaller plates you know cone shape cone-shaped parallel plate capacitor but I don&#x27;t know Jared&#x27;s telling us that we need uh materials Mark get the effing book out and it just has to do with refracting the wave a little bit frequency selective surfaces and the diff that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been going in with that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re with the antenna Theory unlike the instead of the the split ring you have the S resonators and then you just line them up so you have the figure eights so you start reflect reflecting the wave uh backwards through the material like the phone as the photons turn into it I might have built something like that he built a bunch of effing things and coils and coils and more coils and yeah there was some sort of like figure eight coil thing yeah it&#x27;s uh resonator instead of a split ring an S ring resonator because two of them you know in in layers creates a figure eight so it&#x27;s an S ring does create a ring so um and then with the left-handed materials it&#x27;s what like Moon negative there&#x27;s the they get double positive double negative uh Epsilon negative and moon negative and so the stuff like copper is single negative reflectance refactoring the single negative and dual negative so yeah copper is usually upper right quadrant so it&#x27;s single negative refractive reflection and refractive or playing around on my the tip of my tongue so anyway I is the crowd I think I&#x27;m gonna punch out too it&#x27;s like nine o&#x27;clock for me and I need to get some sleep or go make some coffee or something um jatine and Tom or you&#x27;re still there if you got PCS at home look into that octave software that&#x27;s the Matlab open source Matlab and um check out the that YouTube video that I posted because that&#x27;s it is the Matlab coding environment and it gets to be very useful for punching in equations and then coming up with you can make it eventually compile and to see and then upload that into your microcontroller so we can get at some of these uh pulse waves and stuff mathematically uh anyway and that&#x27;s I&#x27;m jumping in balls to the wall in that one but I&#x27;ve so if you guys could do that that would be very helpful all right um it&#x27;s just a continuation of what you were doing with like learning the uh pololo yep yep so and it&#x27;s start very basic but uh octave you can you know octave and then play around with it and then probably this is business some of this needs to be talked about during Thursday&#x27;s meeting but sir yes sir good sirs please kind sirs don&#x27;t download that octave stuff and watch that YouTube stuff sir yes sir thank you very much have a good night man all right I&#x27;m punching out Mark I think I&#x27;m gonna punch you out as well I think it&#x27;s just uh I think we&#x27;re done here for tonight guys 12 people that signed in thank you for joining us on the second night of Hanukkah for our experiments and uh hope you guys enjoyed it it&#x27;s 11 10 right now and we need to clean up this shop smells real good like Sage Bart butcher just says what do you know if you put a piece of a woman between charge capacitor plates would that align Electro and nuclear Bart butcher do you want to come over to New Jersey and find out you can put it on there yourself pinky says yes pinky wants to try it g&#x27;day guys live long and price thanks guys peace Thomas and broadcast</p>
