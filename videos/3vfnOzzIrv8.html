            <p>hello everybody Welcome to the law of one session 20 this one is about the Harvest Dewey Lawson on his work around physics as well as why our lifespan has been reduced so significantly and the nzar lines so starting with the questioner like a pet graduating from second to third density can you give me an example of an entity in third density that was just previously a second density entity what type of entity do they become here and then raah as a second density entity returns as third density human for the beginning of this process of learning The Entity is equipped with the lowest forms of third density Consciousness that is equipped with self-consciousness the questioner speaking of the rapid change that occurred in the physical vehicle the change from second to third density um this you said occurred in appr approximately a generation and a half body hair was lost and there was structural changes I am aware of the physics of Dewey B lson who states that all is motion or vibration am I correct in assuming that the basic vibration which makes up the physical world as we experience it changes thus creating a different set of parameters in the short period of time between density changes allowing for the new type of vehicle am I correct and then raw correct questioner just as a side question here is the physics of dwe Len correct ra the physics of sound vibrational complex D Lon we could actually just the physics of dwey Lon is the correct system as far as it is able to go there are those things which are not included in the system however those coming after this particular entity using the basic concepts of vibration and the study of vibrational distortions will begin to understand that which you know of as gravity and those things you consider as n Dimensions I&#x27;m not sure what they mean by that these things are necessary to be included in a more Universal uh physical Theory questioner did Dewey lson bring this material through in his Incarnation for use primarily in fourth density ra correct questioner thank you yesterday we were speaking of the split that takes place in third density when an entity either consciously or because of bias chooses the path of service to others or service to self the Phil the philosophical question of why such a split even exists came up it is my impression that it is that as it is in electricity if we have no polarity in electricity we have no electricity we have no action therefore I&#x27;m assuming that in Consciousness without such polarity there would be no action or experience is this correct and then ra correct you may term this um or you may use a general term work the questioner then the concept of service to self or service to others is mandatory if we wish to have work whether it be work in Consciousness or work in the mechanical or Newtonian Concept in the physical is this correct and then raw this is correct with one addendum the coil as you may understand this term is wound is potential is ready the thing that is missing without polarity is the charge the questioner then the charge is provided by individual individualized Consciousness is this correct raw the charge is provided by The individualized Entity using the inp pourings and inst streamings of energy by the choices of Free Will so using being the operative word whatever experience is coming in I just listened to a video by Aaron ABY today about his perceptions or his understanding or breaking down of this work and um I haven&#x27;t listened to any of his stuff in a long time but this one video popped up today and I thought oh this looks fascinating it&#x27;s on the importance of working on the lower three chakras um and he mentions that raah talks about Catalyst and using Catalyst to bring balance to to the physical body that without the Catalyst there is there is no movement and so the Catalyst which is any experience is needed in order to um to become harvestable in order to work through whatever knots or whatever perceptions are happening in the lower chakras or imbalances or distortions in the lower chakras in order to come up into a higher chakra or a higher um he doesn&#x27;t use the word chakra he says Ray um so I guess this would be similar to to that concept using the inp pourings and inst streamings of energy by free will the questioner thank you as soon as the third density started 75,000 years ago and we have incarnated third density entities what was the average human lifespan at that time raw at the beginning of this particular portion of your SpaceTime Continuum the average lifetime was approximately 900 of your years the questioner did the average lifespan grow longer or shorter as we progressed into third density experience ra this is a particular use uh there is a particular use for the span of life in this density and given the harmonious development of the learning teachings of this density the lifespan of the physical complex the human being physical body would remain the same throughout the cycle however your particular Planet developed vibrations of the second major or by the second major cycle which shortened the lifespan dramatically and then the questioner assuming a major cycle is 25,000 years at the end of the first 25,000 year cycle how long was the lifespan raw the lifespan at the end of that period was approximately 700 of your years the questioner then in 25,000 years we lost 200 years of lifespan is this correct raw correct questioner can you tell me the reason for the shortening of lifespan raw the causes of the shortening are always an inharmonious relational vibration between other selves we got to be peaceful to live longer guys in this in the first cycle this was not severe due to the disp uh dispersion of peoples but there was the growing feeling towards separateness from other selves the questioner I&#x27;m assuming at the start of one of these Cycles there could have been either a positive polarization that would generally occur over the 25,000 years or a negative polarization is the reason for the negative polarization and the shortening of the cycle the influx of entities from Mars who had already polarized somewhat negatively ra this is incorrect there was not a strong negative polarization due to this influx the lessening of the lifespan was due primarily to the lack of the building up of positive orientation when there is no progress those conditions which Grant progress are gradually lost so if you don&#x27;t use it you lose it this is one of the difficulties of remaining [Music] unpolarized the chances shall we say of progress become steadily less you know there is so much confusion you know when I when I think about my own experience um in my 35 years how much I have learned you know even you know I&#x27;ve been exploring metaphysics for about 10 years like consciously exploring it but I&#x27;ve only been on the spiritually more awakened path for five or six years now and even with all the information that helps to reduce the confusion or the distortions that were previously there there are new distortions and confusions and so um though I I certainly know that I am on a path to serve others that that choice is not um there&#x27;s no confusion around that choice where the confusion lies is in the attachment to The Limited self and the needs of that limited self and the attachment to the identification with that limited self um I think you know if you if you are on a similar path you know exactly what I mean is as you are exploring your spiritual self and human things happen and discomforts and catalysts as ra calls them um and you feel the discomfort or the disease or the fear or the pain or the attachment or the need to control your experience um it creates this confusion which ultimately slows down the process of polarizing or of [Music] um yeah let&#x27;s say polarizing of polarizing even further along the path of self of service to others not self-service so yeah I think I don&#x27;t remember what my point was about that but um when there is no progress those conditions which gr progress are gradually lost and this is one of the difficulties of remaining unpolarized the chances shall we say of progress become uh steadily less ah my point was in the confusion of becoming attached to the limited self making use of the conditions that are being presented in order to polarize even more along the path of service to others um sometimes we get stuck sometimes we get stuck in in that uh attachment to the Limit itself and in getting stuck on a specific um task or area of learning and looping and looping and recycling The Experience basically there cannot be new experiences to come in to help level up because we don&#x27;t have the capacity to see them we&#x27;re stuck in one lesson if that makes sense and so the chances to polarize just slow down that was a very long-winded um point but I&#x27;m going to leave it there if you have some thoughts you&#x27;re welcome to share them in the comments the questioner the way I understand it at the beginning of the 75,000 year cycle we have a mixture of entities those who have graduated from second density on Earth to become third density and then a group of entities transferred from Mars to Incarnate into their density here is that correct ra this is correct you must remember that those transferred uh to this planet were in the middle of their of their third density so this third density was an adaptation rather than a beginning in other words those that came from Mars were not starting like the ones on Earth they were beginning um on into or coming into third density whereas Mars was already in the middle of their of their process questioner thank you what percentage of the entities roughly who were in their density here at the time were Martian and what percentage were harvested out of of Earth second density ra there were perhaps 1 half of the third density population being entities from Mars so a half half of the population from Mars and a quarter about a quarter from second density on our planet that graduated into third density and then approximately another quarter from other sources or other planets who decided to come here for their third density work the questioner when they incarnated here did they mix did all three of these types mix together in Societies or groups or were they separated by group or Society ra they remained largely unmixed questioner then did this unmixing lend to a possibility of separation of group um or the possibility of warlike attitude between groups ra this is correct questioner did this then help to reduce the lifespan raw this did reduce the lifespan as you call it questioner can you tell me why 900 years is the optimum lifespan raw the Mind Body Spirit complex of the the human of third density has about a 100 times um more intense opportunities for learning from experiences compared to other densities this is nuts guys I mean imagine coming out of this third density experience having especially because of the information we have access to now we don&#x27;t need to take that long to learn the lessons that we would be Recycling and Recycling and recycling we can use that information to accelerate our growth which he&#x27;s about to mention in the next point but the opportunities for for launching ourselves even further along [Music] um or higher in or into higher densities or higher um experiences of that density in other words when we are harvested into fourth density we do not come into fourth density at the lowest part of that fourth density we come in at a much higher a much higher state or I I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible to go forth from third to fifth density I think it is the way that Raz explained it it seems that if you gain access to intelligent Infinity you can basically go anywhere but um just having access to the information and the practices that you know that was so largely hidden for a long time and that we didn&#x27;t have available to us um using all the experiences and the opportunities for learning in their density such a great opportunity to launch ourselves forward on the spiritual path he goes on to say this makes the lessons in third density very confusing due to the overwhelming amount of experiences so well done to everybody here during the first 150 to 200 years as we measure time a Body Spirit complex goes through a spiritual childhood 200 years of childhood guys during this period the mind and body are not yet disciplined enough to clearly receive spiritual insights the remaining lifespan is then dedicated to making the most of the understandings that come from these experiences I guess this would be applicable mostly to third density um beings in terms of their Consciousness Consciousness not in terms of the vehicle that we are in because um wonders or light workers coming from higher densities and incarnating into third density vehicles um have access to you know aside from the information available to us to help us also have access to insights and inner wisdom that may be third density Consciousness being do not yet have access to unless they are dedicated to their path and their practices which would also launch them ahead um but yeah 150 to 200 years in spiritual childhood I mean it would be pretty impressive to watch a third density Consciousness being in a third density vehicle launch itself in a lifetime of 70 to 80 years into sixth density Consciousness or even fourth density Consciousness fifth density Consciousness it&#x27;s a pretty fascinating thing to contemplate the questioner then at this present then at present it would seem that our lifespan is much too short for those who are new to the density lessons is this correct raw this is correct those densities which have in some way learned or taught themselves the appropriate distortions for rapid growth there we go can now work within the confines of the shorter lifespan however the greater preponderance of your entities find themselves in what may be considered a Perpetual childhood and I have a note there to self a nice big F word it&#x27;s a really tough thing you know a Perpetual childhood and then you come into the next Lifetime and you have to start again without your memories and the things that you&#x27;ve learned from the previous lifetime and basically try to no wonder it takes so many lifetimes 25,000 to 75,000 years for souls to be ready for Harvest is the constant repeating of things because of the this incredibly short time that we have to learn thank goodness for the time that we are here in at the moment with all of the information we have access to especially you know our wanders and our light workers and our our um spiritual teachers Etc that are here to help Elevate the consciousness of the planet but without their memories you know that also get stuck in the same repeating patterns or Cycles Consciousness experiences as um third density beings who are still very young in their experience well done well done to all of us the questioner thank you now back in the first 25,000 year period or major cycle what type of Aid was given by the Confederation to the entities who were in this 25,000 year period so that they could have the opportunity to grow ra members of the Confederation residing in the inner Plains of Earth&#x27;s Vib vibratory densities assisted these entities additionally a confederation member helped those from Mars transision however most of the involvement was limited to ensure the confusion mechanism would operate fully allowing planetary entities to develop freely within their own thought processes typically a third density planetary cycle proceeds without external or other self- Aid in the form of information instead the entities work towards appropriate polarizations and third density learning goals on their own you know I have to say when I was you know first awakened to the spiritual path and I started to to read and learn from from older texts like yoga was one of the first areas well the law of one but um yoga was one of the first areas that I studied um but even in my studying I had no attachment to to this material because I recognized that it is coming through um other lenses you know that could also be distorted and that ultimately what you want is to use these texts and these teachings to get get you to a certain point on your spiritual path and then drop all of it so for the teaching not to become the main thing and so I found that at some point I became resistant to you know ancient texts to any text to any information that was um shared from a human perspective which is all of it and the only thing that I was open to was direct spiritual experience and so I was insistent on my path to having these experiences that would help me to share with the people that um I was sharing this stuff with from my direct experience that would help me to bring them to their own direct experience that was really at the heart of a lot of what I was doing back then but now on the other side of that and having contracted in Consciousness again I see the value of how this material has helped to to bring people further along and their part than if this material was not available at all and so it really plays a big role in the raising of Consciousness on the planet I mean we&#x27;re currently learning from the law of one the text that has been channeled and how much of us have gained so many insights because of access to this information and this knowled knowledge so yeah I have a a greater respect for for this information now um moving on the questioner I will make this assumption then if maximum efficiency had been achieved in this 25,000 year period the entities would have polarized either toward service um towards self or service to others one or the other this would have then made them harvestable at the end of that 25,000 year period or either service to self or service to others type of fourth density in which case they would have had to move to another planet because this one would have been in third density for 50 more thousand years is this correct the questions are not always very clear and straightforward I actually should have taken a moment to um clarify exactly what he was asking but nonetheless ra um answers the question let us untangle your assumption which is complex and correct in part and then raw continues the initial goal is for entities to seek and become one if this happens quickly they can advance rapidly leading to a third density Planet which uh being vacated at the end of that cycle however typically throughout the Universe after the first major cycle only a small number of entities are harvested those remaining become more polarized resulting in a larger Harvest than the second cycle sorry resulting in a larger Harvest after the second cycle it&#x27;s about that that doesn&#x27;t make any sense than the second cycle no after the second cycle by the end of the third cycle the process is complete and the final Harvest occurs question of very good then was the Confederation shall we say watching to see and expecting to see a harvest at the end of the 25,000-year period in which a percentage would be harvestable fourth density positive and a percentage harvestable fourth density negative ra this is correct you may see our role in the first major cycle as that of the gardener who knowing the season is content to wait for the spring when the springtime does not occur the seeds do not Sprout then it is that the gardener must work in the garden questioner am I to understand then there were either harvestable entities of positive or negative polarity at the end of TW of that 25,000 years raw that is correct Those whom you call the Orion group made one attempt to offer information to those of their density during that cycle however the information did not fall upon the ears of any who were concerned to follow this path to polarity questioner what technique did the Orion group use to give this information ra um two kinds thought transfer or telepathy and the second one um the arrangement of certain stones in order to suggest strong influences of power this being those of statues and of rock formations in your Pacific areas and to an extent in your Central American regions as you now understand them are you speaking about um the ston heads of Easter Island raw correct questioner how would such ston heads influence a people to take the path um of service to self ra imagine entities living as if they were at the mercy of uncontrollable forces um when they encounter a charged object like a statue or rock formation filled with power they might attribute to its power over uncontrolled aspects of their lives this belief can lead to further distort distortions such as seeking power over others I would have liked for them to continue further down this line um because I think it is still not completely clear but um they move on the questioner how would these Stone heads con constructed ra these were constructed by thought after a scanning of the Deep Mind the trunk of Mind Tree and I just have a note here what question mark question mark because the trunk of Mind Tree I have no clue what they mean looking at the images most likely to cause the experience of awe in the viewer questioner did Orion entities do this themselves did they land in physical or did they do it from mental planes or did they use one of their incarnate entities to construct these thoughts these by thoughts raw nearly all of these structures and formations were constructed at a distance by thought a very few were created in later times in Imitation of original constructs by entities upon your per Earth plane or density questioner what density Orion entity did the creation of these heads uh fourth density ra says the density of Love or understanding was the density of the particular entity which offered this possibility to those of your first major cycle questioner and I had the same question you use the same nomenclature for for fourth density negative as for fourth density positive both are called the dimension of Love or understanding is this correct ra this is correct love and understanding whether it be of self or of self toward Other Self is one wow I have written questioner now what was the approximate date in years past um in years past of the construction of these heads and then raw approximately 60,000 years ago questioner what structures were built in South America RA in this location were fashion some characteristic statues um some formations of what you call Rock and some formations involving Rock and Earth questioner were the lines at NASCAR included in this raw correct questioner since this can only be seen from an altitude of what benefit was this ra the formations were of benefit because they were charged with energy of power questioner I&#x27;m a little confused these lines at NASCAR are hardly understandable for for an entity walking on the surface he cannot see anything but a dis But A disruption of the surface however if you go up to a high altitude you can see the patterns how is it of benefit to the entities walking on the surface raw given the current time space it&#x27;s hard to imagine that 60,000 years ago the earth was formed with visibly powerful structural designs observable from distant Hills questioner in other words at the time there were Hills overlooking these lines ra this will be the final full question the smoothness you see now was once built up with many Hills over time wind and weather have significantly eroded both the impressive structures of the earth and the surrounding Countryside and then the question I think think I understand then then these lines are just the faint traces of what used to be there raw this is correct and so that brings us to the end of session 20 as always I hope you found little nuggets or something interesting in here and I look forward to connecting in the comments have a really wonderful day and I will see you guys on the next one much love</p>
