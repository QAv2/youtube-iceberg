            <p>all right here goes I&#x27;ll be testing Thomas Town Center Browns theory that two charged plates can produce a force in the positive direction to test this I&#x27;ll be using a high-voltage DC power supply goes up to 40,000 volts but we&#x27;re gonna stay under 20 and this is the charged plate it&#x27;s in a container to prevent ion airflow so if there is a force that he like mr. Brown said it was that was not produced by Owens and this would did that detect it he said that it would work even in a vacuum so putting a cage around it airtight cage around it would be basically the same and this is a balance that I built some out of some wood it&#x27;s very very sensitive it&#x27;s balanced on two razor blades so if this does produce any type of force it should be able to do that detect it and to measure the force I have this counterbalance a jar with water and a laser pointer setup and this laser pointer is pointing over at that wall so that even an extremely small amount of movement will register and you can see that it&#x27;s sort of going up and down right now because of random air currents I guess but anyways here it goes this is my control it&#x27;s a little Deadman switch connected to the external control of the power supply when I press this slowly cranks up it should stop around 9k yeah probably about 8 K first of no filling all right that&#x27;s what that stays rights once again trade to cranking up but as you can see the laser dot isn&#x27;t roughly the same spot as it was before so does not moved at all so what I&#x27;m gonna do now [Applause] right except when we bump the scale but refer to too slow and we&#x27;re back okay so what I&#x27;m gonna do now is crank up the voltage pressing the button so right now the capacitor is starting the charge that may just short out actually oh so the laser pointer did deflect up above than normal right up until the capacitor blew so I don&#x27;t know this is kind of registering a small force there but experiment is done now I can&#x27;t see any visual damage but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a short in there now so see you next time</p>
