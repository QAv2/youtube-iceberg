            <p>[Music] [Music] when Danielle was doing her initial research with the force plates and I saw what was going on because I was there and queried her so I believe I might have been a little forward and asked could I be one of your experimentor so I was one of the original people that she started getting her data from I was involved in the group that was initially tested by Daniel at that point we knew something was being measured because there was strange instruments and test equipment around but um I wasn&#x27;t aware what and I per chance happened to stop by and have a look at the computer to see what was happening cuz none of us quite understood what was was going on at that time and she had just captured some extraordinary pieces of data and the idea was to put an individual or a subject on a force plate it&#x27;s fancy word for a device that measures weight what she was seeing from the result as a result of her experiments was that the weight of a subject could be dramatically increased by several pounds or dramatically decreased by several pounds over a short period of time so I&#x27;m looking at the science I&#x27;m looking at the effects I&#x27;m looking at how humans have an effect on the gravitational and electromagnetic field around them how is that so how can it be that that has never been observed or recognized by science before because they weren&#x27;t looking for it every individual Alters the gravitational field around them I mean that that brings up thousands and thousands of questions there was enough interest in the fact that I had recorded some anomalous gravitational and electromagnetic data to invite me to um submit an a abstract and then later on a paper uh for the American Institute of physics sponsored conference [Music] proceedings I was attending the STA conference at Albuquerque New Mexico that&#x27;s the major conference that looks at space technology and Associated types of research on this occasion Danielle&#x27;s work created an enormous interest and at the end of her presentation she undertook a demonstration of the work that she performed she brought along one of her experimental assistants who um basically sat on a load measuring cell and over the space of I guess 15 or 20 minutes that load was demonstrated quite clearly in the instrumentation to change now that of course should not happen she captured the interest of a lot of aerospace engineers and program managers who had never seen this kind of work before and especially not in a space technology Forum there was one particular scientist who returned eight times to read the board and watch the screens and the conference attendees all of them gathered around the demonstration to see precisely what was going on they couldn&#x27;t believe really the numbers that were coming out of the instrumentation what she is doing is achieving measured effects and measuring them at at a larg of magnitude that is no longer a statistically marginal uh data point it is now a an effect that&#x27;s several factors or even orders of magnitudes above the statistical uh marginal limits I had had demonstrated previously unobserved and unrecognized anomalous interface between the gravitation electromagnetic fields in human beings this was of interest if they weren&#x27;t interested they wouldn&#x27;t stand there and ask questions they would just go well that&#x27;s nice and walk on but they were there I mean hours and there followed a very very Lively discussion where all the top scientists in the field were exchanging views on how the instrumentation could be improved what was really being measured that was uh a scientific conference at its best and quite unusual in my experience we&#x27;re not affiliated with academic environments intentionally so that we do have the freedom and the latitude to explore these previously unexplored areas we are also not affiliated with government agencies in which this type of research has always always been previously protected our interest is to get the information out to the world not to hold anything back so that science can look at it and say okay if this is so then what questions do I have to ask the work in terms of the work I&#x27;m doing if Danielle&#x27;s results were shown unequivocally to be correct that would be absolutely revolutionary it would completely revolutionize our current thinking about Mass and weight studying human ability and looking at it through the eyes of Natural Science and to begin to expand the models of Natural Science by including the nature of human being within the Natural Sciences is the future of science we&#x27;re basically at the at the beginning at the Forefront of a new understanding of certain aspects that we haven&#x27;t understood before because science has always been understood in the sense of it&#x27;s replicable and it and the environment we can measure in a very replicable way what we haven&#x27;t understood is the effect of the Observer so our impact on the environment the other way around anomalous behavior is still behavior in in nature and if we&#x27;re calling it anomalous uh it means we&#x27;re not yet accounting for it by our theorems by our the model that&#x27;s we&#x27;re using and therefore we need to create a broader understanding that can um um account for it in the language of science who would have thought that with your focus you can impact the gravitational field who would have thought that with your focus you have immeasurable tremendous impact on the surrounding electromagnetic field nobody so why is it important well to a large extent we don&#x27;t know yet why it is important but the fact that we have the impact where in traditional s science the understanding was more around that the environment has an impact on us where that goes who knows I don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s going to go but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s fascinating that we can have that impact and it&#x27;s worthwhile investigating further Northwest Frontier Research Institute is on The Cutting Edge of the kinds of science that will be developed in the next 30 to 50 to 100 years we are The Cutting Edge we are the leaders in this field and we&#x27;re the only ones looking at this science and this research from previously unobserved and unrecognized perspective IV here&#x27;s A New Path of scientific evidence that can be used also for potential business applications how it&#x27;s yet to be determined we have our gravity experiment over there and we have our calorimetry for measuring Fusion device performance here this experiment is a super sensitive experiment to test the force of gravity at very Ultra just think of the infinite possibilities of things that can be done new applications that can arise new sorts of uh consumer devices new sorts of medical devices we don&#x27;t know we won&#x27;t ever know unless uh institutes like hers can get funding so she can move forward as far as Danielle&#x27;s work is concerned uh it&#x27;s important that she maintains her lab so that people who want to go to see what she&#x27;s doing can say can we visit your lab and talk about your results and let&#x27;s see the work going on uh and that&#x27;s another Reon reason why it&#x27;s important for her Research Institute to receive continued funding the people that are going to be interested in supporting This research are the ones that are eager to see science move forward and integrate the human element back into the Natural Sciences it&#x27;s the people who look at things differently and have the minds to see a different possibility that that create change and it&#x27;s always been that way and I think we&#x27;re at another one of these moments and I think that Danielle is one of those people the impact on what this organization can do what the institution can do bringing this forward into the public I think is immense would be a part of a new paradigm in science or defining a new a new type of science it&#x27;s an inquiry into nature and um I think it was Socrates who said the unexamined life is not worth living and is there another examination that can be more interesting than the one into your very own nature perhaps we will find that it is the human itself that is the missing link between our understanding of the big and the small Perhaps it is that Humanity itself will demonstrate itself to be what&#x27;s been missing in our understanding of unification Perhaps it is that we will find that human potential itself will as it develops as as the study of the human potential develops that many of our big questions in science can begin to be [Music] answered</p>
