            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel and uh we look into uh some of the greatest uh findings that I&#x27;ve made from my research a lot of theories of everything all-encompassing theories uh Magnum opuses from uh some of the um lost greats and uh today we&#x27;re looking at the reciprocal system of theory this is the 325th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system that was originated by dwey B Larson and in his uh life that lasted from 1898 until 1990 uh he uh had uh he put in about 60 years of time working on the reciprocal system never got paid never got any fame um just did it because it was the right thing to do and uh he figured he could make a contribution even if it was postumus and um wrote about 15 books wrote uh about 50 articles and a lot gave a lot of talks got a little bit of a following and um but the following is pretty small and Larson died in 1990 and so uh his work is threatening to fall through the cracks so we&#x27;re trying to um you know at least uh document some of his findings uh get it out there put it in a place where other people might be able to see it more readily and uh I might not be the person for this because I&#x27;m uh admittedly no expert on the reciprocal system so I&#x27;m just trying to present it the best way that I can um it&#x27;s a fairly difficult thing to master and uh I certainly have not done that but I have enough of an understanding of it to at least be able to maybe hold your hand while uh we gu and guide you through some of his writings and some of his talks and some of the the talks of some of his followers and be able to um you know light a spark under you and hopefully you will um get excited about his research and um you know do your own work okay now um we are looking at an article uh this will be the third installment of an article that he wrote called the nature of time and uh just to give you a quick once over on the reciprocal system which he will also be doing um according to Larson we live in a universe made entirely of motion and in Larson&#x27;s Universe of motion motion is defined as the relationship between space and time so what that does is it sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time and um space and time have no independent existence they only exist together in motion motion is basically a fraction uh with time or space as the numerator and space or time as a denominator and uh normally I kind of go into Larson&#x27;s uh two fundamental postulates but since they are part of his um his writing here we can just uh go through exactly what Larson says so we&#x27;re going to back up um a couple sentences and um then just get directly into this work here and then maybe I will um talk a little bit about the at the end here okay extrapolation of the relation between space and time that is is observed in the phenomenon of motion thus leads directly to three conclusions about the properties of time and space uh which can replace the assumptions that physicists have made without examination now in the earlier parts of this paper uh Larson was looking at um kind of the history of the science uh of time uh how how scientists in the past have understood time and he quoted Newton for example Newton is saying time being onedimensional that being known to all uh so there&#x27;s no scientific rigor involved in that he&#x27;s just um you you know saying well everybody knows that time is onedimensional it doesn&#x27;t make any argument for it doesn&#x27;t uh provide any evidence just says everybody knows it so it&#x27;s not something that we need to ascertain and Larson is rightfully saying uh that&#x27;s not good enough um you know just because everybody thinks that that&#x27;s what it is you know 250 years ago everybody thought that Tomatoes were poisonous so uh that doesn&#x27;t mean that they are poisonous and um so uh that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s referring to where he&#x27;s saying without examination assumptions that the physicists have made without examination together with the further assumption that SpaceTime as th as thus defined is the sole constituent of the physical Universe these can be combined into one comprehensive postulate as follows so his First Fundamental postulate is going to contain all of the kind of elements in the second part of this paper he was looking at um kind of the extrapolation process so he&#x27;s saying okay well this is how space looks to me from here and this is how time looks to me from here uh I can try to extrapolate um the characteristics of space onto time and try to extrapolate the characteristics of time onto space uh and apply it to the universe in general he recognizes that the process of extrapolation is not infallible but that it is generally Fairly reliable so um that&#x27;s kind of what he was doing there now he&#x27;s um trying to move all of this information into this first postulate he has two postulates the first one is by far the most important though so the First Fundamental postulate the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion of which she also calls SpaceTime so the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and in two reciprocal forms space and time in addition to this first postulate which defines the physical nature of the universe some further assumptions as to the mathematical Behavior will be necessary and since this present development does not get into any of the any difficulties of the kind that have forced modern physics to resort to the use of complex and abstruse Mathematics it will be possible to formulate the following simple postulate second fundamental postulate the physical Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and it&#x27;s geometry is ukian now I must say that um some of Larson&#x27;s followers have taken him to task on the second postulate at particularly the ukian geometry and uh if you look at Larson&#x27;s writings uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty clear that he kind of understood that the universe of the geometry uh the geometry of the univers is not ukian um but that he didn&#x27;t want to really get into any of the non- idian geometries because it was just too confusing and it was just adding too much uh bag too much more baggage to what is already a difficult exposition of the topic and so he just didn&#x27;t want to get into uh any more complex geometries um now what Dr Bruce Perez one of his uh primary um revisers and followers uh proposed is to say that the geometry of the universe is projective projective geometry is a kind of geometry that actually includes ukian geometry so ukian geometry is part of projective geometry but just a um a specific part of it there&#x27;s really a geometrical Cascade that occurs from projective geometry to aine Geometry to metric geometry to ukian Geometry so ukian geometry is basically a special subset of projective geometry and um that um that makes good sense to me in that it doesn&#x27;t encumber the system too much and and it also includes uh larsson&#x27;s original contribution for most intents and purposes the geometry of the universe is ukian um but there are situations where that doesn&#x27;t apply and uh for our our purposes it&#x27;s not really that big of a deal okay on examination of the these two postulates it is apparent that they require a progression of SpaceTime similar to the progression of time as ordinarily Vis visualized now again this progression of time Larson calls that clock space and clock time clock time is meaning that the clock is always getting later and later and later and later the progression of space is that the uh space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart now this is what Larson calls a scalar motion this is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction the clock is always getting later and later and later but in no specific Direction it&#x27;s not getting later North or later South by Southwest uh it&#x27;s getting just later and um with space you can visualize this using a balloon with dots on it you take the balloon with dots on it and you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction they&#x27;re all moving away from each other and um so this is kind of the model that he&#x27;s using for the progression of space and the progression of time uh and he&#x27;s really saying that we don&#x27;t see the progression of space in the same way that we see the progression of time because we&#x27;re in a gravitationally bound system and so we see space as three-dimensional and time as progressing but if we were in a different setting in the universe we would actually see time as three-dimensional and space as progressing space would always be getting farther and farther and farther apart and you do see that in the uh observations of the Hubble telescope that noticed that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other okay let us consider some location a in SpaceTime when one more unit of time has elapsed this location has progressed to a + 1 in time since one unit of time is equivalent to one unit of space according to the first postulate this location has also progressed to a +1 in space at the very outset therefore the new development confronts us with an important basic phenomenon which has not hitherto been recognized a progression of space similar to The observed progression of time we thus have an immediate opportunity to test the validity of the new system by observation of the actual physical Universe if SpaceTime actually progresses as a new Theory contends then we should be able to recognize some phenomena on or some phenomena in which identific identifiable objects without inherent motion of their own are being carried along in Space by the progression of SpaceTime in order to simplify the question of a reference system let us assume that a large number of such objects originate at the same space-time location which means that they originate at the same space location simultaneously due to the progression of SpaceTime these objects immediately begin moving outward but outward in space time is a scalar Direction and The spatial motions of the individual objects will be distributed over all possible directions in accordance with the probability principles hence if there is if there actually is a progression of SpaceTime we should observe objects of this kind originating at various spatial locations and moving away from the points of origin in all directions at a constant velocity we do not have to look very far to find physical entities which display exactly this Behavior throughout the physical Universe there are sources of light or other electromagnetic radiation from which photons emate in all directions and recede from the points of emission at constant velocity this radiation phenomenon therefore furnishes the definite independent evidence that is necessary to demonstrate the reality of the space-time progression so in this analysis in Larsson system the photon is actually uh a motionless particle the photon does not move rather it is being carried by the SpaceTime progression and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s always measured at the speed of light because the speed of light is one unit of space in one unit of time that is the speed of the progression the universe is moving outward at the speed of light in all directions and the photon is just sitting there and it&#x27;s being carried by the universe moving outward at the speed of light in all directions and that&#x27;s why the melson Morley experiment determined that the speed of light is constant uh because that is the space-time progression and the photon is just following that and the photon is the light particle okay so um so that&#x27;s one demonstration of uh the uh reality of the space-time progression that the photon is always moving at the speed of light speed of light is a constant and that&#x27;s one unit of space in one unit of time 1 over 1 equals 1 Larsson refers to the speed of light as unit speed and so that&#x27;s the background of the universe of motion if you have a if the physicist in the physicist Universe you measure everything from zero from motionless if you got a speed you measure it you know 10 mil hour 10 mph is 10 m more than zero so that&#x27;s how you measure it but if you are measuring in the reciprocal system you measure from the speed of light outward and so uh in Larson&#x27;s Universe you actually have half of the universe that is moving faster than the speed of light which is you know blasphemy to the uh Legacy scientists uh who follow Einstein who said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe for Larson the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and um the half that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light he refers to as the cosmic sector uh to uh distinguish it from the material sector which is the sector that we&#x27;re familiar with and the the scientists are familiar with that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light so again in a universe of motion uh which is you know Larson&#x27;s Mo larsson&#x27;s Universe then you have motion before you have anything else um you have to be able to kind of accept that that motion occurs if you&#x27;re going to kind of try to evaluate the reciprocal system you have to step into that world and and and um accept that motion uh precedes everything else and that if in a universe of motion the state of rest is outward at the speed of light that is the state of rest um okay now he&#x27;s going to get into a second uh form of evidence that also confirms the reality of the space-time progression additional conf information is provided by the Motions of the external galaxies all galaxies except our immediate neighbors are receding from us in exactly the same manner as the photons of light that originate in our galaxy meaning uh in all directions except for the fact that the relative Galactic velocity is a function of the distance and has only reached about 1/4 of the velocity of light at the extreme range of our optical telescopes and perhaps 1 half the velocity of light at the greatest distance accept uh accessible to radio observation so the farther away the Galaxy the faster they are moving away from us and theoretically at the very edge of you know as far away as we can get they will be receding at the speed of light the lower velocities of the galaxies as compared to the velocity of light uh as compared to the velocity of light the light photons are quite obviously due to the mod if Ying effect of gravitation which even at these enormous distances still exerts a small force of attraction that operates against the progression so this force of gravitation is operating against the progression and um at a certain point they balance out so at a certain point you you know and that that&#x27;s at that point then you start to to get into the three-dimensional space uh beyond that you&#x27;re really dealing with uh a progressing space and no longer three-dimensional thus the reality of the space progression a basic feature of the new theory that has uh has no counterpart in any other physical theory is substantiated by two independent lines of evidence space limitations preclude a detailed discussion of the development of the consequences of the fundamental postulates to the point where they require the existence of matter but for present purposes it should be sufficient to say that this development indicates that the atoms of matter are rotating units in which the direction of rotation is opposite to that of the space-time progression that is irrespective of the spatial direction in which the atoms are moving their scalar SpaceTime direction is always inward directly opposite to the outward motion of the space-time progression whereas the progression is continually carrying all physical objects outward away from each other the inherent rotational motion of the atoms is carrying them inward toward each other this is the phenomenon we call gravitation as an aid in visualizing how gravitation operates according to this Theory let us assume that a violent explosion has taken place and that we are looking at the results shortly there after without any knowledge of what has happened we still see a cloud of flying particles apparently exerting a force of repulsion upon each other and we will observe that this Force has some peculiar characteristics it acts instantaneously without an intervening medium and in such a way that it cannot be screened off or modified according to the new development gravitation is a force of the same general nature except that it acts in the inverse Direction ction inward instead of outward like the apparent Force which the particles of debris exert on each other gravitation merely appears to be an action of one Mass upon another in reality each mass is pursuing its own course independently of all others in as much as the motion of the progression originates everywhere and is constant regardless of location whereas the gravitational motion originates at the location which the atom happens to occupy and the component directed toward any other atom therefore decreases with distance in accordance with the inverse Square relation there is a point at which the two velocities are equal inside this equilibrium equilibrium distance the gravitational motion is the greater and there is a net gravitational effect beyond the equilibrium point the motion of the progression is the greater and the objects move away from each other the net outward velocity increasing with the distance as the gravitational effect decreases the actual behavior of the universe is exactly in accord with these predictions of the new Theory okay I think we&#x27;re going to stop it there uh we&#x27;ve got a few more pages um not too many more pages to go um I I I I think I&#x27;m actually going to try to finish it here throughout the Physical Realm the new Viewpoint as to the nature of space and time derived by the relatively straightforward and dependable process of extrapolation similarly resolves the dilemmas and difficulties which have uh resulted from basing physical theory on pure assumptions it is evident from these results that space and time are actually entities of the same nature and that the great difference which we seem to see in them are merely the result of the gravitational motion of mass matter gravitation conceals the effect of the space progression in our immediate vicinity and the progression is observable only at extreme distances hence the most evident property of space is its three-dimensionality the progression of time on the other hand is unchecked by gravitation and the velocities of the progression is so high that any motion in three-dimensional time is negligible uh relatively except at extreme velocities we therefore recognize only the progression of time but science is now penetrating the regions of extreme distance and very high velocities where the progression of space and the three dimensionality of time plays significant roles and in order to remove serious obstacles to a clear understanding of phenomena in these regions it will be necessary to take heed of the Salient Point disclosed by the extrapolation process of the present investigation the fact that both space and time actually have all the properties that have hitherto been attributed to either of them individually okay that is the end of this paper the nature of time now tomorrow we&#x27;re going to try to get into uh you know the first before this we had done the paper that he called the physical nature of space and now we just did the nature of time this next paper uh is going to be called the nature of motion motion being the relationship between space and time so we can kind of make those different comparisons but uh for now we&#x27;re going to leave it off and start up with the nature of motion tomorrow uh thanks for tuning in have a great</p>
