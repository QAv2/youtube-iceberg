            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>And when I was in I I I got invited to Arrow. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. It was like so crazy. So I can&#x27;t go into the reason why I ended up in Arrow.</p>
<p>Excuse me for wipe my nose, but I can&#x27;t tell you exactly that because they asked me not to, but I was going in to look at a specific case that I&#x27;m familiar with. I&#x27;ve reported on it a bunch of times &gt;&gt; and they had some evidence they wanted to show me &gt;&gt; and I had to get like uh I had to get like 48 hour background screening and I got major going through like and I had to get an approval this little pass to have a photo. &gt;&gt; How recent was this? &gt;&gt; Last about a year ago. Little little over a year ago. Yeah.</p>
<p>So &gt;&gt; after Kirk Patrick Kirk &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was it was in December of I think it was December of 2024. So, it was a little over a year ago because it was December. &gt;&gt; And uh and I I and I I go into uh well, they had to do they had to do like this background check. Then I had to show up and I it was escort required. Then I got this little badge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Then I I I I walked through I happened to be flying home after that because I was going from my hotel. Then I went to the Pentagon just just next to the Pentagon. And um and I met somebody in a parking lot. They walked me through the parking lot. They took me in all these doors and then I had to go through security.</p>
<p>They comb through everything and I had everything on me cuz I was traveling. I was going I was going back home afterwards. So I had to go through all my bag and all my affairs. Finally get my stuff. And then I walked through this.</p>
<p>It was like Star Trek. It was like a glass tube. I&#x27;d say about that I want to say about maybe that big around maybe seven or eight feet tall or maybe went up higher. &gt;&gt; And one end opened like open like that. You step inside only one person at a time and then that closes and then the other one opens.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what they did in I don&#x27;t know what I got scanned. I don&#x27;t know what happened. Then I walked in there and then I had to go to a locker with a with an escort guy in a suit just like you&#x27;d expect like a man in black kind of guy, right? Very cordial. Go to a locker and I had to get rid of all my electronics, everything. I had to take everything off and put my phone, everything inside there.</p>
<p>And then we go up to this big door just like a bank vault kind of thing. Opens up. The entire office complex was a skiff. The whole thing was. And they take me inside there.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m thinking, this is so [ __ ] strange, man. Can&#x27;t even believe I&#x27;m in here. And I&#x27;m thinking to myself, God, is this a good idea? Like what? You know, I don&#x27;t know. It just felt a little spooky. But I was like, ah, they&#x27;re people, you know? I&#x27;m just going to treat them like people.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And um we go down this hallway, all these cubicles and stuff. We go down the hallway and there was a door to my right that was closed and a door to my left that was open and he&#x27;s like, &quot;Wait here. I&#x27;ll be right back.&quot; He goes off and I have his name, but I&#x27;m not going to even do. He was Air Force Office of Special Investigations. OSI.</p>
<p>And uh I look inside the door and not that far away, I don&#x27;t know, six, seven feet with a little table and there were a bunch of people I think a couple girls, couple guys having a conversation, all nicely dressed and I couldn&#x27;t help myself. I What else am I doing? I&#x27;m just sitting there. And the brain has this uncanny ability to like almost like turn a little, you know what I mean? Like like Yeah. And I just start easedropping on their conversation. I was like just kind of curious.</p>
<p>Are these guys part of arrow too? Like what&#x27;s you know? And I&#x27;m like fully tuning into their conversation. And then one of them looks over at me, gets up, grabs the door, closes my face. I was like I kind of looked like sorry what am I supposed to do here? So anyway, so then this individual comes back, opens up the door, gets in there, and there&#x27;s a a computer right there. It was a computer, and I I wish I could remember the name of the of the access point, but it was Intel folks that told me where the high-res photos and videos were, and it was that computer. Damn it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s in It&#x27;s in the program. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m sorry. I can&#x27;t &gt;&gt; Oh, there&#x27;s like a special computer that has access to all the top secret [ __ ] &gt;&gt; Yes. And I was told by intel folks that had been on by multiple Intel folks and it was that it was right there and was looking at he I was like, &quot;Oh, what&#x27;s that?&quot; You know, he goes, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s the skip or whatever the hell it&#x27;s called. I&#x27;m sorry.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t remember. I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; and um start like showing me some footage and stuff and I was like, &gt;&gt; &quot;What if he said, &quot;James, I&#x27;ll let you have this computer alone in here for one hour, but on one condition, &gt;&gt; you have to stop all of your investigations and all your documentaries moving forward.&quot; &gt;&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t do it. &gt;&gt; You wouldn&#x27;t do it? &gt;&gt; No, I wouldn&#x27;t do it. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re a good man. Not for all the money.</p>
<p>Not for all the money in the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But uh so then the other uh uh John Kusclowski, the new head of Arrow, he comes in. I got to be honest with you, I was a little nervous, you know, but then I was like, I&#x27;m a public figure in some respects, like not like I&#x27;m hiding what I&#x27;m doing. So I was like, &quot;Guys, like, you know, you got to throw us a bone here because the public&#x27;s frustrated and you&#x27;re not putting the genie back in the bottle.&quot; like and I started rattling off cases and one of them was like, you know, James, it&#x27;s kind of funny.</p>
<p>Uh, your documentary, The Phenomenon, is mandatory viewing for anyone who&#x27;s going to work for Arrow. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; I was like, that&#x27;s my that&#x27;s pretty damn cool, right? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s awesome. And then uh then I started talking about Rua, Sakoro, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, because it&#x27;s one thing to talk about unknown objects, you know, in the air like the tic tac or whatever, but when you start talking about beings on the ground, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a different story, man. It&#x27;s a whole another level.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s one of the things that doesn&#x27;t get addressed often enough, right? &gt;&gt; And I tell people all the time because it&#x27;s like, &gt;&gt; you know, you got close encounters of the first, second, and third kind. And that was not something that just came from the public. that came internally from the scientific adviser that was working with the Air Force. &gt;&gt; They were documenting close encounters of the third kind in the 50s, right? &gt;&gt; And they were putting it off as like psychological. I think they were writing it off psychological.</p>
<p>The person&#x27;s batshit crazy. Don&#x27;t look at it. Psychological. And that changed with Sakoro in &#x27; 64. But uh &gt;&gt; then I said like people aren&#x27;t going away.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re having these hearings like you know you you guys are going to come to the determination if you haven&#x27;t already that some of these represent a non-human intelligence. Like what&#x27;s going on? And John looks at me, John Koscllowski, the new head of Arrow, and he goes, he goes, &quot;James, um, I can&#x27;t part my own hair without approval from the DoD.&quot; And you can quote me on that. &gt;&gt; He was basically telling me, &quot;Dude, my hands are tied. &gt;&gt; I doesn&#x27;t matter what I determine. It doesn&#x27;t matter what I uncover, you know, and I&#x27;ve had other members that I kept to remain nameless that so weird because I&#x27;m meeting with these people now.&quot; kind of not surprising.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And people think I&#x27;m crazy. Like, you know, look, like I get cues like, &quot;Oh, James is a spook. He&#x27;s working.&quot; I&#x27;m like, &quot;Oh my god, come on, man. I&#x27;ve been doing this since I was in my 20s.&quot; &gt;&gt; Everyone&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s a spook, dude. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not a spook.</p>
<p>Like, come on. I share everything publicly that I possibly can. And the only reason why I don&#x27;t share other things because if I violated the trust with some of the people that I&#x27;ve met with and the [ __ ] that I&#x27;ve heard, dude. Okay. Like, you know, I&#x27;ve heard some stuff, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; If I said I even asked one time, can I say I heard it anonymously? They&#x27;ll know exactly who it came from. &gt;&gt; So, the stuff that I&#x27;ve heard. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and uh Well, I can I can I transition into one more thing? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m talking to another insider and like why not why can&#x27;t I have a seat at the table? &gt;&gt; Like what is it going to hurt? I&#x27;m not going to stop doing what I&#x27;m doing. Okay, I&#x27;m not going to like I&#x27;m never going to just not reveal what I possibly can, the maximum amount I can possibly reveal to the general public. I will always do that and I&#x27;ll be straight with you guys. And I don&#x27;t get it right sometimes.</p>
