            <p>well we&#x27;ve had fun over the last 23 years proving that cold fusion is really defeating the prime directive as David does so well subscribe but now we have to get back to business and explain this puppy so I&#x27;m not a theoretician I did not come to Theory voluntarily I came to desperation and the I ran all the papers there&#x27;s about 2000 now that you really need to master I did hundreds of experiments only a few of which work only enough to keep me interested and I had the impression that nature was playing games because I get very discouraged and then nature would reel anthems make one work just in time so I realized that I needed help from theory so I read all the series and I was really disappointed because most of the series either violate basic laws that I was taught they don&#x27;t mess with they explain only one observation and ignore all the rest or they have a whole raft of hoc assumptions that are connected by complex complex mathematics so I didn&#x27;t find them very useful so I was essentially forced screaming and kicking to develop a theory of my own which you&#x27;ll hear about today if you&#x27;re patient the a theory is always based upon an assumption and if the assumption is wrong it doesn&#x27;t matter how clever the math is the theory will be wrong for example if you assume that the Sun goes around the earth it doesn&#x27;t matter how much complex math you apply to that that theory is going to crash and burn and that&#x27;s also true of any theory having to do with cold fusion so I will describe fourth assumptions and you can decide whether or not they&#x27;re rational or reasonable so we have a problem right that&#x27;s a start because the name of the field the name of the phenomena is not even agreement between people in the field so I will call it cold fusion simply because it&#x27;s easier to say that low energy nuclear reaction and I&#x27;m describing the single phenomenon I&#x27;m not describing hot fusion Padrino reactions zero-point energy of magnetic energy I&#x27;m explaining just one those all might be real and they might interact occurred during cold fusion but we have to separate them out and talk about one phenomenon when that phenomena is a nuclear process initiated on rare occasions an apparently ordinary material without application of significant energy that generates heat and nuclear products without the expected radiation when any isotope of hydrogen is present us it&#x27;s a lot to remember but we&#x27;ll try to apply that all right the first assumption is the culture and cannot occur in a normal material but requires formation of a unique condition everyone who has gone through graduate school and possibly even undergraduate it&#x27;s taught that nuclear reactions simply are not initiated in ordinary material it just doesn&#x27;t happen I mean their geological evidence there there&#x27;s heroic efforts as David described that fail it is not easy to do yet it happens so we have a problem how do we explain that conflict the way I explain it is that I assume that something changes within the material and I call that change the creation of the nuclear active environment and we won&#x27;t talk about the nature of the new bracket environment at this point we&#x27;re just simply saying that we require something other than ordinary material the second assumption the heat energy and nuclear products are produced by the same basic process operating in the same hyperactive environment other words is one operation one mechanism one place where it happens we&#x27;re not talking about a variety there are some people that like to make up all kinds of possibilities but I choose to simplify this and talk about one kind of a reaction and we&#x27;ll see it as possible to explain it that way or do we have to introduce a lot of complexity and the third assumption is that cold fusion is not hot future now beliefs that cold fusion was hot fusion caused a lot of confusion early on in a lot of the rejection and let&#x27;s look at that in more detail because that&#x27;s a very important mantra cold fusion is not hot fusion and of course the reverse is true hot fusion is caused by two deuterons in this case coming together with high kinetic energy to combine into a single nucleus which immediately explodes it explodes into four fragments one of the fragments is a neutron which can get out of the apparatus and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s measured mother traction is another fragment is healing three which is absorbed and disappears tritium is radioactive it accumulates and so you can measure its presence by its accumulated radioactivity and then the proton also is absorbed these all come off with high energy and so there&#x27;s a conservation of energy here this is normal type nuclear reaction well let&#x27;s look at contrast this with cultures and cultures and the two bigger rides come together with hardly any energy and when they combine together nothing happens you just get healing for the heat energy comes out if your little radiation comes out there&#x27;s no obvious way that energy can be conserved by that process and that&#x27;s the big problem and trying to explain cold future nevertheless that&#x27;s what is observed so let&#x27;s look at them this is more detail because it&#x27;s very important hot fusion is made a number of different ways and we&#x27;ll contrast that with how cold fusion is made it&#x27;s caused the burn hot Tyrian is made to occur in intense plasma controlled by magnetic field this is either that&#x27;s the technique that is presently being developed for power generation into which possibly 50 billion dollars has already been invested and it has so far not succeeded in making any useful energy the laser induced plasma that also has not produced any useful energy although it&#x27;s justified based on nuclear weapons research Farnsworth&#x27;s fuser uses an electric eel instead of a magnetic field people think that might be useful as a source of energy but it&#x27;s only so far generated neutrons which is very useful but not for power production bubble collapse fusion or sauna future here an acoustic wave is caused to pass through a liquid a heavy water the bubbles that are formed collapse and just before they disappeared the energy is concentrated enough that a hot fusion reaction is said to occur it&#x27;s called sonoluminescence because you know like a pulse of life at that point fractal fusion or nuclear fusion occurs whenever a crack forms in a material that has deteriorated if you take lithium deuteride which is very similar to salt and smash it with a hammer you will get a burst of neutrons cavitation fusion is a combination of these two now a meal on fusion is very interesting because it has been related to cold fusion I think we need to eliminate that of that confusion you are huge in results because the muon has a charge equal to the electron but it&#x27;s 200 times heavier so it can form a molecular structure in the same manner as electron does but that molecular structure between two neurons brings the tutor on so close together that they confuse but the process is hot to you it&#x27;s not cold future you get all the products that are typical of the hot fusion reaction you can also say well all these involve application of energy and this is occurs in the cold so therefore you know it must be cold fusion you can look upon it somewhat differently and say the energy instead of being applied as kinetic energy as in these cases it&#x27;s applied as mass and the mass now is used to bring the two closer together by forming this molecular structure that&#x27;s quite different than the way cold fusion works energetic ion bombardment is very interesting oh I was afraid that might happen here we have an example of putting figures in using a Macintosh and he&#x27;s gonna get on her back so I will have to explain to you what we have here the we have two graphs the first graph shows the the rate of reaction of the fusion reaction in a plasma and it&#x27;s a log scale you can see that clearly horizontal axis energy line here it goes down and drops off very rapidly as you go to lower energy now that&#x27;s typical hot fusion now down here we have a graph that shows the excess over that reaction other words how much additional fusion rate one would have under the different conditions as a function of again energy and you will notice that as you go along modest energies maybe around anything about fifteen kilovolts the rate that you get when you bombard zirconium or in fact almost any material with deuterons the rate of oxygen reaction is constant and equal to that what you would get from this curve but when you get below about 15 kilowatts it starts to rise and you get an enhancement now people have said well an enhancement is a transition to cold fusion you know it&#x27;s not because it is in fact even in this region hot future and furthermore this rise is very trivial it looks big when you bought it this way but if you plotted it on this log scale it would just be a slight deviation because the rate at which is the rate at which the fusion reaction is dropping with with energy is very very rapid so you never get to the levels even matter how much extrapolation you do to the levels that have been found in coal tree themselves so we can forget about that as an explanation okay let&#x27;s talk about the way in which culture is made cold fusion is made by exposing material to electrolysis that subscribes placement ponds affect exposure of material to gas discharge exposed to remote aerial to a sonic bombardment the stringing effect in this case the acoustic wave makes the bubble but rather than have it collapse within the liquid it collapses against the target and so the content of the bubble is injected into the target and it&#x27;s a full chain reaction that occurs in the target not in the boat we can expose a material that has been activated to just simply the gas itself now all of these essentially are techniques for bringing into of a solid environment the reacted the product protein or the deteriorate ro migration enhances because of the effect in other words if you put a voltage across the material it can be an oxide dissolves deuterium or it can even be a metal causing the ions to move you can see an extra amount of energy even simply passing deuterium through palladium like normal concentration gradients has been shown to produce a small amount of extra energy and we&#x27;ll talk about why that happens a little later so you can see that there is a difference between the hot fusion and the cold fusion is a way in the kinds of products and the way it&#x27;s caused to occur so if I were teaching a course I would ask everyone to repeat after me ten times pop fusion is not cultured cold fusion is not hot clear-cut and in fact as I would ask you as a homework assignment to say that before you go to bed tonight it will help you sleep alright there&#x27;s one other assumption and that is that all laws that we presently know and love are followed by cold future it does not violate anything everything we know can be applied to explaining cold fusion now obviously something&#x27;s missing and the challenge is to identify that missing part not come up with all kinds of strange and wonderful explanations that violate the various laws but just stay with what we know at this point now the cold fusion phenomena has three separate parts that we can identify and evaluate separately we have to we have to make the nuclear active environment because that&#x27;s occurring in a chemical lattice it follows all the rules of a chemical reaction if therefore has to form its energy to so whatever you imagine to be the nuclear active environment you have to satisfy that rule otherwise forget it what&#x27;s an interactive environment is formed the Deuter odds are the protons have to go into it have to enter into it and form a structure individual atoms will not use they only fuse when they come together when something comes together it is in fact what&#x27;s called a molecule or chemical structure and that&#x27;s what we have to make and that also has to follow the same rules of chemistry because it is occurring in a chemical lattice it also has to generate Gibbs energy and finally once that structure is formed it immediately goes about fusing it immediately goes about bringing the out of the nuclei together and and radiating the energy by some the process that we&#x27;ll talk about very shortly now I won&#x27;t go in to talk about Gibbs energy I want to spend a little more time talking about the theory but if anybody doesn&#x27;t know what the Gibbs energy is please see me afterwards I&#x27;ll give you a short tutorial we also have to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics the laws of probability and conservation of momentum and if you don&#x27;t know what those are then ask me later ok so if you apply these assumptions 200 series you discover that something&#x27;s missing so we have to think about something an information that&#x27;s different so let me summarize first my explanation and we&#x27;ll go into more and more detail until hopefully your patience is exhausted first of all the nuclear active environment I&#x27;m claiming is a gap having a critical critical size that is created by stress release now I came to that conclusion by process of elimination because there are only a limited number of ways in which you can modify a chemical system and we have to modify it in conventional ways in order to make this but it has to have a characteristic that allows other things to apply so the only thing I could see was common to all experimental methods and experimental conditions or cracks but it&#x27;s not just any old crack because large cracks will are bad they obviously did because you can&#x27;t warm the hydrogen molecule we know the large hydrogen molecule is dead so you have to form some form of hydrogen short and different from the hydrogen molecule the I&#x27;m saying that the hydrogen when it gets into this gas forms a covalent chain which I call a hydrogen with the release of Gibbs energy and that stabilizes the gap because energy was given off the format in order to destroy the gap that energy has to be replaced that energy is so large that it&#x27;s not available even a thousand degrees the chain resonates which allows the periodic mission of protons in each direction I&#x27;ll show you that in detail the electron reduces the Coulomb barrier there has to be electron there and when these two nuclei finally come together nuclei being right there as a necessity gets sucked into the reaction and the nuclear reactions that I&#x27;m proposing are here now this tritium provides a the key to understanding this process and tritium also provides the way in which the process can be verified tritium is made in these cold fusion cells and but tritium cannot be made by the hoppier reaction because we&#x27;re not seeing any neutrons so it has to be made by some other process well there are a limited number of ways in which you can make tritium when you examine all of those you discover but the only thing that really makes any sense is this reach what is this reaction here the deuteron chooses where the proton captures the electron makes tritium which then decays by its normal decay or with a half-life of twelve point three years to helium three and electronic based upon assumption number two all of the isotopes of either could have to behave in the same way so that means the deuteron fuses with the electron that makes hydrogen for which decays very very rapidly so we don&#x27;t see that accumulate to make helium four and four the electrons as part of the DJ and protium then would fuse with the electron to make material which is stable now this reaction is very interesting because it provides a way of not only testing the model but it has very experienced world real-world consequences to Rossy claims if you make you tear them that material deuterium will accumulate in the nuclear active environment find a proton combine fuse together to make trillion so we should see in an e cap an accumulation of tritium and not only just an accumulation it should start slowly and accelerate as the concentration of deuterium goes up well that&#x27;s very important because if you don&#x27;t take that into account and open an e cap that has been making a large amount of energy and therefore contains a large amount of tritium and get a snootful you&#x27;re not going to be happy and furthermore the regulator&#x27;s when they find this out that you&#x27;re making all this radioactive tritium they&#x27;re not coming clean about it they&#x27;re gonna shut them down so it&#x27;s absolutely critical that tray of measurements be looking for or trendy look for in an B cap and if it&#x27;s found that unambiguously supports this model all right let&#x27;s look at the way in which I imagine this to occur this is the lattice the hydrogen room it doesn&#x27;t matter where the throw team or deuterium is located within these between the metal of nuclei metal atoms your random way a gap forms by stress release they accumulate and form this structure this is a structure covalent structure based upon the P electron to the 2p electron state initially these are just vibrating in random waves like ordinary things do but because it has a linear structure it can start to vibrate such that is to come together and these two further apart is to come together so forth and then alternately these go for their parties to come together when they still come together they find themselves too close they have too much energy too much mass for the distance because they&#x27;re on the way to having formed a fifth of future products and so the question is where during that process do they recognize that they have too much mass and have to get rid of it when you do it by hop here if that&#x27;s done it very very quickly and overwhelms this process I&#x27;m proposing that this is the unique feature of cold fusion the way in which that knowledge is communicated once it&#x27;s understood I predict will result in a nobel prize this this is where cold fusion differs from hot fusion and so the alternately get close and further apart they give off these protons and opposite direction the conserve momentum finally and that&#x27;s given off at each time to get a little closer they give off a little bigger proton and then eventually they get close enough that they go together this electron end but there&#x27;s hardly any mass energy left over at that point so this becomes stable or if not gives off a very weak gamma if this is material then and these are protium people get together and random ways and generate tritium if these are all deuterium people get together and generate gilja okay there are several predictions that can be made do scientific predictions and there&#x27;s engineering predictions talk about the scientific predictions first I predicted the high protons is metallic hydrogen this is that mythical material that people have been looking for by squeezing hydrogen at very high pressure and I&#x27;m saying that that is precisely what is formed in this gap the gap makes that possible the reason why metallic hydrogen has been very difficult to detect is because once it forms it uses that&#x27;s not too bad because the samples are very small but it does wreck the apparatus because they have diamond handles and they crack and they get colored my colored Centers presumably by the radiation given off by this process so that allows us to harvest the mathematical understanding of metallic hydrogen which is already in the literature to explain this material and also relate what we&#x27;re seeing to another kind of measurement I&#x27;m saying that the heat claimed by Rossi and others using nickel and hydrogen is not the result of transmutation some transportation may be occurring but it&#x27;s at a very low rate and it does not it does not have a rate sufficient to produce any kind of measurable Heat the measurable heat is in their case is coming from the formation of the deuterium and tritium will be produced in increasing a map when hydrogen is used and that also makes attractive the use of heavy hydrogen for future energy production because that does not make tritium and an adenine produces much more energy for each reaction alright so let&#x27;s look at the engineering consequences of this idea in any engineering system one has to identify the variables that you have controller work and what effect they have on the basic process we&#x27;re not looking at the details of the reaction at this point so let&#x27;s identify the variables first of all there&#x27;s a constant in the equation this is power and this is the equation that I proposed describes the amount of power that&#x27;s being produced under the various conditions X is a constant related to the isotope present if deuterium is present of course it has a big number if like hydrogen is present has a small number but it&#x27;s light hydrogen present it&#x27;s a variable because as the deuterium accumulates it&#x27;ll start producing tritium which then has a higher energy for production a is the number of nuclear active environment well it makes sense the more places that the reaction can occur the faster the more often it will occur just common sense but that&#x27;s the problem if material has no nuclear reactor environment of course it doesn&#x27;t matter what else you do - it&#x27;s not going to do anything so that&#x27;s the place where you have to concentrate you have to somehow or another figure out how to increase the number of nuclear active environment that&#x27;s the challenge C is the concentration of hydrogen isotope in the material surroundings in the correct environment well that makes sense the more reactive you have in a system the faster the reaction will go now that&#x27;s a variable also if it&#x27;s sensitive your temperature generally the higher the temperature the lower the concentration is sensitive to the pressure the higher the pressure in the system the higher the concentration it&#x27;s sensitive to the current for example that applies through a pass through an electrochemical well it&#x27;s and also the current that goes through a gas discharge cell so this is variable but we know what to look for and all of those variables are understood understandable and can be incorporated into this concentration term and finally once the hydrogen is in there it has to find it has to get to within the curricular garment factory that involves confuse and so this I&#x27;m putting into this equation the equation that describes the purity temperature effective diffusion this is the here diffusion this is the gas constant versus temperature diffusion will also be changed by a concentration gradient by the application of a voltage I mean all kinds of ways that you increase the future and that&#x27;s why the electromigration has an effect because it changes the rate at which the deuterium can find the new corrected environment all right there&#x27;s one other equation and that&#x27;s how fast the energy can get out of the system now there&#x27;s various ways that can happen by radiation by convection by conduction for simplicity sake we&#x27;ll talk about it being limited only by conduction in this particular example and in that case we have the thermal conductivity of the barrier times the temperature difference across thus defining the loss rate all right so let&#x27;s put some numbers into these equations that are arbitrary the plausible and see how it behaves this is a power produced in watts and this is the temperature in the environment of the nuclear active environment for this curve that curve is based upon this equation here these straight lines result from this equation and they show the power being lost against the delta T water here now so long as the power being produced here is less than the greater that power can be produced by loss the system will be stable even though it has a positive temperature temperature goes up a little bit that produces an increased ability which is more than enough to get rid of that energy so it&#x27;s stable and this is the range that most experiments are done it and you see it has a very modest temperature coefficient but that&#x27;s not a very interesting range occurring in a very low power so Rossi said okay I want to increase the amount of power so he puts a resistor into his cell applies power that causes the temperature to go up and because it&#x27;s going up it follows this line now if he goes too hot hotter than his system is capable of getting rid of heat he will hit a runaway region where it will just simply go out of control and an explosion will result and he&#x27;s talked about that having happened so he&#x27;s got a problem he wants to stay in this range as close as possible to that critical temperature but with control so he applies the de Pete takes Kate takes the temperature off and then once it gets near that critical temperature he turns it resistors off and it cools back down but the other one goes to cold so he turns it back on so he&#x27;s constantly going back and forth in this region here well because he has to apply energy to start with he has to waste some energy and so it&#x27;s not self-sustaining against this factor of six if these equations are applied properly it&#x27;s possible to design a system that would be to sell self-sustaining and it is possible using these equations to design assistant very nicely pawns emplacements all this effect early on they had this one centimeter cube of palladium if they had been electrolyzing for a while here at times and it was doing nothing that they could see and then one day they came in and the apparatus was destroyed in a sample and nobert its way through the beaker and going into the floor and that&#x27;s what very different proof that they have a source of energy that was enormous well what happened the sample was surrounded by water so it could get rid of its heat very readily but it was making some energy down here but overnight its boil the water boiled away and so the ability to get rid of the heat dropped thermal conductivity was reduced because melt was only in their organ yes and so it started to heat and I proceeded to heat control as it heated see withdraw because it going to higher temperature it was losing their charity but it stayed up here long enough to destroy the apparatus and then cool down when they found it the next day so that&#x27;s the possible danger in this particular technology okay well we have another problem here let&#x27;s think that&#x27;s a little bit more of a challenge I know what looks like the the challenge is to figure out what about the surface is universally related to a sample that makes excess energy because you would expect to be able to identify something that is uniquely characteristic of an active surface the problem is that these surfaces are covered with all kinds of crud and if you look at them on the scale that you have to see this you can see almost anything but after examining hundreds of these photomicrographs by other people and by myself there&#x27;s a characteristic that is I find and that is you get a structure like this with holes in it and all of these that I that you can&#x27;t see hopefully you can imagine our surfaces with a similar kind of structure now I don&#x27;t believe that the holes themselves are the nuclear active environment the holes are created by the process the sample uses to release the stress because all these samples were produced in such a way as for this stress in that environment and that stress produces a characteristic morphology in the surface I don&#x27;t so the holes themselves are not the active they only give you the indication that that stress reorganized the surface what I&#x27;m saying is that that stress also produced the Nano cracks in the walls of these holes and that&#x27;s where you have to look to find Jeanne of course all right so just to conclude confusion is real it&#x27;s not related to hot to yoga it requires a significant change in the material to occur and that getting that change in material has been the real big problem to make the text reproducible what you can identify how to make the AK example reproducibly it becomes trivial the present lack of progress is caused by effective guidance to research the theories are so bad that they really do not allow any kind of direction we have to correct that and you don&#x27;t even have to believe my theory and for me to be satisfied you just have to not believe anybody else and well behavior using all isotopes of hydrogen can be explained by a single basic mechanism operating in a single nuclear active environment it&#x27;s not unnecessary to make up a lot of obscure imaginative creative explanations you can do this very simply the nuclear active structure is metallic hydrogen the forms and the nano gaps that he is generated by the formation of helium tritium and deterrence depending upon which isotopes President and transmutation results only as a consequence of a fusion reaction it does not occur can an independent process I haven&#x27;t talked about that but that that would be another lecture that could take all day but transmutation has to follow the same rules that apply to the fusion reaction so anyway thank you very much if you have any questions okay so I don&#x27;t have the mathematical tools available to me to answer your question precisely and like I also argue that they&#x27;re not unnecessary once the concept is accepted anybody will find justification and ask to explain anything the challenge that I&#x27;m offering here is only that okay please look for triggers people are not looking for trivial if you look for treating them and you find tritium then we&#x27;ll talk because then that this theory has legs that no other theory would have and then we&#x27;ll start talking to mathematicians to justify why do you treat us well well your your series predicts trillion by introducing a few assumptions but I can if your theory is right your theories right and the tritium will have a particular given that it came from someone that&#x27;s distinguished and respected as yourself I think this one error in your presentation about the explosion of Rossi&#x27;s reactor rather than the meltdown and I think on a public point of view if that got out from yourself I think it would it would get undue weight so I think it&#x27;s a meltdown rather than an explosion I&#x27;m wouldn&#x27;t be corrected Wells&#x27;s Cardian his job description his lectures described as explosion his words I mean we&#x27;re not talking about a big event like a nuclear bomb we&#x27;re talking about a normal explosion that occurs in a chemical laboratory because once this gets out of control and gets too hot it starts to turn off and the explosion is caused by the increased gas pressure that&#x27;s generated not by the nuclear reaction right it&#x27;s a very safe technology by the way you</p>
