            <p>The formal patent system we recognize today has its origins in Renaissance Europe. The first documented patent law was established in Venice in 1474, marking a groundbreaking concept aimed at fostering innovation. It provided inventors with a temporary monopoly in exchange for disclosing their inventions to society. However, some inventions are legally patented yet kept hidden from public knowledge. In 1951, the United States enacted the Invention Secrecy Act, allowing the government to classify certain technologies and inventions as secret.</p>
<p>If a technology is deemed a threat to national security or the economy, it receives a secrecy order preventing the inventor from discussing, exporting, or selling it except to the United States military. Violating these orders can result in imprisonment or, as we will soon explore, even more severe consequences.</p>
