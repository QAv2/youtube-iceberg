            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hi there today we&#x27;re doing something a little different we are still reading something but this isn&#x27;t going to be well I don&#x27;t know how much of it is true is the thing so this was uh this is a whistleblowers report that came out during a congressional hearing earlier this month about uaps the unidentified anomalous phenomena and uh it&#x27;s quite interesting it&#x27;s quite interesting read and I I kind of wanted to share with you some pieces about this Immaculate Concept ation now as as I am and I hope you are too I always remain skeptical I never 100% believe everything unless I without a shadow of a doubt have had some form of evidence myself like a like a personal encounter etc etc you know something where I can&#x27;t disprove it kind of stuff and I completely believe in it then otherwise it&#x27;s good to stay skeptical so we&#x27;re going to read this because um me and my buddy been talking an awful lot about it and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s quite it&#x27;s quite interesting it&#x27;s quite interesting and I think you might find it the same now this is just a summarized version of the actual testimony from the Congressional hearing but I do have access to the actual full testimony which I I&#x27;ll pop a link in the description below you can read through the whole thing if you really want to if you want me to read it you know if if you pest me enough I&#x27;ll probably do it anyway introduction this document is the result of a multi-year internal investigation into the subjects of unidentified anomalous phenomena uaps Technologies of unknown known origin tuos and non-human intelligence nhi this investigation was undertaken in response to Urgent and credible threats to the public good and safety of the United States of America and provided to Congress through the UAP whistleblower mechanisms established by the FY 23 National Defense authorization Act and the FY 23 National Intelligence authorization act the data consulted during this investigation and summarized in this report originate from non-public data held within the executive branch of the United States government USG the author obtained access to this information while pursuing their lawful duties as an employee of the Department of Defense excuse me this public version of the author&#x27;s report was reviewed and approved for public release by the Department of State Bureau of public sorry Bureau of global public affairs the results of this investigation are deeply disturbing elements of the US executive branch have conspired to prevent the US legislative branch from exercising its lawful powers of governance with respect to the UAP tuo and nhi issues the information provided by the author strongly suggests that the US executive branch has been managing UAP nhi issues without Congressional knowledge oversight or authorization for some time quite possibly decades this criminal conspiracy keeps the elected government of the United States and its citizens ignorant to profound discoveries and dire threats originating from the existence of UAP and hii and their Technologies unambiguous evidence demonstrating the reality of UAP nhi and Duo has been made available to Congress by multiple independent UAP whistleblowers this document is but one item of evidence brought to Congress much more exists and hopefully will be made available in this public version of the report information is organized into seven categories of evidence including an unacknowledged special access program usap imagery intelligence I I me nt Okay human intelligence human signals intelligence Sig USG bureaucratic records USG historical records and other sensitive sources all information in their support is derived from access to non-public information okay well we we have a nice um it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a heavy for warning really about interesting things that are going to come out including there there there&#x27;s even testimony from military personnel it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just interesting it&#x27;s really interesting so section one is about the unacknowledged special access program Immaculate constellation Immaculate constellation is an unacknowledged special Access program established following the public disclosure of the a aipw saap programs by Louis elizando in 2017 upon disclosure to Congress it was determined that the usap and its collateral information have not been lawfully reported to Congress Immaculate consolation primary mission is collecting imagery Intelligence on unidentified aerial phenomena and arv slrv reproduction Vehicles utilizing tasked and unasked US military intelligence resources as part of a network of saps linked to non-human intelligence and UAP Technologies Immaculate constellation acts as a Nexus for collecting analyzing and disseminating Intelligence on the activities capabilities and locations of anomalous Aerospace threats that originate from foreign or unidentified sources interesting the intelligence within the immaculate constellation program cons primarily consists of high quality imagery intelligence and collateral measurement and signatures intelligence of uaps and arv RVs within Earth&#x27;s atmosphere The Collection platforms involved are a blend of tasked and unasked capabilities in low earth orbit the upper atmosphere military and civilian Aviation altitudes and Maritime environments Immaculate consolation pays particular attention to anomalous Aerospace platforms that have been developed through the study or acquisition of Technologies of Unknown Origin by Foreign Nations or unknown entities UAP and arv RV signatures and preferred operating areas are known to the program enabling a degree of strategic awareness and warning finally Immaculate constellation shows that UAP and arvs are operating around the globe often in close proximity to sensitive foreign assets and locations okay that part&#x27;s a bit strange sensitive foreign assets what do you mean you what what what would you class as a sensitive for an asset sorry let&#x27;s keep going the categor of Immaculate constellation as a parent usap with various child saps under its umbrella indicates a high level of compartmentalization and secrecy in effect Immaculate constellation serves as a central part as C sorry serves as a central or parent usap that consolidates observations of UAP and arv activities detected by tasked and unasked collection platforms sophisticated internal information security controls are a major part of the Immaculate constellation program which enforces compartmentalization by detecting quarantining and transferring UAP and RV imagery collection incidents before they are circulated within the military intelligent Enterprise in conclusion Immaculate constellation shows that the USG is not only aware of uaps and tuo but also foreign State efforts to replicate UAP and tuo capabilities the data within Immaculate constellation reveals the capacity of the US armed services and Military Intelligence Community to detect track identify and engage anomalous trans medium platforms Immaculate constellation also demonstrates the extent capability to detect quarantine and transfer UAP and RV collection incidents before they are observed and circulated within the military intelligence Enterprise partially explaining why many otherwise cleared members of the military and IC are unaware of UAP activities finally the existence of Immaculate constellation provides verifiable evidence of the right of the of the witting the witting participation by elements of the US armed services defense civil service and the intelligence community in a global surveillance and reconnaissance mission tasked with monitoring uaps and arv RVs so to summarize that Immaculate constellation is not publicly announced this has been whistleblowing but the whole point of Immaculate constellation is they are gathering every piece of information they can about uaps nhis tuos all basically anything that is not known right which I&#x27;m not me good to say aliens let&#x27;s not jump the gun here we don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s the key word here they gather evidence and information on things we don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s essentially it and in some cases if they can also properly get evidence of it like say maybe take some of it with them to investigate and dissect and stuff well they do that too interesting very interesting section two USG imagery intelligence the USG United States government if you couldn&#x27;t figure that out maintains imagery intelligence datab bases accessible to personnel with appropriate security clearances and Mission need these databases are scattered across various organizations and services leading to a fragmented ownership structure this dispersion complicates the timely and comprehensive Gathering of IM related to unidentified aerial phenomenon control over access to these data sets primarily reside with the military intelligence Enterprise the combatant commands the armed services and individual program managers the IM Min collected from data sets available to the dod Department of and reviewed for this report provide compelling evidence for UAP which survived prosaic explanations there was a large number of unique imagery sensors available to the US Military and intelligence Community including infrared forward-looking infrared full motion video thermal and still photography the multitude of wavelengths collected by these sensors have captured UAP characteristics that are difficult or impossible to observe with the human eye alone I I could I could agree I could agree with that we&#x27;ve certainly captured evidence of things that we can&#x27;t explain 100% not everything don&#x27;t get me wrong I don&#x27;t think all of it&#x27;s true like there are plenty of fake evidence out there but yet again and this is one of my big arguments there&#x27;s so much of this stuff if even 1% of it is true makes you [ __ ] Wonder right anyway um subtle atmospheric effects associated with uaps are visible through the sensors deployed by the US Military and intelligence agencies enabling unique analytical techniques the verifiable chain of custody for UAP IM collected by US military assets ensures a high level of confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the data gathered the following examples are presented centcom cuboard formation of metallic orbs on USG networks there exists daytime FMV and daytime fli the forward infrared footage of a formation of of 12 metallic orbs roughly roughly 12 metallic orbs skimming the ocean surface at high speed before dispersing in multiple directions the rapid and agile maneuvering of the metallic orbs were incompatible with known Aerospace vehicles and were between 3 to 6 m in diameter in the opening segment of the footage the roughly 12 metallic orbs flew in a tight cuboid formation the metallic orbs were in three vertical Square formations of about four orbs each arranged in a three-pronged configuration creating the illusion of a cube shape at distance interesting all the orbs were white hot against the black cold ocean in the F footage and each sphere created a faint atmospheric Distortion both around itself and as a heat Shimmer contrail the metallic orbs moved in this Cube formation over the ocean for some time before rapidly breaking formation as paars the sensor platform lost track of most the metallic orbs as they ascended in altitude and accelerated in speed but maintained observation on a pair of met talic corpse continuing through the original trajectory of the larger formation centcom fast mover observed transiting over sensitive facilities on USG networks there exists Fleer footage of a small medium oval UAP flying at high speed and low to the surface the footage begins all routine surveillance of a sensitive Coastal facility when the oval UAP rapidly comes into frame as it flies above Coastal facilities the oval UAP then makes a rapid turn towards the ocean where it is tracked by The Collection platform the oval UAP is tracked flying low over the open ocean at high speed before the track is lost okay I mean there&#x27;s not a massive amount of information in that one maybe maybe Indo pom intelligence vessels positioned to collect on reproduction vehicle interesting on USG networks there exists infrared footage of an imagery there exists informative footage of and imagery of a grouping of vessels engaged in Sig and massin collection at night in a specific area of the Pacific Ocean right in this footage which was in close proximity to the vessels a large equilateral triangle UAP suddenly appears directly over the ships three bright points are seen at each bottom corner of the UAP which is observed to slowly rotate his horizontal AIS this rotation partially reveals a horizontal bar of sweeping lights intelligence analysis associated with this event specifies that the equilateral triangle is a reproduction vehicle and concludes that the vessels must have been aware of the RV&#x27;s frequent use of these coordinates due to foreign pre-positioning of advanced collection assets at the exact time and place after a brief period of hovering and slowly rotating approximately 500 to 1,000 meters above the ocean the RV suddenly disappears and the footage ends interesting indopacom equilateral triangle UAP Tails unwitting vessel on us networks there exists infrared footage of an equilateral triangle UAP approximately fighter jet sized hovering less than 200 m above a vessel in the night at a location in the Pacific intelligence analysis associated with this event specifies that the equilateral triangle is an arv of Unknown Origin this vessel gives no signs that it is aware of the arv maintaining altitude and bearing directly overhead two lights on the underside of the arv are visible while a third is blocked from view due to a slightly upward angle of orientation okay indopacom large dis using clouds as concealment on USG networks there exists OPI footage of a larger saucer of a large saucer shaped UAP emerging from within a dense cloud formation the saucer registered black hot against white cold with atmospheric disturbances caused by the saucer shaped UAP visible the saucer was between 200 to 400 m in circumference and displayed SYM symmetrical concavities on the upper surface well that&#x27;s a really weird description the saucer shaped UAP emerges at a shallow angle traveling upwards towards the upper atmosphere sorry outer atmosphere after breaking above the cloud cover the saler shade to UAP suddenly reverses its direction descending partially back into the cloud cover then accelerating rapidly out of frame and partially obscured by the cloud Tops This Behavior was evasive in nature and implied that the salsa shaped UAP had become aware that it was under observation by a space based collection platform h that be a satellite then interesting into Pon Boomerang UAP observed by Pilot and sensor site on USG networks there exists Fleer footage of a swept Boomerang UAP maneuvering at an uncertain altitude location off the east coast of a country the UAP is tracked against clouds by the sensor Suite of the operating craft the UAP is observed rapidly decelerating to a stationary hover followed by the sudden emission of a sphere of light from the junction of the two Wings which expands to partially engulf the craft in a rotating sphere of light at which point the available footage ends it&#x27;s weird that we don&#x27;t know much as the fact is some of this footage ends is weird right just I don&#x27;t know something suspicious about that northcom jellyfish UAP crosses us Mexico border I&#x27;m sorry jellyfish okay on USU networks there exists flare footage of an irregularly shaped UAP flying across the southern border the UAP appeared to Fleer to be muttle irregularly with hot/ cold emissions and approximated a jellyfish or floating brain with hanging appendages in appearance that&#x27;s weird I&#x27;ve never heard of like a a shape like that obviously jellyfish but I&#x27;m saying like as a as a UAP I&#x27;ve never heard of a UAP Report with a shape like that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s pretty weird that&#x27;s pretty weird the UAP flew Against the Wind with no visible means of propulsion maintained an unnatural rigidity in its movements and flight path and maintained a comparatively low altitude to geographic features in appearance of behavior footage of this UAP violating the airspace of the Southern border resembled the same class of uaps observed near uh Department of Defense facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan there exists at least one compilation video of this class of UAP sourced from DOD Force protection assets and the ISR which uses this footage as a point of comparison so it&#x27;s not the first time something like this has been seen that&#x27;s interesting I&#x27;d like to see some of that footage that&#x27;s really interesting some jellyfish type uaps that&#x27;s interesting northcom supersonic rang Fowler intercepts usn fighter on USG networks there exists Fleer footage and radar data of a supersonic UAP of Uncertain characteristics conducting a head-on intercept of a usn fighter operating off the Eastern SE keyboard the UAP is observed emerging from a cloud bank at high speed and approaching the usn aircraft headon rapidly passing over the left side of a cockpit radar data from this approach tracks the UAP on its approach towards the craft providing information on speed heading and elevation interesting ah Tic Tacs I&#x27;ve heard about these shapes southcom Tic Tac detected by space asset in proximity of vessel oh on USG networks there exists opir imagery and massin of a Tic Tac UAP trans in through an area of the Atlantic Ocean the Tic Tac Maneuvers an altitude at or near local cloud cover and correlated electromagnetic signatures were collected by Mas in the available footage of the Tic Tac UAP transits rapidly through the field of regard as it transits the ocean okay no observed reaction is seen to come from The Vessel but it&#x27;s approximate but its proximity in time and space of the trajectory of this UAP suggests for knowledge of the UAP event by intelligence that&#x27;s quite quite a variety of interesting reports of of footage and imagery which sadly we don&#x27;t get to see here I think we do get to see a little bit of it in the actual proper full testimony stuff I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not 100% sure don&#x27;t quote me I haven&#x27;t fully read that because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like 200 pages is a lot section three defense human intelligence reporting we&#x27;d be here all day the USG maintains a database of intelligence collected by military personnel across a plethora of topics ah so this is like the the military reports including UAP these individual reports are considered raw because they have not undergone evaluation corroboration or contextualization into a finished analytical product by military intelligence Community analysts great a significant volume of reports documenting firsthand encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena or unidentified flying objects by DOD Personnel exists within defense human databases many of these UAP reports are filed by military aviators and Pilots as well as service members trained in for military intelligence collection activities and often include photographic evidence and censor data when aggregated these reports reveal significant information on UAP this section is directly informed by reviewing over 400 defense human reports on encounters with uaps and UFOs by USG Personnel spanning from 1991 to 2022 over 400 reports by military personnel over the Spanish about 30 years but that&#x27;s that&#x27;s still something that&#x27;s still that&#x27;s still a significant number it must be noted that this data set is not exhaustive other hum data sources exist which are emitted from this analysis so there might even be more we&#x27;re just not allowed to see all of it yet we only have access to a certain data set I see I see oh excuse me the defense hum data set summarizes here highlights notable Trends in the report reported stream and are presented here along with specific examples common UAP UFO shapes observed in defense hum data set from 1991 to 2022 the most common UAP shapes reported in this USG data set were spheres and orbs discs and salers ovals and Tic Tacs triangles Boomerang Arrowhead and a regular SL organic organic interesting the triangle Boomerang Arrowhead shapes were by far the rarest and spheres the most common variations of morphology Within These categories are present I.E smooth spheres and spheres with protuberances saucers without domes and saucers with domes smooth ovals and ovals with surface structures jellyfish or floating brains with appendages and elongated triangles as well as equilateral triangles yes interesting interesting interesting sphere or orb spheres with the most reported shape with variations ranging from smooth featureless orbs to spheres with visible openings or appendages these objects prevalent suggests a possible standard in UAP design or function capable of high maneuverability and speed the diversity within the sphere category spanning from simple polished appearances to more complex structures with appendages suggests a broad range of purposes or Technologies unique to the platform&#x27;s mission Andor the originator getting thirsty discr salcer saucer shaped uaps reported with and without domes were the second most common shape reported flat sourcers were reported as well these being dis- likee objects without pronounced domes traditional biconvex uaps are also reported in the data oval or Tic Tac oval-shaped uaps were infrequently reported within the data set and only after approximately 2003 these uaps either maintained a uniform egg-like symmetry occasionally tapered into a teardrop shape cylinders with convex ends to Tacs fall into this category and occasionally feature visible protuberances on the top or bottom of the otherwise uniform platform triangle triangles were among the rarest uaps reported in the data most of these sightings were equilateral triangles occasionally with vertical stabilizers visible on the top of the UAP elongated isoceles types were also reported occasionally with the same vertical stabilizers observed on the equilateral type Boomerang or Arrowhead boomerangs and Arrowhead shaped uaps were also among the rarest reported the boomerang uaps exhibited bilateral symmetry with sweeping wings at a high aspect ratio Arrowhead uaps also showed bilateral symmetry but possess tapered Wings in a low aspect ratio typically with highly swept Le leading edges irregular or organic I&#x27;m really curious about these ones irregularly shaped uaps those that defy simple geometric geometric description were among the rarest reported sightings shape-shifting uaps also appear in the data set typically having a spherical or dislike base form from which a regular geometries are seen to project floating brain or jellyfish uaps are present as well characterized by a Central Mass from which multiple arms or spars hang downward finally combined shapes were also observed including cubes within spheres ring dis saucers and various rectangular and Cube Ward forms it&#x27;s [ __ ] interesting really interesting common observable behaviors and characteristics of the shapes uh table one sphere and orb so observable size details sizes range from small objects to those several meters in diameter speed capable of stationary hovering to Rapid acceleration speed surpassing conventional aircraft have been noted signatures often like conventional signatures such as heat Trails electromagnetic effects on Military Electronics reported colors varied with gray SL metallic grayish blue white white yellow and red and orange red being prevalent surface details ranges from completely smooth and reflective to having visible protuberances appendages concavities and openings behaviors High maneuverability including abrupt Direction changes in the ability to hover often observed to fly in complex geometrical formations and to operate in tandem atmospheric phenomena occasional disturbances in cloud formations and Heatwave contra Trails have been reported biological effects close observers report a feelings of unease and of electronic device malfunctions table two dis SL saucer size generally range from a few meters to over 20 m in diameter speed exhibits capabilities for both hovering and high-speed flight often making sudden Sprints signatures radar detection varies visual sightings more common some reports include a humming sound colors metallic silver or gray is common though some have been reported as emitting light or changing color surface details variations include smooth featureless surfaces to those with visible domes or segmented panels behaviors sudden vertical ascents hovering and Silent operation some reports indicate the ability to become visible or blend into the sky unique emissions instances of electromagnetic interference in nearby devices and vehicles an atmospheric phenomena visual disturbances shimmering air or sudden fog formation H shimmering air or sudden fog formation that&#x27;s kind of weird smokes screen Table Three oval tictac size lengths typically from 6 to 40 m maintaining proportional width and height that&#x27;s pretty big man speed highspeed travel and instant acceleration have been frequently reported with no Sonic Boom but how clearly it&#x27;s some mode of transportation we&#x27;re not aware of if it could move so insanely fast that it has like no effect on the sound barrier and stuff right signatures visual identification often notes a lack of contrail colors white or silver H surface details uniformly smooth surface with occasional reports of protuberances that could be sensors propulsion elements weapons or unknown technology behaviors observed ability to hover and then accelerate suddenly some encounters describe them maintaining stable positions despite high winds triangular size medium to large size ranging from F16 to football field size yes so that one doesn&#x27;t come in meters okay speed capable of slow precise movement as well as rapid acceleration to speeds Beyond conventional aircraft fun signatures often reported to emit soft humming sound may affect electronic devices within a certain proximity colors black or dark gray sometimes with white lights at the corners and a central red light reports of twinkling stars across [Music] surface surface details some have been described with visible surface textures like panels or ridges and occasionally stabilizers behaviors hovering is common all as is Silent Flight the ability to suddenly vanish or accelerate rapidly is frequently reported unique emissions triangular uaps often emit Focus beams of light toal light patterns are sometimes observed to emanate from a central point leading to Rapid acceleration or disappearance biological effects long-term psychological effects such as anxiety or insomnia have been noted alongside the feeling of being watched or shared awareness with the triangle UAP Boomerang SL Arrowhead size wingspans can exceed 30 meters especially for Boomerang shaped uaps aads typically range from F-16 size to a slightly larger speed exhibits both gliding at low speed and the capacity for high-speed flight signatures visual sightings often note a slow Silent Flight profile colors typically dark blending with a night sky though some reports include glowing edges or tips surface details smooth surfaces with a notable aerodynamic design the the arrowhead type show more triangular features sorry behaviors known for silent operation and the ability to execute tight turns unique emissions seen to emit a spherical ball of light from the central line which partially envelops the UAP during Maneuvers causing electromagnetic interference with local Technologies Table Six a regular SL organic size highly variable from small compact forms to larger more sprawling structures speed movements range from slow drifting to Rapid acceleration often unpredictable signatures some reports include unusual sounds or the absence of expected aerodynamic noise electromagnetic effects are common colors often described with bioluminescent qualities or shifting colors particularly for floating brain or jellyfish types surface details descriptions vary widely from smooth fluid-like surfaces to complex articulated structures Behavior demonstrates a wide range of behaviors from control maneuvering to erratic patterns of movement shape-shifting abilities have been reported biological effects observations include physical sensations of warmth or cold unexplained smells example ozone and psychological distress unique emissions the floating brain jellyfish uaps occasionally exhibit patterned luminescence or fluctuating light/ colors typically only visible in the higher end of the electromagnetic spectrum cool atmospheric phenomena sudden temperature drops and the appearance of clouds have been reported one sec I gotta relax throat right it&#x27;s better examples of Defense hum reports on UAP so this is some of some of the examples of the reports that they&#x27;ve been getting close encounter by CVN Flight Deck person Personnel while in active duty in the Pacific Flight Deck Personnel working night Duty experienced a close encounter with a spherical UAP of medium to large size on duty Flight Deck crew observed a small orange red sphere maneuvering at high altitude above the CVN shortly after first observation the UAP rapidly descended from high altitude to a position directly above the flight deck of the CVN height approximately 100 to 200 yards the UAP maintained altitude and match speed with the underway CVN for an uncertain period observing Personnel reported altered perceptions of time during the close encounter the uaps appear to emit a soft orange red light which bizarrely did not illuminate the ocean or the flight deck of the CVN despite the visual appearance of intense Luminosity the surface of the UAP was observed to be dynamic rolling like the surface of the Sun the UAP took no reported actions during the encounter only maintaining a close in proximity to the CVN after an uner period the UAP suddenly shot into the air disappearing at a point high above the CVN observing Personnel felt as if they snapped out of a trance and sense of profound unease the instant report concludes with noting that the CVN had not responded in any way to what was perceived as a hostile interception by the UAP metallic orbs intercept F22 on conis air surveillance and control Mission while performing a routine airspace surveillance and control mission in the Eastern air defense sector an F22 fighter observed multiple UAP contacts at Mission altitude moving to intercept the F-22 pilot noted multiple metallic orbs slightly smaller than a sedan hovering in place upon vectoring towards the uaps a smaller formation of the metallic orbs accelerated at rapid speed towards the F22 which was unable to establish radar locks on the presumed hostile uaps the F22 broke trajectory and attempted to evade but was intercepted and Boxed In by approximately 3 to six uaps one UAP maneuvered in proximity little greater than 12 meters so the area directly standard of the C star sorry to the area directly starboard of the cockpit there the UAP established a rigid spatial relationship with the F22 maintaining its exact position and orientation parallel with the f-22&#x27;s cockpit despite multiple evasive roles and Maneuvers surrounded by the presumed hostile uaps the F22 is forced out of the mission area under the escort of the UAP formation that&#x27;s pretty freaky if that&#x27;s true that is real freaky man perimeter of sensitive facility breached by UAP at a military Airfield located on the Eastern Seaboard ground Personnel reported a lengthy low altitude intrusion late at night by a small spherical UAP the UAP displayed visual signature management appearing as a blurry sphere around which light was assorted or bent this effect emanated outward from the central sphere giving the appearance of a he Haze or Misty volume of distorted light ground Personnel reported eye strains headaches and a feeling of unease or dread while observing this dark sphere the UAP was first observed while slowly crossing the runway moving in the direction of a sensitive area once again the UAP hovered above a grouping of ground equipment before floating further towards a building within the sensitive area the UAP then floated the building before suddenly disappearing ground Personnel were uncertain of the length of the encounter but estimate their observation lasted between 10 to 15 minutes some interesting interesting little military accounts really is section four Department of Defense bureaucratic records discrepancies found throughout the internal records of AO and DOD interactions with Congress cast serious doubts on the Integrity of the dod statements of the elected leaders of the United States government extent transcripts held by DOD leadership show a pattern of trivialization obfuscation and outright denial of UAP data and what were intended to be highly classified private and transparent conversations with appropriate Congressional members this same behavior also prevents critical members of Congress from receiving an accurate assessment of the National Security risks posed by uaps basically Congress ain&#x27;t being told everything and they were supposed to be specific examples known to the author include denying the existence of multiple compartmented access programs owned by a military intelligence agent agency which directly related to the UAP Mission denying the existence of joint dodin Department special access programs directly related to the UAP mission in the study of tuo and finally the denial of the existence of Immaculate constellation by DOD representatives to appropriate Congressional members in their staff separately additional internal records confirm the claims of Mr Lou elzando regarding aatp aap&#x27;s Mission activities and findings additional documents support the exceptional character and credibility of Mr elzando these non-public documents include letters of commendation service award nominations performance promotion reviews archived email chains and a AIP aawsap program briefings which directly corroborate the public statements of Mr alzando these records also provide additional insight into the activities of these organizations the evolution of the program&#x27;s findings and its interactions with senior DOD leaders ship finally these records provide insight to highly classified and suppressed areas of scientific research and Technology development derived from the study and exploitation of UAP and nhi Technologies section five restricted USG historical records g162 d78 this serial number corresponds to an official NSA report published in 1978 the existence and content of this report was verified by accessing the appropriate intelligence archives the substance of the report concerns scientific research in the Soviet Union on the topics of Paras psychology Sai and biological effects of UAP on human beings Additionally the existence of the report stream sorry the existence of the reporting stream demonstrates the US intelligence was explicitly tasked to collect on foreign entities active in areas often relegated to the fringes of scientific research in including parapsychology and the biological effects of encounters with UAP the fact that significant intelligence sources were dedicated to understanding and exploiting information related to uaps and nhis highlights a strategic commitment to understanding the full scope of UAP nhi and tuo these and other classified accounts provide a rare glimpse a rare public Glimpse revealed The Contours of a secret of decades long competition between major terrestrial powers to collect exploit and field novel techn techologies derived from the study of UAP and nhi section six signals intelligence a substantial body of sensitive signals intelligence collected from peer and near peer countries demonstrate foreign awareness of UAP events occurring over their sensitive military and intelligence facilities including nuclear weapons facilities due to the exceptionally sensitive nature of the sources and methods involved only General conclusions are provided here foreign countries are known to have observed uaps whose signatures and behaviors correlate to those observed by the United States these UAP events are treated by the security apparatuses of each state as serious National Security threats due to UAP and proximity to sensitive military and intelligence facilities these facilities are most often associated with Aerospace defense strategic deterrence and Military sponsored scientific research and development on multiple occasions each of these nations have attempted to intercept and shoot down uaps VI ating their territorial airspace and the airspace over sensitive facilities foreign countries have internal organizations dedicated to studying the ambiguous threat posed by uaps deducing scientific principles through observing UAP and the careful management of public perceptions of the UAP issue section seven sensitive sources from mouth to ear well that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a nice quick chapter conclusion the offcial disclosure of the existence of non-human intelligences and their presence on Earth is a pivotal moment in human history the nature of this information is of such incomparable relevance to the public good that it demands to be shared some may object and say the disclosure at this time poses too many risks to them it must be said that we will never be able to predict how individuals families communities and Nations will react to Revelations of such magnitude moving forward we must guard against the lure of authoritarian Solutions justified by expediency and appeals to National Security the good in humanity will always Triumph through time and it is in moments of Crisis that our and it is in moments of Crisis that our capacities for achieving the extraordinary are discovered Be not Afraid well so that&#x27;s um that&#x27;s the summary of the Congressional hearing that happened based about Immaculate consolation and the whistle blower which um I believe there was a journalist who brought this report forward from The Whistleblower because the whistleblower&#x27;s identity was not revealed I can tell you that it was a journalist Michael shellenberger who brought this forward and um yeah so so a lot of this information can now be found publicly uh some of it is through the uh I believe it&#x27;s the mace house the Nancy mace house she&#x27;s she&#x27;s a republican congresswoman uh out of South Carolina for for example the if you Google Immaculate constellation I mean it it&#x27;ll pop up it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s hard to find but yet again I will provide links in the description below of the entire testimony of the entire actual hearing and then obviously this little um simplified one as well because I find it to be a little bit easier to read but I thought this was I thought this was interesting because yet again it opens up the the idea of discussion and I think it&#x27;s important to remember that whether whether aliens exists whether they have been observing us or not it we we we can&#x27;t say we don&#x27;t know 100% for sure you know we have bits and pieces we&#x27;ve got this T there&#x27;s tons of evidence tons of evidence doesn&#x27;t mean all of it&#x27;s true that&#x27;s the thing right that&#x27;s the thing and I mean I hate to be sounding like I&#x27;m [ __ ] on it but we have to remember you can&#x27;t take everything at face value you can&#x27;t you have to do your research you have to understand things you have to look at things from more perspectives you need to be willing to make informed decisions yourself before you immediately put on the tinfoil hat and just jump into a conspiracy theory mindset I am merely bringing you information that was brought forward to Congress to United States government and was shared was whistle blown about what could or could not be real but we do know that there are government programs investigating these sorts of things we do know that there are there&#x27;s video evidence of a lot of these things which yet again I&#x27;m not saying all of them are true but after a point it does make you [ __ ] wonder what if one of them is and if even one of them is that&#x27;s something right I feel the same when it comes to ghosts and paranormal and Supernatural and all that [ __ ] too but uh but this literally happened this month November 2024 and I just thought it&#x27;d be interesting to share because it&#x27;s um it is interesting it&#x27;s very interesting the fact that the government government is willing to share this information I think it&#x27;s good I think it&#x27;s progress it&#x27;s progress into opening up discussions and information and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s yet again a reminder that humanity is willing to grow and willing to learn we have to be patient we have to be understanding but we&#x27;re all in this together the end of the day we&#x27;re the human race no reason to not try stuff no reason to not learn with each other and the more information we have the more accurate the information could be I love it I&#x27;ve been Nate at night I uh I&#x27;ve had a wonderful time and I sure hope you have too if you want me to read uh more things like this or maybe continue following these kind of stories or if there&#x27;s anything else you want me to continue investigating please let me know it&#x27;s with your love and support that I will continue doing this sort of work well we will see you next time bye-bye thank you so much to my YouTube members and patreon members for all the love and support thanks to people like you that we
