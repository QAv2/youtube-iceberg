            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel this is uh a channel for educational purposes we try to tune into some of the uh greatest theories of everything that I know of from many years of research digging around curiosity and um trying to bring to you things that you may not know about but that if you did know about them they would benefit your life in countless ways help you with your new fa new paradigm formation your PR preparation for um 5D Consciousness today is our 418th video on the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory that a system of theory that was first originated by dwey B Larson and in 1959 Mr Larson proposed his two fundamental postulates which was uh uh a product of him boiling down all of his uh research from the last uh 20 25 years 30 years even of um trying to figure out how the universe operated he had a few epiphanies and a few leads and he um you know worked it out um over the course of time and then he took those two fundamental postulates and derived through a process of deduction a long process of deduction he derived a theoretical Universe about how the universe would look if the universe operated the way that he said said that they do that it does and then in his books he compared his theoretical Universe with the uh empirical Universe the measured universe of the Legacy scientist that they have um you know measured in their Laboratories and combin uh compiled in their scientific tables and um we are looking at one of the results of that uh that effort which is called basic properties of matter this book is primarily about chemistry and it uh looks at some of the basic properties of matter and uh Compares larsson&#x27;s theoretical results he deres equations for each one of the basic properties of matter or a number of equations in some cases for the basic properties of matter and then compares them with the scientific tables and um we are uh in Chapter 2 of this book U I think this is the um uh third or fourth um installment of this uh fourth installment of this chapter in about the 13th installment of the whole book um and this chapter is on interatomic distances um and uh so the uh two fundamental postulates of Larson are one the universe is composed primarily of or not primarily entirely the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two fundamental as uh two reciprocal aspects space and time and the second postulate is um more mundane that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukan uh so the second postulate is just kind of uh almost a priori like the way that you you know you have to pretty much just say well two two 2 plus 2 equals four you know um we have to the the laws of math work the same um you know today as they did yesterday uh so so it&#x27;s kind of just you have to agree to the second uh postulate almost just in order to do science but um many people have disagreed with the second postulate including me uh in terms of the ukian geometry uh I do I have been convinced that there are other forms of geometry that are more inclusive projective geometry in fact includes uh ukian geometry as a subset so um Bruce Pratt among others has uh proposed an alternative second uh fundamental postulate that uh gets rid of the commutative mathematics and the uh absolute magnitudes and the ukian geometry I&#x27;m pretty much on board with that but I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s all that important at this point the first postulate is uh is the uh real breakthrough for Larson and uh I could restate that as just saying you know the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion and in particular it&#x27;s made out of a kind of motion that is called scalar motion scaler motion is a more generalized and um a non-localized motion a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction you can Envision scalar motion uh if you take a balloon and uh with a magic marker you put dots on the balloon if you blow up the balloon all all of the dots will be moving away from each other that is a scalar motion there is no specific Direction every dot is moving away from every other dot um and um there is no you know way to Mark the directions there um the only way that you&#x27;d be able to do that is to assign a reference point that is to say that one of the dots arbitrarily is motionless and by you know saying that one of the dots is motionless then you can start uh you know measuring the directions to the other dots and um so this scalar motion is really the motion that is uh of what the universe is constructed you can see that in if you look at um first that motion is the relationship between space and time so that is where Larson gets the name the reciprocal system of theory space and time are reciprocals of one another generally they uh have identical qualities but in different order the same way that 3 over one and and 1 over3 uh are reciprocals of one another they have the same qualities but they are in different order and um motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator time or space as the denominator all of our basic scientific qu qualities quantities are motions U matter is a motion energy is a motion acceleration is a motion momentum is a motion um force is a motion and they all have different time space uh coordinates or you know spaces on the fraction because both time and space can come in uh three dimensional three dimensions uh or even more but uh Larson says uh universe is made out of motion and motion um can come in uh in three dimensions he calls that coordinate space and coordinate time so also a spatial reference system and a temporal reference system uh think of XYZ coordinates or volume in space in a still frame that would be your coordinate space and three dimensions of time in a still frame would be your coordinate time three dimensions of space and time so for example matter matter is time to the thir power over space to the thir power energy is time over space speed is space over time acceleration is space over time to the second power um and you can come up with those time space coordinates for all your basic scientific quantities uh which is a huge improvement over the MKS system where you have three different qualities or quantities you have mass and then you have space and time the m KS system meter kilog second and so now you can just take that kilogram of mass and you can um turn that into T to the 3 power over s the 3 power and so now you&#x27;re just dealing with two variables instead of three um now also uh another uh important prong of the uh first postulate is that space and time come only in discrete units they are quantized you have to have a full unit before you have anything you have to have a full unit of space before you have space you have to have a full unit of time before you have time if you have one unit of space in one unit of time one over 1 equals 1 Larson calls that unit speed unit speed is also the speed of light and so this speed of light is the center of Larson&#x27;s universe uh in order to basically embark on a study of the reciprocal system you have to uh you have to be able to be okay with the concept of motion existing without anything moving without anything motion exists before anything that would be moving and in fact the thing that would be moving is motion itself um and so in Larson&#x27;s empty universe or his zero zero point or his null Point origin of the universe is the speed of light outward in all directions scalar motion uh just like on an expanding balloon outward in all directions and um that occurs in both space and time and uh then Larson makes me Larsson calls that the progression of the natural reference system you can kind of think of it as the you know the flow of time the flow of space um the progression of the natural reference system now if you suck in that balloon that&#x27;s the opposite Force the Contracting balloon where all of the dots are moving toward each other that is akin to gravitation again though um that doesn&#x27;t uh imply a graad gravitational field you only can get a gravitational field is it when you assign a reference point and when you say that one of these dots is motionless and then you can start looking at the relations between the individual dots before then it&#x27;s just all the dots are moving toward each other now um within the discrete unit postulate it sets up two boundary it sets up a boundary between uh the the unit speed boundary um so it sets up two different sectors of the universe a material sector and a cosmic sector in the material sector the motion is slower than the speed of light in the cosmic sector the motion is faster than the speed of light light and they are reciprocals of each other in the material sector you have relations based on three dimensions of space in a still frame and progressing or flowing time uh time is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and then in the cosmic sector when you cross that speed of light boundary and go to faster than light speed then you have relations based on coordinate time three dimensions of time in a still frame and clock space the flow of space um space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart just like on the surface of an expanding balloon now but what this also does is within each of those sectors Larson calls those the material sector and the cosmic sector within those sectors you also have a sub region uh uh again due to the discrete unit postulate the um within the material sector um if you have uh interactions that are based in less than one unit of space you don&#x27;t have space you have to have a full unit so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit you don&#x27;t have space and so you only have time and so that is what Larson calls the time region and when you cross that unit distance boundary you change the rules again the rules change and um the directions change the progression now becomes Inward and gravitation becomes outward same is true in the cosmic sector except with time instead of space when you have interactions that occur in less than one unit of time then you don&#x27;t have time and you only have space and Larson calls that the space region and in the space region um gravitation moves outward in space and the progression moves in uh the progression moves inward in I&#x27;m sorry in time and um these two regions are the you know these are the Realms of uh Atomic and molecular interactions so that is relevant here where Larson is discussing the um interatomic distance the interatomic distance is basically an equilibrium that is established within the time region uh where the constant uh motion of the progression of the natural ref system which is inward um is balanced by gravitation which is outward which is variable so you have to figure out the distance at which gravitation becomes equal to the progression okay so we&#x27;ll go from there we&#x27;ll see see what happens here he uh we we went through a few of the groups of atoms um and he kind of compared he did compare uh his results um but now we&#x27;re going into division three which is Larson divides the periodic table into four divisions uh division one and two are electr positives on the left side division three and four are on the right side um Electro negatives division 2 and division three um maintain a veilance of four or more and so um that&#x27;s kind of how that goes because of the greater probability of the electropositive types of combinations the characteristics of division 2 carry over into the first elements of division 3 and these elements nickel Palladium and lutetium are included in the table some similar modifications of the normal division boundaries have already been noted in connection with other subjects the net total rotation of the material atom is a motion with positive displacement that is a speed less than unity and as such it normally results in a change of position in space inside unit space however in the the time region all motion is in time the orientation of the atom for the purposes of the SpaceTime equilibrium therefore exists in the three dimensions of time as we saw in our examination of the inter Regional situation in chapter 12 of volume one uh which is called Nothing But motion each of these Dimensions contacts the space of uh of the region outside unit distance individually so each one of the dimensions is independent to the extent that the motion in a dimension of time acts along the line of this contact it is a motion in equivalent space otherwise it has no spatial effect beyond the unit boundary because of the independence of the three dimensions of motion in time relative the relative orientation of the electric rotation of any combination of atoms may be the same in all spatial Dimensions or there may be two or three different orientations in most of the elements that have been discussed thus far the orientation is the same in all spatial dimensions and in the exceptions of alternate rotations and in the exceptions the alternate rotations are symmetrically distributed in the solid structure the force system of an aggregate of such elements is isotropic it follows that any aggregate of atoms of these elements has a structure in which the constituents are arranged in one of the geometrical patterns possible for equal forces an isometric Crystal all of the electropositive elements divisions one and two crystallize in isometric forms and except for a few which apparently have quite complex structures each of the crystal forms of these elements belongs to one of or another of three types the face centered Cube the body centered Cube or the hexagonal Clos pack structure we now turn to the other major subdivision of the elements the electr negative class those whose normal electric displacement is negative here the force system is not necessarily isotropic since the most probable arrangement in one or two Dimensions may be the negative orientation a direct combination of two negative electric displacements similar to the all positive combinations uh just uh as an ed editorial here uh you can see uh as Larson moves through these different subjects that probability takes such a large um uh importance in in his deductions okay he&#x27;s always uh he&#x27;s using a deductive process if this then that to construct his theoretical universe and in doing so he uses the probability principles uh and you know recognizes that you know what what happens is the most probable thing um and or if there&#x27;s close probabilities between two things then maybe two things can different two different things can happen but uh you know he has to apply the pr the principles of probability to determine um the if this then that uh aspects of many of his derivations of deduction okay so uh division 2 is not necessarily isotropic and U one or two Dimensions may be negative uh the negative orientation a direct combination of two negative electric displacements similar to the all positive combination it is not POS possible to have negative orientation in all three dimensions and wherever it does exist in one or two Dimensions the rotational forces of the atoms are necessarily um anisotropic the controlling factor is the requirement that the net total rotational displacement of a material atom as a whole must be positive negative orientation in all three dimensions is obviously incompatible with this requirement but if the negative displacement is restricted to one dimension the aggregate has fixed Atomic positions in two Dimensions with a fixed average position in the third because of the positive displacement of the atom as a whole this results in a crystal structure that is essentially equivalent to one with fixed positions in all Dimensions such crystals are not usually isometric as the interatomic distance in the odd Dimension is generally different from that of the other two where the distances in all Dimensions do happen to coincide we will find on further investigation that the space symmetry is not an indication of force symmetry if the negative displacement is very small as in the lower division 4 elements it is not possible to have negative orientation in two Dimensions if the positive displacement in the third dimension exceeds the sum of these two negative components so that the net result is still positive here the relative positions of the atoms are fixed in one dimension only but the average positions in the other two dimensions are constant by reason of the net positive display placement of the atoms an aggregate of such atoms retains most of the external characteristics of a crystal but when the internal structure is examined the atoms appear to be distributed at random rather than in the orderly arrangement of the crystal in reality there is just as much order as in the crystalline structure but part of the order is in time rather than in space this form of matter can be identified as the glassy or Vitus form to distinguish it from the crystallin form so he&#x27;s saying that the glasses are um cases of uh mixed positive and negative orientation um and so some of the order is now in time instead of space okay so the term state is frequently used in this connection instead of form but the physical state of matter has an all together different meaning based on other criteria and it seems advisable to confine the use of this term to one application so both glasses and crystals are in the solid state in beginning a consideration of the structures of the individual elect negative elements we will start with division 3 the general situation in this division is similar to that in division 2 but the negativity of the normal electric displacement introduces a new factor into the uh determination of the orientation pattern as the most probable orientation of an electronegative element may not be capable of existing in all three dimensions as stated earlier where two or more different orientations are possible in a given set of circumstances the relative probability is the deciding factor low displacements are more probable than high displacements simple orientations are more probable than combinations positive electric orientation is more probable than negative in division one all of the these factors operate in the same direction the positive orientation is simple and it also has the lowest displacement value all structures in this division are therefore formed on the basis of the positive orientation division two the uh in division two the margin of probability is narrow here the positive displacement X is greater than the inverse displacement 8 - x and this operates against the greater inherent probability of a simple positive structure as a result both the positive and reverse types of structure are found in this division together with a combination of the two in division three the negative orientation has a status somewhat similar to that of the positive orientation in division 2 as a simple orientation it has a relatively high probability but it is limited to one dimension the regular division 3 structures of group 3 A and B are therefore an isotropic with the reverse orientation in the other two dimensions a combination uh with the reverse orientation in the other two Dimensions the in anisotropic of 3A and 3B of division division 3 a combination of these two types of orientation is also possible and in Copper and silver the first division three elements of their respective groups the crystals um formed on the basis of this combination uh Orient ation have cubic symmetry as to division 2 the elements of division 3 in groups 4 a and 4 B crystallize entirely on the basis of the reverse orientation table four lists what may be considered as the regular interatomic distances of the elements of division 4 uh sorry division 3 although the probability of the negative orientation is greater in division 4 than in division three because of the smaller displacement values this type of alternate uh this type of structure seldom appears in the crystals of the lower division the reason is that where this orientation exists in the elements of lower of the lower displacements it exists in two dimensions and this produces produces a glassy or vitous aggregate rather than a crystal the reverse orientation is not subject to any restrictive factor of this nature but is it is less probable than the lower displacements and uh except in group 4 a where it continues to predominate um this orientation appears less frequently as the displacement decreases where it does exist it is increasingly like to combine with some other type of orientation as a result of these limitations that are applicable to the inherently more probable types of orientation many of the division 4 structures are formed on the basis of the secondary positive orientation a combination of two 8 - x displacements all right we&#x27;re going to stop there hang in there we just got to get through this and uh we&#x27;ll make sense of it later so um hopefully you join me tomorrow and continue this chapter thanks for tuning in</p>
