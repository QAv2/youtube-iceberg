            <p>this dude bought an RTX 4060 from best buite and the internet is eating him alive right now I doubt this Reddit thread will stay up for much longer this is just a normal dude trying to share his happiness of his new graphics card but little does he know that the PC Master race hates the RTX 460 top comment dude has brass balls posting this here be prepared to get roasted here there&#x27;s almost a th000 comments on this already honestly guys it&#x27;s pretty sad the reason he&#x27;s getting roasted is because pretty much everybody was unhappy with the launch of the RTX 460 because in terms of FPS per dollar it was pretty awful it&#x27;s very similar in performance to the last generation RTX 3060 however if you don&#x27;t look at the price for just a second the physical RTX 4060 graphics card is still actually pretty good it chews through every game in 1080P and honestly the price of it has continued to go down and as a community we should always just be happy when somebody upgrades their gaming PC even if they don&#x27;t make the most optimized meta choices</p>
