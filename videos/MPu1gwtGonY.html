            <p>[Music] Dr ning [Music] Lee mysterious disappearances often involve individuals whose work defies convention the perplexing Case of Dr ning Lee whose groundbreaking research on anti-gravity beguiled and confounded her peers is one such story Dr ning Lee immigrated from China to the United States in 19 83 joining the center for space plasma and aeronomic research at the University of Alabama in the early 90s her pioneering papers on anti-gravity were met with skepticism dismissed by many as fanciful science fiction still Lee&#x27;s theoretical work proposed a specific practical method for generating an anti-gravity field a concept that promised transformative applications in 1999 Lee left Academia to found her own company AC gravity to further her research she secured a significant Grant from the Department of Defense nearly half a million dollars this pivotal moment marked the beginning of a series of strange and troubling events in her life despite the promising start AC gravity never published any of its research by 2003 Lee had vanished from the public eye her last known communication was a private email to colleagues specifically reporting an experiment that generated quote 11 Kow of output energy after this message she disappeared entirely her colleagues continued to send emails which were marked as red but no replies ever came rumors and speculation filled the void left by her disappearance some suggested she was working under strict confidentiality for NASA or the Department of Defense Jack sarfati a fellow scientist speculated that she had returned to China now funded by the Chinese government and was beyond the pentagon&#x27;s reach a potential national security threat in an interview years later Leah&#x27;s son recounted a cryptic exchange with his mother quote mom do you need to tell me something he asked her response was as enigmatic as her disappearance quote first off you don&#x27;t know anything second off if you even think you might know something you forget about it Leah&#x27;s son recounted how her work under the defense department had never actually ceased instead becoming classified and shrouded in secrecy a burden that weighed heavily on her tragedy struck in 2014 when Lee was hit by a vehicle an accident witnessed by her husband of 46 years who suffered a fatal heart attack on the spot Le sustained severe brain damage as a result of the accident an obituary published in 2021 announced her death at the age of 79 in Huntsville ultimately Dr ning Le&#x27;s story is one of loyalty and sacrifice it was discovered that she steadfastly refused the overtures of the Chinese Communist Party remaining dedicated to her work in America this dedication cost her dearly she was even barred from returning to China for her mother&#x27;s funeral however her loyalty to her adopted country and dedication to her mysterious research remained unbroken Until the [Music] End madman Mike Markham in early 1995 a young inventor known as madman Mike sought to challenge the very fabric of time with a machine he believed could predict future lottery numbers ridiculed at first Mike&#x27;s critics were stunned when he seemingly vanished while testing his invention at just 21 Mike Markham was an electrical engineering student when he began experimenting with the Jacob&#x27;s Ladder spark generator this simple device capable of producing an electrical spark that jumps between antenna sparked an idea that would consume him during one of his experiments Mike observed something extraordinary he claimed to have seen a circular Vortex into which he threw a metal screw according to Mike the screw vanished and then reappeared a few feet away he theorized that the screw had traveled through time only reemerging when time caught up to it to harness this phenomenon for time travel Mike realized he needed a much larger and more powerful Jacob&#x27;s Ladder lacking the funds to purchase the necessary equipment he resorted to breaking into a power station and stealing six Transformers when he fired up his large scale Jacob&#x27;s Ladder the ensuing blackout lasted several hours and attracted the attention of the police arrested for theft Markham spent time in prison yet his notoriety only grew emerging from prison Markham embraced the nickname madman Mike and took to the airwaves appealing for donations to complete his project despite his mad reputation he raised enough money to proceed legally by 1996 Mike claimed that his early test had shown promisee I tossed in about 200 objects and animals in total conducting over 200 tests he later explained in 1997 justce he allegedly perfected his invention Mike vanished speculation ran wild with some suggesting he had time travel to the 1930s and died on a California beach years later the mystery deepened Mike resurfaced or so it seemed posting on various blogs about his disappearance in a 2022 Reddit post he addressed the rumors quote rumors are a blazing that I am dead not well in a time travel to 1930 something where I died on a beach in a tube whoever posted those pictures of a redhead that was also not me he explained that his time machine plans were quote stalled at the moment until I can get inverters Skeptics remain doubting the authenticity of these posts despite multiple requests the poster has yet to provide proof of his identity whether a Madman Mike truly defied time or simply became another puzzle of the digital age remains a mystery Tesla&#x27;s missing files in some cases the mystery does not lie in The Disappearance of the inventor but in the unusual immoral and illegal Vanishing of their work such is the case surrounding the final years and Legacy of Nicola Tesla a man credited with revolutionizing the world through his pioneering work on alternating currents as Tesla aged his fortunes waned and his mental health deteriorated once a Visionary genius he became erratic and eccentric Tesla meticulously counted his steps developed an obsession with cleanliness and certain numbers and displayed a variety of peculiar quirks his later years were marked by solid ude with his only companions being the pigeons he fed daily on the streets of New York on January 7th 1943 at the age of 86 Tesla was found dead in his room at the New Yorker Hotel the discovery was Grim he&#x27;d been deceased for 2 days a do not disturb sign still hanging on his door shortly after Tesla&#x27;s death his nephew svako sinovich arrived at the hotel to collect his uncle&#x27;s belongings he later reported that some of Tesla&#x27;s most important papers including a black notebook filled with sensitive information were missing this claim was met with skepticism and concern particularly from US government officials the FBI&#x27;s Declassified files released in 2016 reveal a complex narrative kosanovich the Yugoslavian ambassador to the US was suspected of intending to transfer Tesla&#x27;s research to Yugoslavia the office of ilen property custodian or APC intervened fearing the potential leakage of sensitive information despite legal ambiguity is regarding their authority over Tesla&#x27;s estate given his status as a naturalized US citizen the APC confiscated his possessions and files among these were details and plans for the elusive death ray or telforce a theoretical particle beam weapon that Tesla claimed could bring down aircraft hundreds of miles away an MIT Professor Dr John G Trump Uncle of future president Donald Trump was tasked with examining Tesla&#x27;s papers Dr Trump concluded the Tesla&#x27;s later works were primarily of a quote spec cative philosophical and promotional character and lacked practical applicability despite Dr Trump&#x27;s dismissal the US military showed renewed interest in Tesla&#x27;s beam Weaponry after World War II requests for Tesla&#x27;s papers from various military agencies suggest an ongoing interest in his ideas by 1952 after a lengthy legal battle kosanovich received his uncle&#x27;s possessions however of the 80 trunks Tesla had claimed to own only 60 were returned to the family fueling speculation that the US government retained some of Tesla&#x27;s most sensitive work the mystery of whether the government returned all of Tesla&#x27;s papers persists today some classified copies of Tesla&#x27;s research remain but most originals are now housed in the Nicola Tesla Museum in Belgrade Serbia Lou L [Music] Prince Lou L Prince often heralded as the father of cinematography crafted an early motion picture camera that would set the stage for the film industry yet his incredible achievements are shadowed by the murky circumstances of his mysterious disappearance and presumed death in October 1888 in the industrial heart of Leeds England the prince captured what is widely regarded as the oldest surviving film in existence the round ha Garden scene this historic 2 minute 11 second movie was a precursor to a Burgin in career po to revolutionize visual storytelling however fate had other plans 2 years later the prince embarked on a journey to France intending to visit his brother and subsequently travel to Paris to reunite with friends and family he missed his scheduled train from Dion and boarded a later one from that moment Lou L Prince vanished Without a Trace despite an exhaustive 7-year search by Scotland Yard no concrete evidence surfaced over the years numerous theories have attempted to explain his disappearance in 1890 a drowned man was pulled from the sen but the body stacked disqualified it from being the prince speculation ran Wild One film historian suggested fratricide alleging that L Prince&#x27;s brother the last person to see him might have killed him for financial gain another theory proposed that L Prince allegedly gay chose to disappear voluntarily to spare his family the societal Shame of the era however none of these theories were substantiated perhaps the most plausible and controversial theory is that the prince was assassinated on the orders of Thomas Edison over a patent dispute at the time of his disappearance the prince was on the verge of patenting a projector in 1889 with plans to Showcase his inventions in the United States Edison arrival in the race to dominate the nent film industry later claimed the invention of the moving picture camera as his own adding to the Intrigue of this Theory Lou Le Prince&#x27;s son Adolf testified in court against Edison two years later Adolf was found dead on Fire Island near New York from a gunshot wound although he was ruled to have died in his own hand the circumstances of his death have fueled ongoing suspicion the life and disappearance of Louis Le Prince remain a compelling mystery intertwined with the early competitive days of Cinema his pioneering Spirit and the unresolved questions of his fate continue to haunt the story of M picture [Music] history mayorana etor marana&#x27;s contribution to theoretical physics were so profound that numerous equations prizes and particles now bear his name a reclusive genius Mayana mysterious Disappearance in 1938 has sparked speculation for decades by all accounts Mayana preferred the Shadows his work flourished in the early 20th century leading to significant breakthroughs often ahead of their time despite his introverted nature Mayodan was drawn into enrio fery&#x27;s circle of elite experimental scientists in the 1920s at the assistant of his friend Emilio s in 1937 Mayana predicted the existence of a novel type of particle that could be its own antimatter exhibiting self-destructive Tendencies this prediction was revolutionary foreseeing particles that physicists Now call my Fons Sig later received a Nobel Prize for related discoveries highlighting the groundbreaking nature of Mayan&#x27;s insights yet just months after this breakthrough at the age of 31 Mayana emptied his bank account took a boat from Naples to palmo and vanished he purchased a return ticket to Naples but it remains uncertain if he ever used it my adana&#x27;s disappearance has been fertile ground for theories ranging from monastic seclusion to kidnapping by Foreign governments in his final communication my Adon wrote a note to a colleague at the Naples physics Institute quote there isn&#x27;t a bit of selfishness in it but I realize what trouble my sudden disappearance will cause you and the students for this as well I beg your forgiveness investigations over the years have offered tantalizing Clues but no definitive answers in 2011 Roman authorities analyzed a 1955 photograph purportedly showing bodana in Argentina further evidence in 2015 suggested he had lived in Venezuela between 1955 and 59 leading to the closure of the case with the assumption that madana voluntarily immigrated madan&#x27;s Legacy persists not only in the mystery of his life but also in the ongoing quest to confirm his theoretical particles modern CH aister engrossed in what some describe as the hunt for mayadas researchers from Google Microsoft and the University of California Santa Barbara are attempting to approximate Mayana particles they aim to Coral these particles on super cooled chips hoping to fortify quantum computers by exploiting the particles unique properties do you believe any of these inventors were intentionally silenced or disappeared because of their inventions let me know in the comments as always thank you for watching Dark V like And
