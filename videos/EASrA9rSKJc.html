            <p>here is given by T1 Co or cosine of the angle there cos 45° that&#x27;s the horizontal component of T1 the vertical component becomes sign of it which is simply the vertical component here would simply be T1 sign of the angle there which is 45° all right that&#x27;s for T1 for T2 which is this let&#x27;s resolve T2 now the first thing is this um if I have my quadrant like this this is positive X this is positive y this is x in essence if I have a vector this way here and I resolve the vector this way it becomes negative it&#x27;s the negative part of X so hence we saying that if I resolve T2 this way here it becomes minus so know why I&#x27;m putting minus there minus T2 cos 30° that&#x27;s what you have here right negative C of this of course this one here was</p>
