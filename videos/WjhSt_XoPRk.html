            <p>talk about this 2009 unclassified letter uh in which it you&#x27;ve got to read between the lines a little bit but it is pregnant with possibilities i mean the implications of what what you see in those is that this is real that assessment runs very contrary to the statements that the pentagon has made pentagon spokespeople have since you came forward you know yeah yeah i think there&#x27;s a lot of pockets within department of defense that may not necessarily know exactly what you know another pocket is doing right the right hand doesn&#x27;t always know what the left hand is doing they try i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s deliberate or on purpose i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a misinformation campaign i think [Music] if there was a question as to what the government knows or doesn&#x27;t know you&#x27;d probably have to bring that up to the government to answer i certainly don&#x27;t want to guess why the government said what they did um i can only imagine for two reasons a national security and if it&#x27;s not national security uh they just didn&#x27;t know yeah atip is uh the program was killed right and it was killed because it didn&#x27;t find anything right this this letter we&#x27;re talking about says they did find stuff well and i&#x27;ve made that very clear before um without necessarily referring to the to the memo that atip did find a lot of stuff this wasn&#x27;t just a one-off looking at the nimitz incident there were many many incidents we looked at and we looked at them on a continuing basis and we thought we saw some congruences throughout these incidents time and time and time again some repeated patterns of behavior and as an intelligence officer when you see those repeated patterns of behavior that is key that something&#x27;s going on that there is something there of predictability that you can use then later on to figure out how these things work and what these things really are though the arguments that were made in that letter are still valid today absolutely in my opinion absolutely they&#x27;re more valid now than they ever have been before um it feels like something&#x27;s going on and i i don&#x27;t it&#x27;s there&#x27;s some sensitivities involved but i mean is that feeling correct there&#x27;s a well you&#x27;ll have to excuse my uh my response on this but but george um in the end i&#x27;ve always said it doesn&#x27;t matter what my feelings are right i may feel something but um i also may be wrong so um i sense that the conversation is occurring now among the american people and among some of our senior levels of government that has never happened before and i&#x27;m very optimistic about that how i feel about it is probably irrelevant but i will tell you if you&#x27;re asking i feel good about it i feel that finally people can have a rational conversation and and and people much smarter than me can figure out what the healthy things are well the reason you left is because it wasn&#x27;t getting the attention it deserved and absolutely absolutely same argument that this right i actually left out of loyalty not disloyalty because i love the department and the leadership so much particularly secretary mattis that there was no other way for me to communicate that these things that we were seeing and experiencing were real and that they were being collected by not just grandma in the backyard shooting a camera and seeing some lights back there this is by trained observers flying multi-million dollar weapon platform systems sometimes over u.s cities that we we trust to fight and win wars on our behalf and they&#x27;re telling you they&#x27;re seeing something they&#x27;re seeing something that they they don&#x27;t know what it is and we have to pay attention which is backed up by electrical electro optical data which is backed up by the radar data which is backed up by you know more and more and more layers at some point you have to look and say you know there&#x27;s an old saying we have if you see it once it&#x27;s an anomaly if you see it twice it could be a coincidence if you see it three times you&#x27;re probably looking at a trend right and so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing and when you&#x27;re building this mosaic you&#x27;re building this this for lack of better terms this jigsaw puzzle you know people will say well how do you even know where to begin well you begin with the first piece right you take a a a 1 000 piece jigsaw puzzle and i&#x27;m not very smart so i&#x27;m not very good at building anything so what i usually do is take the four corners first and i set those pieces aside because you can tell what are the four corners then i take all the pieces that have the straight edge because i know they&#x27;re going to be the border and i set those aside right so that&#x27;s in another little bin and then what i do is i take all the pieces that are kind of the similar colors and i&#x27;ll take those and probably figure they&#x27;re probably part of the same scene and i&#x27;ll set those aside and before long my daughter and i went from having a thousand piece jumbled mess so now we have five or six bins that we can say okay these are common pieces that are going to help us now put together the picture and so very much i know it&#x27;s a very poor analogy but very much that that same methodology we did that with an a-tip we tried to find those commonalities and bend those in what we now know as a five observables of combatives of five observables and that has helped us really focus in on on collecting the data pieces that are that are that are very important or the pieces of data that we don&#x27;t have yet can you describe there is confusion about atip asap bass different acronyms how that all you describe your network of guys sure and and how that interacted with the others so uh george i understand when we first came out i was only in charge of atip at the time so it really wasn&#x27;t up to me to have a a a big lengthy discussion about ossat before that advanced weapons uh special application program but in the end um i i knew that information would eventually come out enough people are asking the right questions that it would come out and and i want it it needs to come out but it can&#x27;t kill him from me right because that really wasn&#x27;t that started before i came on board and therefore my knowledge of it is is a bit limited so in essence in 2007 the initial program was called a wsap program and it was that name for about nine months and that program was later refined it was a bit of a shotgun approach to the to the phenomena so included a lot of stuff in this program uh on trying to figure out how these things fly and where they coming out of where they&#x27;re going and things like that when i came into the program the name had just been changed to aatip advanced aerospace threat identification program atip not advanced aviation advanced aerospace i know people keep saying it&#x27;s advanced aviation it&#x27;s not and eventually that&#x27;ll come out too and people will realize that was that&#x27;s not the name it&#x27;s advanced aerospace threat identification program and so when i came in the name had atip had already been been issued and that&#x27;s what it was being referred to as now whether it was not a nickname or a formal name it was a formal name for us it was briefed as atip but if people want to you know argue about semantics and they want to say it was a nickname that&#x27;s fine but it wasn&#x27;t really a nickname at least not for me and the guys that and the gals that were working with me so um it was a tip and that&#x27;s how we briefed it but anyways that focus was really on the more of the nuts and bolts uh looking at what it is and and how does it work right and as i&#x27;ve said before many times that was our focus and that was atip&#x27;s focus so we went from a broad kind of spotlight approach to more of a narrowly focused laser approach trying to figure out pieces of this because it was just too much too much of the elephant to eat in one bite frankly in my opinion anyways it could be wrong but looking at now hindsight being 2020 the awsap program given the resources 22 million dollars would never be enough to really follow each and every down each and every rabbit hole to to do this uh conclusively in my opinion anyways so it was refocused to atip i took over in 2010 the programs continued to go as a tip 2012 that initial five-year funding dried up so we were issued more funding in 2013-2014 unfortunately the the verbiage in the way it was written in the bill that when it finally came out another office in the pentagon took our money that was intended for our office unfortunately and i won&#x27;t go into detail what office that was but the office took it and we were unable because nobody was right into the program to step up and say hey that money was intended for us so um the program was indeed intended to be funded well beyond 2012. uh interaction between you and your group and the asap bigelow bass conversations back and forth you&#x27;ve got to get no idea what they&#x27;re doing brutally of course yeah we didn&#x27;t we didn&#x27;t do anything without talking to each other what about skinwalker ranch did you get reports on that or can you say uh i would prefer to defend for that question if that&#x27;s okay um let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do a hypothetical the kinds of phenomena that have been described there that were investigated by bigelow both as bass and as nids are confounding in the sense they never repeat and that same thing doesn&#x27;t happen again it almost seems to be like the approach would be to study it as an intelligence issue than a scientific issue or as an intelligence well i think there&#x27;s always an intelligence aspect to any big question right you have to ask questions you know let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let&#x27;s take the the nature of skinwalker out of the equation and just look at it from an intelligence problem you have to ask yourself a is this something that is naturally occurring is this something that is being deliberately done is this something that another nation could be behind trying to influence us or is this something that is occurring um that is just a uh a natural part of being a human being on this planet right and and a bunch of other possibilities as well so we&#x27;re looking at things with through this through the optic of trying to determine exactly what are these things that are being detected that are being observed that are being reported and is it something that is naturally occurring or not and when i say naturally occurring doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean naturally occurring as part of a weather pattern this is an awfully big universe we live in and we now realize uh through theories such as string theory and m theory that the universe in which we live in may be part of a much bigger neighborhood of universe as part of a multiverse which resides within one great big superverse and this is not just mere speculation there is scientific evidence right now that even some very serious scientists are looking at uh give you a case in point the lopsided supposed lopsided nature of our universe when a hand grenade blows up it tends to blow up in a somewhat symmetrical pattern and yet here is our universe supposedly originating from a big bang and it seems lopsided and so some scientists now have speculated it could be that way because of the gravitational force from a neighboring universe those gravity effects are actually affecting our universe over here right is it proven no but it is a theory and so i think whenever it comes to things like skin walker ranch or anywhere else i think we have to keep an open mind again 20 years ago my cell phone my ipad maybe 30 years ago was was paranormal right it was supernatural witchcraft voodoo and now it&#x27;s routine i think when you get into quantum mechanics and you realize things such as duality principle and tangled particles you realize this universe is far more complex than we had ever even imagined and we have to take that into account that that there are things that that may go bump in the night and we just need to figure out what those things are [Music]</p>
