            <p>It seems to me intuitively, and I don&#x27;t actually know this, that a lot of the products that might help the intelligence community are hardware versus software. Some are software, right? You might have AI, but that you&#x27;re taking a bunch of compute power or satellites or rockets, things that explode all the time and have high risk, but that that takes more money, right? So, it&#x27;s more leveraged when you have these investors. So, maybe that&#x27;s another shot in the arm. Is that true or not true? &gt;&gt; Uh, it&#x27;s certainly true for a certain set of deals. So, we invest across a wide variety of uh technologies.</p>
<p>So we certainly do software.</p>
