            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>You are alleging that the US government has been concealing the existence on this planet of alien life. I would couch it as non-human intelligence. You know, NHI, like we like to say in our our language. Why do you say that? Why do you say NHI? I don&#x27;t want to necessarily denote origin. I don&#x27;t think we have all the data to say, oh, they&#x27;re coming from a certain a certain location.</p>
<p>And I and I I couch it as somebody who studied physics where maybe they&#x27;re coming from a different physical dimension as described in quantum mechanics. We know there&#x27;s extra dimensions due to high uh high energy particle collisions etc. And there&#x27;s a theoretical framework to explain that. Yeah. Just let me cut to the quick though.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re saying there is an intelligent species engaging with this planet. Yes. That&#x27;s potentially extraterrestrial. Yeah. I speak for everybody sitting at home.</p>
<p>That is a shock. it was to me and uh I had a lot of sleepless nights. Grush says he&#x27;s never personally seen nonhuman intelligence, but he&#x27;s spoken to enough people directly involved in what he calls the program that he&#x27;s convinced it&#x27;s real. I started out as a non-believer. I came to the the problem as a hardcore physics guy, intel officer.</p>
<p>So I have a you know, excuse my language, high factor. I was very methodical interviewing people who didn&#x27;t know each other, making sure this wasn&#x27;t some kind of cover up of some other program. He says he pressed to gain direct access to this program, and that&#x27;s when his trouble started. Grush claims his investigation was stymied, his requests for access rebuffed. They shut the door in my face.</p>
<p>They denied me access to these programs. Soon after, he says he endured reprisals and retaliation from above. He then reported that information to the intelligence community inspector general. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s filed this whistleblower complaint. He says that experience is why he decided to go public here.</p>
<p>And in a recent article written by Leslie Kaine in the debrief,</p>
