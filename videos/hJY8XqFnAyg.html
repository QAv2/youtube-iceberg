            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>known energy and computers pioneering reader theoretical physicist and inspired inventors challenging the way we think about her missing the unseen forces of nature despite routine michael funding and come right suppression they are confronting and outmoded classical world view lecturing and a monumental scientific revolution most people would agree camp get something there&#x27;s no such thing as a freelance we got our oxygen free from the air we</p>
<p>breathe we get some white premium water that used to be free until bottle drinking water came along but what about energy we&#x27;ve always had the paper that with the ritual of the recall oil electricity it&#x27;s always been the rule that you can never get back more energy than what you put him in the first place that&#x27;s a fundamental law of nature physicist of the nineteenth century</p>
<p>figure that out for the first lol thermodynamics the conservation of energy maybe so but science does come a long way since then bonds never haven&#x27;t been broken of course first uh... explain some things that are free energy devices and then give you comparison to explain what we mean by free energy for example paddle wheel in the river that used to power meal ground corn there&#x27;s a free energy device so is a windmill for example while remaining as we are taking the</p>
<p>energy from an external chores and using it so it&#x27;s of open system the environment of the system is furnishing afford energy into the system which the system is in collecting primary quirements it has to be an open system it has to have an external source of energy to finish the energy that we&#x27;re going to use them there for two more mysterious than women looks good today the primary energy source we&#x27;re talking about here is the vacuum but we&#x27;re speaking of vacuum in the quantum mechanical sent it has been known now for some time that the vacuum has in fact field with the more most energy flux so there&#x27;s no question that the energy</p>
<p>use them the question is extracting it and then using it in your system uh... it turns out ironically that everything we build batteries generators and so forth are already free energy systems and so far as extraction is concerned there already is a process and every battle in every electric doubtful or magnetic babble that automatically extracts engage energy full from the vacuum the energy flowing electric circuits and in general and physics is</p>
<p>very interesting much of uh... physics including all the luck magnetics was already established be for a week had them even the idea that energy flowed through space this was simultaneously done by appointing and also by heavy satin the late eighteen eighties and the notion was extremely novel at</p>
<p>the time that energy actually could flow through the vacuum or through space today of course we use that as a matter of fact what is not so commonly known is that the application of tracking the energy flow in and lectured circuit has never been very well done at all in physics you&#x27;ll find that most of the electromagnetics textbooks when they get to that point how does the energy flow in the circuit they actually do their very simple example or two show some sample calculations and the never say anything about it again now the pope the pointing energy flow</p>
<p>which is what it&#x27;s called is of course very well apart and things that radiate off into space but it has been very poorly applied and electric circuits and in fact for over a hundred years there has been a continuing argument basically a gentlemanly argument amongst the electrodynamics isd as to exactly what you have to apply for example they confuse different vectors the slepian vector of the pointing vector and they&#x27;re still arguing over just exactly what energy flowing circuits are so i would just want to point out the actual energy flow in a circuit is not well accounted for all or well</p>
<p>understood even today jen&#x27;s max best-known brands maxwell lake attribute it to accept things straight series of electrical in a way that eliminates zero point in time but maxwell&#x27;s more advanced filed with the existence substance under the name which since the time like been considered a science there&#x27;s a strange thing that exists in electrodynamics trip was not diabolical and i&#x27;m probably not even intentional in the way that it in the thing that it did and this is unearthing to do with</p>
<p>regading michael&#x27;s equations and his own version those what they did they express the equations and potential form and you come out with two equations into unknowns but both unknowns are now and they did in both equations in other words the bearable for not separated so the electrodynamics as have done iri gauging changing the potential so to speak of those two equations were when they change one potential for example magnetic vector potential this produces andy field also it doesn&#x27;t change would be feel but it</p>
<p>produces in the field so then they go and then they changed the scale of potential free to produce exactly the opposite the field and have the to the fields cancel this kills what is called asymmetrical read gating in other words you change the potential energy of a system which you&#x27;re free to do this just in to transfer it doesn&#x27;t</p>
<p>take work to do that but you do not allow any excess force to appear to use that energy to do work on the system now that is a symmetrical re gauging what that has done this is the four this is the theory that they&#x27;ve been applied to electromagnetic circuits and devices and everything in the world but what this has done is excluded an</p>
<p>entire class of systems which is in fact covered by michael j poisons before regading that includes systems which regains and produced the force in other words asa metrical league aging now that class of systems which has been omitted from electrodynamics contains two further clashes one of those is the fourth produce will use that energy to hurt you in other words and give you back drag</p>
<p>it&#x27;ll give you back you know if that sort of thing and so it&#x27;ll hurt your system performance the other subclasses before superiors in a way to help your system performance it will use that excess energy in expended on the system for example rotary engine to increase the rotational speed and therefore the stored energy uh...</p>
<p>kinetic energy in the system now obviously that is the class of systems that include over unity electrical systems in other words erie gauging occurs by the machine itself automatically it takes excess energy into from the vacuum it produces a force which the system designer places exactly in the system so that that force will expand that energy on the system to increase the connecticut urges system</p>
<p>and then we&#x27;ll take that excess interview off-the-shelf now let&#x27;s explain how an electrical baffle for example as a battery of agenda is able to take energy extracted from the vacuum and place it on to the conductors of the circuit first of all of the particle physics and particle physics any electrical charge is automatically broken symmetry now what this means is there is a virtual photon flux violent what exchange between the vacuum itself which is filled with this or to vote on flux being absorbed by the mass of this</p>
<p>particle and then re radiated back to the vacuum and so the vacuum and any electrical charged particle or engaged in a fierce exchange of energy all the time from the back into the particle back to the vacuum now that&#x27;s not a gating process it goes right back to the lacking from the particle but if you have to particles of opposites i&#x27;m separated by a small distance you have two different kinds of fluxes and the difference between the two guilt</p>
<p>what we call uh... scaler potential or voltage and current of an electrical circuit what this means that one of those charges you can compare to a source that is lately actually the uh... positive</p>
<p>charge conventionally in electromagnetics is assumed to be the source chart energy from the vacuum is actually get it out of this charge into the conductor&#x27;s it has the characteristic it&#x27;ll flow along the conductor would call that pointing flow along the circuit it flows outside the wire in terms of</p>
<p>field energy the other hand actually goes back into the wine acts as a saint but we also tend to illustrate that as a different kind of floor different uh... degree of flow from the bottom of the circuit the difference between these two flows is basically what&#x27;s called the ml for electromagnetic force in a system and so the doctoral itself the existence</p>
<p>of the two opposite charges separate about small distance generates an actual full of electromagnetic portion is not a fourth it&#x27;s a potential an electric circuit metropolitan circuit now by the white that is the only function that a source of the all the rest of that stuff generator the battery everything in their all that does is get you the separation of charges once you have this these charges</p>
<p>separated the floor of energy from those charges is forever free and it will flow forever if thats all you take from is flowing pointing energy so what we have done in our electric circuits is we take half of that energy that flows into the system freely from the vacuum through the duffel restored in the circuit we take half of that energy and we rely on the so-called spent electrons in the ground return on backed up through the source against its</p>
<p>back to you now we do work inside and own the ancillary stuff in the back through the generator to destroy that separation charges thereby closing the gate this given us are free full of energy it does not cost one carpet cleaning before degenerating capacity of a power plant to power a large city the actual energy flow out into all the homes in the used to power the homes does not cost anything the costs that we run into is when the</p>
<p>power company pots all of those electrons back to against the back you know does exactly that much work inside their own generator to fight it and they engage in a sumo wrestling match inside the generator and that&#x27;s what we pay for there&#x27;s a question many times about exactly what is that i come zachary what is a potential because when you get right down to it these terms are if you are not the kind of old and there&#x27;s a very poorly defined the now famous mickelson morally</p>
<p>experiment turn-of-the-century they don&#x27;t have detected station the passable physics resumed once and for all that it did not exist the case was plugged until quantum mechanics re-opened the discussion allowing for new interpretation and how matter in iraq within zero point b although skeptics off point behind experience wrote it was on stunning who in nineteen twenty seven now the argument that the profit denied needs them ultimately no bomb platform the fundamental fact ok non-human ninth</p>
<p>u all-inclusive jim the them please donald is a component designs fix this cordon bleu yahoo the space oughtn&#x27;t unthinkable which i&#x27;m back in the spring invincible told a different senses some engineers use it in just about all that and that&#x27;s called back and that&#x27;s back in technology asad-ul iqbal we&#x27;re talking about empty space time we know today for example the lamb she often mechanics showed that at this exchange of energy between the vacuum and the chart particle is in fact we love and generate really fax and you can measure it and he was given the nobel prize management showing physics literature so emotionally experimentally is detected because</p>
<p>inertia for example shows clearly anecdote energetic effects anyway it turns out in the modern view iron-clad mechanical if you apply that knowledge has been getting what you find is that the vacuum is fierce reacted it&#x27;s a fierce energy flux and going out of our actions of all time the energy density of that as estimated by various physicist is extreme for example one cubic centimeter if you could take the rock in that cubic centimeter and convincing him to match the night passing score you would have more uh...</p>
<p>largest telescope shimon stars and so the the energy this is extremely dance and fears just drive everything that we call physical rio bottom level right on up the observer level everything is energetically driven by the fact that now as long as any point is totally in equilibrium you would never have any result in higher order emerge from that so the emergence of the normal world we live in the microscopic world already depends upon they&#x27;re being hidden order in this fall uh...</p>
<p>that&#x27;s called problem inquire mechanics of the missing chaos the missing order because they assume there was no order that make on james random and that does not generate the present world we live in you falsified quantum mechanics by simply listening to this video tape adjusting the time opening one bill so we know that it&#x27;s wrong it&#x27;s admitted</p>
<p>their own qana mechanics now the problem is we have to change the statistics that we use we have to use an already chaotic statistics now fortunately very good physicist name david bomb showed that if you have hidden order hidden variable theory it&#x27;s consistent with all experiments that&#x27;s alpha nothing refutes it it eliminates all the problems and quantum mechanics as far as i know obama never discovered how to actually apply</p>
<p>hidden bearable what i have been doing it pointing out that the work that began with stony input occur stony prior to nineteen hundred shortly before that whittaker nineteen oh three nineteen or forum later used a little bit but he has a bit abided by and somebody iraq for example that work when applied becomes an engine arable hidden verbal theory and so you can engineer the stuff we&#x27;re</p>
<p>talking about if you look at it with the right set the theoretical uh... it is doable in the laboratory on the bench with some difficulty now there&#x27;s a problem today very serious problem that&#x27;s recognized by him a few foundations business loans business is still very few braveheart is sold who struggle with what the stuff we</p>
<p>would mean level what each concept and so forth means and as you correctly stated is that long whatever it turns out that foundations of physics that we&#x27;re using today is very seriously flawed particularly and electrodynamics i want chart for example are often used in presentation that has some twenty five very serious falls and classical electrodynamics of things we</p>
<p>used to design uh... t_v_ systems so is seriously flawed it needs complete overhaul that&#x27;s over a hundred and something years old max will be at that stuff when uh... the american civil war had just started so we&#x27;re talking about something that old the prevailing belief of the time was that the vacuum was within the</p>
<p>bureau fluid these so-called reliever which we know today is fall eat there is there but it&#x27;s not being observable material fluid another thing that was uh... completely wrong and it was an assumption of the transverse wave that&#x27;s founded on a single thing uh... faraday who was a brilliant man that did most of the research trying to put electoral electrical field together with</p>
<p>magnetic field ferreting had establish this notion of lines of forced but he thought that in this picture of the through the roof physical strains he thought the electromagnetic field or the election magnetic disturbances in the partial to speak was really trying strange the strings were on the tension and when you had a disturbance what you really did with pluck the strings now my actual states very clearly that</p>
<p>he said about to actually capture exactly wat heard it was doing his lines before in the theory and that&#x27;s what he did he actually the other thing with a vacuum is considered to be for the strings which don&#x27;t exist material strength if you&#x27;re examining problem from first principal fukin found very easily that the actually electromagnetic wave in the back in flux is in fact marcus allen&#x27;s longitudinal none eclipse asl for example new</p>
<p>therefore well from his own experiments for example when hurts reported experiments uh... showing that he had finally discovered the way that michael from collisions had predicted the transverse wave te sol dot on a boat went to europe built it hurts and showed him experiments to refute that insuring that it was longitudinal parts was not going to go against my</p>
<p>actual than the prevailing idea of the day in hurts died not long after that anyway the other short life unfortunately so the prevailing motion of the transverse blade and bike and there&#x27;s no other substance and that is a matter of fact the contract the receipt of uh... signal in the electron gas and uh...</p>
<p>copper wire intent of for example if you plug in today what we know to be the electron reaction uh... the fact that has been in taxes a general moves i decide recesses hardly travel down the line all maybe</p>
<p>six inches an hour uh... if you actually plug all that and what you&#x27;ll find out is javal precession of the electrons that were actually measuring now the other early fellows thought that the electric move physical fluid shaking and the vacuum was intercepted by the wire and since</p>
<p>they measured transfer of ways they were measuring the fluid from the vacuum interning there that&#x27;s what they thought the electron hadn&#x27;t even been discovered yet molecule adjustable ah and so they put together the theory www all of that stuff missing it&#x27;s seriously in need of total overhaul the solution to the problem in electrodynamics is to take some very sharp bright-eyed bushy tailed young graduate</p>
<p>students who aren&#x27;t afraid to climb mt olympia again and go at it from the very beginning each part of the peach concept and put in all the modern knowledge that we know about it lacked andrea plus the electron span all of this kind of thing and reestablishes the theory the foundations accurately put in the longitudinal way that we can show exist uh... we would like to contribute the electromagnetic mechanism that generates the flow of time because i publish that</p>
<p>obscurity i&#x27;m going to publish it not so obscure the and more definitely in the future but that should be in there because you can engineer that as well there are many other things that uh... should be in there that many of the foundation for this is also have pointed out for example electrodynamics assumes at</p>
<p>each point in space there is a point q oma charge located there and what the politicians in the electric field establishes the way that point you will move is considered exist in the point and me q home of charges not allowed to have its own skin the potential for example which is false uh... if they&#x27;re doing magnetic field you should move the unit north pole sitting there and the way that north</p>
<p>pole moved in space is what the for your prediction now of course that&#x27;s nonsense none of that exists in this place so we should correct all that again and overhaul of the stuff that&#x27;s over a hundred years old we have had magnificent success with the electromagnetic from him there is a tremendous electromagnetics beyond that that was omitted from actuals equation my actual actual theory is political</p>
<p>asians and twenty lna unknown inc what tonya which is a hard top ology algebra you can do things in that you can&#x27;t bring mob in doing internships and just certainly can&#x27;t do in vector zinnia certainly can do with the theory of the started our universities all that remains to be rediscovered an uncovered every side and to some extent gibbs will largely because people little bit of hurts responsible for translating that into</p>
<p>that could be creating uh... victor algebra and so do it most of what we study today is my actual deployed not his questions at all their heavy suds interpretation and subset and so would reduce the top quality of the model anyway from uh... twenty degrees of freedom so</p>
<p>to speak you four degrees of freedom obviously we eliminated most of the pres.-elect magnets we needed you can do a lot of things today actually that are not in uh... talk and i have normal universities and do not appear in the text books of course anybody who is struggling free energy and we are struggling and although there are now some devices</p>
<p>actually working that uh... i believe have been sufficiently tested independently to verify those devices of a certain amount to make the patterson sales being one that can be demonstrated to actually build unity without question i think the takahashi engine the client</p>
<p>and uh... johnson has a new motivated potential use and his permit magnet gates that that will withstand the most progress investigation so i think that some other engines are other things that i have not now that also appear to be valid and peered be independently verified what i&#x27;m saying is that we have certain</p>
<p>things now which i actually do produce over unity phone calls when you turned on and they do produce the effect it has now become one question the question now becomes so what happens when the start spill out an inter for example a commercial market well what is going to happen really a tremendous revolution in energy right across the board one of the things that&#x27;s going to happen ears of freedom from a lot of the costs that we have now associated with the production use of energy billions of building trillions of dollars every year their another thing that will</p>
<p>happen for the benefit is that we will clean up a lot of the bond hydrocarbon waste out yet recover our atmosphere again uh... we should be power normal bills for example on over unity engines mclean and three so to speak without having to pay a tax at the gas pump and so forth to run the automobile we will get the boots of economic boot of the back of</p>
<p>everybody&#x27;s mechan power in their homes when you&#x27;re able to actually broke your device for some kind of reasonable cost that will power your home for the heating and lighting everything only for the maintenance then obviously that&#x27;s a revolution right across the board for everybody now there&#x27;s a few disadvantages also uh... when we&#x27;d start to produce lots</p>
<p>and lots more energy there are facts that uh... i don&#x27;t think anybody knows yet we have to investigate all of those infection phenomena for example if you produce excess energy in the vacuum in space-time at a point you actually changed the energy density</p>
<p>of the space time and so doing now that by the way is totally a gravitational chain you have now just done general relativity on the bench if you make very powerful changes you have some very when a startling changes that emerged you can have gravitational or anti gravitational changes would be very embarrassing to have a partial or she</p>
<p>would stay nail down to the floor for example that&#x27;s not what you want want barlow you might want a bill to ship them flyer but that&#x27;s a different purpose so what we are also interim is a great new world of phenomena in physics that we have not explored we do not have in our textbooks and nobody has been inside to see all the way through to it what we can say these economically it&#x27;ll be a revolution uh...</p>
<p>culturally it&#x27;ll be a revolution technically it&#x27;ll be a great revolution and we hope and pray that for the common person like you and i for our homes and automobiles and cleaning up the atmosphere getting rid of all a lot of the pollution and waste getting rid of the nuclear waste nuclear power plants that is going to happen we have a problem people often ask why uh... why has this type of so long to</p>
<p>get out of my even today while are than conventional scientist so opposed to it well there are things with herbal reasonable and on the reason let me just give some of the factors one of the factors as a straightforward technical when this regading that i spoke on of the electrodynamics equations was gone what you end up with was a closed system it actually applied theory and says all</p>
<p>systems that use a syria closed system you&#x27;re going to have to put as much energy into that system to do work on at the moment as you can possibly ever get out impact it&#x27;ll have some friction losses of villages and so you don&#x27;t have put a little bit more in other words it completely through away any possibility of doing over unity</p>
<p>system since the scientists thought that was an exact statement they didn&#x27;t realize they had thrown away the other classes of system in doing the read a region this meant that they all legitimately believe that anything else with smacks of perpetual motion you you&#x27;re suggesting that a closed system with no input of energy whatsoever can</p>
<p>creative that&#x27;s against the fundamental principle of consolation venue which is energy can neither be created nor destroy it you can use it you can change is for me against gary but you can&#x27;t get rid of it and you can create it is as simple as that if you suggest that you can create if</p>
<p>that is called perpetual motion and of course that&#x27;s nonsense and so most of the scientist equated any notion of a free energy over unity device as being a perpetual motion uh... machine and therefore utter nonsense you see it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s uh...</p>
<p>it&#x27;s a play on words the scientist interpreted it one way of the guys trying to do it are looking at it as a open system now fortunately today we have a type of pharma mimics uh... you know nobel prizes have been issued for it to pretty gene for example uh...</p>
<p>four systems not environment and then a key vote every that do have they&#x27;re open systems and the energy does flow in from outside and through them those kinds of system can produce over unity it&#x27;s all perfectly legitimate physics you do not violate conservation of energy lol you do not violate the laws of physics and you do not violate the laws up some of them annexed the nonlinear from in a minute what you do about late is the assumption</p>
<p>of a closed system some of them into so-called equilibrium thermodynamics which says it inured to close in the one part will flow out of me you can get in the end excess accumulation in fact you gonna lose energy feed it up so it says you&#x27;re doing before you start obviously we have a system of complies with that you cannot ever have over unity you&#x27;ll have the conventional systems by the unconscious throwing away and discarded move all the</p>
<p>systems that did allow you to do that and do the job the scientists believed farming in their hearts that they were rejecting nonsense when they rejected the idea will be inconsistent that&#x27;s the primary reason is strictly a scientific technical reason and that was the reason point is we are not assuming perot system there so we can open system now there</p>
<p>were other reasons financial uh... if everybody has a jeep engine clean energy hired on attack some for this was morgan&#x27;s famous statement to know how can you put a meter on that uh... the interest of course the</p>
<p>financial community or to the cellular energy that&#x27;s uh... uh... a large part on the financial cost of all of them lifted is the in the energy that it takes to run it and so there&#x27;s a great deal of money to be made actually the same people and companies and so forth if you would check it</p>
<p>bought up just about all the major energy sources they only wall and won the cold nor the nuclear power plants everything you have any real promise that all radio and so what you have been i would say uh... economic cartel lucien it thing between various uh... countries and so forth that are or withdraw it energy ridge to keep the status quo and keep selling the thing i thought was certainly a barrel over today here on it with</p>
<p>certain barrel tomorrow would keep jargon board one of the things that this revolution have posed or in many people&#x27;s minds it has polled is that i started lol i would like to change that date will be it i think everything we&#x27;re dealing with right now in its present form is sort of both right and wrong there many things right with it there are many things wrong with it&#x27;s</p>
<p>not totally black or white it&#x27;s a mixture of great now let&#x27;s talk about uh... relativity you know i&#x27;m starting today there was absolutely no knowledge whatsoever of anyway to use the electromagnetic force which is a quite strong for to produce curvatures place too the geometric curvature in space-time which is what they rolled it is all about so i start news the very weak gravitational force which is about for electrons about ten months thirty</p>
<p>eight to ten mile forty something like it bears number two march fourteenth two as strong an extremely weak full this means if that&#x27;s all your theory encompasses you&#x27;re never going to have an experimental science on laptop bit because us to would before she can you measured it you got to go out by a great big sign of rugby star something like that bend the light even have a blurb will affect you</p>
<p>just simply don&#x27;t crank up a new laboratory department said i do point out to you that if you involve rotating machines and bring problems with that you do involve photo of dividend uh... that&#x27;s very uncommon but it has been done uh... for example uh...</p>
<p>in electromagnetic machine uh... there are a couple very famous uh... uh... electrodynamics is probably the best</p>
<p>this country their produce who work in that and so the worked very very formidable than it does attempt to combine electromagnetics and four joachim so what you&#x27;re going to find a job that chain who don&#x27;t go away but it&#x27;s gonna start to use the very strong electrodynamics force as being the medium of curvature and is going to turn into an experimental laboratory science and great adventures in that loop feinstein is not going to one of our own he&#x27;s going to wind up in part correct but needing a great deal of extension</p>
<p>that&#x27;s what&#x27;s gonna there are several questions also i guess you&#x27;d say and silver questions of more interest too uh... says no that occurred when you start talking about the man very large packages a day dior great number and resources nowhere putting a lot more energy lucien will blunt truth of it is multi signal multi radiation environments uh... there are some effect without</p>
<p>specifying loving to the limit the time drogoul explore to park article priori work that was done in france ended annabel with some of the new kinds of biological facts that you can get from these kinds of things that doesn&#x27;t appear in the present the repertoire so to speak of the scientist who are studying effects diem feels radiation living systems so we do have effects that we have long-term cumulative facts uh... we have to characterize our environment we have tillotson experiments to do that we have to characterize environment that&#x27;s going to be resolved and as the years go by and we have to know what we&#x27;re doing and</p>
<p>what safe and what isn&#x27;t uh... that&#x27;s only going to occur vlan term the normal university is on the chart number of the students and lots of months of experience and we explore the phenomenology we have to turn the scientific community before the research funds would be made available to the universities to do that and so the first priority in this area</p>
<p>the safety of let&#x27;s get the scientific community active in this area get research funds actually in this exploding and also looking at all the overhaul the models terrible medium effects on biological systems because there are facts and there are new affects that we don&#x27;t even know about you know we&#x27;re going to run into some of which we do suspect and nobody but we have to investigate have to be</p>
<p>sure that this is a safe sighing birth of the baby we don&#x27;t just contribute to the problem what we&#x27;ve gotten that work has to be done and yet to requires a change in the present paradigm because the president ah... models for young bhalo is basically the petition we dump energy in it the so-called deposition is basically living on the line don&#x27;t do that drupal with the system is not true several of the mechanisms that give you the inflation and martha signaled by month including down to the bone marrow moving into the actually mean stem cells that michael himself in a system so there can be very profound thirteen an electron ics martin and multi signal funds we have to explore that much</p>
<p>deeper than what the present scientist have allowed explored because uh... economic there&#x27;s another impact which sometimes i hesitate to mention that i think it&#x27;s true and i think it clearly has been shown in some experiments without people thoroughly understand them when you add extra dimensionality look at the extra dimensionality you can model living system particularly from extra free space attached to this particular showing up</p>
<p>in the dimensions of heaven infinite number of the seven spaces and that&#x27;ll allow you to mom and actually connected to with body well that&#x27;s interesting because it means if you choose the right engineering in this type of things you can engineer mind directly and there are some experiments or the by this there are some that show that you can do things with sales for example tomra versus old vodka produced a cure</p>
<p>diseases pre-order and several other researchers have shown aspects of the robert becker for example was nominated for nobel prize for sure will try and be sequence will be see potential we can separate and the stuff vinyl by whitaker approach decomposition uh... he showed very conclusively that you can just take salesmen were some backward for previous date or forward to</p>
<p>a future state called differentiation andy differentiation uh... he should have been given a nobel prize for that wrote this magnificent times of tragedy that he wasn&#x27;t we have a fax which can get down now into the very fundamental thing that dr everything the man stuff that connection of the man to the body for example if you were to generate extreme pollsters extreme powerful pulses of the so-called scale of potential</p>
<p>stuff internal stuff if u jerica juror thing normal smu full time span what you really believe mapped the body it&#x27;s mine connection the two from each other assume something a bit at every level and we sell does they were germ does information does while she was the whole body that so obviously if you&#x27;re gonna try to take think of eulogy and those enormous amounts of you&#x27;re going to be extremely careful do that just willy nilly without risking terrible fax from so there are some limitations that will merge on is to acknowledge and goals of thing that we must experiment with and understand and control from the very beginning you&#x27;ve got to get those scientist ambush</p>
<p>are converted working that out and now the question that arises is this thing we&#x27;re calling loosely out there zero point energy in the world is a low point well the notion is that when you prove something in temperature down to absolutely well no motion actually the motion doesn&#x27;t go away uh... according the climate can extended period you have uh...</p>
<p>temperate climate chemical witchcraft motions that can margin continued for example if they can move all by itself instantaneously with extreme belongs to the extreme energy for just a moment and then they have to cut off to go away for state their loans observable but if its quicken up you can have an</p>
<p>energetic thing born and that&#x27;s called the so called virtual particle flux of lacking home field theory and that also is what the zero point energy as the energy remaining when you get down to say that normal class promotional be grown still lots of management up there and that&#x27;s what it consists of so there&#x27;s a wedding of the two down at that level and that&#x27;s the level of energy that was so fierce they&#x27;re bombarded every tried potent version dr dr comes from that and for the first time we&#x27;re now beaming directly with latin as the sort of what we&#x27;re trying to do there&#x27;s both matter and anti-matter</p>
<p>included in the part of the beauty of a particle mom and pop article all being born furiously n disappearing furiously requirement can go back in a long time violent four csun particles and anti-apartheid that&#x27;s what makes up the so-called virtual particle board for black and intern mix up what we call classically zero point and so there&#x27;s lots and lots and lots of energy than pointed out incredible amounts of it but it&#x27;s and it&#x27;s very peculiar form but it does dr everything else in the worse including all the living systems now what we get into realm of dimensionality we get into some very peculiar questions we have for example the wave particle duality problem hadn&#x27;t been resolved this is just shake hands group with order nature is happy to be bold way part of</p>
<p>the same time and we tried to insist that it&#x27;s either way or particle well what you do for that for for modeling purposes the best way to do that if you seven stations three hyper dimensions three normal space dimensions uncommon time dimension between the two put your hidden lake stuff whitaker milk ascii stony stuff up in the harper&#x27;s places that which are perfectly acceptable denied by the can&#x27;t wait and put your particle plopped down in</p>
<p>the normal minkowski space which is where the quantum physics laureates put it but now you have very magic thing you have the fact that uh... perfect order apan hyper space and all the stuff in the back and perfectly or did not headlong into help evolved cosmological feedback principal he&#x27;s</p>
<p>right yes absolutely ordered but if you have something that&#x27;s changing it&#x27;s a two hundred twenty times a second for one particle bombarding military particle you have no information individual actions of tall men so fresh you can get information so you have to approach it statistically you have to approach it with statistical methods and so it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s a lovely but he didn&#x27;t want the reason and it goes away uh...</p>
<p>put all cosmological so use a seven space tomato upscale a potential birthplace and taking a look at what i&#x27;m seriously think is the immediately progressing advance of over unit and system and even self powered system we have a closed-loop feedback there are some statements i think we can uh... speculate on pretty safely one is will really have a true science one it is accepted in science and the true technology when all that phenomenology is thoroughly worked out blowing understood when all the models worried on so that we adequately can model this theoretically we could do engineering</p>
<p>shutdown design circuits they&#x27;ll work every time we have compliments on the ship within bar symbol in network we&#x27;re not at that stage today we are at a stage today which is the worth of the baby we&#x27;re not at the state whether it&#x27;s already a teenager running around playing uh... playing baseball on the baseball a</p>
<p>lot were at the birth of the baby in the birth is very difficult because it&#x27;s opposed by so many interest the orthodox scientific community still of very adamantly oppose it because they think nonsense i think that it&#x27;s there&#x27;s all idea perpetual motion and closed system creating energy from nothing and that is nonsense you can&#x27;t do that uh... there are very strong and very powerful economic interest in the world probably the strongest economic interest</p>
<p>in the world which are adamantly opposed to it uh... can you see what this does to the oil-rich nations uh... i can you say you eventually can you see what this will be too many things and i actually wanted to do your plays the ol petrochemical industry won&#x27;t go away you</p>
<p>still need you all for the materials that unit and the chemicals and so it&#x27;ll be more and more petrochemical industry rather than keep burning and wasting wall and put in all the pollutants in the uh... biosphere so many things will readjust uh... it&#x27;s going to wrest control from a lot</p>
<p>of the great wealthy control browns and now dominate uh... largely the economic world there was going to change now what you&#x27;re going to see that i would predict and we&#x27;ll see if history bears this out windows barren really realized that this stuff is for real and it can be made to work pan internet republished in computers and everything they can no longer contain information and it&#x27;s very embarrassing to keep</p>
<p>killed in the matter is that they stopped at about fifteen at some point you&#x27;re going to say uh... overwhelming availability of funds become available when the funds become available the scientist would change over into it because i go where the money there bought and paid for samples that you can do research in this you got the phone cut off a research grants professor gets without a job with the leasing immersed in and so science a separate bought and</p>
<p>paid for in this country and much of the world when the money goes the science will go through it now that will put the sharp young rectitude omit finally with some plunged into the experiment and work on their doctorates and so forth you will have a very rapid assimilation and advancement of a totally new and extended electromagnetic science at the time that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen rd ninety meaning technologies answer now you can get bored back from the new energy spirit all when nine how conversation demonstrations of reintroducing explore the world theoretical businesses we&#x27;re changing the paradigm volume one and particle physics anything like that his baumatic broken symmetry now what this means is there is a cordial full-time exchange between the vacuum itself which</p>
<p>is field portable unplugged volume two john hutchison to attend best motor here well after mindtree josephine alright here volleyball and them bhopal uh... or laptop uh... argument or right the important point annable divide in their we&#x27;ll on the inside without ill meal let&#x27;s see what kind of what we got at seventy five psi hahahaha background it with all the way off thing a hundred and fifty foot on the floor they&#x27;re doing twenty nine ninety five each ten thousand are getting people hundred nineteen ninety sleeping with their future brown went through every monday seven nine five d_p_p_ right mike works audio and video</p>
