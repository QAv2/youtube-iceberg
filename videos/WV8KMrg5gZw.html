            <p>[Music] hello and welcome to my channel this is an educational channel that we focus on all kinds of different theories of everything all-encompassing theories cosmologies Paradigm shifters um holistic theories that can help you um plug in uh with your own life and improve uh the world around you and uh today is our 410th video on the reciprocal system of theory uh which was originated by dwe B Larson back in the 20th century and we&#x27;re looking at uh one of his books called basic properties of matter um we&#x27;re in the first chapter called solid cohesion uh Mr Larson um was a chemical engineer or mining engineer one of the two or both and uh he uh was working on a chemistry problem and having to do with the interatomic distance and uh stumbled across uh some ideas that got him thinking about some things worked out uh a lot of problems over the course of many years and in 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates uh um basically uh condensing his work two sentences about how the universe operated and then he took those fundamental postulates and he um went through a process of deduction to determine uh his theoretical Universe what his Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then in his books over the uh remaining years of his life up until his death in 1990 he uh compared his theoretical Universe with the universe that the scientists had measured and uh recorded in their Laboratories uh and their scientific tables and uh that&#x27;s kind of what he&#x27;s doing here in this book basic properties of matter he&#x27;s looking at things like the interatomic distance the compressibility thermal expansion melting point critical point boiling point whatever you want to call it um and uh other basic properties of matter and he goes through his theory and shows uh provides equations for like okay this is excuse me this is uh his this is my equation for the uh interatomic distance this is my equation for thermal expansion and then he um you know goes through the whole periodic table and he in goes through many compounds as well many molecules and um you know says well if I plug in my equation this is what this is what my uh coefficient of thermal expansion would be and for this element and for this element and for this element and for this element now let&#x27;s take my data and compare it with the data that uh has been measured by the chemist in the laboratory and um let&#x27;s compare so that&#x27;s what he does in this book um and we&#x27;re going to you know we&#x27;re going over the results now we&#x27;re still in chapter one called solid cohesion and he&#x27;s laying the foundation and laying the foundation is a seriously difficult task because that&#x27;s the hardest part about uh the reciprocal system is that you have to unlearn a whole lot of stuff before you can really learn anything and he has to kind of carry you through that and he doesn&#x27;t necessarily always do that the you know he does that usually he&#x27;ll he&#x27;ll do it he does it very well with the um the kind of the literature review or the history of science review so he will show you what their theory is and why it&#x27;s not correct and and why it&#x27;s going wrong and he will use their own words to condemn their own Theory but then when he&#x27;s presenting his theory he sometimes takes a few shortcuts uh like oh I alluded to this in chapter 11 of my previous book so so if you&#x27;re too lazy to go uh find his previous book and look in chapter 11 uh and read that uh he kind of assumes that you&#x27;ve already read that because it&#x27;s the first volume of of his Trilogy and this is the second volume of his Trilogy we did read it as a matter of fact uh and that those are videos uh that I did about six months ago so you can go back and refer to the his pre previous book is called Nothing But motion so if you go back in my archives you can see that I went over the book nothing but Motion in about probably 80 90 videos I don&#x27;t know a lot of videos um uh but uh for people who are just tuning in you know uh it it&#x27;s a little difficult to go back and figure out what he was talking about so I&#x27;m trying to carry you through that but there&#x27;s a lot of kind of stuff like that where he&#x27;s referring to things that he that he covered other places and that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the difficulty with lson is that there&#x27;s so much uh difference between the way he&#x27;s doing it and the way that you&#x27;re used to it being done that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s difficult for him to carry the narrative forward at the same time that he carries all of the uh accessories forward and he does have a lot of accessor but what&#x27;s interesting is that those accessories are consistent so if you read his book on uh basic properties of matter on chemistry he uses the same accessories as what he uses when you read his book Universe of motion which is on astronomy and he&#x27;ll use even the same uh accessories when he&#x27;s writing about economics in his book The the road to permanent Prosperity which we&#x27;ll be getting to eventually here as well um so he&#x27;s not just making these things up but it it appears as if he does if you are just taking the books um on an island and and you&#x27;re just taking them one at a time you have to kind of see the whole picture you have to kind of read all of the books before you re realize that he&#x27;s actually being consistent and not just pulling things out just because they work for him in this particular instance so you kind of maybe just need to trust me on that a little bit but um Larson is being consistent like where he&#x27;s using the interatomic distance or um you know where he&#x27;s uh figuring out the rotational forces so we&#x27;re going to backtrack just a paragraph when going through this but um we&#x27;re going to move forward here even I&#x27;ll be it slowly and trudge our way through these first couple chapters until we can get some kind of more solid foundation now the basic idea behind larsson&#x27;s Theory again is articulated in his two fundamental part postulates and really in his first postulate which says that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay summarized by me I would say the universe is not made out of matter the universe is not made out of energy or anything else force or anything like that the universe is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time this sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time and uh motion is basically a fraction with space space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator time and space can both come in multiple Dimensions 1 2 3 even four five and six dimensions and um all of our scientific quantities are relationships between space and time such as speed speed is space over time energy is time over space acceleration is space over time to the second power force is time over space to the second power matter is time to the third power over space to the third power and so on and so forth um and those can be derived in various ways but they also are valuable check on our work because now he has boiled it down to two uh variables time and space as opposed to three from the MKS system which is matter uh um meters kilogram and seconds so time and space and matter but for Larsson matter is just time to the third power or space to the third power so that gets rid of matter and now we&#x27;re just dealing with time and space and so that makes it much less cumbersome um now um Larsson when he refers to the universe of motion he&#x27;s referring to a specific spefic kind of motion that is actually a more generalized and non-localized kind of motion that he calls scalar motion which has been recognized by science but not recognized for its significance uh it&#x27;s kind of just a a sideshow for uh Legacy science but for Larson scalar motion is the fundamental thing that he builds upon and a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction and the way to Envision scalar motion is by uh a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the dots will be moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific direction or rather they&#x27;re moving in all directions each dot is moving away from each other dot um and uh but there&#x27;s no specific Direction that&#x27;s basically like a two-dimensional scalar motion you would fill in that third dimension if you use something like raisin bread and if you put the bread in the oven and it starts to rise all of the raisins will be moving away from all of the other raisins that&#x27;s also a scalar motion each one is moving away from each other one but they&#x27;re not moving in any particular direction the only way that you get a particular direction is if you pick one of the raisins and say this one is motionless or one of the dots on the balloon and you say this one is motionless and I I will measure from uh you know all the other dots from this one and that will give you the directions but that is not a product of the motion itself it is a product of the reference system so it&#x27;s the reference system that is giving you the directions not the uh motion itself which is scalar and the same uh and it can be applied also with an inward movement of that balloon so if you suck in the balloon and all of the dots will be moving toward each other it will appear as if uh the dots are moving U due to a force of attraction like this this dot is moving toward this Dot and so there must be a force field there other otherwise that&#x27;s that that&#x27;s action at a distance and there has to be a force that ex is explaining why this dot is moving toward this other dot but that&#x27;s not the case it&#x27;s just that all of the dots are moving toward all of the other dots including these two that you&#x27;re focusing on it appears as if there is an attraction there but there isn&#x27;t uh and the the uh data the measurements that you make make it appear as if there is a force between as well it acts as if it were a force but it is not a force that&#x27;s what Larson calls an as if Force it&#x27;s not a force but you call it a force because it it complies with all of the math of a force but it is really an as if for it is a scalar motion that you have assigned a reference point to okay now the um other major thing is that uh space and time and motion come in only discrete units you have to have a full unit of space and you have to have a full unit of time in order to have those things if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have them so uh and the units are small but not infinite decimal or close to infinite decimal actually but very small but they exist so the uh unit of space is 4.56 * 10- 8 m and the unit time is 1.52 * 10- 16 seconds and so um if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have what lson calls unit speed 1 over 1 equal 1 and unit speed is the speed of light so in the reciprocal system this is the center of the universe this is the null point or the neutral point the zero point the origin a lson calls it the progression of the natural reference system if you have an empty Universe with nothing at all in it you still have a motion outward at the speed of light in all directions that is the default uh motion of the universe and that&#x27;s what Larsson calls the reference the progression of the natural the natural reference system the stationary reference system is what the scientists use they make their measurements from zero speed Larsson makes his measurements from from the speed of light outward in all directions and that means that it&#x27;s the the midpoint and that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light half is moving slower than the speed of light the uh speed of light represents a boundary between those two regions that Larson refers to as the uh Cosmic sector and the material sector respectively and then within each one of those sectors is a sub region um that is uh in the pl place where you do not have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space and so you only have time that&#x27;s the material sector in the material sector you have um three dimensions of space which is what Larson calls coordinate space three dimensions of space in a still frame and you have clock time that&#x27;s a scalar motion of time time is always getting later and later and later and later that&#x27;s in the material sector in the cosmic sector you have three dimensions of spa of time three dimensions of time or coordinate time and you have clock space meaning that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart just like on an expanding balloon uh so basically when you cross that unit speed boundary you switch they are reciprocals of one another the cosmic and material sectors are reciprocals of one another and you have to switch the uh roles of space and time so in the material sector you&#x27;ve got coordinate time and clock space in the in the cosmic sector you have coordinate space and clock time and the same is true in the material sector where you get with less than one unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space you only have time because the contents of the universe are space and time so it&#x27;s got to be one or the other or both and in this case it&#x27;s not space so it must be time Lara refers to this as the time region and this is a region of where uh atoms and molecules interact because that is less than they interact in less than one unit of space and uh same is true in the cosmic sector but in the the reverse uh that if you have uh three dimensions of uh time in a still frame um but you have a region of less than one where the interactions occur less than one unit of time well you don&#x27;t have time anymore you only have space u because you have to have a full unit of time before you have time and so then you only have space so Larson refers to that as the space region and that is the region of Cosmic atoms and Cosmic molecule interactions a cosmic atom was known by Legacy scientists as a an anti antimatter or a Mason okay so that&#x27;s kind of laying some of the groundwork now he lays down a few other things here um um and talking about the time region but so when you&#x27;re talking about solid cohesion you&#x27;re talking about a balancing of forces between um uh this outward motion outward scalar motion the progression is what he calls it and the inward scalar motion which is what he calls gravitation but when you cross that unit speed boundary and you move into the time region you reverse the directions of those forces so normally the progression is moving everything farther and farther and farther apart and gravitation is moving the dots closer and closer and closer together but when you move into the time region it turns out that gravitation is moving everything farther and farther and farther apart and the progression is moving everything closer and closer and closer together and at a certain point those two forces reach an equilibrium and that equilibrium is known as the interatomic distance and so that each element has an interatomic distance uh or maybe more than one of them depending on the orientation of the atom how it&#x27;s oriented an atom is a combination of rotations in larsson&#x27;s system the universe of motion everything is based on motion so an atom is not a bunch of electrons and and protons and neutrons it is is a bunch of motions and uh each atom has their own motion profile on the periodic table for example oxygen oxygen is element number eight in the periodic table meaning that it has eight protons and eight electrons and eight approximately eight neutrons maybe more and um in the in Larson system uh a uh an oxygen atom is two primary two-dimensional uh rotations two secondary two-dimensional rotations and one onedimensional rotation or two I&#x27;m sorry two negative to um rotational onedimensional rotational motions um it seems pretty complicated but it basically is just notated as 22 -2 and each atom has a signature three three-digit signature such as that and um you can figure out the atomic number from those and you can figure out a whole lot of other stuff from those three numbers so those are the re rotational forces of the atom again these are as if forces es okay so we&#x27;re going to start reading from here and we&#x27;ll see if this makes any sense and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m just backtracking by a paragraph in this chapter we are dealing mainly with what we are calling rotational forces there are of course these are of course the same as if forces due to the scalar aspect of the atomic rotation that were called gravitational in some other contexts the choice of language depending on whether it is the origin or the effect of the force that is being emphasized in the discussion for quantitative evaluation of the rotational forces we may use the general Force equation providing that we replace the that was an equation he derived in the book nothing but motion the previous motion um the previous volume to this providing that we replace the usual terms of the equation with the appropriate time region terms so now he&#x27;s making a you know a change of the of the um equation to adapt to Now using it in the time region uh the region of less than one unit of uh of space as explained in introducing the concept of the time region back in volume one equivalent space so equivalent space is time uh uh equivalent space is the spatial equivalent of time time and space are reciprocals of one another so time equals 1 over space and vice versa space equals 1 over time and so equivalent space 1/t replaces space in the time region and velocity is therefore 1 over time squared because velocity is space over time so 1 over time over time equals 1/ time squar energy uh which is normally time over space energy the onedimensional equivalent of mass which takes because mass is time to the thir power over space to the thir power energy the onedimensional equivalent of mass which takes the place of mass in the time region expression of the force equation because the the three rotations of the atom act separately rather than jointly in this region is the reciprocal of this expression or t to the 2 power time over space but space is one over time so time over 1/ time which equals time to the second power acceleration is velocity divide divided by time so that&#x27;s 1/ time the 3 power the time region equivalent of the equation fals ma which is the general Force equation from Newton or whoever is f = EA equals time to the second power * 1/ time to the 3 power which equals 1/ T in each Dimension so that is the uh force or the as if Force at this point we will need to take note of the nature of the increments of speed displacement in the time region in the outside region additions to the displacement preceived by units first one unit then another similar unit yet another and so on the total up to any specific point being n units there is no term term with the value n this value appears only as a total so that&#x27;s how you you know add up the increments of speed displacement and speed displacement is basically how is this differing from motion at the speed of light in all directions the progression that&#x27;s what you measure from so speed displacement is the distance from um the progression to what you&#x27;re measuring so that&#x27;s uh you know unlike the Legacy scientists who are measuring from zero Larson is measuring from the progression of the natural reference system and so that that uh amount is not necessarily speed it is speed displacement the additions in the time region follow a different mathematical pattern because in this case only one of the components of motion progresses the other remaining fixed at the unit value or speed of light outward in all directions um here the displacement is 1 /x and the sequence is 1 over 1 1 over 2 1 over 3 all the way out to 1 over n the quantity 1 /n is the final term not the total to obtain the total that corresponds to n in the outside region it is necessary to integrate so now we&#x27;re getting into C uh minor calculus it is necessary to integrate the quantity 1 /x from x = 1 to X = N the result is log of n the natural logarithm of n many readers of the first edition have asked why this total should be an integral rather than a summation I kind of question that Larson even had many readers who even got to that got that far into it to even ask that question but um if so he had many readers who asked him why this should be an integral rather than a summation the answer is that we are dealing with A continuous quantity as pointed out in the intro introductory chapters of the preceding volume the motion of which the universe is constructed does not proceed in a succession of jumps even though it exists only in units it is a continuous progression a unit of this motion is a specific portion of this continuity a series of units is a more extended segment of that continuity and its magnitude is an integral in dealing with the basic individual units of motion in the outside region it is possible to use the summation process but only because in this case the sum is the same as the integral to get the total of the 1 /x series we must integrate uh I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever understood that paragraph um and I probably need to read it over again but um I probably could use the brush up on my calculus as well but he you know he&#x27;s saying even though it exists only only in discrete units it is a continuous progression I think that&#x27;s what I have trouble with even though it exists only in units it is a continuous progression okay so to evaluate the rotational Force we integrate the quantity one over one from Unity the physical data or zero level 2 T so the integration of um [Music] one uh 1 over t uh DT equals log of T time the integral of 1 / T um DT equals log of t Okay so that that is the equation that he&#x27;s going to be using [Music] uh for uh figuring out uh I think the force here so if the quantity uh T is below unity in any Dimension there is no effective outward force in that Dimension uh in any Dimension there is no effective outward force in that Dimension but the natural logarithm exceeds Unity for all values of X above two and the atoms of all elements have a rotational displacement of two um equivalent to tal 3 or more in at least one dimension consequently all atoms have effective rotational forces so he has determined through that equation what the force of each atom is you just take the log a the natural log and uh he&#x27;ll be plugging that into the equation but he has to derve a few other equations before he does that and we&#x27;ll get into that tomorrow uh if anybody has any uh recommendations about uh the best way to teach this I would be certainly open I&#x27;m trying to I&#x27;m trying to be thorough and to cover what he&#x27;s talking about just but you know uh I&#x27;m just one guy and I don&#x27;t understand this uh flawlessly either I&#x27;ve read it over a number of times but there&#x27;s some sticking points and I I&#x27;ve tried to kind of do the background I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not a scientist I I you know but I&#x27;m I&#x27;m doing the best I can so I&#x27;m just trying to present the information you might be able to extract it better than I could uh so uh we will move on to the next uh section here and uh we&#x27;ll do that tomorrow so thanks for tuning in today and have a great day</p>
