            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>A lot of the sourcing is coming from people that were in the government, right? That, you know, they probably still are in in some cases and they&#x27;re compartmentalized like we were talking about early earlier with some of this stuff. &gt;&gt; And so, &gt;&gt; what what do you think of what do you think of Grush? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think &gt;&gt; and him coming out. Obviously, it&#x27;s not quite a story. &gt;&gt; No, but I think bizarre, but &gt;&gt; I think what he did was great.</p>
<p>I think what he did was great and I think it&#x27;s a shame that more haven&#x27;t. You know, I think I think him and Bob have something in common in that I believe they both felt that more people would follow up when they came out. &gt;&gt; I think Bob was hoping that more people from S4 would be like, &quot;Yeah, me too.&quot; And I think Grush felt more people from the program would also be like, &quot;Yeah, me too.&quot; And I don&#x27;t think it happened. And I think that sucks, you know, if you&#x27;re in that position. So, &gt;&gt; oh, there&#x27;s a lot of things that happen behind the scenes, too.</p>
<p>And I think people get wind of that like, oh, [ __ ] I don&#x27;t want that to happen to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you see, you know, the barrage that he had to, &gt;&gt; you know, and and just for that, just to not deal with social media is a big enough reason not to come out, just to be like, I don&#x27;t want that. I don&#x27;t want to &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; have a Twitter profile now.</p>
<p>And &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the thing though, when you&#x27;re making when you&#x27;re coming out with something that big. Yeah, &gt;&gt; forget just the extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Every part of your life that&#x27;s publicly available is going to be picked apart and there&#x27;s &gt;&gt; I understand that and and I&#x27;m that sucks. I can&#x27;t imagine being in that position. That really does suck.</p>
<p>But like &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s relevant. You know what I mean? Like who you are, where you&#x27;re from, what your motives could be. It&#x27;s all relevant. &gt;&gt; Nobody knows that you know [ __ ] right? So they&#x27;re never going to be like you got to talk. They&#x27;ll just leave you alone.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; But the second you say, &quot;I might know something.&quot; &gt;&gt; Now you&#x27;re an [ __ ] for not playing ball. Now you&#x27;re might go to jail if you say something. Now you&#x27;re in this weird position. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. And and you know, we know people like that who you know, they&#x27;ll come out and they&#x27;ll say a little bit of something, but now you&#x27;re playing ball. Now we know, you know, and now it&#x27;s like everybody&#x27;s judging you. Everybody&#x27;s picking at your past and digging into everything you say and every interview and micro expressions and &gt;&gt; but if you just sit back, &gt;&gt; you don&#x27;t got to say anything, &gt;&gt; right? you know, and that&#x27;s fine, too. So, it&#x27;s like I get it.</p>
<p>I I do understand, but that&#x27;s why what Grush did and what Bal Lazar did, I mean, it takes it takes some balls. It takes some guts. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then, look, you&#x27;re going to get some people that are just going to copycat that and jump on it and some that&#x27;ll just straight up lie. And then you&#x27;ll get some stories that aren&#x27;t reliable to which then can denigrate the original person through no fault of their own, which I think some of that&#x27;s happened to David Grush.</p>
<p>Yeah. because you did have like you&#x27;re right a lot of the people that he&#x27;s referring to that he&#x27;s like I hope and I don&#x27;t know who these people are but sure I hope they&#x27;ll come out and talk about it clearly &gt;&gt; all those people didn&#x27;t and &gt;&gt; the pe of the people that have there&#x27;s been no one to come out since Grush that I think has anywhere near the level of like [ __ ] meter you know smell test credibility that he does and we and we&#x27;ve seen several but like &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s also when you&#x27;re in this space and you&#x27;re getting sourcing ing. Now, hey guys, if you haven&#x27;t already subscribed, please hit that subscribe button. It&#x27;s a huge, huge help. Thank you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; A lot of the sourcing is coming from people that were in the government, right? That, you know, they probably still are in in some cases and they&#x27;re compartmentalized like we were talking about early earlier with some of this stuff. And so, you know, if you&#x27;re someone like James Fox, right, our mutual friend, he&#x27;s a documentarian. He has to go. He&#x27;s not a government insider or like an insider in that case on on UFOs, he has to go get the sources. So if you get without naming names certain people who had access to certain programs to tell you things that then seem reliable and then those same people then end up feeding you things that are not reliable.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It makes the it it makes you question all of it. I know James like deals with that like what? Yeah. All right. If that wasn&#x27;t I know this isn&#x27;t true, but does does that mean that&#x27;s not true? That seemed more true. This one&#x27;s you know what I mean? It&#x27;s a really tough game to play.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s tough. Yeah. That&#x27;s why you know podcasting is easy for us because you know we can sit across somebody who&#x27;s &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; living a you know a schizophrenic reality or &gt;&gt; is a government insider you know and it doesn&#x27;t matter either way. It&#x27;s entertaining.</p>
<p>is fun. We can talk about things and discover things and hypothesize and theorize about whimsical realities. Uh but yeah, like people like James, uh it makes it a little bit more tough because he&#x27;s he&#x27;s in those courtrooms and he&#x27;s in, you know, those interviews with the military folk. And that&#x27;s why I think the more I study this stuff, the further from that disclosure UAP team I&#x27;m going u and and and not because it isn&#x27;t uh valuable. I think sure it&#x27;s valuable.</p>
<p>It has its place. I just rather talk to a farmer than a lawmaker at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; I like that. That&#x27;s a good bar. Farmer than a lawmaker.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re just, you know, I don&#x27;t know. Somebody who&#x27;s salt of the earth and just tells it like it is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, just because it comes from a guy in a suit who who who drafts up bills or whatever, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s not going to raise my conviction level.</p>
<p>If anything, it&#x27;ll lower it. So, I I think just talking to real people, experiencers, people who&#x27;ve, you know, had experiences and hearing them out and that&#x27;s it. And then I &gt;&gt; let the people judge. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think we&#x27;re going to, you know, that&#x27;s our part.</p>
<p>The part that we play as podcasters in this uh disclosure forum &gt;&gt; I think is just opening the conversation. I think that&#x27;s a really important part to play is just to have a platform where it&#x27;s okay. And now that you know someone says, &quot;Oh, I was on the Julian Dory podcast.&quot; And they go they go, &quot;Oh yeah, I like that guy. Yeah, he had a guy on there was talking about aliens the other day.&quot; And it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not so insane, you know? And that I think that&#x27;s just in itself very important to just have that. And so I&#x27;m very happy with that.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll leave the uh detective work to guys like UAP Gerb and you know and James Fox and those guys digging a little bit deeper than I ever you know could possibly. So &gt;&gt; yeah, that was because like I go I go way back with James Allesie who used to be the instudio producer and runs all my &gt;&gt; he&#x27;s like the head of content with me now. He he was down in Brazil making mom contact with James in July 2021. James came to my parents house a few years ago, did a couple podcast that went nuts and all that. So like awesome guy, works his ass off, genuinely cares and and really is amazing at getting people to open up and you see that in his work.</p>
<p>And like whenever you&#x27;re looking at anything, let alone something as wild as UFOs. Doesn&#x27;t matter who you are, you&#x27;re never going to get it all right. Or there&#x27;s going to be things that later you&#x27;re like, &quot;Ah, thought maybe that could be something, but that&#x27;s actually bullshit.&quot; But you know how people are on the internet. They pick every [ __ ] thing apart. And like James made another brilliantly put together documentary with the program that had, by the way, had a lot of important storylines in it in it that absolutely have real verifiable stuff to it, but then also had Jason Sans in there.</p>
<p>And this this is where I ran into a problem because the people that brought James Jason Sans which are think like government suit type people like you were talking about have brought him other stuff in the past that seemed more to pass the smell test. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then you see with Jason Sans and you realize that they knew that Jason had severe PTSD among other issues in his profile that would make him questionable at best as a witness. And then clearly someone who I I I don&#x27;t think any of his story is real. I think it literally was all lifted from Gaia and there&#x27;s a whole explanation behind there.</p>
<p>But like when those same people were push literally I know pushing that [ __ ] down James&#x27; throat like yo just hear him out have him on this documentary. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like what does that mean about some of the other stuff &gt;&gt; course &gt;&gt; that we thought was pretty good? Like do you wrestle with that sometimes? &gt;&gt; Uh no. Um, I I just kind of take it in. It&#x27;s fine.</p>
<p>Like I&#x27;m not just because I hear a story doesn&#x27;t mean I believe it. So I&#x27;m I&#x27;m very happy to hear all the stories even if they&#x27;re true or not. Or I think something I think true information is as valuable as somebody who&#x27;s lying. I think if you&#x27;re telling me the truth or lying, if I know you&#x27;re lying because I can prove it, then that&#x27;s valuable information, too. Just like you said, now that you have this, you&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, now you start questioning the source.&quot; So, I think it&#x27;s important to get all this stuff.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t care, you know, just let&#x27;s I don&#x27;t know. Let&#x27;s just dissect what we have and and speculate on what we have. I mean, there&#x27;s nothing else we can do. This is all we got to play with. Like, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m sitting here reading on Reddit and 4chan forums like like I&#x27;m some type of, you know, researcher.</p>
<p>It it&#x27;s all we got. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And people come on come down to me like that. They&#x27;re like, &quot;Hey, you know, 4chan isn&#x27;t legitimate sourcing.&quot; Yeah. obviously, but it&#x27;s all we got.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all I got. I got some guy here claiming. So, I&#x27;m going to take it. I&#x27;m going to read the whole thing. If something clicks, something clicks.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&#x27;t, whatever. No loss. I&#x27;m just, you know, now I have more information I did before. So, that&#x27;s how I kind of treat it all, whether it&#x27;s, you know, the Jason Sans stuff or whatnot. I think uh but I do hold you know witnesses that are outside of the government sphere in higher conviction &gt;&gt; than I would somebody within the government for sure.</p>
