            <p>The heart of what we do uh is not uh merely the investment in the company. The heart of what we do is to uh facilitate the piloting of technology uh uh uh uh by an end user at one or more of those agencies of the technology from one of our portfolio companies. And success for us is when the end agency adopts that technology. Adoption is a very specifically defined thing as a contract between the end agency and the portfolio company which deploys the technology into mission and operational environment oftent times with the enhanced features that we helped uh uh uh uh uh uh uh the two groups come together on. So uh uh so we&#x27;ve been doing this now for 25 years.</p>
<p>We do it at scale and we&#x27;ve delivered impact across a wide variety of uh uh US intelligence and defense agencies.</p>
