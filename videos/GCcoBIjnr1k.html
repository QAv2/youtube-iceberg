            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>-TRAVIS: Oh, hey, fellas. -THOMAS: Welcome back, guys. -Good to see you. -TRAVIS: How y&#x27;all doing, man? -How you doing, boy? -Good to see you, man.</p>
<p> TRAVIS: While we were waiting  for the casing of borehole one  to get done in the mesa, we welcomed back the guys from LOC Precision to help us conduct our most advanced rocket experiment yet: to figure out one of the craziest anomalies we&#x27;ve ever encountered</p>
<p>on Skinwalker Ranch. You know, we&#x27;ve been following up on what appears from our view through lidar -to be an invisible bubble -Yep.</p>
<p>that is about 600 meters in, uh, radius, centered on the triangle here.  TRAVIS:  Based on numerous  infrared lidar scans,  a gigantic sphere</p>
<p> that we call the bubble  sits above and below ground,  and it covers a huge area,  including the mesa drill site,  the east field  and even Dry Gulch Creek.  It&#x27;s like something  that we can&#x27;t see  exists all through that zone  and displaces  or swallows the data.</p>
<p>So, today, we&#x27;re gonna use high-powered rockets, equipped with specialized devices, to see if we can collect some accurate data up in that space. All right, everybody,</p>
<p>ready for launch  in five, four,  three, two, one.  Rocket&#x27;s straight overhead. I don&#x27;t see the light. There it is. I saw the chute charge,</p>
<p>but I didn&#x27;t see any lights.  TRAVIS:  I think I just heard it  crash on the ground. -JIM: Hey, Travis.</p>
<p>-Yo. -You&#x27;re not gonna believe it. -What am I not gonna believe? -So I get over Dry Gulch Creek... -South of it? Yeah.</p>
<p>When I get up near that barrier of the bubble, I started losing all communication on the drone. Could not move the drone. So, you had GPS errors,</p>
<p>you had communication errors. Yeah, yeah. That&#x27;s crazy, man. Hey, Travis? This is Pete. Do you want to walk over here to the terrestrial</p>
<p>laser scanner?  TRAVIS:  I&#x27;m headed right there.  Jim&#x27;s drone issues  sounded like, once again,  the barrier of the bubble  was somehow stopping us  from collecting data.</p>
<p>So, that made me wonder what Pete was about to show me on the lidar scanner that we had right in the center of the triangle. What&#x27;s up, Pete? -Just look at it -What do you want me to look at? and tell us what you see.</p>
<p>All right. PETE: There&#x27;s where the rocket was launched from.  TRAVIS: Right.</p>
<p> PETE: But way over here  is where the lidar  shows its smoke trail  after the launch.  They should line up.  TRAVIS:  The rocket is displaced by...</p>
<p> PETE:  Ten, 12--  TRAVIS:  Ten-- ten or 12 feet. That makes no sense.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> lidar technology  uses infrared light  to map out detailed images  of an environment. But once again, something at the center of the triangle either fooled or displaced  Pete Kelsey&#x27;s</p>
<p> terrestrial lidar data  to make it seem like  our last rocket launch  was several feet away  from where we knew  it actually was. This was more possible evidence that something right in the center of the bubble is corrupting</p>
<p>our data collection. But what on earth could do that? How we doing out there, guys? Good. About ready to arm it all up here. Okay, I&#x27;m gonna check Kate.</p>
<p>-JIM: Okay.  -TRAVIS: Either way,  now that something  at the center of the bubble  seemed to be  once again stopping us  from collecting data there, we needed to launch that last big rocket to see</p>
<p>if we could figure it out. All right, let&#x27;s do it. Hey, guys, don&#x27;t forget to start all the lights and everything. -JIM: Look at that.</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: We got-we got something on the mesa! Erik, we got something on the-on the mesa. Just west of the tower. Erik, if you got any eyes on top of the mesa that can look north</p>
<p>just over the mesa, -behind the launch tower. -I am watching now.  Travis, uh, please be advised  I do show  a moving point of light that is to the north and west of the triangle.</p>
<p> Quite interestingly,  Travis reports spotting a prospective UAP over the mesa.  Immediately,  my thoughts are turned  to the very peculiar timing  of when it showed up.</p>
<p> This happens to coincide  with the emergence  of a 1.2 gigahertz signal.  We don&#x27;t know where  it&#x27;s coming from, but I would really like to know, and I think we would all like to know what relationship there is</p>
<p>between these emergent signals and some of the other phenomenology, like the UAPs that we sometimes see. -ALLEN: Kate says launch is a go.</p>
<p>-All right. Five, four,  three, two, one. Ooh. PETE: Wow.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Chute has deployed. We see the rocket, straight up.  ERIK:  Travis, do we have eyes on the strobe? TRAVIS:</p>
<p>Yes, we do, Erik. It is straight up.  ERIK:  Copy that. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>2,400 feet right now, Erik. Copy you, Travis.  I&#x27;ve got eyes on the rocket. THOMAS: Gosh.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: This one&#x27;s falling way off course. Y&#x27;all see that? MIKE: Kind of whipping around up there a little bit.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: How far? ALLEN: Half a mile. TRAVIS: Half a mile away</p>
<p>right now to the north. ALLEN: It&#x27;s going to the same place. TRAVIS: Yep.</p>
<p>These huge rockets are designed to go straight up  and come straight back down.  There were no high winds,  but both large rockets  fell way off course  to the same spot,  like something pushed them  away from the bubble.</p>
<p>Again, it was like something was stopping us from collecting data above the triangle and inside the bubble. So, what could do that?  -ERIK: Hey, guys.  -TRAVIS: Hey, hey.</p>
<p>-ERIK: Come on in, have a seat. -What&#x27;s going on? -KALEB: Hey, guys. -We are gonna look at the data from the, uh, rocket launches with LOC. THOMAS:</p>
<p>That was a very active night. -I remember there was just a lot going on. -Mm-hmm.  After spending</p>
<p> most of the next day  crunching all the data  from our rocket experiment, Erik called us into the command center to review everything. ERIK: So, what I&#x27;m gonna show us is the positional GPS data for all the events that go along</p>
<p>with, uh, rocket launches. So, this is the Kate data, then? Yeah. Which was the computer inside of the rocket? Yeah. Watch this.</p>
<p>So, you&#x27;re gonna see the launch. -We are at the triangle. -THOMAS: Mm-hmm. Center of, uh, center of our bubble.</p>
<p>And look what happens here. -TRAVIS: Wow. -JIM: Whoa. -THOMAS: Oh, wow. -TRAVIS: That&#x27;s crazy.</p>
<p>ERIK: Yeah, so, I mean, look, you guys were standing right down there at the tent, you saw this launch. Do we all agree it didn&#x27;t do this? -Yeah, that&#x27;s strange.</p>
<p>-Yeah, it did not do that. It went straight. Yeah, nevertheless, according to a very sophisticated rocket tracking system, that&#x27;s the path that that rocket took.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s an abrupt change of direction. TRAVIS: That rocket did not do that. Now, look at this.</p>
<p>Green coloration means that we have a stronger link between the Kate system aboard the rocket and the receiver on the ground. The red end is as weak as it gets.</p>
<p>But, so what means is, uh, the Kate system was-was affected by whatever this phenomenon is. -Yeah. -Yeah.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  We all saw that rocket  go straight up  above the triangle.  But according to  the Kate GPS tracking system,  right after the rocket</p>
<p> was launched,  it flew at a very hard angle  for several hundred feet  before suddenly turning  and then going straight up. So, could the bubble have fooled this rocket&#x27;s GPS tracker to think it made</p>
<p>these maneuvers? Now, the weird thing is, uh... Zoom out all the way to the-- -So we get the whole thing. -Uh-huh. TRAVIS: And let&#x27;s see if there are</p>
<p>other kinks in the flight. ERIK: Yeah, let&#x27;s have a look. I would say that this part here-- that looks like</p>
<p>a regular rocket trajectory. Right here, there&#x27;s clearly a kink. And it&#x27;s possible that somewhere in here-- We&#x27;ve got missing data here, and you got missing data here and missing data here and here.</p>
<p>Inside the bubble, right? We&#x27;ve consistently seen missing data inside the bubble. But then, look up here. There&#x27;s more missing data. Somewhere...</p>
<p>somewhere in here, right? That&#x27;s about 3,200 feet. That&#x27;s where the rockets got pushed off course on their descent. Look, we got rocket data missing above the bubble at about 3,200 feet high.</p>
<p>So, now, we got something else going on above the bubble, too. That&#x27;s pretty damn interesting. TRAVIS: That&#x27;s real interesting.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a gap of missing data points about 3,200 feet high above the triangle right where the rockets fell off course.  So, is there another anomaly</p>
<p> above the bubble  that is related  to the countless UAPs,  strange signals  and voids in our data? And if so, how are these things connected? THOMAS: Okay.</p>
<p> ERIK:  Thanks, guys.  A lot of our efforts  are focused on judging whether we&#x27;re dealing with something real or simply, uh, artifactual</p>
<p>within our data  when we&#x27;re talking about  this bubble.  We need to employ  everything we&#x27;ve got  to give us even more  accurate data to find out.</p>
<p>Between the UAPs, the repeated missing data and the weird signals we detected this week,  it feels like something  on Skinwalker Ranch  is trying to discourage  our investigation.</p>
<p> Well, let me tell you,  it&#x27;s all having  the opposite effect.  And we&#x27;re not gonna give up  until we have all the answers.  This morning,  things on Skinwalker Ranch</p>
<p> appeared to be going  a lot better than usual  with our drilling operation  out at the mesa.  The team had gotten more than  halfway up through the second  of two boreholes  that are positioned  on either side of a massive,</p>
<p> potentially metallic object,  which is surrounded  by several smaller anomalies. So, once Borehole 2 is finished, we can insert scanning devices into both boreholes, and hopefully, identify what these potential objects could be.</p>
<p> ALEX: Thomas, you got a copy?  THOMAS: I do, Alex.  Go ahead. Running into, uh, some issues over here. I&#x27;m going to have to pull out.</p>
<p>You say you&#x27;re pulling out? -Yeah. -Uh, what&#x27;s the problem? Yesterday, I was cutting through this hard spot around 380 feet in. -Right. -And then I hit this spot, 470 foot in, and I hit something.</p>
<p>Took me every bit of two and a half hours to get 67 inches, and I&#x27;m not moving at all now. And it&#x27;s not even biting, it&#x27;s just rotating smoothly.</p>
<p>Well, shoot. I&#x27;ll-- I won&#x27;t delay you anymore, I&#x27;ll let you get the pipe out. I&#x27;m going to go over to the spoils pit and see if that bit is damaged -when it comes out of the hole.</p>
<p>-Okay.  THOMAS:  The drillers experienced  so many issues drilling  on our second hole. And now, whatever we&#x27;re running</p>
<p>up against is extremely hard.  It really makes me wonder,  what&#x27;s making it  so hard for them  to drill into the mesa? There it is. Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Only one tooth on that bit is worn down. The way that you guys were describing it, I thought the teeth would have popped off or been wore down to a nub.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s exactly what should have happened. -That&#x27;s got all the teeth. -Mm-hmm. That cutting side one, the inside&#x27;s off of it a little bit.</p>
<p>ALEX: Well, I don&#x27;t know what I could have been into. I was not moving at all. And it was acting almost bald. It felt like I didn&#x27;t have</p>
<p>any teeth on the end at all. KYLE: It makes kind of a screeching noise, like if you&#x27;re rubbing a knife on a plate or something.</p>
<p>Something smooth. And that would usually be when there&#x27;s no teeth on the end of that bit. THOMAS: I am absolutely shocked.</p>
<p> Because this drill bit  isn&#x27;t seriously damaged, it leaves me with a lot of questions as to what was so hard that this drill bit couldn&#x27;t drill through?  Is he drilling up against  those anomalies that the GPR  data shows buried in the mesa?  Does this mean  that we&#x27;re drilling into  some type of metallic object?  Or is it something else</p>
<p> that&#x27;s causing  this strange behavior  with the drill? I&#x27;ll get out of your way and let you guys get this changed out. ALEX: Yeah, we&#x27;ll change out these</p>
<p>bits and I&#x27;ll keep you updated.  THOMAS:  Okay. Thanks, guys. EASTON: Is it moving at all? I don&#x27;t think so.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s a pretty hard layer I&#x27;m in right here. Alex Swanson and his crew stayed late  to see if they  could break through it  and finish the hole.</p>
<p> So, we were closely  monitoring the process  with our spectrum analyzers  and radiation detectors.  THOMAS:  Thomas to Erik, do you copy?  ERIK:  Yeah, Thomas.</p>
<p> What do you got?  Uh, they&#x27;re drilling  through something  -extremely hard right now. -Copy that.  We&#x27;re going to  monitor down here.</p>
<p>Copy that.  TRAVIS:  And while drilling continued,  archaeologist Chris Roberts  was still methodically  sifting through the drilling  spoils for any clues  that might help explain just</p>
<p> what&#x27;s buried inside the mesa.  CHRIS (over radio):  Hey, guys. You got a copy? THOMAS: Yes.</p>
<p>Go ahead.  Yeah, I got  some things over here  I think you&#x27;re gonna want  to take a look at.  You want to come over here</p>
<p> to the spoils site? Absolutely. We&#x27;ll head right over. Sam, Jim, if y&#x27;all don&#x27;t mind, keep an eye on this and let us know if it changes dramatically or whatever.</p>
<p>-Yeah, absolutely. -All right, we&#x27;ll be back in a bit. ROYSTON: Okay.</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: Hey, Chris. -CHRIS: Hey, guys. -Thanks for coming over. -TRAVIS: Yeah, man. CHRIS: Something I wanted</p>
<p>to show you that I really can&#x27;t believe that we found inside the mesa. What the hell is this? What is that? CHRIS: It&#x27;s ceramics. What? Travis, flip it over.</p>
<p>Flip it over. Do you see the two different colors? -TRAVIS: Yeah. -We&#x27;ve got a glazed surface -and we have a porous surface here?</p>
<p>-Yes. L-Look at the patterning. TRAVIS: Yeah. It&#x27;s like</p>
<p>a crosshatch pattern in it. ERIK: Yes, absolutely. That&#x27;s manufactured, guys. Yeah, that-that is</p>
<p>absolutely pressed into place and then baked. Could this really be a manufactured ceramic material? How did it get deep in the mesa?  Is this what damaged the drill  and made  the beacon signal spread?  And is it connected  to the 1.6 gigahertz signal  we just detected? This right here</p>
<p>is a edge fragment -right there. -TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. CHRIS: That-- so that&#x27;s a finished edge.</p>
<p>-KALEB: Yes. -THOMAS: Oh, my gosh, -look how perfect it is. -TRAVIS: It&#x27;s beveled. TRAVIS: Holy crap.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s beveled for something-- it fits into something else. CHRIS: It&#x27;s flat, it really doesn&#x27;t have a curve to it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not a vessel, it&#x27;s not a, a plate, a cup. Basically, it&#x27;s a tile, right? But it&#x27;s too thin for a floor tile, too thin for a roof tile. You said &quot;tile,&quot; and that&#x27;s</p>
<p>ringing some bells for me. -Think about what we were told at the University of Utah. -TRAVIS: Yeah. Right? It&#x27;s a lot like</p>
<p>the space shuttle tiles. Holy smokes.  TRAVIS:  Three years ago,  we had the metal pieces that  were extracted from the mesa  examined</p>
<p> at the University of Utah. Okay.  TRAVIS: And there, metallurgy  expert Dr. Ravi Chandran  helped us conclude that</p>
<p> they had a manufactured design  that was similar  to the protective coating  used on spacecraft. It&#x27;s like a glass, it&#x27;s like a ceramic, uh, composite, right? Yeah, so, that makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>So, could this ceramic material be what the drill was hitting, and is it what kept the bit from heating up? If so, what the heck is buried in the mesa on Skinwalker Ranch? Have we punctured through something that&#x27;s coated with this ceramic? What is that ceramic</p>
<p>doing in there? KALEB: So, that&#x27;s the question is like, what would you use metal and-and ceramic like this in conjunction? TRAVIS: I don&#x27;t know. A spaceship? You said it.</p>
<p>-There&#x27;s space-age material right there. -THOMAS: Yeah. ERIK: Yeah.</p>
<p>470 feet -into a mesa in the middle of the desert. -TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>How did it get in there? THOMAS: Well, we do have a video of a UAP flying through the mesa. Who knows? Was this some kind of high-tech vessel that maybe didn&#x27;t make it all the way through and got stuck in there? ERIK:</p>
<p>I smiled at it when you said it, but I got to tell you, I&#x27;m taking it more seriously now. Watch how this thing emerges, and watch the path that it takes.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> In 2022,  we captured unbelievable video  of a glowing UAP  flying into the mesa  in the east field  and then reemerging  on the other side,  like it flew  right through solid rock.</p>
<p>So, knowing that there&#x27;s a massive object in the mesa and seeing these strange materials in the drilling spoils really makes you wonder what might have happened here. THOMAS:</p>
<p>Well, guys, the sum total of everything that we&#x27;ve seen up there, we&#x27;re seeing signals spread. You couple that with the metal we&#x27;re pulling out of there. You&#x27;ve got ceramic material,</p>
<p>you got metal, -you got magnetic rocks. -Right. -TRAVIS: Yeah. -All these things could be related to what&#x27;s in there, right? I think it&#x27;s a hundred percent</p>
<p>connected. ERIK: I want to take a radiation measurement. I&#x27;ll-I&#x27;ll get</p>
<p>the gamma ray detector. KALEB: No, that&#x27;s freakin&#x27; awesome, though. ERIK: Let me get</p>
<p>a control measurement here. Okay, so... control measurement: 37. So, I&#x27;m seeing 37 to 68. -Okay.</p>
<p>-ERIK: Yeah, that&#x27;s a normal reading. Seems like it got a little more excited. -TRAVIS: It is more radio-- 105.</p>
<p>-THOMAS: 105. TRAVIS: Whoa. THOMAS: Whoa.</p>
<p>It is radioactive. -What in the hell is this stuff? -Wow. TRAVIS: Wow, on top of everything else, this stuff has given off unusually high amounts</p>
<p>of radiation. So, could that be a clue that whatever&#x27;s in the mesa might have caused the radiation damage to the plants and animals in the nearby field? We&#x27;ve got to figure out exactly what this really is.</p>
<p>Dude, what&#x27;s going on in there? -Unbelievable. -It&#x27;s fantastic. All-all thanks to our archeologist -who knows what he&#x27;s looking at. -Heck yeah, dude.</p>
<p>-ERIK: That&#x27;s a hell of a job. -TRAVIS: Heck yeah. TRAVIS: We got to get this thing to a lab and get it tested.</p>
<p>ERIK: I want to sit down with this and get some quality time with an S.E.M.-- scanning electron microscope-- and figure out what this is. Hey, well, let&#x27;s get to it.</p>
<p>-Immediately. All right. -Let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s go.  THOMAS:</p>
<p> Thanks, Chris. DYLAN: Hey, guys. How&#x27;s it going? ERIK: Welcome to the ranch, guys. I&#x27;m Erik Bard.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m Dylan. Nice to meet you. Dominique. Nice to meet you. ERIK:</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we&#x27;re so glad to have you out to help with our investigations. Absolutely.  TRAVIS:  For six years, our team&#x27;s been working</p>
<p>to figure out all the strange things we&#x27;ve encountered on Skinwalker Ranch.  So today, we brought  a team from US Kites out  to help us learn more  about one phenomenon  that&#x27;s pretty much</p>
<p> at the top of that list.  TRAVIS:  According to the data  we&#x27;ve collected from numerous lidar instruments,  we believe that  there is a gigantic  bubble-shaped feature</p>
<p> on the ranch  that is invisible  to the human eye.  It&#x27;s centered at the triangle  and encompasses  a huge area of the property,  both above and below ground,  where we&#x27;ve seen  all kinds of things,  such as possible evidence of</p>
<p> a black hole-like phenomenon  and tons of UAPs. ERIK: We&#x27;ve had just about everything out here, you know? We&#x27;ve had helicopters, you know, fixed-wing aircraft, of course, drones, rockets.</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: Plenty of rockets. -ERIK: Plenty of rockets. But we&#x27;ve not yet had one of these Helikite platforms out here. Okay.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  We don&#x27;t know how, but whatever this bubble is, it seems to have thwarted almost every investigative tool that we&#x27;ve used to figure out what the heck it could be.</p>
<p>Last week, Jim Royston&#x27;s lidar drone even seemed to get stopped right at its southern boundary.  So today, we&#x27;re  hoping to figure out  how it could do that  by using a specialized  piece of equipment  known as a Helikite.</p>
<p>ERIK: Now, why do we call it the Helikite? Well, it&#x27;s a combination between a helium balloon and a kite. How long can we stay aloft? As long as there&#x27;s</p>
<p>helium in that balloon. -Oh. -ERIK: Okay. DOMINIQUE: It&#x27;s actually a piece of military equipment.</p>
<p>Wow. Well, we&#x27;ve got some instruments that we want to attach to this Helikite.  TRAVIS:  What excites us about the Helikite is that we can attach our instruments</p>
<p>to it and then let it hover in the air right inside the bubble&#x27;s barrier to help us collect data on it while we run a new experiment. ERIK: Yeah, I want to get out there</p>
<p>to the east field canyon -and get started. -All right. -TRAVIS: I say we get with it. -DOMINIQUE: Yeah, let&#x27;s go.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Since we first detected  evidence of the bubble,  we&#x27;ve been running experiments  inside of it  to verify its dimensions  and see what other strange  things it might contain. But today, we want</p>
<p>to see what happens when we attempt to penetrate its boundary with different instruments.  So, Thomas is going  to tow the Helikite  out to the east field  using a UTV,  where it will hang  several hundred feet high,  right in the eastern wall</p>
<p> of the bubble,  collecting data with  several of our instruments  that are attached to it. JIM: This is a good setup.  TRAVIS: These will include  a GPS tracker,  high-speed cameras</p>
<p> and a signal generator  that will continually  broadcast a frequency  at 1.2 gigahertz. All right. Yeah, good. ERIK:</p>
<p>Okay, Thomas, be advised, you are approaching the boundary -of the bubble.  -THOMAS: Copy that. ERIK: Okay if you&#x27;ll stop right there, let&#x27;s see what we&#x27;ve got.</p>
<p>Copy that.  ERIK:  You are now right at  the inside boundary  of the bubble.  Leave it in that position</p>
<p> for the duration.  THOMAS:  Copy that.  TRAVIS:  Once the Helikite</p>
<p> was positioned  right in the eastern barrier  of the bubble, we wanted to get Jim&#x27;s drone launched before I started firing rockets. All right Jim, have at it. JIM:</p>
<p>Hold on. -TRAVIS: It&#x27;s telling you errors? -JIM: Yeah, hold on. I can&#x27;t take off.</p>
<p>How is putting a balloon up in the sky keeping you from launching your drone? JIM: Who knows? I&#x27;m resetting everything. It&#x27;s crazy.</p>
<p>TRAIS: Wow, look at that. Something&#x27;s happening. Oh, dude! I&#x27;m-- This is crazy. One of my receivers</p>
<p>is picking up -a 1.2 gigahertz signal... -JIM: Whoa. ...that we are not broadcasting. This is just insane. This is the signal</p>
<p>we&#x27;re transmitting, and suddenly, this line to the right of it appeared right as the Helikite passed right into -the barrier wall. -JIM: And that&#x27;s where I got my error. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>That&#x27;s insane.  ERIK:  That is very interesting, &#x27;cause we&#x27;ve been talking about what may happen whenever a physical object passes through that boundary.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s really interesting. TRAVIS: That&#x27;s crazy. Right when we get  the Helikite up in the air  in the bubble barrier,  we detect another duplicate</p>
<p> 1.2 gigahertz signal, and Jim&#x27;s drone won&#x27;t even fly.  Did the Helikite making  contact with the bubble  trigger all of these things? All right, I am going to go get that rocket ready.  If that was the case,</p>
<p> we wanted to see what would happen when I launched a rocket through its eastern barrier. Hey, Erik, Thomas,  I am ready to do  the first rocket launch. Copy that.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re watching. We will be watching, too. Rocket&#x27;s hot. In five,  four, three,  two, one! ERIK: It&#x27;s going the wrong way.</p>
<p>Looks like it&#x27;s going north. TRAVIS: I don&#x27;t understand that.  We&#x27;re trying  to penetrate the bubble  with rockets and Jim&#x27;s drone.  But somehow, whatever this thing is,</p>
<p>it appears to stop them from going through its eastern barrier. But how can it do that?  ERIK: You ready to discuss  our experience with the maiden voyage of our Helikite? Yes.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  The next day, after processing  the Helikite data, Erik called us into the command center for a debrief on everything that happened during the experiment. Yes.</p>
<p>You know, we have a few things to discuss, but I want to start with some information that you have to share, Jim. I guess this is -your display, right? -Yeah.</p>
<p>ERIK: It&#x27;s my understanding that you experienced some difficulties with some interference with the drone itself during the experiment with the Helikite.</p>
<p>Yeah, let me jump up there. We&#x27;re looking at this boundary that&#x27;s kind of somewhere in this range, right? That&#x27;s the bubble. So, Thomas, this is where the Helikite was before you started moving it to the barrier of the bubble.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. So, this is the actual home point of the drone. We get ready to go, and as we start moving the Helikite down into the boundary,</p>
<p>all of a sudden, we&#x27;re seeing this weak satellite signal. Which to me is very interesting data because I get 21 satellites, so that&#x27;s plenty enough GPS satellites, if you will, to take off and fly, no problem. But the actual satellite signals</p>
<p>are so low, the drone -can&#x27;t take off. -Wow.  TRAVIS:  That&#x27;s crazy.  As soon as the Helikite  got into position</p>
<p> at the barrier of the bubble,  Jim lost connection  to 21 satellites.  That kept his drone  from taking off. Was it</p>
<p>the Helikite&#x27;s interaction with the barrier of the bubble that triggered it? Did you see any of these issues prior to moving -the Helikite? -No. Something about</p>
<p>the Helikite going in that barrier inside the bubble stimulates it or something, &#x27;cause then I&#x27;m having problems once it&#x27;s in there. Got it. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>I think whatever this bubble or barrier or dome is, that it&#x27;s blocking the external signal somehow. And adding to your point, blocking and possibly responsive to what we&#x27;re doing. That duplicate</p>
<p>1.2 gigahertz signal showed up when that Helikite was exactly on that boundary that we&#x27;re talking about. That&#x27;s a good point. Yep. So, as if this isn&#x27;t</p>
<p>weird enough, I&#x27;ve got some other things that happened during the-- -Hey, there&#x27;s more? -Oh, there&#x27;s more. -(chuckling) -There are some...</p>
<p>some interesting hits in the high-speed cameras that we mounted to our science platform on the Helikite. Okay, so here we have the embossed effect being used to help</p>
<p>bring out any movement, anything going through the field of view of the camera. To be clear, this is high speed, 120 frames per second. Let me know if you see anything. -SAM: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>-THOMAS: Looked translucent. What did you see? -Movement in the upper middle... -Okay. -...to the side. -So, let&#x27;s go back.</p>
<p>SAM: Right there. ERIK: Okay. We are looking at</p>
<p>at least four-- TRAVIS: At least four dots, maybe five. Yeah. Okay, so, let&#x27;s dive in on this part of the, uh, video frame.</p>
<p>And so, I&#x27;ll back us up. Okay, now I&#x27;ll play through at the normal rate. All right. There it is.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Okay, so if it&#x27;s moving really damn fast, if it&#x27;s anywhere further than right next to the camera lens. THOMAS: Can you frame advance just -a couple frames?</p>
<p>-Okay. There&#x27;s one, two, three. THOMAS: It goes behind it. ERIK:</p>
<p>Wow. THOMAS: So, we know it&#x27;s not a bug... -That&#x27;s important. -...in front of the camera.</p>
<p>-Yeah. -Yeah. That string is out -away from the platform. -ERIK: Absolutely. That is just unbelievable.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  Later that day,  while the drilling operation  continued at the mesa... Man, y&#x27;all brought a crew out this year, Tim.</p>
<p>Yeah, we-we got a crew all right.  TRAVIS:  ...we welcomed Tim Anderson and his team from Nu-Salt Lasers back out to help us investigate something else that&#x27;s just as mind-boggling.</p>
<p>We discovered that there appears to be a bubble over the ranch that is invisible to the naked eye but is centered at the triangle and is about 2,000 feet in radius. So, we&#x27;ve got to get</p>
<p>more information about what is going on right here, and what&#x27;s it connected to. Well, you know what we saw last year. The laser stopped in midair.</p>
<p>We are hitting something with the laser. What are we hitting?  And last year, before we even  knew about the bubble,  during an experiment  at the triangle,  one of Nu-Salt&#x27;s</p>
<p> high-powered lasers  was cut off 2,000 feet high, right at the top boundary of the bubble. What&#x27;s different about what you&#x27;re bringing out this time, Tim? Well, we do have a brighter Laser Space Cannon, so we&#x27;re gonna be doing</p>
<p>a lot of red, green and blue Laser Space Cannons for the experiment. ERIK: All right, let&#x27;s do it.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Our goal tonight is to confirm  if laser beams  really might be stopped  or strangely altered  by the bubble. So, we&#x27;re gonna use multicolored laser beams to see if all of them</p>
<p>will be affected in the same way or if it only applies to certain colors. Hey, Erik, we&#x27;ve got, uh, one rocket on the pad. Let&#x27;s go ahead and, uh,  bring all the lasers up.</p>
<p>Okay. Copy that. Thanks, man.  TIM:  All right,</p>
<p> Nu-Salt laser technicians, I&#x27;m gonna do a countdown.  Three, two,  one, lasers. THOMAS: Lasers are up. -Look at that.</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: Look at that. Wow. TRAVIS: The lasers look amazing.  With all</p>
<p> the laser cannons working, I was ready to fire off a rocket just outside of the bubble from Homestead Two. Rocket is launching in five, four, three, two, one. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I just hit all the errors.</p>
<p>ERIK: Unbelievable.  KALEB:  Hey, Erik? Jim just got all sorts of errors, and having a lot of interference -going on with the drone.</p>
<p>-SAM: All right, Erik, be advised, the, uh, drone is aborting the flight and returning to home.  ERIK:  Okay, listen to this...</p>
<p>...that data corruption error happened literally right at the edge of that bubble. -(laughter) -That&#x27;s freakin&#x27; nuts.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> The rocket appeared  to be unaffected.  But right after I launched it,  Jim&#x27;s drone  completely malfunctioned  and couldn&#x27;t penetrate  the southern barrier  of the bubble.</p>
<p>Did the rocket somehow activate the bubble to stop the drone from flying inside it? That just makes no sense. Everyone be advised that, uh,  we are on the move  to the drill site.</p>
<p> ERIK:  Copy that. At that point, I wanted to launch another rocket, but this time, from inside the bubble  at the mesa drill site  to see if that</p>
<p> might get us an answer. (device beeping) -What&#x27;s beeping? -Whoa. -What&#x27;s beeping? -Look at-- oh, my God,</p>
<p>look at that. We&#x27;re getting huge gamma rays. Everybody in their cars and out of here. -THOMAS: Out, out, out, out.</p>
<p>-We&#x27;re evacuating now. -TRAVIS: Everybody, out now. -Hey, guys, it&#x27;s going off! TRAVIS: It&#x27;s going nut-- everybody out, now!  -TRAVIS: This is no joke.</p>
<p> -THOMAS: No, it&#x27;s not. -THOMAS: Erik... -Erik, we are getting over 700 counts per minute, and at some points, it was 800. That&#x27;s getting into the dangerous zone there, uh, Travis.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  Things went from weird  to really freakin&#x27; scary  at the mesa drill site right as we were preparing to launch a rocket up through the bubble.  Out of nowhere,  our gamma ray detector</p>
<p> started spiking,  which indicated  we were suddenly exposed to an extremely dangerous level of radiation. Anybody at Homestead Two, anybody west,  has to come back towards</p>
<p> the command center. TRAVIS: We&#x27;re now approaching the triangle, but it seems to be following us. We&#x27;re still getting slammed.</p>
<p>KALEB: Travis, you guys literally just got to the triangle, and right when you guys got there, the-- all the lasers just went out.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  That doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  When Kaleb alerted us  that the laser cannons  at the triangle quit working,  it was right as we were passing by on our way</p>
<p>back to the command center. Now, we were also driving inside the bubble. So, was something inside of it shutting down our equipment while also emitting this spike</p>
<p>of gamma rays at us? What the heck was going on? You&#x27;ve got two different Geiger counters. TRAVIS: Yeah. Just kind of watch</p>
<p>and see what happens. (device clicking) THOMAS: What was that? (clicking continues) -TRAVIS: It jumped. -Oh, it&#x27;s jumping. Look.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Look at that.  Erik, do you copy? Yeah, Travis, go ahead. TRAVIS: Erik, we checked</p>
<p>a second gamma ray detector. If I hold one, it&#x27;s up over 1,900, but if I&#x27;m not touching it, it reads normal levels.  So I think we&#x27;re having</p>
<p> an electromagnetic  interference issue here, not gamma rays. Yeah, Travis, I&#x27;m...  fairly confident we&#x27;re  looking at an E.M.I. issue.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  Okay. It was time  to take a deep breath.  The Geiger counters detected  normal and safe levels</p>
<p> of radiation  when I wasn&#x27;t touching them,  but spiked  when I picked them up. That meant we were not getting hit by dangerous levels of gamma rays, but instead, something</p>
<p>had caused major E.M.I., or electromagnetic interference, here on the ranch, which can make electronics go haywire like what we were seeing.  TRAVIS:  Greetings, earthlings.</p>
<p> ERIK:  Come on in and have a seat. What are we doing today, Erik? So, we&#x27;re looking at the review of all the data we got last night with Nu-Salt Lasers. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>So, I have some still-frame images that are built from long exposure. These show the laser cannons that were in the east field.</p>
<p>You know, obviously, given what we saw last night, we&#x27;re all very interested in whether we see any kinds of unusual effects in the beams themselves. -Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>-Can you zoom in on that? Look at that. -There is a gap in the green laser beam. -KALEB: Whoa. -What the hell?</p>
<p>-Exactly. TRAVIS: These lasers are right by each other. I mean, literally inches</p>
<p>from each other. ERIK: Yeah. And it didn&#x27;t stop the blue -or the red, only the green. -KALEB: Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s the same thing we saw last year. TRAVIS: That&#x27;s outside the bubble boundary.</p>
<p>Wow.  Kaleb&#x27;s exactly right. During an experiment last year using the Nu-Salt lasers at the triangle, something blocked out a small section only in their green laser beam.</p>
<p>But that was inside the bubble. -Whoa. -ROYSTON: Whoa. -KALEB: No. What could be doing that?  And now, the exact same thing</p>
<p> happened last night  just outside the bubble&#x27;s  eastern barrier. This is why we used different colored laser beams. To see if they would be affected</p>
<p>differently. But now the question is why? -ERIK: But wait. -TRAVIS: But wait. There&#x27;s more. Okay, what is this one? ERIK:</p>
<p>Yeah, this is surveillance footage of something moving in that general region of the sky. KALEB: There&#x27;s two of &#x27;em.</p>
<p>ERIK: You see what&#x27;s going on here? How about I dive in on it? -Yeah. -Zoom in. KALEB: Yeah.</p>
<p>THOMAS: And then, one of them disappeared. -Yeah. -Let&#x27;s just keep watching this one.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Okay. -TRAVIS: Wow. -KALEB: Whoa. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>And it vanished right there. Let&#x27;s play that again. TRAVIS: Whatever these two things are here, they don&#x27;t seem to look like your typical</p>
<p>low-earth orbiting satellites. It&#x27;s moving too slow and with a different kind of motion. Well, it certainly isn&#x27;t in lower orbit because the rate of travel here</p>
<p>is far too slow, -and there are no aviation lights. -No aviation lights. TRAVIS: Was one or both of these UAPs -what flew</p>
<p>through the laser beams? -Yeah. So, go back to three minutes, Erik. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p>going on here, and I just saw a really bright flash, too, so... TRAVIS: Oh, there was a flash. There was a flash. -Back up, Erik.</p>
<p>-Okay. TRAVIS: And then there&#x27;s that flash. What is that? Where is that light coming from? What? Holy crap.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what the flash in the east field could have been, but it seemed to appear right at the same time as the UAPs. Could that have been where they came from? And if so, how might it</p>
<p>be related to the bubble? As always, I&#x27;m in a state of bewilderment. In awe. All right, guys, this was a fantastic review.</p>
<p>Fantastic. -Yeah. -Wow. -All right.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Great stuff.  -ERIK: Thank you.  -TRAVIS: Yup. How you doing, man? -Good to see you, Travis. -Yeah, good to see you, Dave.</p>
<p> ...we welcomed  thermal imaging experts  Dave Mason  and Pete Kelsey back  to help us conduct nighttime  experiments at the triangle  designed to learn more  about the bubble-like anomaly.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m praying for a lot of smoke.  Ever since we saw  the blob above the triangle, I thought that building large fires there and creating a lot of smoke might help us be able to paint the invisible man, so to speak.</p>
<p> So tonight&#x27;s exercise  where we&#x27;re gonna have  two large containers with fire is gonna give us the opportunity  to put a lot of smoke  up in this space  over a long period of time. We&#x27;re getting there.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  While the fires fill the air  inside the bubble with smoke,  we&#x27;re hoping  that it will allow us  to see the shape of the bubble either with our own eyes, or on our instruments.  Dave Mason will be operating his specialized FLIR thermal cameras to capture  anything strange that might</p>
<p> appear cooler than normal  in what will be  a very hot environment.  If he does capture anything,  it could be more evidence  that something  of significance  is above the triangle.</p>
<p> Meanwhile, Pete will fly All right, guys, we&#x27;re ready to light this first bin. Uh, here it goes. There it goes. Burn, baby, burn.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a lot of heat coming off that now. Yep. Well, we&#x27;re now flooding that zone pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah, we sure are. That&#x27;s a lot, that&#x27;s a lot of hot air.  THOMAS: You guys ready for us  to light the second one? Light that second fire.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all I needed to hear. All right. Perfect. That&#x27;s a great smoke column. DAVID: All right,</p>
<p>what the hell is that? A big cold pocket just forming. Oh, that is weird.  You guys should see this.  This is just weird.  This cold vortex in the heat.</p>
<p>David, that is really interesting. Oh, there&#x27;s another one. In the FLIR we&#x27;re picking up these dark zones.</p>
<p>These cold vortexes in the heat. And then some of them would just kind of move around. ROYSTON: Look at that.</p>
<p>DAVID: Yeah, see? Right there. That, yeah, see? That doesn&#x27;t make any sense. DAVID: This is just amazing.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t have an explanation for it.  DAVID:  The cold spots that registered as black or just extremely cold  are in the vicinity of where  there would be extreme heat,  and there&#x27;s no physics</p>
<p> explanation for this. I have never observed this, nor would I expect to be able to observe this. This was the strangest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: All right, I think I&#x27;m gonna put a rocket up through there. 10-4. Since we had no idea if the cold spots were physical objects...</p>
<p>I think right there&#x27;s gonna do it.  ...I decided to launch  a rocket to see  what would happen as it flew through one of these anomalies. Everybody, everybody be advised.</p>
<p>At the triangle, we have a rocket is going hot. Rocket is going hot. Copy that. Guys, be advised</p>
<p>we&#x27;re about ready to go with the rocket launch. Have all your sensors ready to go. Uh, David, be paying attention on your differential FLIR, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, roger that, I&#x27;m doing that. In five, four, three,  two, one. Dude, that one went straight up. Come on, chute.</p>
<p>KALEB: Eyes on it? TRAVIS: I don&#x27;t have any eyes on it either. -KALEB: Right there. -There it is.</p>
<p>Good chute. KALEB: It stopped? Rocket went straight up, chute has deployed.  And it&#x27;s sitting still</p>
<p> right over the triangle. -KALEB: What? -TRAVIS: Look at that. It&#x27;s not even moving. It looks like it&#x27;s floating</p>
<p>right over the triangle. It&#x27;s not coming down. Look at that. Look at that. KALEB:</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not even moving now. TRAVIS: It&#x27;s not moving. Thomas, look, it ain&#x27;t falling. KALEB:</p>
<p>It looks like it&#x27;s suspended in the air. It ain&#x27;t even falling. What the hell? That is insane. KALEB:</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s moving. TRAVIS: Yeah, it&#x27;s coming down now. It&#x27;s gonna come right down on top of us.</p>
<p> I couldn&#x27;t tell  at the moment what caused it,  but something clearly made  that rocket freeze  midair a couple hundred feet  high for several seconds. There was literally no wind at</p>
<p>the time that would explain it. So, could it have been something strange inside the bubble that held it in place like that?  TRAVIS:  What&#x27;s going on? Remember, after we got</p>
<p>the fires going, we did do a rocket launch. I&#x27;ve got some video content that David Mason has shared with us from his differential thermal FLIR system. We do see the rocket</p>
<p>in this video sequence, but there&#x27;s also another feature that you may remember he was drawing our attention to, -and it was a cold zone. -Mm-hmm. -I remember that. -That cold zone</p>
<p>was there almost all night. -It was really weird. -Yeah. ERIK: I&#x27;m just gonna let this play through.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: So, you can see the two fire bins on either side and the hot smoke rising. But for some reason you got these dark, cold zones right about where the blob was.  THOMAS:</p>
<p> As we review the data  from the smoke-fire experiment  in the triangle,  it&#x27;s crazy to think that these cold spots were right above me. There was so much heat</p>
<p>in that area. I don&#x27;t even see how that&#x27;s possible.  To have these cold spots,  what could  possibly be going on here? PETE:</p>
<p>I have no explanation for that. But I&#x27;ve got a few things I wanted to show you all. Okay. PETE:</p>
<p>This is the triangle. This is the SLAM lidar scanner. This, to me, was the most interesting one. Well, check this out.</p>
<p>If you rotate this and look at it from the south, there was something that looked quite solid sort of poking out of that cloud. The feature</p>
<p>that first caught my eye-- because it appears to be more solid-- -was actually in this area here. -TRAVIS: Yeah. ERIK: All right, I&#x27;m gonna point and you tell me where Dave&#x27;s feature,</p>
<p>his cold spot, was located. You can stop in height, but you need to go to the west. Stop right there. -Right there?</p>
<p>-Yep. That&#x27;s where the big cold spot, or vortex, was. PETE: That&#x27;s crazy.</p>
<p>-ERIK: Yeah. -They look similar, now that I&#x27;m looking at it. Wow. PETE: That is wild.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: There&#x27;s clearly structure right in there that&#x27;s more dense, or has more particle points, than the rest of the cloud. ERIK:</p>
<p>How do you get such coherent structure in smoke? TRAVIS: That&#x27;s crazy.  Between the cold spot  that Dave Mason captured  in his thermal camera  and the features in the smoke  that both Erik and Pete Kelsey</p>
<p> picked out in the lidar data, it made us wonder if there could be multiple anomalies at the center of the bubble. But if so, what are they and what purpose do they have? We did a lot of scans. I&#x27;m just gonna show you</p>
<p>one more, because this is the really interesting one. I&#x27;ll just come around to the launch site. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>Okay, so what are we looking at right there? PETE: This, I believe, is the rocket. TRAVIS: The rocket? Uh-huh.</p>
<p>PETE: This is a total mystery once again. In almost the same spot in over 25 scans now, there&#x27;s been something</p>
<p>in that direction giving me returns, going well up into the sky. -TRAVIS: Is that the edge of the bubble? -Yes. TRAVIS: All right.</p>
<p>So this is looking straight up. -Straight up. Mm-hmm. -Yeah, this is looking</p>
<p>straight up. And there&#x27;s the top of the bubble. You can see the rings. Look here. It&#x27;s, uh...</p>
<p>You can see this ring right here. There&#x27;s the central point. There&#x27;s another ring here and there.</p>
<p>Look, here&#x27;s-here&#x27;s an outer ring here. You can still see it. You can see the walls of the bubble.</p>
<p>-PETE: Yeah. -Look. See? Here&#x27;s-- Here it is. Look. You can see the walls.</p>
<p>You can see it. The lidar picked it up again.  Our fires and smoke certainly gave us more data on possible anomalies above the triangle. But just like Pete&#x27;s lidar data</p>
<p>from one year ago,  we now have repeatable  hard evidence  that a massive  bubble-shaped phenomenon is encompassing the entire area.  Now we&#x27;ve got to figure out  an experiment  to determine what it is  and what these weird things</p>
<p> inside of it could be. This was a fascinating experiment. -Yeah. -We&#x27;ve got a cold blob floating</p>
<p>in the air that doesn&#x27;t move. -We&#x27;ve got people seeing blue orbs. -(chuckles) And we got, uh, lidar picking up a bubble around us.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s crazy. So, Erik, maybe you were right. Where there&#x27;s smoke, there is fire. This time for sure.</p>
<p>And more. -Yes. -So, after looking at all the data, you know, I wonder,</p>
