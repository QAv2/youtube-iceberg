            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel and uh this is my educational contribution uh and um today is video number 279 that we have done on the reciprocal system of theory of Dewey B Larson Mr Larson uh was an engineer in the 20th century in uh Western United States I think born in North Dakota and eventually settled out in Portland at Portland area and um starting around 1930 he uh had some flashes of insight about his reciprocal system worked out his ideas over the next 25 or 30 years and eventually put out his fundamental pot two fundamental postulates and uh then took those postulates and through a process of deduction uh deduced a theoretical Universe um and uh I did about 15 videos back when about 8 months ago on uh that is uh reading through his talk that is called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system where he goes through his uh 165 steps of uh if this and then that uh well if this then that and so he&#x27;s elaborating on his two fundamental postulates to create his theoretical Universe out of which he wrote books um on many different topics especially chemistry astronomy and physics and then also economics and metaphysics and uh the basic idea behind Larson system is that we live in a universe of motion not a universe of matter or a universe of energy but the fundamental thing about the universe is that it is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time now when Larson first formulated this he actually referred to motion as space time said the universe is made out of space time uh he eventually changed that to motion uh toward the end of his life he actually uh said that when he&#x27;s referring to this motion he&#x27;s really referring to change in three dimensions so you could really say space time motion or change in three dimensions and the three dimensions comes from his first postulate that the uh universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time that sets up a reciprocal relationship between space and time they&#x27;re both the same thing except that they are reciprocals of one another uh they have the same characteristics and qualities the first of which is that they are three dimensional Larson calls this coordinate space and coordinate time XYZ coordinates or for time uh at least from our point of view J JK coordinates and then um space and time also have their scalar aspects and scalar motion is a um a a motion that has a magnitude but it has no direction or really no particular direction um you can think of that in terms of clock time clock time is always moving forward always getting later and later and later and later but not in any particular direction and then you can also uh posit clock space and you would use a balloon with a magic marker uh dots on the balloon uh you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart that is the flow of space or the progression of space or clock space a scalar Motion in space and that was indeed observed by the Hubble telescope uh that determined that all of the the distant galaxies are moving away from each other okay so uh the Third Kind of um stipulation of the first postulate is that uh space and time are both quantized meaning that they come only in discrete units there&#x27;s no uh continuity of space and time there&#x27;s a minimum uh unit of space and a minimum unit of time and you have to have a whole unit before you have anything and those units are small but they are still uh you know chunks you have to have a chunk um and if you have one chunk of space in one chunk of time you have the speed of light one over 1 equals 1 Larsson called the speed of light unit speed and for Larson that speed of light is the neutral point the null point or really even The Ether the um the background of this universe so the uni it&#x27;s a universe of motion so you have Mo you so you have to you have to be able to admit that if you have a universe of motion then you can have motion without anything moving and indeed the thing that would be moving is motion itself so uh motion precedes the thing that is moving and that so that background or that ether is the speed of light outward in all directions Larson referred to that as the progression of the natural reference system so this uh motion outward at the speed of light is the natural reference system and whereas in Legacy science the natural reference system is zero everything is measured from zero speed uh and you can um you know have it moving in a positive or negative Direction + 1 + 2 + 3 -1 - 2 - 3 but with with the reciprocal system you have one as the center or the uh reference system and your measurements are made from that so in Larson system half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light that would be 2 3 and four you know you start with one and then you have to go to two to three and to four four and then on the negative side that would be the half of the universe that is moving slower than the speed of light and for there uh that&#x27;s balanced uh the cosmic sector is Bal all the cosmic sector is the sector that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light the material sector is using moving slower than the speed of light and then the numbers you would use there would be 1/2 1/3 and 1/4 to balance out the 2 3 and four in the cosm sector so these are two basically twin sectors of the Universe um of which Legacy science was only aware of one only the material sector but since uh there&#x27;s a reciprocal relationship between space and time uh what goes on in the cosmic sector even though it is unknown to us it is uh determinable because we can extrapolate what&#x27;s going on in the material sector to what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector all we have to do is uh reverse the roles of space and time so in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and clock time clock the clock is always getting later and later and later these are relations that we&#x27;re familiar with uh because we reside in the material sector and we make our measurements from there and so on uh but we can also determine what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector uh simply by reversing the roles of space and time so in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart uh so uh that&#x27;s just one example of of being able to extrapolate what&#x27;s going on in the material sector to what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector okay so he basically took that first postulate the second postulate is not as important but it basically says that the uh Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics uh its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian um many of Larson&#x27;s uh followers uh have rejected that second postulate uh in particular the idea uh that uh the geometry of the universe is ukian uh and in fact Larson to a certain extent rejected the second postulate he recognized that the universe may not be ukian either but that that was the uh that was the most basic way that he could confer his ideas without them getting to esoteric um he was aware of the nonukan geometries that were um beginning to um become more popular uh in the late 19th and and early 20th centuries but he he kind of steered away from them but uh one of his followers Dr Bruce peret uh Champion using the uh projective geometry Cascade uh now uh projective geometry um so he said that the Universe of geometry uh the geometry of the universe is projective now you have uh what&#x27;s called a geometry Cascade of which you know projective geometry becomes a fine geometry becomes metric geometry becomes ukian geometry so ukian geometry is part of projective geometry but just uh just a small part so it wasn&#x27;t like Larsson was wrong but just not inclusive enough but uh that it will be a topic for another day but uh but that was that&#x27;s one of many Innovations and kind of uh revisions that do puce Brett made on the reciprocal system especially after Larsson died in 1990 um pet uh came up along with Dr kvk neru came up with uh this thing called the rs2 the reciprocal system 2 or the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system which uh purported to correct a few of Larson&#x27;s uh shortcomings um and uh wrote on a number of different subjects and we&#x27;re looking at one of them today uh that he wrote Under the uh pen name of Daniel Phoenix 3 and usually when pet wrote Under the name of Daniel Phoenix 3 he moved into a much more uh speculative territory and wrote on subjects that I don&#x27;t think Larson would have uh would have written on uh but not that Larson was going to limit uh you know the application of his reciprocal system he felt that the reciprocal system was it was a system it was something that would apply to any subject um but these are just subjects that I don&#x27;t think that Larson uh was you know interested in researching at uh I could be wrong now this uh this article is called geoengineering Chemtrails harp uh that&#x27;s h a RP all capitalized World orders timelines and Ascension okay uh first section is called background I was listening to exopolitics expert Alfred labont on a radio show discussing the negative timeline as being some kind of synthetic Quantum environment orchestrated by the gray e ETS stating that this negative timeline was all made up having worked as a technician on the Phoenix 3 project more commonly known as the time travel aspect of The Monto project I have firstand knowledge of what was going on and what they were trying to do and it appears they are using some of the knowledge gleaned from those experiments in Geo geoengineering application in the 20 years that have passed since those experiments I have learned much and decided to take a look at it in the context of the new knowledge provided by Dewey Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system of physical Theory Phoenix 3 was a covert attempt to determine the nature of time if it could be manipulated and if so the process to do it without going into details the short answer is that those involved never came to an understanding of time other than it was not what conventional physics thought it was but we&#x27;re able to make use of some of the technology obtained in order to perform temporal experiments into the past and future in order to access time a navigation computer from a faster than light propulsion system was utilized to open a portal from which a visual record could be made in later experiments a way was found to send living organisms through this portal to other chronological periods though this was highly dangerous and seldom worked as expected due to the nature of the equipment being used only persons with a highly developed psionic or psychic ability could operate the equipment psychics that were skilled in precognition one of the issues was that the time travel experiments ran into a bump literally crossing the 2012 2013 year boundary of the conventional calendar and at the time it appeared to be some kind of artificial reality that was constructed by the psychic running the chair the so-called experts did not know what to make of it but for the most part thought it was a realistic view of the period being viewed because it was consistent with different psychics and everyone uh sent forward returned with a very similar with very similar information looking at it now it would seem to be more consistent with a synthetic Quantum environment such as one described by labont uh than a natural one which may explain why it was always Frozen past a specific point with what we know now there is a good deal of Truth to what lermont was discussing on that radio show and that show was from August 13th 19 uh August 13th 2012 are you on the catastrophic or positive timeline on the global voice radio show um he just me has a uh footnote here uh called um or says that the reciprocal system was first published in the 1959 book the structure of the physical Universe uh and the reciprocal system is a Theory of Everything based on two simple postulates that produce The observed universe as a natural consequence it has a number of notable successes including producing the existence of quazars some four years before they were actually discovered and that is true Larson um predicted quazars in detail before they were actually discovered by the scientists based on uh simple deduction from his reciprocal system okay moving on Research into to the strange weather being seen around the world including the effects thereof red rain abiotic stress of plants with sudden death extreme levels of radiation and ultraviolet light to name but a few may have turned up what is actually going on and it ties in with the old Monto project this interpretation explains the Chemtrails harp G engineering underground cities uh genetic engineering and even explains the timelines and the upcoming Ascension to a higher real a higher density these connections cannot be seen by conventional science but due uh due to various misconceptions treated as fact with the information in dwey Larson&#x27;s books Universe of motion beyond space and time and the followup articles by Professor kbk Neu on the nature of the Stellar interior and the sunspots what is going on starts to make a lot of sense you think the politicians hide stuff try scientists most of the things going on are a reaction to a larger event find the cause and the effect starts to make sense so let&#x27;s start with the most obvious effect climate change and for that we have to take a look at the single largest effect on weather sunlight and where it comes from the sun okay there&#x27;s a couple of uh footnotes here before we get to the next section um he says we the scientific underground prefer density over Dimension when describing the in increased complexity of organisms since the number of spatial Yang Dimensions does not change the number of available temporal Yin Dimensions does resulting in a compaction that has the property similar to the physical concept of density some of the misconceptions being the backward direction of Stellar Evolution the omission of three-dimensional time and the omission of the cosmic sector of the universe of antimatter um the sector of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and the nature of radiation and x-ray emission these are things that are limiting the Legacy scientists from understanding what&#x27;s going on here okay back to uh this section it&#x27;s called Stellar evolution is backwards in the reciprocal system physics Larson comes up with a better structure for the atom based on the concept of scalar motion again that&#x27;s a motion with a magnitude but no particular direction and as a natural consequence of that structure determines two destructive limits for atoms a thermal limit and an age limits the thermal limit is the common limit used in therm no nuclear reactions but the age limit is unknown to Conventional science and concerns the capture of charged electron neutros by the atoms that create isotropic isotopic Mass when the age limit is reached an element becomes radioactive and explodes when Larson applied those Concepts to astronomy he found a different mechanism for Stellar combustion based on those limits combustion is based on exploding atoms fishion not fusion and that led to the conclusion that astronomers have the stellar and Galactic evolutionary sequences backwards in Universe of motion Larsson shows that uh Universe of motion is uh Larson&#x27;s book on astronomy and uh that&#x27;s one of his three books in the second edition of his structure of the physical Universe the first one is called um nothing but motion uh which we went over uh we went over that uh almost the entire book uh about uh 3 4 months back uh so you could go back to those videos and listen to uh my rendition of of almost the whole book of nothing but motion that&#x27;s the first uh book in his Trilogy uh the structure of the physical Universe second edition um this that book came out in 1979 and then uh then he wrote Universe of motion on astronomy uh which came out in 1984 and um that is actually the Third third book in the series even though it came out chronologically second and then the second book which came out in 1987 the third book chronologically but the second in the series uh which is primarily on chemistry is called basic properties of matter and I believe we are going to go over um a lot of that book uh coming up here pretty soon basic properties of matter uh it&#x27;s pretty fascinating reading uh although very difficult and I still haven&#x27;t made heads or Tales of a few of the chapters after 10 readings but um still it&#x27;s still worth uh worth taking a look at and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do but uh so peret is saying in Universe of motion Larson&#x27;s book on astronomy L uh that is also a fascinating book uh and we will look at some of that too uh in Universe of motion lson shows the consequences of what happens when you flip Stellar Evolution around making red giants the youngest stars and blue giants the oldest backwards Evolution made for a perfectly logical and consistent pattern of evolution eliminating the need for a bunch of devices that conventional astronomy introduced to try to make sense of their interpretation things like dark matter Dark Energy black holes Quark Stars neutron stars Etc when you put the sequence right they all become just distinct stages in a single consistent Stellar evolutionary process as a consequence um actually I think we&#x27;re going to stop there uh cuz this section goes on a little bit and uh gets pretty involved so uh we&#x27;re going to um tomorrow we will start up here with as a consequence to setting the Stellar evolutionary sequence straight some conclusions are different than popular belief and so we&#x27;re going to get into some of the different conclusions that lson uh arrives at in his uh book on astronomy and uh how those relate to um the ideas of geoengineering Chemtrails harp and uh so on okay um thank you for tuning in please come back tomorrow for the next episode and have a great day</p>
