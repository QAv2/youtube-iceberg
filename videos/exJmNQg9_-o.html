            <p>Dad, I was reading about vectors and scalers, but now I&#x27;m seeing something called scalar physics. Is that like physics for lazy numbers? &gt;&gt; Not exactly, Steve. Scalar physics is the study of physical quantities that only have magnitude, no direction. &gt;&gt; So like temperature. &gt;&gt; Exactly.</p>
<p>Temperature, mass, energy, electric charge, all scalers. They&#x27;re fully described by a single value. Compare that to vectors like velocity or force, which need both a magnitude and a direction. But why even separate them? Isn&#x27;t it all just physics? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s about how these quantities behave in equations. Scalers are direction independent.</p>
<p>If I tell you the temperature is 25° C, it&#x27;s the same no matter which way you face, but velocity changes if you turn around. &gt;&gt; So, in scalar physics, you never have to deal with arrows on a diagram. &gt;&gt; Pretty much. You work with simple algebra instead of vector math. But don&#x27;t let simple fool you.</p>
<p>Scalers can still describe huge concepts. Energy in a nuclear reaction, for example, is scalar. Same with entropy in thermodynamics. &gt;&gt; Wait, so when I&#x27;m tired, that&#x27;s just my scalar energy being low? &gt;&gt; More like your scalar motivation, Steve. And that&#x27;s not in any physics textbook.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Guess I&#x27;ll just stay a low energy state forever. &gt;&gt; Careful. In physics, low energy can mean absolute zero, and you wouldn&#x27;t survive</p>
