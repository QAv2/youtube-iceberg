            <p>all right oh excuse me how is everybody doing today I&#x27;m Thomas welcome to my channel I do educational videos on many different subjects mostly obscure things you&#x27;ve never heard of before that I think are important that um you sh you should know about or you should at least be exposed to have the option of knowing about uh we are uh in the middle of covering the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson a theory he developed from about 1930 until 19 he until he died in 1990. and it has been uh updated also by uh Dr Bruce Perrette Dr kvk nehru Dr Gopi Krishna uh in the last 30 years and um that&#x27;s called rs2 so right now we&#x27;re going through an address this is just kind of the introduction just kind of laying down the foundation of the theory he takes he has an original postulate and then he he deduces a theoretical Universe from that initial postulate I guess they&#x27;re two postulates one of them is kind of in dispute so the other one is the most the more important one and he deduces this entire universe and then kind of Compares it with the actual universe or the universe that has been discovered by the Legacy scientists okay and so we&#x27;re going through that right now we are at statement 95. uh so we&#x27;ll start there uh you may not be able to pick this up here right here at this point you might have to go back and watch the earlier videos but uh you know possibly you&#x27;ll get something out of it this way as well so give it a try and don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t get it you know this is just uh laying the foundation we&#x27;ll get into more of the specifics later and um you know uh this is just really kind of laying the groundwork getting a feel for kind of how Larson is thinking and how this this the nuts and bolts of the theory okay number 95. in order to change the spatial position of an atom or an aggregate of atoms an outward motion must be applied against the inward scalar motion of the atom that inherent inward motion then acts as a resistance that can be that that inherit inward motion then acts as a resistance to the applied outward Motion in this capacity as a resistance or inertia the mass acts as the inverse of a three-dimensional speed with the dimensions t to the third power over SP over s to the third power or time to the third power over space to the third power in practice gravitation is measured in terms of force a derivative of inertia rather than in terms of speed both the gravitational and inertial relations are therefore expressed in terms of the time to the third power over space to the third power magnitudes this explains why measurements of the gravitational mass and the inertial mass arrive at the same results just to go back I didn&#x27;t really introduce Larson&#x27;s postulate the universe is made out of motion you know not not matter not energy but motion and motion is the relationship between space and time uh and space and time have all the same qualities uh but they are reciprocals of each other so motion is a relationship between space and time all of our scientific quantities that we know of you know the things that have units they are all expressible in terms of space and time so here he&#x27;s really saying that inertia and gravitation are both expressed in terms of the time over time to the third power over space to the third power and that&#x27;s in Larson&#x27;s Theory time and space are both multi-dimensional uh we we know that time has multi-dimensions three um most usually three and um therefore time also because they have the same qualities the thing that we know about time is that it&#x27;s always progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later and so too space has that quality uh which we can see in the recession of the distant galaxies everything is always moving farther and farther and farther apart okay Number 96 having established the space-time dimensions of mass we can now Define the dimensions of the other physical quantities of the mechanical system the product of mass and speed momentum is time to the third power over space to the third power times speed space over time that equals time to the second power over space to the second power so that is momentum the product of mass and the second power of speed is energy that is uh t to the third power times base to the third power or t to the third power over space to the third power times space to the second power over SP time to the second power that equals time over space that&#x27;s energy energy is time over space acceleration the time rate of change of speed is space over time times one over time or per time and that equals space over time to the second power fourth the product of mass and acceleration is time to the third power over space to the third power times space over time to the second power equals time over space to the second power okay so he just defined you know four uh qualities there of um are for you know units uh four different fundamental you know quantities of uh our scientific you know theory in terms of space and time momentum is time to the second power of a space to the second power energy is time over space acceleration is space over time to the second power and force is time over space to the second power number 97 physical phenomena with the same dimensions have the same general status in physical interactions and are interchangeable for example all phenomena with the dimensions time over space are equivalent to energy and can be converted to kinetic energy by appropriate processes okay here we have finished the section B of this um of this talk and this must have been a very long talk people must have been dozing off during this talk if they weren&#x27;t if they weren&#x27;t able to follow um because this this must have taken hours I believe this is my I think this is my 11th video just on this one talk here so anyway uh section c in this section we examine the application of the general physical principles developed in section A to the basic phenomena of another physical field the field selected for examination in section B was chosen to show how the quantitative relations emerge easily and naturally from the mainly qualitative general principles and relations now in this third section we demonstrate the ability of the theory of the universe of motion to clarify the theoretical relations in a field that has heretofore been subject to much confusion as in the preceding sections each statement is a deduction from the postulates of the theory or one or more of the numbered statements earlier in the outline number 98 the only difference between the effective component of the electron which is m 0-0-negative one and the rotational base uh which is uh m 0-0-0 is one unit of rotational space displacement it is therefore a rotational combination with the dimensions of space the term electron as used in this outline refers to the particle defined in statement 70. similar particles carrying charges will be identified as charged electrons so again in Larson&#x27;s system he has uh the electron defined in 70 is the uncharged electron similar particles carrying charges will be identified as charged electrons number 99 as noted in statement seven in statement 97 different physical phenomena with the same space-time Dimensions have the same status in physical interactions from the general physical standpoint the electron is therefore equivalent to a unit of what we may call extension space the space of our ordinary experience the idea of the equivalent of ordinary space is new to science and may be conceptually difficult for some scientists but it is the same kind of a concept as the idea of the equivalent of ordinary kinetic energy that we have all become accustomed to for example if we wish to put a rocket into orbit what we have to do is accelerate it to a certain speed that is give it a certain amount of kinetic energy but in addition we must provide enough fuel energy to compensate for the difference in the energy of position the potential energy and lift the rocket against the Earth&#x27;s gravity this potential energy is not kinetic energy but it is energy and in relations involving energy in general it is the equivalent of kinetic energy similarly electron space is not extension space but it is space and in relations involving space in general it is the equivalent of extension space okay number 100 from statement 67 the net speed displacement of the atoms of ordinary matter is positive that is in terms of effective units there is an excess of time over space the electron can therefore move through matter as the relation of space or electrons to time or matter constitutes motion according to the postulates of the theory of the universe of motion it cannot move through space cannot move through space relative to the Natural reference system as the relation of space uh in this case electrons to extension space does not constitute motion it&#x27;s a pretty key concept for him the relationship of space two space does not constitute motion and the relationship of time to time also does not constitute motion but the relationship of space to time or time to space does constitute motion okay number 101 we identify the movement of electrons through matter as current electricity it should be noted that the current moves through the matter not through the spaces between the atoms as has been assumed but the space moves the current moves through matter matter is made out of time so the electron is made out of space space through matter so it doesn&#x27;t move through the spaces between the atoms but through the atoms themselves number 102 the movement of space or electrons through matter is identical except in scalar Direction with the movement of matter through extension space just like if we were you know launched through space that is the identical uh analogy thus quantities involved in these motions and the relations between them are thus the same in both cases we may characterize the relations involved in the movement of space through matter as the mechanical aspects of electricity since the scalar direction of gravitation a movement of matter through space is inward it follows that the scalar direction of current electricity is outward number 104 the electrons or effect effective Dimensions s space are units of electric quantity which she labels as Q the rate at which the electrons move through matter the quantity per unit time is the electric current label I capital i with dimensions s over t equivalent to those of speed electrical force or voltage uh which is a capital V has the general Force Dimensions time over space to the second power okay so that is a force the product of voltage and current is power or p with the dimensions time over space to the second power times space over time so that equals 1 over s so the product of voltage voltage and current is power power has the units of 1 over s the product of power and time is electrical energy or work w the dimensions are 1 over s times T equals T over s which are the units of energy or work the mass taking part in the current flow is not a constant quantity but depends on the duration of the current the mass per unit time dimensions t to the third power over s to the third power times one over t equals t to the second power over space to the third power is therefore a significant quantity in current electricity we identify it as resistance or r to demonstrate the identity of the electric current relations motion of space through matter with those of the mechanical system motion of matter through space we may compare the energy equations kinetic energy is one half MV squared Mass um times velocity squared space-time dimensions are t to the third power times uh t to the third power over s to the third power times s to the second power over t to the second power which equals T over s electrical energy is um r t I guess R is a resistance T times I to the second power which is uh I is the um I thought it was the current uh I is the current uh the dimensions so there are time to the second power over space to the third power times time times space to the second power over time to the second power which equals time over s t over s another mechanical expression for energy is force times distance f d which equals time over space to the second power times space equals time over space the analogous electrical expression is voltage times electrical quantity so that&#x27;s V Q which equals time over space to the second power time space equals time over space in both cases the equations are identical except for the terminology okay this will be the last one 106.</p>
<p>since they are phenomena of the same kind the flow of electrons through a conductor is analogous to the flow of gas molecules to a pipeline but a constant force or voltage differential causes a steady flow of current this agrees with the observation existing theory ascribes the flow to a difference in electrostatic potential which it does not distinguish from voltage but such a potential difference applied to the charged electron which is assumed to be the moving entity would result in an accelerated motion present-day science has no explanation for this phenomena or for this contradiction okay that&#x27;s the end of number 106 and that&#x27;s about where we are for today uh probably another um handful of uh these presentations before we get to the end I think it goes up to like what number 165 or something so okay we&#x27;ll just keep with it I know this is difficult stuff but this is a review this is stuff that you&#x27;re once you once we learn the reciprocal system we&#x27;ll have this in the bank we&#x27;ll be able to refer back to it um just land on the foundation but I also want to show you the way Larson thinks and um the process that he goes through to get to his universe is not just making stuff up he&#x27;s using the same principles every time um but it&#x27;s sometimes that&#x27;s hard to see okay have a great day we&#x27;ll see you next time</p>
