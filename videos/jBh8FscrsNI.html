            <p>What if the world doesn&#x27;t really exist until you look at it? Sounds crazy, but that&#x27;s the observer effect in quantum physics. Tiny particles like electrons act like waves, a cloud of possibilities until someone observes them. And the moment we watch, boom, the wave collapses. A single outcome appears. In short, observation changes reality.</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s where it gets even weirder. If your attention affects quantum particles, what else is your consciousness influencing? Could your thoughts be shaping your world moment by moment? Maybe you&#x27;re not just watching life unfold. Maybe you&#x27;re co-creating it. That&#x27;s the observer effect, a glitch in the matrix, or a sign that your mind is more powerful than you</p>
