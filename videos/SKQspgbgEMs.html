            <p>[Music] starting right now we are live on YouTube what is up we&#x27;re here in 2020 about halfway through with a very special episode I have two guests on me with tonight who are technicians from my my my anti-gravity research team we kind of had this Falcon Space kind of tour going for a little bit and I&#x27;m think I&#x27;m back to just hover brothers hover brothers is pretty much a loose collection of researchers and scientists who are interested in gravity and how gravity works and how to beat gravity and anything related to anti-gravity or warp drive or advanced propulsion or whatever you want to call it we&#x27;re basically trying to defeat gravity and understand as much as possible about physics itself unifying physics you know kind of getting past the hurdles of our current limitations of our you know current theories like quantum mechanics and special relativity which the maths are just too complicated and unresolvable to mix together and no one can quite figure out you know quite how quantum mechanics works with relativity or how the quantum world of quantum field theory works to build the structure of space-time we&#x27;re working on a lot of the science behind that as well as you know just just trying to I&#x27;ve been following up on everything I can find on gravity and air all the research into gravity for you know for the past 15 years since I&#x27;ve been researching this and I&#x27;ve been linking up with other individuals and other groups who are interested also in this search for gravity and we&#x27;re here tonight joined by Jeremiah and Wayne of the Falcon space and hover brothers so welcome aboard we got to do some work on this however brother&#x27;s website and we&#x27;ll put you guys we got to get more people on the about Us page learn about the different teams that you know we&#x27;re connected with and working working with or alongside through the network you know not if not everyone in this network that we&#x27;ve linked up with is really I really say like we&#x27;re part of the same team because we&#x27;re all you know basically working together toward a similar goal but um you know yeah then you&#x27;re not gonna get a better team than the AR PE all right so what is the ARP this is the new team we&#x27;ve kind of this is the new - yes indeed we&#x27;ve uh we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve gotten rid of a lot of the politics and pretty much whittled it down to a small team of people that are actually doing experiments or have some some reasonable theories to put forward to help move this progress so here the association of reactionists propulsion experimenter z-- key focus onyx on experimenters mm-hmm yes we took basically we had a really large group going with this Falcon Space Program and there was just tons of people anyone who asked to be invited was getting invited basically and it was getting too big and kind of confused and out of control and there were people making all kinds of claims and not bringing enough evidence to the table so we basically took all the technicians all the science people all the people that were really contributing with experiments and and contributing with you know input on the science and and really just the people really focused on the science and we kind of took everyone from and formed a new another group that&#x27;s sort of more streamlined towards just experiments and stuff and I do apologize for a lot of the more technical and science-based people who follow these streams I do want to apologize I saw a lot of those people were kind of upset with with some of the things in the last stream there wasn&#x27;t enough you know evidence being presented and none of theories and not enough like science that that people are really yearning for that we&#x27;ve kind of got this you know collected that the audience that I&#x27;ve attracted and built is sort of the people who are into this more technical side of stuff and learning yeah and specifically it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s the topic that is ignored and oftentimes not put as important as it should be in other formats it&#x27;s just really hard to find any stream or any videos talking solely on the subject of engineering orbit or building it it&#x27;s all fluff these days yes it&#x27;s that&#x27;s good for entertainment if you&#x27;re watching it to be entertainment if you actually want to go back to your lab and do something useful well there&#x27;s no space for that right and there&#x27;s also a lot of to talk about disclosure I mean there&#x27;s this disclosure project with Steven Greer this is that disclosure Jesus guy that the UFO Jesus with his post disclosure world talking about you know what&#x27;s going to happen after disclosure and the more and more of the way I&#x27;m learning about disclosure is it&#x27;s dude this is like real serious education this isn&#x27;t like the government&#x27;s just going to come out one day and tell the truth and and everyone&#x27;s just gonna accept it no in the world&#x27;s gonna change its oh yeah where Trump could come out Trump could come out you know in an interview with the son saying yes we have in fact had anti-gravity for decades and we do have captured offworld craft and even with that information coming out it does absolutely nothing for anybody period right now you just had something verified congratulations you&#x27;re exactly where you were with your research yeah well it&#x27;s the government is saying this and we&#x27;re nowhere we&#x27;re no closer because the government comes up with disclosures that are lies all the time they come up with press releases that they&#x27;re that are meant and designed to be deceptive and lead us psychologically in a certain direction so no matter what the government comes out with even if they did have disclosure we&#x27;re still gonna have to analyze it we&#x27;re still gonna have to pick it apart we&#x27;re still gonna have to have the you know people you know ripping it and ripping it down and starting right you know any there&#x27;s very little technical detailed information that you can derive on the engineering side even while watching the tic-tac video you can say well it doesn&#x27;t do what our crafts do but we have no idea why it can do what it&#x27;s doing so it still doesn&#x27;t help us and even if all the information was disclosed like some people are arguing it already has been disclosed and it&#x27;s been leaked with this Salvatore pay&#x27;s guy that this invent well you could say the same thing about like John Quincy Sinclair and those crazy pens because before elevator before Salvador Quincy had the you know flying triangle patents and the right rotary electric field flying craft this disclosure essentially means nothing without groups like ours testing this stuff and building it for ourselves and mean like well real because is this we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s dissing every time the government comes up with something whether it&#x27;s leaked or disclosed we have to like verify it you know yeah and I&#x27;ll tell you there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that doesn&#x27;t work doesn&#x27;t work there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that&#x27;s put out specifically to make foreign governments think we have these capabilities when we don&#x27;t it&#x27;s just you know and so at this I just I&#x27;m shaking my head at the disclosure world and all the people talking about disclosure it&#x27;s it this is an education process this is a learning process well don&#x27;t forget too that we are in our own little corner of this whole genre because for the most part what people mean when they think disclosure is they want somebody to validate or verify the idea that we&#x27;re not alone in the universe they&#x27;re not thinking really about METEC but we&#x27;re solely on that so we kind of forget most people don&#x27;t actually care about the tech they would if they knew what it could do but they would well the thing is I care only about the tech because I realized that it&#x27;s the only thing holding us back from whatever their concept of disclosure is because once we have the tactical of the stars it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna be you&#x27;re gonna need them we&#x27;re gonna meet them and we&#x27;re gonna be interacting with them it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just no doubt it&#x27;s gonna happen the Drake Equation we&#x27;re sits so statistically improbable that we&#x27;re alone in the universe is it ever that if you if if you really believe that then you&#x27;re not a real scientist so it the way that we&#x27;re looking at us yet it&#x27;s got to be about the technology and and bridging the gap and it&#x27;s not going to be this instant disclosure thing we&#x27;re gonna need to form groups we&#x27;re gonna need to expand these groups and get and and I honestly I want only private funding I&#x27;ve discussing this issue last night about bringing some people that were interested in funding these endeavors into the groups to into our technical discussion groups to like really you know but we&#x27;re like worried about hey you know these people gaining you know too much intelligence about you know like the research that we&#x27;re doing in things that are going on and be you know like are they really are they in this for for profit and investment for to make a return on investment or are you just in it for the science and and for the adventure and to learn about because that&#x27;s what me and Jeremy people like me and Jeremiah haven&#x27;t made jack [ __ ] off this we were basically like doing this we made absolutely no money ever period from this research no one has ever given me funding specifically for this research no one is providing me resources specifically for this research and the most powerful important thing I&#x27;ve ever gotten from anybody else is the collaboration that we now have in this group yes which cannot be underrated I agree and then when I put out that hover brothers video like back in the day that the whole announcing the Phoenix project with Ken and everything it was the one part where we started switching to the whole thing about you know trying to get funding for to build do experiments and stuff that ruined the entire video and that made everyone was like fake and they through it all the stuff about quantum entanglement and all the [ __ ] I was trying to allude to about how do we merge quantum mechanics quantum field theory with relativity well it&#x27;s through entanglement this is the this is the entanglement is the spiderweb that forms the space-time metric network and now that&#x27;s the key concept I was trying to get across as soon as we started talking about the funding it ruined the entire thing for every [ __ ] person watching it and it just instantly became a scam and a hoax and and it was just it ruined it all so I think in the future we&#x27;re not gonna go for I don&#x27;t want to go for for funding or donations or anything like that well I&#x27;m not against the idea but I think if we&#x27;re gonna do that maybe we should put your fundraiser in the title of the video so people know what they&#x27;re clicking on so it doesn&#x27;t seem like we&#x27;re selling something and then you know trying to trying to trick people or because they peed I should be paranoid and there are so many friggin shells out there you you&#x27;ve got like all the way back to the Sundance motor if you guys remember that three overunity machine that was recorded on VHS promotional videos that were tossed all around and ended up on YouTube I mean so that there&#x27;s so many people that have wild claims and they just need your money and they they do these events that that are saloon set up on raising money provide nothing ever to they don&#x27;t scare me yeah we can hear me yeah we got you waiting yeah okay so I was just saying in the other chat group there so we&#x27;re not even at the you know as an analogy proving out Faraday&#x27;s law of induction stage yet I mean after that came like that was the precursor to the invention or development of the electric motor the Dynamo of the generator and that&#x27;s where all the commercialization and all the investment dollars came in and all that so we&#x27;re just like the way I see it were just we&#x27;re just kind of in the very very infancy stages and just kind of proving out or discovering these laws and just putting it all together and this is where I think we just need to have a lot of people that and you know just do even one simple experiment or you know put something together somebody who&#x27;s reasonably equipped with you know tools or whatever can now build something on their bench and see see upping hop and and prove it out no just just to get around all that skepticism and so ya know really way too early for asking for money or funding er yeah I mean this is like how many inventors in you know in the last few decades it&#x27;s the same old story you know some some guy lone wolf inventor built something in his garage it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a miracle device he goes and gets patents keeps it all a secret tries to get investment dollars and then he hands the income the fraud and then no one can replicate his technology or device and then he just takes his patents to the grave and the end of story over and over again and in many cases the grave comes a lot sooner than his time right yeah someone as someone pointed out yeah this is like disclosure it&#x27;s like disclosure happened when Maxwell you know published his theories his treatise on electromagnetism that was disclosure in a way and and and that disclosure still hasn&#x27;t resonated with you know people who were studying UFOs a lot of people who study UFOs and study this stuff don&#x27;t understand Maxwell&#x27;s equations they don&#x27;t you know get like you know the basic field theory so yeah there a certain aspect this is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like an educational enlightenment where we think about this enlightenment is yeah coming to these realizations that we&#x27;ve been lied to and stuff but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s realizing that there&#x27;s so much knowledge out there that you know you&#x27;re almost you almost you could spend a lifetime just studying one thing and you know you&#x27;ll still find there&#x27;s more to learn really yeah you&#x27;re humble about all this yes we need be humble complexity students just students and study and learn and share ideas and let you know just let the enlightenment just happen right yeah in my opinion the 222 items we already have in you know in our possession those documents are technically disclosure and they&#x27;re pretty much all public yeah I hadn&#x27;t is effectively disclosure in in many ways of speaking yes so we have disclosure pretty much and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really more about educating people to bring them up to speed with with the knowledge so another thing I want to talk about with on that note is documentation and in the disclose because disclosure is pretty much our could happen it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just about educating people and waking them up and bringing them up to speed about what&#x27;s and then this path for what we&#x27;re trying to do with you know if it disagrees with experiment it&#x27;s wrong because everything out there is just theory and jaemin just a guess okay that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of fineman&#x27;s view of science is that everything out there is just a theory or a guess and that we need to basically do experiments to figure out what works either it works or it doesn&#x27;t you know what I mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that where&#x27;s the beef basically is is the approach that we&#x27;re taking with my this team and technicians and scientists that I&#x27;m trying to put together to test this stuff and to actually elucidate it and build it and figure out what works and what doesn&#x27;t was the what&#x27;s the disinformation and what&#x27;s the real information and and and trying to sort out that that whole mass because there&#x27;s so much lies and disinformation out there it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like just disclosure is more about getting through all that and getting to the truth than it is about you know the government coming out and saying yeah we admit that this is the way you know something is because even even when they do that we still need to verify yeah it&#x27;s all about verification at this point yeah there&#x27;s gonna be there&#x27;s just there&#x27;s just too much fluff to to weed through but so the good thing is about the fluff though I think it&#x27;s important that we build this database and I want to put together some sort of database and I want to get some people who are experts and you know up in building kind of databases and so yeah social memory so far like it&#x27;s pretty kind of in one-directional on my n from just sending this all over the place but yeah we&#x27;d love to be able to integrate it with documents that others have and I know that team has stuff so yeah I know and a lot of different kinds of stuff it&#x27;ll be good to get a centralized source and and you know kind of a sink where we can all just dump this stuff and and then just strain it out you know put it yeah and then we have multiple redundancy on all kinds of systems across the web right so that&#x27;s occurring we can all backup each other&#x27;s stuff and then and we can get everyone on the internet too and then because I&#x27;m trying to build another Network when we do when we do this kind of a dump thing it&#x27;s gonna be like disclosure day you know addy day where everyone has to like get on there and then [ __ ] and share and download that all these files as quickly as possible and but that&#x27;s gonna be a mess in itself because how is how we gonna prevent it from being compromised with you know people throwing I know this is a puzzle ahead of itself that we need to talk about about the network and the database and and and talking over people yeah it&#x27;s gonna be it&#x27;s gonna be a long time coming before any personal server servers are opened up to the public but there are other ways to go about this so and you know that kind of stuff we will definitely discuss off the air about different methods but but I want to get put it out there publicly so that we can get more network security expert well yeah we have an intention of like the thing is to a lot of this like I said it&#x27;s probably as public documents and stuff that you could download it there are different separate things all over the web and they&#x27;re available but when you get them all in one place things start to make sense and kinda there are a lot of similarities and parallels between these things it&#x27;s just mind blowing how many parallels you find and they&#x27;ve been able because of those things to be grouped into major categories eight in total right now target Jedi says one source is a great idea and Paul Weingard says I can help with the networking database please email me at the alien scientist at gmail.com and let&#x27;s let&#x27;s talk about it we&#x27;re gonna I already have a couple database people and some network security guys I&#x27;m trying to put like a team together and then where everyone can talk and kind of work on this together yeah this needs to happen and it needs to get needs to be done there&#x27;s too many papers that disappear there&#x27;s too many articles that get wiped and and disappear from the net and we need to get them all together in one spot so that we can so that they can then distribute it widely very widely agreed very one yes so in terms of experiments I mean I think we&#x27;ve all been working on some interesting things some a lot a lot has so far been negative results as per the usual but I would say inconclusive with specifically like I&#x27;ve replicated Wayne&#x27;s experiments here in my lab and I found them to be also anomalous and inconclusive there are some strange motions and it&#x27;s extremely hard to quantify whether or not we have any total asymmetrical force we definitely have motion but that motion may come back to a neutral point and it&#x27;s really hard to tell with the current test setup which is going on and then refinement that needs to be done what we really need is faster capacitors way faster capacitors yeah fast capacitors and higher voltages yes ideally some some thin playing our barium titanate or any of the tight-knit group capacitors because of their ferroelectric properties then we can make a sort of like blooming line delay line type of device where you get the full discharge of the capacitor with virtually no self inductance which would be quite ideal I think I think what&#x27;s what we were discussing in the chat right yeah that&#x27;s exactly on the chat if you cross reference a lot of these different types and devices and things like it what becomes sort of a parent at least to me is and in all of these devices there there would be some sort of a sudden or a rapid acceleration of electrons or charge carriers and you know and this applies to dr. Parkson offs gravity beam experiment and claude was a Claude Porter is that the guy I think that&#x27;s how you pronounce it yeah yeah that&#x27;s some of his experiments which I saw the other day which is quite remarkable yeah they certainly are very visual experiments yeah so we&#x27;re discussing the you know the interaction of these you know high-speed discharges are very fast to discharges into or out of superconductors yeah and then we were watching another magnetic discharge propulsion device the name who posted it I&#x27;m not gonna disclose yet because he&#x27;s kind of unknown yet and I think it&#x27;s best for him to keep it that way for now but eventually hopefully we can make contact with this fellow and and see what he has to because those results also look promising and yes Serrano and also have the same kind of thing happening where you have these sudden transitions between barrier layers which could be an arc that calls through the air and then suddenly hits the surface of a superconductor and partying the electron momentum that electrons gained in their acceleration towards the opposite charge of the superconductor and then that momentum has to go somewhere so that&#x27;s one way to explain it with the serrano device different barrier layers of different dielectric K and electron drift velocities could explain how electrons can gain momentum within the device and suddenly release that momentum upon entering a high K dielectric layer so or you know just being there different of different connectivities of each like there&#x27;s layers of the semiconductors between the capacitor plates like with different different conductivity and you have different different speed of charge carriers through those layers and then as they hit those junctions - right I mean it would yes there be a sudden rapid jerking of those particles and changing acceleration which could could result in the mission of those electric gravitational waves or shock waves or which could impart momentum have you seen that in and dr. Parkin offs claims and his experiment the momentum transfer yeah that just travels to pretty much everything exactly shielding of it yeah the weird part is that it affects everything in its path but apparently the affected object does not absorb the wave form it continues on through so it can punch a hole in a wall and a big chunk of material can go shooting out the other side this wave still travels on to a hill you know a kilometer away and plunges a hole through or pushes some dirt into it at least it seems to be what he was describing and this is in the parkland off impulse discharge arrangement is that it seems to exert a certain amount of directional force and then that&#x27;s that&#x27;s it so that directional force was like four for the distance of one-and-a-half feet let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s between his discharge electrode and the target plate then that&#x27;s the amount of maximum force that it could exert through an object or that&#x27;s basically how far every electric charge would want to travel in order to follow the carrier electric wave that was transmitted that&#x27;s kind of interesting that&#x27;s very interesting it&#x27;s not just kind of interesting then but it appears the other way it appears that the actual length of the wave itself is somehow directly correlated to the to the spacing it takes place and or the electron momentum that is able to be gained in that space so real quick when Twain and Jeremiah what are your top three top three physicists or researchers that you&#x27;re following right now it&#x27;s hard to follow some because they just don&#x27;t post things very frequently right I would tell you that I&#x27;m following pod cutoff stuff because there it is extremely promising until I tell you I&#x27;m following core stuff but again there&#x27;s like there&#x27;s seen a frequent updates and not really a lot of information happening so there&#x27;s not a lot to follow you&#x27;re just hoping that they release something right well cloud got linked up you know he&#x27;s from the French Space Agency obviously he got linked up with some private investors and kind of has shut up since then so it&#x27;s yeah it&#x27;s interesting then what kind of what goes on in this in this realm and I wonder who these private investors are and what they&#x27;re working on and who&#x27;s working on what and and I wonder how many groups really are out there developing this in secret right now probably a lot because it seems like there should be like a ton you know what I mean I just can&#x27;t believe it took me 20 years to even you know find my way into a community of other people that were also doing this that&#x27;s because when I was when I was a little kid in middle school I would come in with you know the gravity capacitor papers and talk to my friends at the lunchroom table about that and go to my science professor and ask him if he had tinfoil just to try to build this thing that was like that was the best that I could as far as the group appears go and you know later on we ended up becoming one of the biggest Tesla coil shows in the Midwest and went around with that thing and put on our own Tesla Thon&#x27;s but even still the people that were involved in that stuff weren&#x27;t particularly interested in the propulsion side of things or the potential of a testicle to do things other than throw sparks so it&#x27;s been a real challenge trying to find anybody who actually wants to know the science and not just see the pretty things it&#x27;s been 30 years for me thirty years since I started I saw Back to the Future 2 3 was a good inspiration I think mine was mine was like scene flight of the navigator and Bob Lazar I think that was like you know the two flight of the navigator was so good that&#x27;s awesome you know what&#x27;s awesome about flight of the navigators that ship was was perfectly like reflective it was like this it was like this mirror bubble and I&#x27;ve always like stuck with I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ve always like thought that concept was really uh really that it definitely is going to be the way that eventually will engineer everything it&#x27;s gonna be one solid piece no rivets no seams no holes no gaps it&#x27;s weird how the door like comes out of it and like opens up and then it comes back and seals in yeah perfectly and then like becomes part well that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not a door at all it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just a perfect molecular bond that&#x27;s broken by the ability of the machine to break or form bonds self-assembly yeah something man whoever knows it&#x27;s cool stuff but I I&#x27;ve always known that optics and and and and nanotechnology played a huge part in it too because I got into Fineman as a young student I guess in high school and you know I read his paper on this plenty of room at the bottom speaking of Fineman too by the way there is one there&#x27;s one lecture that is the most important for us in terms of antigravity or gravitational control research and it&#x27;s fineman&#x27;s disc paradox you could try to search it on YouTube but you won&#x27;t find anything it&#x27;s there&#x27;s very little information about anybody actually testing it trying it or looking into it farther there were some MIT explanations trying to deal with the paradox and some other papers but extremely important the Fineman disc paradox is the most fundamental piece of information that you can know about fineman&#x27;s lectures regarding reaction list repulsion ah I&#x27;ve never heard of this oh man do you need to get that up on screen you&#x27;re gonna have to fine at least some image thank you here&#x27;s the thing on it fit on a physics exchange oh here we go you can&#x27;t have it both ways hold a hole okay I&#x27;m I&#x27;ve read the firemen lectures on physics and I&#x27;m wondering if this was from it okay so this was right there and volume 2 of the fireman lectures okay do you remember the paradox we described in section about a solenoid and some charges mounted on a disk oh it seemed when the current turned off the whole disk should start to turn the puzzle was where to the angular momentum come from the answer is that if you have a magnetic field and some charges there will be some angular momentum in the field it must have been put there when the field was built up when the field has turned off the angular momentum is given back so the disk and the paradox would start rotating this mystic circular circulating flow of energy which at first seemed so ridiculous is absolutely necessary there is really a momentum flow it is needed to maintain the conservation of angular momentum in the whole world so that one thing that basically is being pointed out there going back into the database literally like everything in the RF magnetic across the V cross B field devices folder has to do with that same paradox and variations of it the paradox is relativistic in nature it has to do with the fact that there there is a difference between the charging time of the solenoid for it to build up a magnetic field and the instantaneous release of that magnetic field upon the collapse or disconnection to the power supply and the fact that that wave has a velocity and that there is a difference in the thickness and intensity of the magnetic flux that is transmitted out at the velocity of light that&#x27;s where the asymmetry comes in and that&#x27;s where we get our paradox but it&#x27;s not really a paradox at all it&#x27;s covered in the Lorentz transform and it is necessary this is interesting that&#x27;s a deep ramen hole for sure because it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s back to that whole idea you were talking motor with thought you know movie you know it&#x27;s not just electrostatics electrodynamics at that point it&#x27;s it&#x27;s actually a moment-- it&#x27;s it&#x27;s relating momentum to the puzzle in angular momentum which is cool yeah it gives a mechanism of action and so there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s a patent that sort of talks about this it&#x27;s us two zero one five zero zero two two zero three one and it is electromagnetic propulsion system so this doesn&#x27;t talk about fineman&#x27;s paradox I don&#x27;t believe but it does go into the the equations and a general explanation even if you don&#x27;t read the math that will show you sort of how this device can work and how you can transfer momentum using electric fields and magnetic fields I can get that fast enough to type up that patent and look it up but I can you maybe post it in the chat so actually yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just us 2015 zero zero two two zero three one zero two zero zero two two zero three one if you can&#x27;t find it just type in electromagnetic propulsion system after boom let&#x27;s post this in the chat there you go guys enjoy that was awesome and we had I had I gotta get Skylar back on with cement a team of some experts to really quiz him on the engine dynamics of that engine and really get to the bottom of his engine stuff as we go cuz that engine technology is really cool and that could change a lot of stuff and maybe get it be a good place for a startup for us to kind of get you know we get some kind of startup our company that we can come up with some kind of product or an invention that makes us some kind of money to fund other experiments or other activities and to the great dismay of other members in the group that product or invention probably won&#x27;t have anything to do with propulsion but it would probably really involves systems that we need for propulsion yeah or something that build it that we&#x27;ll need you know the kind of machine some something like those lines where we get a factory that we can also build you know craft and me for example of like what that looks like in practical terms I&#x27;m working on a Tesla coil kit and doing so has helped me develop high frequency high efficiency battery power drives I&#x27;m working on an ion powered plane and developing the high-voltage ultra lightweight multipliers fort are directly useful in studying TT Braun and other electrical verdicts so everything that I&#x27;m doing is far as these other research projects it ties back in all to the central theme of gravity control and that&#x27;s the way that we&#x27;re gonna end up having to do it because we&#x27;re gonna invest our time in making a product that people want even if it&#x27;s like a kit something really cool and maybe it&#x27;s visual it has to somehow benefit us for the time we invest in learning how to build that thing directly to our research and it&#x27;s not that hard to do since this research is such wide-ranging bringing a product to market on the other hand that is extremely hard to do project unity gravity control I just found another another project you know I type type in antigravity or gravity control or any of this stuff man you just start finding more people coming like trying to seriously work on this idea and bring it about it it&#x27;s nuts every year we get like at least at least 30 new people that have claims out there and they either last the year and stick around or they don&#x27;t but there&#x27;s there&#x27;s constantly new things coming I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot more than that but those are the ones that I&#x27;m able to come across and find that aren&#x27;t very quite so deep that they&#x27;re intangible so about photon propulsion and using light light propulsion I&#x27;ve been researching a lot of stuff on this recently this is kind of what I think I feel like this is the epitome of of really where the technology is ultimately going in the future no let me ask you a question about the photon propulsion and light propulsion because do you want to break that up into two different categories one where you&#x27;re actually talking about ultra short light wavelength propulsion and one where you&#x27;re talking about the idea of photons as electromagnetic radiation which could be literally any wavelength as the reason I&#x27;m asking is the the photon wavelength and the visible spectrum and beyond offers us the ability to directly affect the molecular structure of different materials specifically like meta materials whereas the other one allows us to transfer momentum and exert forces yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard to say because one hand I&#x27;m thinking about you know like these advanced light ships that trap trap light get it going in a circle break this kind of you know that this whole idea of breaking quantum entanglement and then also you know we talk about teleportation but you can&#x27;t violate the law of causality so I was saying that oh what they what these kind of things do is they project a hologram of themselves into that place before they appear there you know that they kind of project themselves ahead of time so that the projection takes up that doubt that um causality effect so it&#x27;s like you don&#x27;t violate the laws of causality and doing this sort of jump our hyperspace leap you know there&#x27;s all kinds of issues that we&#x27;re getting around the physics and it&#x27;s important to understand like the limitations of the physics and why you can&#x27;t do certain things and then to understand how you could get around those you know where the loopholes are in India and the framework so I believe that yeah there might be some lower level like the ion drives and these quantized inertia kind of met drives you know that&#x27;s kind of like a lower level version of this sort of thing but know that this is mäkinen into two separate levels again you know to kind of like we got to kind of like break the you know find a way to separate all these different ideas out because there&#x27;s there&#x27;s things that aren&#x27;t quite anti-gravity there being you know cooped into this this mix you know like I on you know I on wind propulsion or or that that project skyvault stuff like with with the you know electromagnetic yeah discharges tell me of you agree with you I kind of broken into these eight categories we got dielectric force and fueled shaping we have electro mechanical field systems which is devices that require the the use of a moving part of moving parts right hyperspace geometry and subtle energy devices which is really a fringe thing I&#x27;m not looking into that at all right now inertial and mass leveraging fluid devices these are like the claims of gyroscopes that can produce propulsive forces or fluids that are used in reactionist motion yep then we&#x27;ve got ion and charge particle systems plasma EHD and MHD apparatus and then into your stuff with like project skyvault we have RF magnetic eke Rossby V cross V fuel devices and then finally to power all these devices because maybe they not they&#x27;re not over unity maybe they don&#x27;t produce their own energy or they need a lot of power then we have self powered and radioactive power technologies and that folder is specifically catered to only public stuff because of the nature of what&#x27;s in it so yeah so so this is this is good good that we lay out this sort of thing so when I put this database together we can have like the different folders a couple of things from the chat I was just going and reading and not to bring that bring us back and jump jump back around but I think this is important the database is something we need to work towards the idea is that we create like a way to you know that people can join but it needs a better vetting process there needs to be a better you know more profile building you know we needed like people need to give their real name about who they are and what you know well then then we might be cutting it off to people that don&#x27;t want to use their real name that want to come in and play you can always use a fake name as long as your informations good we got to like have a vetting system so that not just anyone can sign on and just dump you know garbage there it needs to be some way of you know vetting the kind of information and the materials that they&#x27;re the people you know we&#x27;re bringing it into this this database kind of or letting letting people you know put stuff on their database sort of like a vetting process that way we can kind of keep it restrictive to us to a certain limit but also not you know top five experiments yeah and the top five experiments top ten experiments or something like that we could go with that and then and then have like these eggs even have this some of the people from our group that are doing working on different experiments you know highlight their work and and then showcase their work in those areas yeah I got a there needs to be something more done with this but I also want people that are want right you want people that are hungry you know exactly you&#x27;ve got a comment how many no I don&#x27;t want a place that people like you know someone who has information that they want to disclose or leak or something could potentially do this through the site to you know almost yeah and know that it&#x27;s gonna get out there without getting buried because there are I mean you can go on go online right now and you know you can type in where to report a UFO say you know all these sites pop up and there&#x27;s all kinds of places to report information but then where does it go out you never see it again yeah and so with people could actually see hey the thing I said ended up on the show the week after and it&#x27;s really getting out there but my name is still not disclosed that&#x27;s awesome then they know it&#x27;s getting out there yeah and they don&#x27;t have to worry about who&#x27;s you know yeah who heard what it coming back to them or something because anyone could have dumped it there for all they know you know so it&#x27;s like someone is afraid like oh how is this they&#x27;re gonna trace this back to me you know that I&#x27;m the mole that leaked this or whatever and that that way don&#x27;t worry folks people like leaked information or break break you know him break the law or anything yeah don&#x27;t worry we&#x27;re not gonna come and visit you at your house unless you invite us over so it&#x27;s pretty much I can&#x27;t afford plane tickets anyways yeah yeah exactly you know and and I want to keep it something that&#x27;s secure that we know that like the government&#x27;s not going to use our database to track down people and sources and and you know either so mm-hmm we&#x27;re definitely on the right path though now I think like I feel like after all this time invested that we&#x27;ve been doing this card of on our own and we are getting all these ideas into the same stream in the same direction it&#x27;s just like a laminar flow it&#x27;s picking up velocity and it&#x27;s reducing the resistance mm-hmm we&#x27;re in a pretty good place to move forward for sure yes no finally getting you know it&#x27;s finally coming together I think a fictive all except for the money yeah well that will come I I have a feeling that will come because what speak once someone realizes we you know Rockets are not the best way to get to space they&#x27;re really expensive really like this really wasteful way of getting to space and if we can have some kind of other way that we could get the space and whether that be propulsion reaction &#x27;less propulsion technology or something else we&#x27;re gonna have you know this is asteroid mining this is where I want to go with this this the first thing the first industry we&#x27;re gonna develop after we build spaceships is asteroid mining and we&#x27;re going to go into asteroid money because the first person to go into asteroid mining is going to be the world&#x27;s four trillionaire that&#x27;s well we have trillion areas already doing out yeah but they&#x27;re not well reported yeah right the priests really the world&#x27;s first multi trillionaire right the world&#x27;s first multi trillionaire alright so asteroid mining they&#x27;re talking about it&#x27;s gonna might be a reality by you know 2025 and it says who wants to be a trillionaire here an engineering yes so so get with asteroid mining you&#x27;ll know that that&#x27;s where the money&#x27;s gonna be at in the future it&#x27;s gonna base basically it makes this this this is these giant chunks of rock floating around they&#x27;re just loaded with coal gold and other precious metals so you know silver gold platinum group metals you know and just grow well just go out there and grab these things and then bring them back to our foundry on the moon or wherever and and forge them into you know yeah in terms of there was a some chat here going on he let your tight ass what are you going to do about the Van Allen radiation the cool thing about this tech is that because it has the ability to affect the rate flow of time as they are relativistic propulsion technology as many of them it is possible to develop a shield and in fact just in our database right now we have several patents that specifically deal with space shields and radiation shields that are purely electromagnetic and non mechanical in nature so how can we haven&#x27;t tested these things because we&#x27;re no longer we&#x27;re nowhere near like even thinking about an actual craft to get inside but when when those things come the resources have been posited out there and we can begin testing those concepts yeah so we got shielding we have we have all that well we will when the time comes so yeah I guess you know we&#x27;re gonna jump the gun right away we&#x27;re still with baby steps people baby steps it W DMT not a magnetic shield per se on the electromagnetic shield that deals with radiated fields you have to you have to impart some kind of motion or some kind of momentum in order to get the effects going just a simple magnetic flux that static will not do much of anything take a look at take a look at that tank shielding system that then generator tanks shield system that just generates a huge amount of voltage that&#x27;s a fine example of how an increasing electric field density in a given volume of space can effectively change the momentum of an incoming object flowing through it so let&#x27;s see what gravity Research Foundation has been up to haven&#x27;t heard much from them in a while oh five Awards four essays on gravitation offered in 2021 we should write an essay on gravitation that would be awesome you haven&#x27;t thinking about putting together some presentations there is one YouTube channel whose name I can&#x27;t remember but I bet you many people watching you right now know what it is this guy basically looks at some of these more obscure patents and builds beautiful 3d models of them in CAD and then sort of talks about his opinion and view of them I&#x27;d love his ability to build a 3d models the way that he explains them working is usually very very far off but then again the patents don&#x27;t always clearly state how they work they&#x27;re very obscure in their language using oftentimes terms like those who are skilled in the art will recognize those who are experienced in this with it kids merely so all the guys think they know more about this and you know the people that worst we&#x27;re learning from and talking about everything then here you go go write an essay on gravitation and win the four for $12,000 first price because you obviously know more than us yeah puts them off put some stomp behind your new theory yeah let&#x27;s do it you know so much anyways I want to talk a little bit more about just let&#x27;s let&#x27;s go back through all the history I know there&#x27;s so much history on anti-gravity we can&#x27;t really cover it all we just this would derail the entire stream but you can go back this is some of the more you know promising history and I want to put together a more complete history on here - I got this is my list is missing a bunch of stuff we need it you add more know it that what&#x27;s not on here is that that one theory about that grab n akov guy yeah that&#x27;s something I would still always wonder about yeah I don&#x27;t know because it seems kind of weird you know they did these you know calculations on these insects and found that the weight of the you know that they&#x27;re the weight of these insects is you know too heavy and that their flight their wings are too small to produce the amount of thrust that would be required to propel them and then he figured that there was this other kind of force going on with the wings kind of like that that they&#x27;ll miss like the cellulose and these wings were acting as a meta material and forming a small type of anti-gravity kind of propulsion with the insect wings this material called chitin and that the insect chitin was somehow creating you know this sort of you know cell that and that he basically took a bunch of these insect wings and used it to make this geometric if you if you look at the if you look at the wing structure under a microscope you see uh there&#x27;s tiny I believe is like tiny conical structures yep or any hexagonal shaped star yeah they they converge at a point and then it might be possible that those bugs are able to slightly electrify those wings like the little of the Centers of those structures yeah it&#x27;s almost like a little little b-2 spirit bomber is with little by fell Brown effect that&#x27;s great electric field yeah trying to see which one is that geez I know I&#x27;ve added to this folder several times I always have trouble finding it in here they&#x27;re gonna smell that reminds me of another article I saw this is from July it&#x27;s you know there is spiders can fly hundreds of miles using electricity and they talk about you know the the spiders use this ballooning technique they blow a web and then they fly up in the wind but they&#x27;re there the scientists who study this phenomenon they realize that that electricity actually you know like electro static fields play a huge role in their ability to fly you know hundreds of miles using this technique which is really cool yeah with Rebecca cough if you want to look at sea at cavitational structure effects &amp; electrostatics regarding like the beetle wing stuff if you look back to a patent from 1965 by TT Brown three one eight seven two zero six now what this talks about and this is a pretty interesting pet and it covers the use of the power supply but also talks about the shaped geometry of the electrodes and the use of alternating fields so if the if the geometry of the fields were set up using the metamaterial structure of the wing just like these shaped dielectrics and this patent are disclosed and alternating field were provided to them you could effectively simulate the Bible you could simulate the vibrations or by giving the vibrations you could simulate a alternate electric field of an incredibly strong intensity that would still have its DC electrostatic bias fulfilling the parameters of this patent for ideal operation so it does it does relate there is something to gravina cough stuff I think related to 2t T Brown directly because of that just like we were talking about and that&#x27;s one place you can go look and try to understand it hmm that&#x27;s interesting I also just like you know think of if this this effect could be used to build warp drives why bugs we don&#x27;t see work bugs you know why they didn&#x27;t well we do see bugs flying with some pretty unusual capabilities and you know beyond the ability of their aerodynamic propulsion yeah and if spiders aren&#x27;t the fine example of that which have zero aerodynamic propulsion seem to fly just fine lofting spiders is just one various example so obviously other insects could easily produce and do produce electrostatic fields on their wings because of the materials and the separation between those two plates increases the voltage to an extremely high potential that is the body their surface of their body and the inside of the wing so why couldn&#x27;t they lost just like spiders and fly on the electric fields coming up from the downward pore of positive ions from the ionosphere and from the particles that the Sun is constantly blasting unto Earth after all Feynman does cover exactly this in his lectures and talks about the incredible power that so if you were negatively charged and you don&#x27;t lose that charge you&#x27;re gonna be pulled upwards which is pretty much how spiders you like didn&#x27;t mean to you know mix us up but I&#x27;m basically just saying yeah small lightweight uh-huh Rangers can in fact fly its fighter so the most amazing thing ever they&#x27;re like the perfect hunting machine their hydraulic no pain sensors and their appendages just fluids to pump them and one central processing unit where all the pumps are located and all the decisions are made it&#x27;s pretty incredible really and they all come pre-programmed to know how to make at the webs exactly mints butters are the most machine like thing I can&#x27;t think of short of say maybe a dragonfly which helicopters look exactly like a dragonfly I would say dragonflies look like helicopters but dragonflies came first just watch one of those things in slow motion that&#x27;s what I would recommend watch a dragonfly in slow motion in the the uncanny nasai what what sort of electrification may happen in these bugs weather no in terms of a tribal electric effect as they flap their wings and then there&#x27;s a charge difference that&#x27;s developed on one side of the wing compared to the other even if it wasn&#x27;t say even if it wasn&#x27;t electrochromatic even if it wasn&#x27;t anything special with cavitational structure effect let&#x27;s just say that the charge developed on the wings somehow added some ionic propulsion effect to their lift factor and that gave them extra thrust I mean that&#x27;s still a huge significant thing to recognize that would explain their flight characteristics in a way that currently just the vortices calculations don&#x27;t do yeah also if I I read that the earth is negatively charged yeah rather it&#x27;s a strange phenomena that it is negatively charged and the only explanation for how this occurs is sprites that shoot or shoot out or jet out to space and we have these these long ion channels that sort of carry out but the thing is if the earth is constantly being bombarded with positively charged particles from the Sun and they have a rate flow down towards the Earth four hundred thousand volts between the ionosphere and the surface and 700 million watts of power then my my question would be you know how does it not lose its negative charge eventually and I suppose the answer to that is no matter how positively charged the earth becomes no matter how many positively charged particles it absorbs and that add to its mass and increase its expansion rate it will never ever ever be more positive than the Sun so that&#x27;s the only thing I could think of really but I do find a pretty fascinating that this continuous downpour of particles creates a constant constant electric field I found some meth and really cool considering design design aspects for you know these kinds of things they almost look like these fractal crystals on just as much smaller level that the kind of stuff that you know the answer the targa jedi to about the database having videos we&#x27;re probably not gonna do videos in the database because we wanted to something be something that you can stick on a flash drive and videos will quickly turn it into a gigantic registry post some on youtube or d tube or whatever and just yeah you know that&#x27;s fine I mean you have definitely feel free to download the videos if we post them up that maybe link back to these things so if they get pulled down or bad or whatever you still have them but other than that it&#x27;ll be they&#x27;ll be external links that probably won&#x27;t last forever and individuals will have to download them and hopefully enough people have the database where somebody can always get their hands on it so the only thing that someone mentioned that that board you know Victor Bev that picture of him on that jumping board and stuff dude like that now that&#x27;s what threw me off of the whole thing when I seen that was like that&#x27;s fake dude like this obviously like Photoshop or doesn&#x27;t done with some sort of like thing and that and that&#x27;s what threw me off of the whole thing but the insect chitin it is some interesting science when you when you start - that that&#x27;s that I must say yeah but if it is fake the weirdest part of his story has to be his report of developing some kind of foot cancer as a result of being bombarded with leptons his explanation of how it works at his feet more strongly than any other part of his body that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a wild date as a wild claim and speculation just to say that you have a flying machine and here&#x27;s someone interesting that he said leptons because leptons would be electrons those would be electrons muons and Tau&#x27;s right yeah he theorized that the source of all the leptons was directly from the Sun and that he was only able to utilize the amount of leptons in in the air at that time so mu 1 mu 1 is also a lepton right and remember I talked a lot about that muon ideas for muon propulsion new on anti-gravity there was a whole thing about using anti muons you know for anti-gravity hmm that base you know what Museum is I didn&#x27;t know you owned iam is basically it&#x27;s almost like a hydrogen atom where where the the protons been replaced with a muon instead because muons are positively charged so basically it&#x27;s like a it&#x27;s like an exotic exotic atom made up of an anti muon an electron and it was discovered in 1960 by Vernon Hughes it&#x27;s given a chemical symbol of MU so there&#x27;s this idea of that you could basically you use these muons how did this work so it&#x27;s basically like using electrons right did they work muons work very much the same as electrons except that they&#x27;re they&#x27;re more punch there are like a lot heavier so let&#x27;s what&#x27;s the weight of a electron versus muon wait let&#x27;s see electron versus muon eunsung two quarks to me yeah I think I well depends on what your definition of quarks are because I have a different model for the muons and the with that other I&#x27;m just going from standard theory to J Decker can we make piezoelectric crystals that work on the natural expansion of space unfortunately not because we would need a relative expansion that was different than the expansion the crystals were undergoing and where we will get that that relative field that&#x27;s different than whatever the crystal is experiencing and I&#x27;m not sure if we can create relativistic fields that were inherently different which is what we&#x27;re going for we wouldn&#x27;t need to to work on the natural expansion sorry so I don&#x27;t think they contain quarks because they&#x27;re there leptons and leptons are like they&#x27;re not they don&#x27;t contain quarks there they&#x27;re kind of like the so that they don&#x27;t the mu1 does not contain quarks no sorry sorry Tarkin Jedi there&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to be a delay before any any database links are put up or shared where&#x27;s there&#x27;s probably quite a bit more that&#x27;s gonna be added to that thing yet and then we of course because because it could be internationally available we need to make sure that everything that&#x27;s in it that&#x27;s going to be posted is stuff that&#x27;s publicly available but don&#x27;t get it wrong those public documents are absolutely more than you need to to start doing this research and get into it so I have some stuff actually on the hover brothers site I&#x27;m about these muon EMU so if you search for me on iam on the hover brothers Theory page alright you&#x27;ll find a couple things on antimatter anti-gravity and testing you know if antimatter has anti-gravity properties and they use muon for that because mule mule mule owned iam they use museum for that because anti muon and aunt it has an anti muon which is antimatter so and there&#x27;s this guy Daniel Kaplan and there was also a team at the at the EDI ETH Zurich the University of Zurich Klaus Kerch they did a bunch of work with they&#x27;re still doing ongoing work with me own iam to test the antigravity and say matter anti-gravity so yeah that&#x27;s what all I had to say about that but that would be interesting if you know like that if those muons or whatever the leptons around his feet because he said leptons around his feet and leptons are yeah leptons are not core they don&#x27;t contain quarks they&#x27;re they&#x27;re kind of like at their own family of quarks horny now is that standard model now I&#x27;d like to have a private chat with Nixa interesting stuff there Nick so yeah we should you got to get we got to get people like this to jump on me I love when people like that jump in the chat and and and because they got a come on so yeah so these are the things on mix is on the right on the right track and voltage discharges I think that&#x27;s I think that&#x27;s one of the keys right and that&#x27;s where some of these things appear in these high voltage discharges I&#x27;ve seen stuff weird stuff on the scales during those discharges I can&#x27;t explain it with with 30 million the scale is so slow in the scale samples like you know one to two samples per second these discharges are on the order of nanoseconds so the fact it even picks it up at all is I think impressive but we we would need the ability to basically measure forces on the order of nanoseconds or Pico seconds which is an incredibly expensive endeavor to take on it requires specialized equipment and extremely fast transducers and they are not cheap no but if we had that we could pretty much understand exactly what was going down going on down to a timescale that would allow us to really engineer it so anything else you guys want anything else peeking your research I bought one of the guys I&#x27;ve been following a lot is this also this Mike McCulloch guy in his quantized inertia calm his research is there he&#x27;s got 28 papers posted they&#x27;re really interesting stuff related to asymmetric capacitors and these conical capacitors and these Casimir effect drives you know interesting thing I just wanted that there&#x27;s a we were talking before about the bug wings and all that and you just mentioned it has effect I thought you know those two plates when they&#x27;re so close together there&#x27;s that force that developed it&#x27;s closer together so there&#x27;s like a pressure there are negative pressure but with these conical structures whether you like these micro structures if they&#x27;re made in such a way that there might be sort of a a asymmetric or net force rating you&#x27;re dead on Wayne so think about the Casimir effect right it works by the fact that certain wavelengths can&#x27;t fit within the volume of space between the two plates and the Casimir effect was interesting because it observes that the natural properties of all the space around us in the universe is filled with these waves and just simply putting two plates with no external signals we generate produces this force but taking the same principle now you basically accepted that momentum in the electromagnetic waves when they&#x27;re rejected can exert a force so if you create electromagnetic waves and a you know of a longer wavelength more like the capability that we actually have with modern-day equipment instead of these extremely extremely short practically Planck length waves then we can generate a larger cavity that also responds to those larger waves and we can put these same waves on both sides of that cavity and some of them will in fact be rejected and we should be able to generate the forest using the CSC in the same way that the Casimir effect works and actually in that document database several patents talking about solid-state Kasmir propulsion devices and energy generators hmm well what about even just um you know some well looking at molecular structures some molecular structures have these trigana or I forget the names but they&#x27;re you know pyramid shapes and they&#x27;re there&#x27;s different shapes of these these molecules so applying electric field across a crystal would you know could for singly create these these structures and then applying what you&#x27;re saying there with the yeah you&#x27;ll be saying that these atomic structures could simulate the same types of effects but because of my way that they interact with the electric fields micro structures yeah to you know create this uh that&#x27;s a whole other that&#x27;s a whole other ballgame yeah you didn&#x27;t mean it certainly bought if it works on a large scale and we can do it we can do it with like physical objects that we could put together with our hands then there&#x27;s no reason to think that we can&#x27;t continue to shrink it down to the atomic scale and actually develop nanomaterials themselves I mean the first transistor was a rock with a wired pressed against it and now look at what we have so I think that&#x27;s more but that&#x27;s more of an advanced more of an advanced tiny though so yes so this is this is where I believe it&#x27;s going yeah this is what I&#x27;ve been saying is that you know we&#x27;ve got these like experiments with these rotating superconductors are these conical you know these conical capacitors or these Mach effect drives or these Woodward effect thrusters or these you know quantized inertia experiments and stuff yeah I think it&#x27;s about scaling it down and building it on the nano level oh hey people can hear your vape going to the whistling of your oh is it loud yeah I can hear it like that&#x27;s the first time I I wasn&#x27;t noticed well I&#x27;ll move myself then except I&#x27;m doing that then the conical capacitors are my idea is that yeah if you could build this stuff on this on the micro level yeah on the nano level we could potentially increase the effect by a milkman you know a hundred to a million fold depending on how many of these things you could fit you know yeah think about the field density of a structure like that and just how you could squeeze into a small space right that&#x27;s it&#x27;s exactly what it is it&#x27;s you&#x27;re squeezing all that power into a smaller space and increasing the effect massively so yeah that&#x27;s where I think it&#x27;s going in the future that&#x27;s where I think that&#x27;s where our goal my goal is to get to and there&#x27;s an interesting metamaterial that has to do with actually generating these these types of fields like we might need in a CSE structure micro Brown structure I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called but basically it&#x27;s a bunch of radio antennas that are printed onto this layer by with lithography like a processor and they are oriented little circles square like like you&#x27;d find in a security Steff system where the beepers would go off these little icon of square antennas anyways they&#x27;re basically those and they get fed from these on-board transistors that are built into the board what they do is they can either convert straight DC into photon wavelength radio emissions so we do not have technology to generate actual photons directly via radio waves instead of through junctions like LEDs do it or if they don&#x27;t use onboard transistors they can directly absorb and orient photons to generate electric power like a solar cell for a very specific wavelength which is pretty darn neat but if you were to take those things in the transmission mode and stick tiny cavitation structures in front of them effectively you would have created the full system now all you need to do is add a DC bias source and you&#x27;ve got it but I can&#x27;t print those I don&#x27;t have any ability to do lithography of any kind but hey there is a possibility in the future that we could do that or somebody could do it oxi hydrogen really cool stuff the Dry cells I know a guy who is making Browns gas very dangerous stuff but this is a little more safe you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like I like the oxy-hydrogen idea a lot better just because it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have that you know factor of you know like storing hydrogen gas or Browns gas you know a mix a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen combustible mixture you know well the hho is the chem is is the perfectly burnable hydrogen oxygen mixture that&#x27;s what comes out of that thing and it it is extremely dangerous but Browns gas specifically differs from hho wherein the hydrogens are in Chains instead of just being individuated into h2 so it has this strange property of containing much much more energy per volume space than hho gas okay interesting ice - that&#x27;s Lake electrolyzers back in 2000 Shh yeah that&#x27;s right around the same time I was making him had a lot of fun through anything I had been put in a car and a mechanic did some emissions testing on it he was just amazed at how Wow there&#x27;s no emissions coming out of here and there&#x27;s no Lincoln Sox that I wear that but you know some guy came along from that PC Safety Authority and said uh you can&#x27;t put those in cars that&#x27;s explosive yeah that was the end of that it hasn&#x27;t stopped I mean there are still there&#x27;s still places all over the US that will install them for you I did one um actually to my friend in Colorado we did one to Jeff pectins car he bought one and wanted us to install for him yeah that&#x27;s awesome i-i&#x27;ve heard some of the crazy claims I&#x27;ve never personally installed it in one of my vehicles because quite frankly I&#x27;ve never owned a vehicle that was like robust enough to know better compression or better combustion but Dan would come in and dam with that engine 201 compression ratio yes I&#x27;m very excited about that project getting out in the public naw bill oh yeah so um people are talking about bob lazar HHO car and that wasn&#x27;t an HHS car he is he actually used the lithium hydride tanks to store hydrogen and I don&#x27;t even know bob lazar built-in hho car oh it was a hydrogen car and he didn&#x27;t build it he just bought the parts for it and kind of put it together and he said that he&#x27;d built he said that he was lithium hydride for his his his tanks he he said he produced his own lithium hydride and a particle accelerator which s quite a bold clean poor guy because he&#x27;s particle accelerator is too small it would have taken you know taken forever to produce that much lithium hydride it&#x27;s way way better weight cheaper just to buy it you know unless he claims he had a line act if he had one of those then he could&#x27;ve done it in as little as six feet a linac a linear yeah a microwave beam linear accelerator yeah but so those are used in CT machines and they are pretty short and they get electrons going to a pretty darn close to speed of light velocity in the power of power that would cost them oh geez yeah it&#x27;s 20 it&#x27;s like 28 kilowatts just to start one up so you the amount of power that you need and the costs of that power would be way more than just buying a bunch of lithium I address yeah he&#x27;d be pretty much using all of what was available to him off the pole and his neighbors lights would dim if he ran it or he&#x27;d have to have a flywheel you know like basically charging up during the day to like run and to run the pot well I mean not really we&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve pulled with the Tesla coil stuff I pulled as much as 100,000 watts off of via well see it&#x27;s quite a bold claim and and and I&#x27;ve had but yeah well I agree that it&#x27;s possible to actually get the kind of power he would require I absolutely don&#x27;t think for a second that he had the ability to assemble a machine capable of conducting that kind of power but hydrogen is is very ideal for a fuel except for the fact that it&#x27;s explosive and you know I think you know what else all hydrocarbons including gasoline that&#x27;s - it&#x27;s pretty explosive - if you get it into vapor is form if it weren&#x27;t for that Hindenburg me being one of the first disasters caught on film because that video you know blowing up kind of ruined you know for the world yeah I think people forget just how many successful flights the Hindenburg had before that little incident and it wasn&#x27;t the only one flying around there there were many that would be commissioned with no incident ever having been recorded but it&#x27;s a shame one one&#x27;s go on the public face will always leave a bad taste in people&#x27;s mouth [Music] age of airships man and Buck Rogers flew an airship he didn&#x27;t fly a rocket I don&#x27;t know about y&#x27;all but I love airships I don&#x27;t personally want to own one because I don&#x27;t want to die but I do love the idea of seeing airships flying around I just don&#x27;t like the idea of the fact that they have a huge surface area the wind can easily push against which is kind of an ideal here&#x27;s a confident speaking of the airships have you ever heard of call a balloon you have ordinary atmospheric area and a needle discharging terminal so I did that I did exactly that yeah and so I had a video I have a video on my channel about the electric magic long I&#x27;ve gone through many many iterations of it since to develop it into a very powerful device but what I did is just I have an ionizing electrode that sticks on it and the one that I tested it with is a hundred thirty thousand volt DC positive so it would reduce cost of ions I just take a girl shoe bleh vague I fling it up in the air with one side so that it kind of in place and then I just take that thing up in the center and as soon as I hit the button 100,000 volts generates enough ions are the bag inflates itself all the way it does inflate just like an air balloon like you&#x27;re thinking it would and it is pushed away from the ion source mmm however the amount of force that it generates in terms of pushing away is barely able to keep itself aloft and the ion source is about ten thousand times heavier than it needs to be so that&#x27;s though it&#x27;s possible could you could you get enough ionic density I mean theoretically it should be insulated pretty well so yes you could inflate the balloon but you would need another you would need another same charge to pull to push against or and obviously charged pull to pull yourself into and the question is where do you get that perhaps just the atmosphere downward positive ionic drift could provide more than enough force if you had negative ions still in the inside of your very well dielectric insulated balloon and maybe that would actually work I mean it&#x27;s possible there&#x27;s certainly enough current they&#x27;re coming down and you get like twice the lift during the daytime than you would at night but hey I don&#x27;t believe anybody&#x27;s ever tried it ah that&#x27;s not true actually you know the balloon boy right well yeah I know about that story that thing was an ion powered though uh he was trying he had a thing in it he was trying to power it with Iowa he was trying to basically set up by Feld Brown inside that mylar balloon to like test by felt Brown on balloons that&#x27;s okay that&#x27;s all stuff I I just read this I just read the stuff of all balloon boy ironically cuz synchronicity is a [ __ ] like a day and a half ago and I was looking through that article and I watch the original video I don&#x27;t know why I even came up but uh I yeah I didn&#x27;t know what had anything to do with this guys were sure that he was some kind of like engineer or scientist I knew him you knew him yeah I didn&#x27;t know that so he live in Fort Collins when I lived I lived there for a vote from April to like October in 2009 I left like right out I left like a couple weeks after this this whole thing happened I left right like right around Halloween I remember I came back and I had hollow I I had Halloween here but I hadn&#x27;t talked to him for like two or three months before I saw that on TV and I remember my dad called me he&#x27;s like hey there&#x27;s this guy&#x27;s on TV it sounds like this guy you know oh my god he&#x27;s like he was working on these balloons and like trying to test you know by Feld Brown effect and and and you have a symmetric capacitors and he had this whole like rig and the inside the balloon that was the thing on the bottom it wasn&#x27;t big enough to hold the payload of a child it was big and all it held was his electronic kind of apparatus that he had is there any way that you could maybe like contact this guy and find out what he had inside there because I would love to know I think I could probably have all the information saved oh you actually have like what he had inside he had some kind of an arrangement and you know what that was I have to dig through that stuff yeah I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know who I might even have emails saying whoo-hoo-hoo you got to build it for him who built the electronic part of it cuz he wasn&#x27;t very good with electronics and stuff I built a lot of electronics formed to test a lot of other stuff but all I worked on with it with him was all this free energy stuff apparently MIT wasn&#x27;t either that&#x27;s why their plan was doing all this L you know free energy stuff so I was building motor controllers and and stuff like that for with with him you know for these these ideas that he had for these motor can you know like these brushless motors these these different types of motor controllers which I&#x27;m sorry we we had nothing on Tesla and their motor controllers they got us beat an engineering device hands down we were like but anyways he he we did a lot of free energy experiments and I was telling him why they wouldn&#x27;t work and he&#x27;s trying to like explain them the second law of thermodynamics and you know like where you know that we have to find like a source and sink off of that somehow and the you know and all this and and I watched him pissed through a lot of money and then we got to and then like I stopped talking to him like a week weaker in a mile probably a couple month two months before this happened and then I saw it on TV and then and then and actually he Richard Heene he&#x27;s the one that flew to Finland in 2004 and got the interview with Eugene pod clean off huh you didn&#x27;t know this hold up let me find this so UFOs it&#x27;s in here so it&#x27;s alright so get this right let me find this picture so here here&#x27;s a picture of me with Richard Heaney the balloon boy dad right on his back porch there&#x27;s the there&#x27;s the desk I prototype he it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a prototype of one of these things he built where he had the he was testing the by Feld Brown effect off on this this was like the canonical piece on the top and then I had a flat piece on the bottom and they were separated and there was like dielectric in between like like and he charged the whole top of it and this was like one of the test models of this thing and then it that&#x27;s not the actual mylar balloon that things built out of pall the isocyanide panels they that are coated with that poll quota with what it&#x27;s built out of what Polly isocyanide panel foam paint what is Polly isocyanide I&#x27;ve never heard of that material Polly isocyanate Wow what are the properties of the material that cause you to choose such a obscure thing no it&#x27;s not it obscure what is it used for generally speaking because like I know this is it&#x27;s foam common uses so let me find pictures of it so if it&#x27;s like really lightweight lightweight and it appears he&#x27;s got some kind of metallic coating that could be what I need for the ion planes PIR board or this stuff hmm used for insulation like a home insulation insulation paneling it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the reflective you know I our reflective panel coated you know it&#x27;s like mylar or this metal material I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is but I guess I need to brush up on my on my synthetic foam material names then I should have already like knowing that right offhand but uh apparently I have much research to do yeah there&#x27;s different types of foam there form different ways like polystyrene and Society see I knew about polystyrene I&#x27;ve just never heard of poly Isis on it all the different types and then you know it compares it to that great great stuff yeah I really I need to brush up on this good material science and all these different types of foam and and how they work but poly isocyanate is good because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty it doesn&#x27;t catch fire and burn you know like the same it&#x27;s really good it&#x27;s good for insulate used for insulation because it doesn&#x27;t just like go up like a tinderbox like the nightclub station fire and then I Club with the station nightclub fire in Providence that was all that insulation that sound an insulation that was a different type of foam I think that was Oh what was that type of foam they used for the make soundproofing insulation it&#x27;s a different type of foam but it burrows up like really fast and and and that&#x27;s what caused that place to burn down and like one and a half minutes with like 600 people inside and Wow deadliest nightclub fires of recent history anyway not of all time I think the most deadliest one was in Boston at the the coconut cocoa Cabana or was the that&#x27;s two of them that happened in Boston that were really really bad but I mean let&#x27;s just hope that by 2100 we can all be insulated with aerogel or something even better anyways back to the balloon incident in anyways and Richard Richard went yeah Richard went to he&#x27;s he&#x27;s the guy that went to Finland let me find this so here&#x27;s a picture of him with eugene pod Clutton off that&#x27;s him with eugene parkland aw he flew there in 2004 and got that interview and he&#x27;s the one that gave that to me when I posted it like back in 2009 I think I posted it in 2009 a couple months after this went down cuz he was saving all his he was saving all this for in all his experiments and all the stuff he wanted to do a TV show and he wanted to put this whole thing together on anti-gravity dude and he wanted like he wanted to he wanted to basically create a reality TV show like Mythbusters but just for antigravity and free energy and we were gonna like basically get like funding through that to do this and I remember hearing about the show I just didn&#x27;t know the name yeah so and the whole we had a pilot that was put together for the show and it was I forget what it was called but basically I believe I seen that pilot it was like pretty intense yeah very technical we had a couple different ideas for it but it was gonna be like it was gonna be like he was like the guy without the education and I was gonna get a bunch of like physicists saw until like basically like he was gonna come up with these crazy ideas and build this [ __ ] and then wasn&#x27;t gonna work and then we were gonna like come up with to come with the team of scientists to explain him why it didn&#x27;t work and and and figure it all out for him at the end of every show and that was kind of like the theme that I was hoping for cuz he&#x27;s like this he&#x27;s like this friggin just he&#x27;s this nutcase and I complete like [ __ ] he&#x27;s I don&#x27;t he I don&#x27;t know how to describe a Richard Heaney but like he&#x27;d be this perfect candidate for this [ __ ] yeah and this is how we&#x27;re gonna do it and it&#x27;s just and it&#x27;s like this is why it doesn&#x27;t work he&#x27;s like ah you know like he&#x27;s just like this perfect character you know like he could play it so well but I don&#x27;t know when so when anyways when I saw this whole thing go down and and then I see like internet historian did this whole thing on this right internet historian which is funny because it shows you what about a little a little bit about history if you want to really get into formal events but Internet historian is this guy and he&#x27;s got two million subscribers where&#x27;s his bloom where&#x27;s his Balloon Boy video right this is funny we&#x27;re talking about this the untold story of Balloon Boy so from three years ago it&#x27;s got five million views dude all right if I made a Balloon Boy video I have to watch this oh yeah I know it&#x27;s I don&#x27;t know why we&#x27;re even getting the end of this and talking about this just because it has some relation to science because rich it&#x27;s funny that the parklet of interview came from Richard Heaney and that he hasn&#x27;t done of me he would that pod clinton olive hasn&#x27;t done an interview in 20 or 15 years right 16 years it&#x27;s been since he&#x27;s done an interview he hasn&#x27;t done any follow-up interviews to that one and the guy yeah just that one series of videos that he released a little more recently was it and that&#x27;s it but the guy who interviewed him was rich was the balloon boys dad like Richard that&#x27;s just just funny history that it&#x27;s not it like here it is in this untold story but yet there&#x27;s more there&#x27;s more going on here than and there&#x27;s so much wrong in the store because he wouldn&#x27;t talk to Richard and like and and it was like oh it&#x27;s about this thing in it and that there was the show and what was what was Falcon Heaney talking about when wolf because you know Wolf Blitzer answer interview right so this is the thing Wolf Blitzer interview Falcon he so the six year old kid admits we did it for the show and this is what blew the whole case wide open for everybody you know the original story was that he didn&#x27;t hear them calling his name and he was sleeping up in the attic you know and he was supposed to say that but right so you should you should leave both of those in the in the chat so just throw them open in a new window and get him ready for after this yeah so anyone following on this in the live chat can go check that out and they can go check out this internet historian video right which is rather interesting because the the the they missed a big piece of it because so this interview internet historian interviewed him and says oh well did the show that he was talking about he was just confused and that he didn&#x27;t really talk about that and that it was you know so that they think we&#x27;d cracked the case that&#x27;s what he claims that they cracked the case okay it&#x27;s just funny cuz I&#x27;ve been waiting for somebody to really crack the case who like like this in this band I invest pretty cool influence those little [ __ ] cuz I went over then run and play guitar for that they had like this shitty guitar like set up with an electric thing they they probably like got for Christmas and like never played with and I tuned it up and I plugged it in and I ripped out like all I ripped out all these Metallica solos and all this stuff for him and they were just like oh man we want to let and then that that I dare guarantee I influenced his kids to become musicians I know these kids and when I seen that I was just like dude for the show Richard really no no and then I watch internet historian they talk about the show so what&#x27;s up with this show so anyways it was 2009 April pilot season I wish you could find this I don&#x27;t think you could even find this to find all the episodes that were pitched to like all the pilots that were pitched in 2009 in April 2009 you basically April is pilot season it&#x27;s like every April all the new all the new shows are pitched to the network&#x27;s and they decide which other shows get the get the hatchet and get cancelled and then find out which new shows are coming on and we were competing in 2009 I remember we put all this together and we were competing with freakin what&#x27;s it called hmm we were competing with two Coreys was one of the shows right that that became a show in 2009 and Howard I didn&#x27;t remember this because I don&#x27;t watch TV and know this stuff but I remember it because because we were competing with all these other shows and two Coreys is one of the ones that vote Cory Feldman and and Cory the other Cory I forget but his best friend there and that show got one over the Richard Heaney show so that was the show that he put together and we were gonna basically with this reality TV show for like studying antigravity and free energy technology and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m pretty sure the show that he was talking about we did it for the show when he said we did it for the show like they basically this was a publicity stunt everyone knows it was a publicity stunt they got charged with it being a publicity stunt they pled guilty in court to it at me as being a publicity stunt just [ __ ] admit that it was a publicity stunt but tell him why the real story is not being told it&#x27;s like he he doesn&#x27;t want to admit to a publicity stunt he&#x27;s still [ __ ] like trying to hold on to this like no it wasn&#x27;t that my six-year-old son made a mistake when he told Wolf Blitzer on public television that we did it for the show that&#x27;s the cat what you know and everyone everyone just jumped on that and and then you know the prosecutor is that yeah the prosecutor was corrupt in Larimer County big whoop you know they all are the entire justice system&#x27;s corrupt it will call across America let&#x27;s get you let&#x27;s get you know get with the times people but this the untold story is that Richard Heaney was working on anti-gravity he interviewed eugene pod [ __ ] knob and he was on to like a lot of this [ __ ] and this returned the same kind of research back then and that was one of the few people out there that i that i found at the time that was into this and they ruin this man&#x27;s public image and his reputation and in part because of that and and probably i don&#x27;t know why he&#x27;s still like not talking about the real [ __ ] he&#x27;s sitting on a [ __ ] treasure trove of all kinds of interviews cuz five Lonavala man only one he interviewed and wonder if there&#x27;s any way that you could still get some of those from him if he&#x27;s got him or you know some were saved they&#x27;re all set on tapes in his basement that are gonna go bad in another 5-10 years dude somebody&#x27;s got it somebody&#x27;s gotta at least try to get that stuff from him and you&#x27;re in the perfect position to do it i tried to reach out to him already man after i watch this i emailed him and i&#x27;d you know i tried to contact him i got a mail and i tried out to him but he never wrote back to me so I said [ __ ] him if he&#x27;s not gonna write back to me I&#x27;m gonna you know I wonder if somebody said some tunes to be told the truth needs to be told about this causation out to the mainstream in the public and it just doesn&#x27;t happen it&#x27;s always just corrupted or you know some stupid version of it because they just focused on how his balloon couldn&#x27;t lift a kid you know well fantasy if it had friggin other propulsion system on board then it could lift a kid but they didn&#x27;t talk about any of that [ __ ] they just had these physics professors on to say oh well the amount of helium and the balloon couldn&#x27;t have lifted the child and you know this guy&#x27;s an idiot and I don&#x27;t know what the hell he was building and what he was you know what&#x27;s he&#x27;s talking about and stuff but yeah he was kind of an idiot and he was kind of you know didn&#x27;t really not really a good engineer who really knew everything about what you know could put everything on paper together not everyone is he was good at building no that&#x27;s that&#x27;s for sure definitely not we found out last week Richard Richard I worked with him on construction you had his general contractor&#x27;s license Colorado we did a lot of construction together when I worked out there that&#x27;s you know how I made my part part of how I made my leg and why do so many interesting research have to go into obscurity for one reason or the other what is wrong with less is just weird anyways that&#x27;s the real history for anyone that once so the untold that&#x27;s the real unto Balloon Boy untold story for anyone who wants to you know hit up internet historian and tell them to [ __ ] interview me and get the real story do the follow up so maybe he&#x27;ll take you up on that [Laughter] into what like an hour and a little over an hour and a half on the show that&#x27;s not too bad I think we&#x27;ve covered quite a bit of information I think Wayne&#x27;s gone silent for the night yeah he fell asleep like about a half hour to an hour ago I want to talk anything we could cap on for antigravity because this is kind of like I wanted to do like an instant experts guide to anti-gravity and bring people up to speed and we kind of did a lot of tangent and talked about a lot of other you know stupid things like bob lazar hydrogen car and the balloon boy but well I uh in terms of about the propulsion tech and the the physics principles that apply right now my main focus is going to be on the radiated e/m stuff are there are many ways to approach it from Al&#x27;s Afon with reorienting Lamar procession of electron balances to you know high-energy pulse magnetic fields but right now what I really want to focus on is the e/m conversion that whole Lorentz transformer we can transfer momentum because I think that&#x27;s one of the most tangible ways that is universally understood and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m developing right now Wayne has a really interesting coil design to produce a monopole magnetic field or a pseudo monopole right well we need tech this readily engineer able that&#x27;s demo it is it is that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d loved about it because it&#x27;s a really simple design and it can be easily made I&#x27;m gonna build it in just a few days here I just got a run over to storage and grab the wire I&#x27;m back on here I&#x27;m back on oh hey welcome back step away for a few minutes but it&#x27;s fine yeah I&#x27;m going to be signing off soon here but yeah so that&#x27;s why I like Mike McCulloch stuff and and and he&#x27;s got quite a number of guys like us out there are these other research groups even people at universities real serious about this a lot of people writing who already took the time off with with the Cova 19 locked down to write up some grants to actually get research money to actually build devices and study this effect further so I think this could be very well be the start of you know inertial drives and understanding how to build a neural quantized inertial Drive mechanisms and so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping for if 2020 could be the you know start of that maybe some good could actually come out of this whole pandemic and and and there&#x27;s this whole Colvin 19 disaster and everything that&#x27;s happened so yeah I mean it&#x27;s the the experimentation and research is accelerating we always have a hiatuses between my jumping from one experiment to the next one we get negative results you know times and we&#x27;re finally just putting things on the shelf for a little while until we get a better understanding or we just completely right the idea off because we were able to replicate it faithfully and I just didn&#x27;t work but uh we&#x27;re always jumping around and right now I&#x27;m kind of in-between experiments with the ion craft and Wayne is still continuing ously working on other ideas and so is so it&#x27;s now so we&#x27;ve got other people that are actively pursuing that as well which is not all start our discussion tonight&#x27;s really really got me intrigued they&#x27;re about the multi multiple layers of dielectric and that sort of thing oh yeah very much so man did we get into some stuff yet yeah I&#x27;m seeing some some you know cross referencing all these different devices have come across over the years like going back to the what Bill biddies crappy capacitor like way back in the year what was that website like from 2000 or so thousand yeah yeah that and that dialogue there and TV net and all those good old yeah yeah and then serranos patented device from 1999 and with the overlapping plates it&#x27;s hard to believe it was that far back and like nothing nothing has really been done with it since then yeah this whole time how much some guy got that guy spent on a world patent and uh no I don&#x27;t know I mean it might have been many thousands of dollars at least his wife must have been pretty upset with them I don&#x27;t know if she was married at that times good whatever it&#x27;s quite a ways quite a time ago and use that I don&#x27;t know man I I always wonder about Serrano because it&#x27;s um it seems so promising and it incorporates so many of the right things and he has a working theory looted in the patent which does mostly make sense I mean it doesn&#x27;t include all the mechanisms that explained it verbally that you would need but allegedly it&#x27;s covered in the equations so I don&#x27;t know I would love this test Serrano stuff but having all these various well assembled dielectrics has been a constant bit of trouble and there&#x27;s only so much that you can do with mixing various materials and powders into epoxy and then making your own capacitor plates becomes a point where you need a press and you need a oven in properly making ceramics as a necessity not an option and I think that&#x27;s with some of that stuff that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at is we need we need better capability of producing materials that actually have the properties required by these patents so there&#x27;s the thing that I&#x27;ve mulled over in my mind about the difference between you know like using the right kind of materials in dielectrics and that whole thing I&#x27;ve thought a lot about the nuclear spins and all that and how that might have some effect and but then there&#x27;s also just the pure field type effects like if you look at the Hutchinson effect where you just had what was it a couple of Tesla coils and a Van de Graaff generator and he was able to levitate bowling balls and this kind of crazy stuff and he had what a wild SAP so that&#x27;s just like a pure that&#x27;s just like a pure field effect rate in space we&#x27;ve got these these uh overlapping yeah you ant you build these longer to manually light photon interacts so there&#x27;s that and they&#x27;d like altering a region of space by these fields and then there&#x27;s the effects of certain materials within say just an electric field as anyone is well aware of the biofuel Brown effect and that kind of approach so and if faman is correct and in the moment and being stored in the field which I&#x27;m absolutely sure he is then there&#x27;s quite a lot of potential in that direction specifically and it&#x27;s engineer ball with what we have you should explain a little bit more about that I don&#x27;t know if you want to get into it here but I might take a little too long at this point in the show but I would like to we could probably do a whole show just just on that and and the various technologies that relate to it because there&#x27;s so much there yeah but signal for another night two hours hey let&#x27;s name let&#x27;s name just name all them let&#x27;s take up just the last bit to name all the scientists that you&#x27;ve researched or anything any scientist that has any kind of anti-gravity or other research worth studying that you&#x27;d like to mention I&#x27;ll start with Bernard haish who led me to Todd SC Otto he&#x27;s written papers with Eric Davis and he&#x27;ll put off also Alfonso Rueda a name that appears on a lot of this you know you can this is how I find a lot of the other scientists and physicists with a lot of these other ideas too is by looking at papers that they&#x27;ve co-written and co-authored together todd deseado was a member of our group he&#x27;s not been very active he&#x27;s got a lot of other stuff going on but he&#x27;s got some really interesting theories and other stuff also Jack star fought he is another guy that I kind of follow because he&#x27;s interesting to watch and put make some interesting Prost&#x27;s from time to time and he&#x27;s doing a lot of stuff with this stardrive dot org I feel free to butt in and interrupt me with any any in now to be honest with you I don&#x27;t really have a list of I don&#x27;t really have a list of names that I follow because I really don&#x27;t follow the names what I what I do is jump around all over the place and follow the experiments and if I can&#x27;t find some like tangible evidence of experiments by a certain name I really don&#x27;t care much about what they&#x27;re doing so what I have is a whole list of like experiments and documents that have all kinds of names hundreds of them and I couldn&#x27;t begin to knit list you off who was the most important at each of them all yeah I just know the data yeah yeah like if you were to look at say you know everything that Tom Bearden is written and then everything let&#x27;s say dr. Paul Laviolette is written I mean it&#x27;s very different very different theoretical approaches so on that note this is this is a good channel for for experimentation just pure experimentation the old scientist was a good one where L saw any any other channels or the join the technicians obviously yeah I&#x27;ll actually be certain a new channel specifically regarding this in a very short order here because I want to I want to separate some of those more public projects with this kind of fringe research because it is a totally different audience but I would like to very much start a channel that includes that and perhaps even the ion plan so we&#x27;ll see but that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s gonna be happening and pretty soon here because of getting video data video footage that I need to compile together and narrate and explain what&#x27;s going on to people and it just takes time right now I&#x27;m kind of jumping the gun on doing more experiments and less that&#x27;s videotaping so that I can just get to a point where I have something more impressive show cuz a little motion is something but a lot of motion that&#x27;s what people want to see yeah I focused on just I focus on just doing just trying to get the experiments as is on video I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t spend much time on the editing on my channel which is a small travel fail forward research laughter I put my my experiments that I think someone worth sharing even stuff that doesn&#x27;t work yeah as we&#x27;ve been talking about never underestimate the value of a negative result because at least you know what doesn&#x27;t work and I can stop wasting your time on it yeah yeah yep exactly I like it well serve I&#x27;ve been researching I&#x27;ve been I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of research into this polariton stuff basically negative mass the idea you know physics creating negative mass and the way they do it is with these you know condensate these condensed matter states of polariton x&#x27; which is like trapped light is there is there any way to work with player tons without the requirement of supercooled solute so this guy right here this is uh this is a recent paper from I think this was Claude polar know this isn&#x27;t Club board this is uh from China I think coherent propulsion with negative mass fields in a photon photonic lattice you might be able to find this was from he optics letters 2019 but they&#x27;d basically they build a photonic lattice get them all all these photons entangled and they they built a way of creating you know negative mass field propulsion using you know a wall of photons using a wall of code you know entangled light and this is exactly what some of the some of the physics and stuff that I&#x27;ve been talking about you know this is where I&#x27;m saying the research has really been at with squeezed light let me go back to that you know look up 30 years of squeezed light and these squeezed quantum states the idea of that basically it&#x27;s a whole it&#x27;s a whole theory of gravitation as well because the idea is that gravity is caused by information blocking by horizons that&#x27;s what Mike Alex theory is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s yeah could you explain that in layman&#x27;s terms because I&#x27;ve heard you talk about that too and I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve had sort of a contradictory idea in my head about certain things that you&#x27;re explaining so I would love to hear it and a little bit of a simpler term if you could so the idea is that you know that gravity is actually mediated by photons that photons essentially are gravitons they carry they carry the gravitational information and that you know when a photon is absorbed or radiated or reflected by a mass it it loses some of the some of the spatial information is lost over time and that causes a little bit of the space between these objects to discipline to gradually like shrink or disappear through this photonic interaction that basically like all things are moving charges and moving charges constantly create photons ER or electromagnetic fields which keep this sort of which is sort of this entangled communication of the network or the web or the matrix will have you and that matte masses only generate gravity or create mass by their you know position in the web or the matrix which over two overtimes an iteration slowly you know make make sections of the matrix disappear according to the you know an object an internal mass it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s mat its mass energy or its horizon its its arising mostly that was an excellent excellent explanation and all of that made sense but then we get the two terms that I think still I don&#x27;t understand how they fit into this and that is what&#x27;s the horizon specifically and how does a parrot on fit into this am theory so there is that we have masses as as as like these as these objects in space which are blocking information and reflecting photons creating grab creating gravitons of creating gravity through their interaction with the matter so the idea is that when you start squeezing light and and and creating these these processes around around your craft so you create this coherent beam of squeezed States and what that does is it it essentially there&#x27;s a couple different theories okay I understand why I was confused now yeah so one is that one is that one is that that these these these states are essentially creating negative mass when negative mass is just a weird concept the other idea is that is that basically it&#x27;s cool hearing this matter to a single a single wavelength so that these photons interacting with it basically make it invisible to to gravity to gravitons two photons so that photons no longer interact with it so that in the information isn&#x27;t blocked by no longer blocked over the object so let me explain this in layman&#x27;s terms if I&#x27;m understanding it correctly so basically what you&#x27;re saying is that the name for this squeezed volumetric space you could you could be calling this negative mass because it&#x27;s negative mass is effectively when anything enters it that has some some mass instead of decelerating it accelerates which would make sense if it&#x27;s suddenly passing a much larger volume of space in the same amount of time it would seem to be to us on the outside frame of reference gaining energy so the idea is that gravity comes from this mix up of information that when you have this mat when you have mass in just this random arrangement as photons come and interact with it it creates it creates gravitation through this loss of information it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like a blocking of information so it&#x27;s a loss of information it&#x27;s when information is lost because it&#x27;s blocked so that way the so the correcting function of the way everything that writes out this way that this sort of simulation self regulates itself or the error correcting code happens is that you know it creates gravity is like this error action in the code basically and that if you it&#x27;s through a blocking of information so that if you entangle and all that information and cohere it and make that that blocking invisible so that the information can pass through and in Oh longer blocks the idea is that that&#x27;s kind of nit what negative mass is because is it&#x27;s the opposite of mass it&#x27;s basically it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a passing of information it&#x27;s instantaneous you know superconducting of information rather than this blockage of information that&#x27;s my interpretation of it I mean yeah it just leaves me with the question of you know wouldn&#x27;t the wouldn&#x27;t a mask that completely blocks or ignores information just just be a neutral mass whereas a mass that not only blocks information but radiates it out would in fact be a negative mass because it would be energy pop it would be providing more energy out to its environment that I could possibly interact with I guess maybe I&#x27;m not understanding that completely but hey I&#x27;ll read up on it and get myself more into get it I need to I need to read up on my explanation it&#x27;s also I also woke up in the middle of the night and decided to do a stream and it&#x27;s not like 5:00 in the morning so yeah same sorry I have some notes on this too that I really really need to read or read up on and and and get like precise on this but this is where I think the ultimate you know it&#x27;s a nanotechnology and and understanding light and how and how photons in the universe with itself through photon and this arguably really are they detecting gravitational waves or real gravity that&#x27;s arguable it&#x27;s we&#x27;re an interesting point in science and and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s only gonna get more interesting from here but I agree I agree with your you guys his approach is just really looking at experiments and things we can test and I got a limited capacity to process all this information and there&#x27;s a thousand and one theories out there that you could spend a lifetime trying to comprehend but at the end of the day which is gonna get you there and I have to go with Feynman on this one yeah it&#x27;s like I understand my limits as a human being and I understand that there&#x27;s only so many things I can pick up and it takes time to do them all so if there&#x27;s anything I have to focus on what can I actually use kind of gotta draw your line somewhere and be humble enough to say I can&#x27;t do it all and I can&#x27;t do even a fraction of it but I can do some things like they say if you can&#x27;t explain it to a third grader you don&#x27;t really understand it I always love that yes well some of this stuff so hard to explain it you know like it gets super complicated because you&#x27;re building upon all kinds of knowledge that you know expecting this third grader and I already have so it&#x27;s like you should already know what a cork is and you should already know you know what you know right well missus can you can you explain the principles either using an analogy or basically including all the information in your explanation that they would need to get a visual grass because I think a lot of this comes down to can you visualize it or can you comprehend it in your mind in some way and oh and so much of this stuff has nothing to do no visual counterpart it&#x27;s it&#x27;s mostly mathematical it has to do with subatomic structures that we see the properties of but quite frankly can&#x27;t even view directly and it gets rather complicated to try to explain using layman&#x27;s terms but I I think that the principles can be whittled down into some kind of analogy that would make sense and the water analogy for electricity worked for a really really long time and still does for somebody that&#x27;s just starting out and there are so like there it&#x27;s necessary to have these analogies they&#x27;re wrong if you if you look at them verbatim but they&#x27;ll get you at least into the idea where you can begin to conceptualize right it&#x27;s just like heavy sides equations yeah they&#x27;re terrible when it comes down to this kind of engineering but if you&#x27;re an engineering you just want to build a working circuit that involves magnetics or electric fields and they&#x27;re fantastic let&#x27;s say that was about uh let&#x27;s probably about it for me it was a good show how do you guys think yeah I&#x27;m gonna go make some breakfast and then it&#x27;s catch up on sleep and yeah let&#x27;s I&#x27;m gonna read up on this for the next couple days and really get it when I do the next stream I&#x27;m gonna have a much better explanation of this squeeze light stuff and yeah I&#x27;ll be looking forward to that for sure and this Blair it&#x27;s on condensates and all that crap that I&#x27;ve been talking about that Marc Kant doesn&#x27;t understand it all you&#x27;ve been told where to put your poll aritaum&#x27;s yeah oh yeah oh I&#x27;m gonna keep working on polariton sand you know when Mark and Amy figure out anti-gravity and or you know have disclosure ready in a package then you know to show us with a device and and and everything then you know we&#x27;ll have something to look at I&#x27;ll be patiently at what you know but I won&#x27;t be holding my breath for it no but I really I&#x27;ll be honest I hate that I hate the term Polara tongs because I think it just adds layers complexity does something that could be explained without that term at all but I guess if you&#x27;re trying to as most science does come up with words that can explain a large number of things with one term that pretty much does it I still hate it yeah you know I have my opinions on things what did I you agree with the principles completely yeah all right we&#x27;ll figure this out one way or the other and if we all agreed on everything we would never get anywhere so that&#x27;s why like we all that&#x27;s why I like everyone here wants to yes we can agree without throwing a tantrum and each other within this group because the adults are talking today yeah or if you don&#x27;t feel if I don&#x27;t believe you it&#x27;s not you&#x27;re not seeing it you&#x27;re not understanding and I hate that and when somebody if you don&#x27;t believe somebody and they accuse you of not understanding their perspective quite frankly they fail to explain it in a way that you can understand and it&#x27;s always their job to explain it to you two seconds your job if you&#x27;re trying to convince somebody of your theory to explain it to them yeah and it&#x27;s not their fault if they don&#x27;t get it it should be the goal of like beings getting ourselves more educated and becoming smarter ourselves not-not-not yeah convincing other people how smart we are yeah we need to still we all start out as students but there&#x27;s a point at which we&#x27;ve acquired enough knowledge and experience even if all we&#x27;ve learned is 1/10 as two thousand and one things that don&#x27;t work we need to go from students to teachers at some point so that we can at least convey this knowledge and I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s really any other way to avoid having think these concepts that well the only way to become a teachers remain a student you have to remain a student continuously absolutely but we also have to take some effort to take our conceptual ideas that exist inside of our heads and put them into words conveyed in a language that other human beings can understand and that part can be rather difficult yeah that&#x27;s a stuff way your explanations are elegant and straightforward why I&#x27;d really impressed by that I&#x27;m used to thinking in a in a mechanical way because that&#x27;s my background as some mechanical engineering so I that&#x27;s the kind of my approach is the terminology can get really convoluted I mean if you talk about like gravity waves longitudinal waves electrogravitic waves you know I don&#x27;t even know what to call it you know there&#x27;s all these different terms based energy tensor is a spacetime girl tonight I&#x27;ve heard scalar waves you&#x27;re that one yes scalar waves are pretty much but the other ones on about and Louise&#x27;s you know so at the end of the day it&#x27;s got to be all the same wave you know the same shock wave or whatever exactly what what really are we looking at with all these different terms they&#x27;re just describing different angles of interaction or different modes of interaction between the same thing on the electric field that has a direction with some amount of dye fraction going on where there&#x27;s a stronger spot in a weaker spot that&#x27;s like really everything outside the core of what&#x27;s all going on here and even call that electric field the photon if that electric field has particularly perhaps properties you&#x27;d call it a claret on but it&#x27;s all the same stuff right and it&#x27;s time variant then we can do stuff with it based on time variations and different frequencies and modes and in it it gets quite complex real real fast and start adding multimode signals and everything that&#x27;s going on in this universe it&#x27;s quite a bit na but it&#x27;s based on very simple principles yeah it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just oscillations between 0 &amp; 1 at different different frequencies it&#x27;s all frequencies and and vibration yeah absolutely all right folks we should probably head it up for the night we definitely need to do another one of these again and we&#x27;ve got to get more people on our team so some of the people in the chat I&#x27;ve seen tonight I would like to speak with I don&#x27;t know how uh how open they are willing to do that or what format we should choose but it will be nice with some of the people in the chat send you an email Jeremy yeah you can come talk off offline or on air you know if there&#x27;s different people that participating in different levels that at all different levels on this team so join up link up and share your knowledge and ideas with us we&#x27;d love to learn from you</p>
