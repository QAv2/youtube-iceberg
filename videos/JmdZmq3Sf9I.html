investigator in oper okay welcome to the oerman report I&#x27;m your host private investigator Ed oerman and you can find me at opman investigations and digital forensic Consulting if you just email me directly at oerman investigations now our guest today this is a historic interview Our Guest today is William Hamilton and he is the creator of the slot.com the promise software uh you may have heard the story we&#x27;ve done some shows about this in the past with uh Ted Rubenstein just trying to explain this complicated story that at one point was described as the octopus uh by a journalist Danny Casello who uh met an untimely demise uh but this is the first interview with William Hamilton the man at the center of this story uh Mr William Hamilton are you there yes I am thank you so much thank you so much for coming on the show I I know we&#x27;ve already been talking for about 20 minutes so I know there&#x27;s going to be some great content here uh before we get into the whole inslaw promise octopus this whole crazy story that you&#x27;ve lived your life firsthand tell us about yourself who is William Hamilton I&#x27;m the uh third oldest of 12 children my wife and I have six adult children now of course and 17 grandchildren I graduated from the University of Notre Dame as an English literature major and uh went to work for NSA where I worked for seven years and uh then I I uh went to work for a public accounting firm in their management consulting department and uh answered a request for proposals to develop a case management software system for local prosecutor&#x27;s office in DC which I named and it was um well thought of and it was soon uh used in many state and local prosecutors offices across the country your audio dropped there for a second you named it inslaw the the company yeah and the was named insula or promise no promise promise okay yeah your audio dropped there for a second okay so then you you received a a you answered a a request for a bid to design this software that&#x27;s right and then I named it promise yeah gotcha now I often I was wondering this now at the time cuz clearly now you know you&#x27;re a Savvy guy you&#x27;re in touch with all these people uh Elliot Richardson and you know he was attorney um but at the time how did you get that contract did you hire lobbyist or you just like off the shelf just no really it just off the shelf it was I was interested in the courts I thought about going to law school and so it was something I I had a uh pre-existing interest in not not not promise but and not case management but courts the legal system right you know and uh so I just wrote The Proposal and uh it the request for proposal came from the DC government because the local DC does not have home rule and the local prosecutor is a division of the US attorney&#x27;s office and so the DC government&#x27;s office of crime analysis issued the request for proposals I wrote The Proposal it was a competitive procurement and we won it and it was like a $10 million contract right no not that that was much smaller okay and and um the uh so the uh after it was finished I went to work for the US attorney&#x27;s office as an independent contractor to try to improve the software because it was the first time anybody had done something like this and so there were a lot of opportunities to make it better you know okay uh and how old were you at that time well I had I had worked already seven years after graduated from college I guess you graduated from college around early 20s right right about 30 years old is what I was figuring yeah yeah probably that sounds right okay so you&#x27;re working for the US attorney&#x27;s officer as a contractor um right and you designed the software and I guess that&#x27;s where the issues came in with the the litigation right that they claimed that they owned it oh no I think that was all baloney okay they they they uh well I the most telling thing is one of the lawyers who represented inslaw rodri Hills we had retained because he had been the he was a very prominent business lawyer and uh we needed to get the justice department to agree that when the a of the justice department liquidated but under the Carter Administration yeah the one that had been financing the development of Promise was called the US law enforcement assistance Administration when the Carter Administration decided to liquidate that agency we rodri Hills to figure out what do we do because you have to continue to invest money in software or loses its value over time you know sure and and the uh the Law Enforcement syst Administration was disappearing so where is the money going to come from for the inevitable upkeep and upgrade you know and so rodri Hills went to the justice department and asked the deputy attorney general Stan Morris for a letter confirming that the justice department would not object the end law uh creating a for-profit proprietary derivative of the software containing privately financed enhanc ments and Licensing it to users for a fee across the country and um the justice department took five months thinking about it so Rod Hill said you can&#x27;t let them hold hostage the future of your company and uh so he said I I think whether they like it or not the copyright law gives in law exclusive as the author of every version of Promise the exclusive rights copyright rights to the software Goa and I think I should have our copyright lawyers at leam watkinson Hills uh do a re a legal opinion on that subject and that he did that and uh they confirmed that was true and then Rod Hills uh said I think I should have our copyright lawyers deliver a copy of this legal opinion to the top copyright lawyer at the justice department so that everybody understands the law he was a very smart lawyer you know and so he did it the top copyright lawyer&#x27;s name was veto DPO in the Civil Division of the justice department and uh he not surprisingly agreed it is the law you know and but most people most lawyers in fact wouldn&#x27;t know something that technical you know sure and um the amendments to the US copyright law spelled all of this out years ago but but most people as I&#x27;m saying would never have had an occasion to learn any of that stuff even long and I guess when you&#x27;re going up against the federal government even if you have the law on your side if they want something you&#x27;re it&#x27;s an uphill battle right yeah and it particularly if they uh if they to give you a a clue at the um under the Brooks act which was named after Congressman Jack Brooks the any agency of the executive branch of the federal government that ever wanted to buy a piece of software had to apply in in advance to the general Services Administration GSA and get what&#x27;s called a delegation of procurement authority to do so because the GSA had exclusive authority over the federal government&#x27;s purchase of computer software for years and the uh so the at one point the general Accounting Office did a report criticizing GSA and criticizing the Office of Management budget under the Carter Administration for failing to provide leadership to federal agencies to stop Reinventing the software wheel and start purchasing prepackaged application software products because every time you if it&#x27;s a common function of the government like case management or Personnel it&#x27;s kind of silly to commission someone to develop a software from scratch each time it&#x27;s very expensive to do that and error prone also seems too that they&#x27;re they&#x27;re the crappiest softwares out there you know um like with the whole thing with the what was that the healthcare.gov and when it first came out was Obama&#x27;s former buddy you know his college roommate or know it&#x27;s always like a deal like that which is how I wondered how you got this deal it it seems like rodri Hills he was plugged in to get this kind of deal pushed through yeah was very smart lawyer yeah like Elliot Richardson was Elliot Richardson by the way if the audience doesn&#x27;t know that&#x27;s the Saturday night Massacre from Watergate is Elliot Richardson who designed yeah under protest resigned yeah he a lot of integrity and very bright just like they we were blessed to have several extremely bright lawyers with Integrity you know kind of an unusual combination especially in DC yeah with this Bunch okay yeah so then then take us through this now you&#x27;re going back and forth with the government about the do you own it don&#x27;t you own it do you have the copyright on you allowed to sell it uh what happens next oh what what we didn&#x27;t really have to go back and forth the uh the because he got this a letter from the deputy attorney general uh office confirming that they don&#x27;t object to what we&#x27;re planning to do okay and that was after the internal legal opinion I told you about from Brad Hills law firm and after they had given a copy of that internal legal opinion to veto dietro and after unbeknownst to us VTO dietro had confirmed it in a internal legal opinion to the top uh internal contracts lawyer at the justice department where he explained what the law is the copyright law and how it affects inslaw copyright rights and that insw had exclusive copy rights under the copyright law as the author of every version of promise just what Hills had said you know and um that the government&#x27;s rights were limited to whatever data rights they had negotiated in the individual contracts with ins law they never negotiated any so they they had no rights they never sought to negotiate any you know and but it it was an invaluable thing to have this veto de Pietro who would I had never heard of you know um issue a internal legal opinion we didn&#x27;t even know he did it and we found out about it in Discovery litigation Discovery in the bankruptcy court and justi has tried to keep that copy of that legal opinion from us because it&#x27;s pretty dispositive you know and uh the court we did a motion to compel production to the bankruptcy judge and he granted production and that&#x27;s how we know about it how did it wind up in bankruptcy how did you wind up in bankruptcy court because the government um withheld millions of dollars under that $10 million contract right to put promise in major cities of us the US attorney&#x27;s offices and big cities across the country and they withheld on purpose millions of dollars in order to force us into chapter 11 and then then we assume they were going to force us into liquidation there could be an auction of the software and it could be purchased by friends of the administration in power wow because it could be make a fortune you know gotcha and the the thing I&#x27;ve started to tell you but I uh got distracted from it is that the um when GAO critici I told you they had issued a report criticizing the lack of leadership from GSA and OMB on this subject particularly on case management software me meaning the leadership don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel each time by prepackaged application software products gsa&#x27;s number two guy the Reagan presidential appoint at the GSA who was number two this was like an 82 or something like that early in the in the Reagan Administration he wrote to the the way that works you probably know when GSA does a report they send a draft of it to any agency that they&#x27;re criticizing like GSA and om and give them a chance to defend themselves you know and then they publish in the GAO report whatever these agencies write to them you know and so the number two guy at GSA said we agree with the recommendation of GAO but with an important provision you the software has to be engineered right from the beginning for ease of customization or the whole thing won&#x27;t work they said such just like inslaw did with the promised software that software is capable of being used to track anything that&#x27;s needed to be tracked in the federal government so this is the presidential appointee who&#x27;s number two at GSA somehow knows all this stuff which tells you something right how&#x27;s he know all of that it&#x27;s all true but he he knows it because he&#x27;s seeing all of these illicit uses copyright infringing uses of our software being approved by his agency GSA through delegations of procurement Authority so basically they were using the ends slaugh uh software in other departments and other agencies other than it was designed for and uh licensed I guess by you right okay right and the the uh at one point Ed um Elliot Richardson one day introduced my wife and me to someone who was knowledgeable about uh software being used for intelligence applications and around what time was that what year was that about I&#x27;d have to try and figure that out how old were you then around that time when you got had that invitation because you&#x27;re 30 when you designed the software how old were around that time when Richardson introduced you to this intelligence information probably probably in my 30s somewhere okay so not too many years down the road gotcha no and and um I forgot where I was going with that well no the Richardson he informed you that the the software was being used for intelligence gathering what yeah and and he said this is before I I knew anything about what they were up to you know and he said lock heat aircraft inslaw a lot of money and I thought to myself what what the hell were they using the Lo aircraft bar and over time I found out that Lo aircraft had a contract to develop the F-117 Stealth fighter and the contract was jointly funded by the CIA and the Air Force and the Lockheed aircraft vice president in charge of the development of the1 17 steal fighter later co-authored a book about the great success of the development of that F-117 Stealth fighter and particularly remarkable database software for the cockpit which which the the author&#x27;s name is Ben rich and the book is called Skunk Works oh yeah I&#x27;m familiar with that book Ben Rich yeah yeah well he he goes into some detail he claims that a couple of his engineers at the Skunk Works in Burbank California came to him up came to him one day and said we got an idea why don&#x27;t we develop some sophisticate he may not have used that word sophisticated but it is very sophisticated database software for the cockpit that will guide the airplane automatically to minimize its exposure to ground fire and missiles and stuff like that and get it to where it&#x27;s supposed to go automatically and he went into great detail about it Ben Rich did in the book and he said it was so successful that the Air Force systems command in Dayton Ohio later bought a Global license from Lock heat aircraft put it in the cockpit of every us attack aircraft that&#x27;s a lot of money probably right yeah this is based on your software and Elliot Richardson I guess he knew this information because he was a defense secretary at one point he was yeah I mean I don&#x27;t think he knew it as defense secretary but he of course was very bright guy and a lot of people uh respected him like we did did you have a relationship with him before you retained him to to represent you no what happened was um Rod Hills introduced me to Goa and uh he Hill said that we have to to get uh an independent decision by the board of the not for-profit that it has fulfilled its use full life and it needs to uh give for-profit successor company this is because of the demise of that agency that financed everything you know the liquidation of it by the Carter Administration right and and uh so he said you can&#x27;t but you can&#x27;t make that decision you have to get independent directors and so Hill&#x27;s got Elliot Richardson and uh the guy who had been White House Council under lynon Johnson I can&#x27;t think of his name right now a famous lawyer another one you know and Cal Kier to agree to comprise the board of the not for-profit and make the decision which they did it wasn&#x27;t a difficult decision without Lea you got to do something because there&#x27;s otherwise you the software will die if you don&#x27;t don&#x27;t find a way to pay for the inevitable upkeep and upgrade of the software now how how are you funding all this how are you funding this these legal fees were they taking a percentage of the future uh contingency or how are you funding all this no we we just we paid we just paid for them under our operating of the company and none of them overcharged us and all they&#x27;re all quite decent people Elliot Richards of course and Rod Hills we very lucky to have such good people you know who were not a corruptible gotcha so when did you first get wind that they were they had this back door in there and it was being used for intelligence is that the next next big point to the story um I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t remember anymore Ed there&#x27;s so much that&#x27;s gone by gone on in this thing so I I can&#x27;t uh at the moment I can&#x27;t um think of when that would have happened and the uh so I I just I&#x27;m not being difficult with you I just don&#x27;t remember well would you feel better if we took like a half hour break or something like that or or is there something else okay then no I I may not come up with it for days well I&#x27;ll come back in days trust me I want to hear this story okay but but ultimately you do start hearing that uh uh there was a back door and was being used for intelligence purposes uh well let me give let me give you an example of how of how we heard yeah that you&#x27;ll find amusing I think the it&#x27;s at one point I get a I was contacted by email and Telephone by the official publisher of of the the publisher of an official commemorative book for the 50th anniversary of the US Air Force and it was 12 months before the 50th Anniversary that he contacted me and he said what the anniversary is about 50th year of the US Air Force and he said uh By Invitation Only we&#x27;d like to invite inlaw to uh take out a full page ad in the official publication and he explained that insw Microsoft and Oracle were among the largest software the US software vendors with the largest installed bases of their products in the US Air Force Israel had never sold it to the Air Force and never author anyone else to sell it to the Air Force but he&#x27;s telling us Oracle Microsoft and islaw are the leading software vendors with penetration in the air force of course that made no sense right yeah and um then when after Elliot Richardson passed away um Admiral Murphy said the first thing you need to do is get another out standing lawyer like Elliot Richardson because government officials will regard it as their patriotic duty this is Admiral Murphy talking to look Ina&#x27;s lawyer in the eyes and lie and so he introduced me to judge William Webster one of his friends who had been the head of the FBI and the head of the CIA sure under the regular Administration and 3 days after judge after uh Admiral Murphy and I had spent hours with judge Webster he called his friend uh Admiral Murphy and said I&#x27;m not confident that the George W Bush Administration is going to be willing to settle and I&#x27;d have to be doing it on a conention cc basis right because in doesn&#x27;t have any money and it wouldn&#x27;t be fair for me to do that to my partners if I have severe doubts the government&#x27;s going to be willing to settle you know so he declined to do it and so then uh Admiral Murphy introduced Nancy my wife and me to uh boyon gray who had been White House counil and um when edma Murphy was Chief of Staff to Vice President George H W bush in the Administration he had hired bin as the lawyer for Vice President Bush and then bin stayed on as the White House counsel when George HW Bush became president and so we we Nancy and I met with uh Murphy and Bo gray and boy says to Bo gray someone needs to be the John Adams of the insw case and represent insw simply because it&#x27;s the right thing to to do will you do it Boon and Boon says can I get paid and so after the meeting I I said right away well we can pay you on a contingency fee basis and uh because obviously we couldn&#x27;t pay him any other way you know and the um so Murphy and ncy and I had lunch after this meeting with boen and Murphy was laughing he said you know because I was Chief of Staff to Vice President Bush I had to review and approve the financial statements of all the people who worked for Bush including boen and he says he&#x27;s one of the wealthiest people in the country he&#x27;s the heir to the RJ rynolds tobbacco Fortune so he he was find it amusing that he was asking can I get paid you know they even stiff you with the bill for lunch these guys too when you go with these cases sometimes you know did did agree to uh represent us of course he was kind of intimidated probably by Admiral Murphy&#x27;s having hired him in the first place years earlier you know and uh and then Bo got Stone walled by the government just like Elliot Richardson did you know they they just lie right and when we look back in hindsight now so illegal when we look back in hindsight now we can see these Freedom of Information Act documents like the one about Bill weld we were talking about off the air were were they&#x27;re talking about $500 million uh in sales through kogi and being um laundered being walked through BCCI the bank of international there you know so there was money out there man you know where was that M did you ever find out who got that money Friends of the administration in power right there there was a you probably I may have set this to you but um at one point Nancy um had an opportunity to meet with senator Paul sarban of Maryland I was out in California attending the deposition of a federal judge in our case isw taking his deposition in his courtroom you know a guy who was involved in the misconduct when he was at the when he was the number two guy at the justice department and by then he was a federal district judge in San Francisco d d l Jensen and uh so I was out there and couldn&#x27;t go to the uh meeting with sarban that Nancy had done her homework and uh had written to sarbanes and talked about his role in demanding accountability during the Watergate scandal apparently did apparently he did a lot of good work trying to force an accountability on the Watergate scandal and so he was a logical person to take interest in his law you know and um he arranged for the chief investigator for Senator Biden Biden was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time right and he he arranged with Ronald the GR an africanamerican lawyer who was the chief investigator under Biden on the Senate Judiciary Committee to come see Nancy and me and try to help us because we&#x27;re getting stonewalled everybody is you know and lron had a source in the Criminal Division of the justice department so lran came down to see us at the behest of Senator SAR Bain the senior US senator in Maryland and we what we think it was going on including illegal sales of our software and uh what whatever we knew at that time which would be compared to today Elementary you know and um so lron says I&#x27;ve got a trusted source of 20 years who&#x27;s a senior career official in the Criminal Division of the justice department with a title and uh he&#x27;s asked me to pass on certain information to you and Nancy he said uh what you think happened did happen you&#x27;re not crazy only you don&#x27;t know squat about how dirty the inslaw case really is and if you ever learn half of it you&#x27;ll be sickened it&#x27;s a lot dirtier for the Department of Justice than Watergate was both in its depth its depth and its breath the Department of Justice has been compromised at every level on the insul case and so Elliot Richardson then wrote to Senator Biden the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and explained what his chief investigator had alleged and he said to him in the letter we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true obviously but it&#x27;s too important not to try to get to the bottom of this and for that we need need your help to bring your Chief investigator and his trusted Source from the Criminal Division and the justice department before a duly constituted body to be interrogated under oath and then in response to that letter he sent to to uh Senator Biden he gets a letter back from the chief investigator he whom he had not addressed you know yeah Ron L gron and he the letter from lron was Preposterous saying something was not true that that he had told us and Richardson that this information was off the Record and it could not be used which is just total baloney you know and so Elliot wrote not to L but to Biden again I have it in front of me first first he responds back to lron responds back because of his strong belief and the separation of powers Doctrine the chairman has a firm policy that the committee will not intervene in pending litigation and then a couple of paragraphs down any committee staff findings or any inferences drawn from the information developed as part of that investigation can only be used as part of the committee&#x27;s oversight process yeah and then richardon point out how ABD the whole statement was you know and but but Biden never answered Richardson and lron that&#x27;s the name of that African-American Chief investigator yeah told Nancy and me at the time I did not draft that letter and I did not sign it an aid to Biden drafted the letter and forged my signature L gron said that yeah is he alive today is he alive he&#x27;s alive yeah whether he will confirm whether he would confirm that I have my doubts it&#x27;s true what I&#x27;m telling you is true but he he suffered pretty badly he he um became ostracized over this and he quickly left the Senate Judiciary Committee staff and got a job in the House of Representatives on somebody&#x27;s staff and then he had to leave there right away they were out the put pain on him you know yeah to shut his mouth I think you know and um so whether he would confirm any of that I have my doubt well I&#x27;m sure yeah I&#x27;m sure he wouldn&#x27;t yeah yeah I&#x27;m telling you it&#x27;s all true you know and and I think he&#x27;s a as far as I can tell a decent and honorable guy but they put pressure on him that beyond what he could take you know and he he left he left the government I&#x27;m sure he wanted to work in the continue to work in the government and he couldn&#x27;t because of this thing and but it&#x27;s also revealing about Senator Biden yeah why wouldn&#x27;t he he&#x27;s a typ of guy who would normally want to salute La Richardson you know it&#x27;s kind of Richardson was good government always and the IT Mo most most people would want to be associated with him for their own self- Glory right and the for him for Biden to ignore Richardson is kind of counterintuitive but Mr Hamilton let me ask you a question now you&#x27;ve been living this thing a long period of Life have you seen any difference between the Democrats and Republicans as far as this deep corruption goes especially when the intelligence agencies are involved it&#x27;s a whole another level I&#x27;m sorry especially when the intelligence agencies are are involved right it&#x27;s a whole another level of corruption yes I agree with that and the uh no I i&#x27; I have no expectation of anything good happening because the uh I they get by with anything they want to get by with it&#x27;s only get worse classifi stuff it&#x27;s only getting worse yeah yeah now now did you ever receive any kind of Justice any kind of any kind of settlement any kind of any throwing up no not a penny not a penny just shut him up just shut up William hampson send him five million bucks 10 million bucks yeah no yeah well the the the uh nothing one of our lawyers who had worked uh in Central America I guess um it said the government can pay insult cash yeah they can&#x27;t do anything they damn Polie and it said it made no sense but the the uh we we had a friend of the family who was a very successful businessman who helped inlaw financially at one point and um he used to say to me when it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me why don&#x27;t they just pay insula off you know and it it the answer to that I think I&#x27;ve told you this I think but the came from Admiral Murphy and when when he when I contact him contacted him after the apparent change of heart on the part of the CIA director George Tennant about settling the CIA part of the insul case and I asked ad Mur what do you have any insight on why he did such an Abrupt change you know what happened you know and he said it&#x27;s my hunch bill I told you this that there&#x27;s another use of your software that you don&#x27;t know about and it involves something so seriously wrong that money alone cannot cure the problem and that unless and until inslaw the discovers that additional use of your software the government may never compensate the company and he said I&#x27;m confident you&#x27;re going to figure it out Bill and then within two weeks he dropped dead and um he had of course he would call me on the telephone and so I would not be surprised that NSA was monitoring all those conversation you know and he&#x27;s he was in a position to be quite lethal because as Chief of Staff to Vice President Bush Bush was in charge of all the under Reagan all of the secret stuff right and when Bush was the CI director his deputy director was Admiral Murphy so the Murphy was very smart guy and as you would expect a four-star retired Admiral not too much fearful you know and the uh I&#x27;m sure they the the people doing all of this misconduct regarded him as a real threat because he knew too much and at one point he he called me on the phone this was shortly before he died and he said I&#x27;m going to volunteer to serve ve his ins Law&#x27;s intelligence Guru and go with Bo and gray for his meetings with the government officials about settling the insult case just to keep the government officials honest which tells you he knows yeah that they know that he&#x27;s in on it you know and that he&#x27;s in a position to tell them when they&#x27;re lying you know sure and so if NSA I don&#x27;t know that NSA was monitoring it except that I know that I was told they were by the RCMP they monitoring our phone calls and T and uh emails and I have no doubt that would be true why wouldn&#x27;t they do it right now absolutely now U we only have a few minutes left by the way in this hour um got about 10 minutes left let me double check now um when he was saying to you that uh they&#x27;re using this for something so horrific that you don&#x27;t even want to know what it is do you think it was drug trafficking human trafficking terrorism I think it no I I of course could be wrong uh Ed but um I I can explain to you why I I&#x27;m pretty confident that it was it was the main core political blackmail version of Promise gotcha used by the White House select members of The White House National Security Council for blackmail operations against such targets as members of Congress and their staffs religious leaders whatever it takes you know gotta and uh you get dirt on them you know and then you blackmail them and that&#x27;s what I I never got a chance to ask Murphy whether I was correct he was confident I would figure it out and um the about two weeks before Casto was found dead that Charles Hayes that guy told you about Nancy Kentucky hillbilly type guy right who had worked for division d as a contractor for years he called me and because I had introduced him meaning Charles Hayes to Danny cero as a potential Source because he&#x27;s former CIA contractor you know and uh um Hayes called me and he said Castello is planning to visit a sensitive facility in Washington DC and it&#x27;ll get him killed he&#x27;s not listening to me he&#x27;s being very stron headed but if you have any influence with him you better use it because he&#x27;ll get killed and the the facility Hayes never told me uh where it was in DC but I called Danny Castello and passed on the warning and castelo said it&#x27;s a facility is under the control of George K Pender and I already knew from Castello that George K Pender was a former senior Cia clandestine operative who celero believed was the head of what celero called The Octopus a group of former US and Allied and Senior intelligence oper who primarily for their own personal financial gain undertook sensitive assignments from us intelligence sensitive and questionable you know and um so the facility was headed by the facility unnamed and then insol intelligence sources told me the facility was in a four-story townhouse near the White House on Jackson Place Northwest where a covert unit from the defense intelligence agency and the US Army telecommunications agency facilitated encrypted Communications access to the main core database at being administered at a computer center in Northern Virginia by the Federal Emergency Management agency ostensibly for handoff to uh the DIA and the US Army in the event of a national catastrophe and the imposition of Martial law and but in the meantime being accessed by select members of The White House National Security Council through help from DIA covert unit at that townhouse Dia and the Army Telecommunications who are providing encrypted Communications so that select members of the National Security Council staff could interrogate the main cord database system to get dirt on people they wanted to get for political blackmail you know it&#x27;s interesting this is right around that same period of time with Craig Spence and Henry Vincent and the white uh the uh DC call boy uh blackmail operation there all that stuff with uh Lawrence uh King Lawrence King that that whole bunch you know uh yeah was doing that homosexual C boy blackmail stuff you know yeah oh my God and and that&#x27;s what the whole Jeffrey Epstein stuff is about too right and my my view is and I don&#x27;t have any firsthand knowledge what I&#x27;m about to tell you but I I do understand a lot about us intelligence and I would regarded as a given that almost every government does this yeah you know and so it would be remarkably naive to assume it&#x27;s not happening yeah I hear you well especially when you know I had Henry Vinson on the show he was a guy who ran the uh the the funeral parlor credit card machine that this C booy operation was running through and he tells me he went to this apartment with Lawrence King and Craig Spence Craig Spence comes in with Secret Service bodyguards and it they they open up this closet door and there&#x27;s all this recording equipment all over the blackmail all over the place man so all high level high level stuff man yeah now in our second uh our second hour which is coming up we&#x27;re going to do a part two with Mr W you&#x27;re listening to William Hamilton who was the man behind the inslaw decom software the promise software the man inside with the Danny Castello Michael ranoso you hear these names octopus you hear this stuff all the time this is the guy he&#x27;s never done an interview before that&#x27;s how important this is uh now we have about two minutes left before and then we&#x27;re going to you know reboot and get back together again uh but what do you want to leave us with in this hour and just think when we come back we&#x27;re going to talk about Danny cello the all the the suspicious deaths around this whole thing what would you like to leave us with in this hour though well I um I have never believed Danny Casto committed suicide and thought that they they no sense and I had sources Ed yeah who one one day an army retired army criminal investigations division guy approached me when I was about to testify on the hill and said he wanted to provide some help and he turned out to be a gutsy character and he provided information to me from sources in the US Special Forces intelligence and they do a lot of the Dirty Work evidently for the CIA on this stuff and including when you need more blackmail stuff and you have to do some physical surveillance they do it and the uh they started funing Furnishing information first through the Army the retired army criminal investigations division officer and then directly to me and uh at one point the U Source had to break it off said he had been warned it would not be good for my health to continue to hear this stuff you know I know and and um anyway the uh it&#x27;s a pretty sorted story real quick before before we have to end this um David Korn made a comment that oh Danny castellaro was over his head just really quickly and like in one minute what do you think of that statement I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true okay they he uh I I thought I mean anybody would be over their head doing this kind of thing but but he was pretty smart guy and uh did not embellish I never saw anything like that and uh and he was had more courage than he should have had probably I can can relate to that too and and David Korn also too made a comment about one of my cases where he was just way off Bas we&#x27;re speaking to William Hamilton we&#x27;re going to come back with a part two maybe a part three he can come back anytime he wants this is golden information that we have to get down on record here in audio uh for history uh William Hamilton thank you so much we&#x27;re talking about the ins law.com software the promise software the octopus Danny castellaro uh and all
