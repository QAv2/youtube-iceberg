            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this is a channel for educational purposes and we usually look at uh late great theories of everything that uh have profoundly influenced my life helped me out in various ways and uh given me different perspectives a new paradigm and uh things that I&#x27;d like to spread out um and um today is our 350 first video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and this is uh a theory that a system of theory that was originated by one dwey B Larson back in the 20th century uh he died back in 1990 but not before he put out uh a dozen or more books and 50 or so articles um many talks and other ephemera on uh the reciprocal system uh the basic gist of the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe that is made entirely out of motion not matter or energy not force or anything anything else but motion and it specifically uh what he calls scalar motion uh this is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction and the model that you could use for uh for visualizing scalar motion is to take a balloon with dots on it when you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction um or they&#x27;re moving in all directions so that&#x27;s a scalar motion um you can also um note that the uh people who operate the Hubble telescope uh discovered that all of the distant Galaxy are moving away from each other so this is an example of a real world scalar motion uh unless you are willing to uh you know assume that our galaxy is at the center of this universe and it is not moving then our galaxy is also participating in that motion um and you can also think of it in terms of a clock the clock is always getting later and later and later but in no specific Direction This is what LaRon calls clock time clock time is a scalar Motion in time and uh it comes as a result of a kind of a far away view of time now for Larson um and then you know the the recession of the distant galaxies really what Larson would call clock space uh scalar Motion in space now um when lson uses this term scalar motion or motion uh motion for Larson is the relationship between space and time that sets up a reciprocal relationship between space and time hence the name the reciprocal system um system is based on this uh reciprocity between space and time space and time uh as reciprocals uh do not exist separately they only exist together in motion they have the same qualities uh that scalar aspect being one of them another being a three-dimensional as aspect uh what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time uh we&#x27;re accustomed to the idea of coordinate space not so much with coordinate time but uh by the reciprocal post that there is also a three-dimensional version of time and then also uh space and time uh only come in discrete units there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time you have to have a full unit before you have either one of those things and uh if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time then you have the speed of light what Larson calls unit speed 1 over 1 equal 1 and um you know time or time and space basically motion is a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator so speed is one of the most basic motions that we can reckon and speed is space over time the bicycle is moving at 12 milph 12 mil of space in 1 hour of time space over time so to the speed of of light is space over time one unit of space in one unit of time now those units are very small uh to make it up to your discrete unit but uh uh space is 4.56 * 10- 8 um M and time is 1.56 time 1.52 * 10-6 uh meters uh um seconds and uh but one unit of space and one unit of time is the speed of light and so in Larson system the speed of light is really like the background or the state of rest the zero point or the reference point the he calls it the progression of the natural reference system the universe is always moving outward at the speed of light in all directions now we are not able to always uh observe that because we are in a gravitational field uh which is the opposite motion of um this progression um gravitation is also a scalar motion but it&#x27;s an inward scalar motion uh so you would just take your same balloon and instead of blowing it up you would suck it in and uh all of the dots would be moving toward each other and uh but there would be no specific Direction you would only get a direction once you arbitrarily decided that one of those dots is actually motionless this is our reference point and then once you decided that one of the dots is motionless then you can determine the directions of of the other dots so the direction is an artifact of the reference system not of the motion itself and so these concepts of like a force field uh in gravity you know between two different bodies is fic is fiction uh in reality and it doesn&#x27;t come about until there is uh a reference point that has been determined which has nothing to do with the motion but has just to do with your choice of a reference point um so uh motion is a fraction with timer space is numerator space or time is in the denominator um you can have um time over space that would be energy it took me 1 hour to push that thing half a mile time over space matter turns out is time to the thir power over space to the third power acceleration space over time to the second power I dropped the ball out the window it fell at 32 m per 32 ft per second squared 32 ft of space in 1 second squar of time space over time squared Force is the conjugate of that time over space to the second power and um all of our basic scientific quantities are uh relationships between space and time they are all motions so uh again where you have Larson&#x27;s uh the speed of light is the background uh motion of the universe that makes sense because in a universe of motion the first thing that you have is motion um and uh you do not need to have a thing before you have the motion the motion itself uh the thing is actually also just a motion so the motion comes before the thing that&#x27;s moving and you have to be able to to at least accept that even if you maybe don&#x27;t understand it or if it seems absurd to you you have to be able to accept that for the time being before you can even pretend to think about uh studying the reciprocal system that&#x27;s just a part of it that motion comes before the thing that&#x27;s moving and the thing that&#x27;s moving is motion in and of itself now um if we have this speed of light boundary uh it&#x27;s a boundary between two different sectors of the universe the speed of light is the boundary that means that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light this goes against all of the um Legacy science especially Einstein&#x27;s dictum that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe therefore he has no idea about this what lson calls the cosmic sector where all speed is moving faster than the speed of light and then there&#x27;s the material sector that we&#x27;re more familiar with and that Einstein was comfortable with that is where the speed of the speed is less than the speed of light now fortunately um because of the reciprocal system we can tell that what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector though we may not be able to observe it directly uh and it&#x27;s a little bit uh opaque to our understanding what goes on in the cosmic sector is exactly the same uh generally as what is going on in the material sector because they are reciprocals of one another all you have to do is invert uh the uh relations of space and time so for example in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and you have clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and we&#x27;re comfortable with those two relations in general but then in the cosmic sector we have coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space the clock is um I mean space is getting farther and farther and farther apart so those are relatively unfamiliar relations but those uh that gives you a picture of what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector now in the material sector you have um matter and in the cosmic sector you have Cosmic matter what Larson refers to as um as Cosmic matter what Legacy science refers to as antimatter uh and this matter is generally form formed in within a a second set of boundaries in the reciprocal system and that is due to the discrete unit postulate if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space so that dictates that there within the material sector there is a small uh sub sector of that of that sector uh where uh you are dealing with um less than one full unit of space if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space and if you don&#x27;t have space then you only have time and uh so Larson refers to this as the time region and in the time region uh the relationships are again inverted and uh this is the realm of uh microscopic uh phenomena such as atoms and molecules and so too over in the cosmic sector um except with having to do with time if you have less than one unit of time then you don&#x27;t have time and if you don&#x27;t have time then you only have space and if you only have space um then it&#x27;s what Larson calls the space region and this is what you would refer to as you know not microscopic but maybe instantaneous or from very very short lengths of time um and not enough to make a full unit and within that within that realm again the relations invert um and you have uh the realm of cosmic atoms and Cosmic molecules now today uh we&#x27;re going to be looking at and trying to finish this paper uh called Quantum piie that was written by Dr Bruce paret who is one of Larson&#x27;s Chief uh followers and revisers uh especially after Larsson died in 1990 peret himself died back in 2020 but did some fantastic work along with Dr KV K uh kvk neru putting together uh what they call rs2 which is the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system kind of updating it modernizing it and uh kind of just getting some of the Kinks out of the system along with being still within the spirit of the reciprocal system and uh this article Quantum Pi is the fifth article um in his rs2 uh1 series 101 102 103 this is number 105 and uh we started this article two days ago so if you want to start at the at the beginning go back a couple days in the archives uh we are at a section right now that&#x27;s called acceleration and orbital velocity now now just uh for the uh just to refresh your memory uh Quantum Pi is basically saying that um uh looking at this other guy miles matys in his work and he was saying that pi equals 4 not 3.14159265 because Pi is um measured in a square not a circle Pi is the relationship between the circumference and the diameter but with a square the relationship between the circumference and the diameter is four but if you&#x27;re dealing with uh discrete units you ultimately once you get smaller and smaller and smaller you&#x27;re dealing with something that is a square uh it only becomes circular when those units become large and um pet is using the analogy of pixels on a screen um you could also use an analogy of a cartoon uh where you&#x27;re not seeing exactly what&#x27;s going on when you see pixels on a screen you can see a big circle but if you look at it really close it is actually Jagged like a stair step you know the the lines are straight but they&#x27;re so small that it looks like it&#x27;s curved and that&#x27;s the case with um the universe uh if it follows this discrete unit postulate um and it&#x27;s the same uh with uh the cartoon um we are what we&#x27;re what we see is a continuous progression but if you really broke down the universe into um you know single units of time which is 1.52 time 10us 16 seconds which is 6576 quadrillion uh you know units per second um if you you would what you would see is one frame at a time one still frame at a time just like a cartoon you you see one picture and then another picture that looks very much like the first one but there&#x27;s a slight change and then another one that looks very much like the the one before but a slight change and then when you look at them all in a sequence it looks like there&#x27;s just continuous motion but there isn&#x27;t it&#x27;s discreet and so lson uh pet here is really saying Pi uh ultimately does equal four when you break it down but uh and it never equals 3.14159265 blah blah blah uh exactly it that is the ideal value if you ever got to Infinity but you can never get to Infinity so Pi is just approaching it only can approach that value okay so we&#x27;re going to start reading acceleration and orbital velocity in a universe of motion everything is based based on the ratio of motion being speed s/ t or energy t/ s there are no unitless constants such as Pi so what are the units of Pi we normally represent the calculation of speed as distance per unit of time V = s/ T that would be velocity um but I guess he&#x27;s using velocity because it begins with a v inste s uh anyway where s is a spatial distance this can also be expressed as an acceleration for a quantity of time V equals a t or in natural units of space and time space over time equals space over time to the second power time time but going around the circumference of a circle is not the same thing as moving in a straight line which is what these equations represent circular motion is referred to as an orbital velocity or V to the 2 power if we treat our equation for circumference c = 2 pi r as the equation for orbital speed expressed in natural units of space and time we get c = 2i r or S the 2 power over t to the 2 power = s * T 2 power Time s * C circumference which equals 2 pi r or S the 2 power * T the 2 power or over T the 2 power equals s over T 2 power * s where the circumference is an orbital velocity the radius is a spatial distance and the value of 2 pi has units of acceleration we can therefore Define acceleration in two different ways one the linear velocity over time velocity over time a equal uh v t uh V over t or S over t to the 2 power or two orbital velocity over space a = v uh to the second power over s or S over T the 2 power like its yinyang counterpart all Motion in the reciprocal system is a relation of rotation Yin orbital velocity to translation Yang linear velocity in the material sector rotation is in time and translation is in space uh that&#x27;s probably the most important thing I think that has been articulated here in the material sector rotation is in time and translation is in space both of these equations are natural consequences of the unit of motion concept consider that with pi equal 4 the equations become simpler and we find that Larson is already using them though he never realized that he was dealing simply with a pixelated perimeter and area for example the circumference is 2 pi r or simply 8r circumference is an orbital velocity and the radius is linear a line so this is defining the relationship between rotation and translation which is found in all of Larson&#x27;s 8:1 ratios concerning the electron further if we look at the area area equal pi r s or area = 4 R 2 we find that this is exactly the same formula that lson uses to compute the periodic table of the elements for n SAR at a conceptual level the definition of n equal or pi equals 4 oh I&#x27;m sorry that did say 4 Pi squar I&#x27;m sorry at a conceptual level the definition of four of of pial 4 is stating that oh I&#x27;m sorry it does say 4 N2 I&#x27;m having trouble telling the difference between the pi and the N here okay at a conceptual level the definition of pial 4 is stating that in a discrete unit system quantized the electric rotation is analogous to the circumference and the Magnetic rotation is analogous to the area this also explains larsson&#x27;s choice of a onedimensional rotation for electric motor and a two-dimensional or planer rotation for magnetic motion this Quantum Pi relationship will be further expounded upon in following paper demonstrating that they are the underlying structure to electron orbitals and the atomic structure as organized by the periodic table the reciprocal system being based solely on natural consequences those found in nature tends to use the quantum pi value of four in many applications so pick your piece of Pi by the reference system in use okay that is the end of this article um I&#x27;m just looking at the footnotes here to see if there&#x27;s anything um that needs to be added uh doesn&#x27;t look like it so um that&#x27;s the end of RS 2105 Quantum Pi uh tomorrow we will be getting into rs2 106 which is called dimensions and displacements and uh I think this one is pretty good um thought provoking the quantum Pi article lost me uh from time to time but I do think that uh uh some of the relationships that he made there at the end are important the electric motion is the uh onedimensional the magnetic motion is the two-dimensional the disc or the plane um okay and um then he also said something else that I thought was pretty uh pretty important that was um in the in the material sector motion rotation is in time and translation is in space now the reverse would be true in the cosmic sector in the cosmic sector the rotation would be in space and the translation or the straight motion would be in time um so that&#x27;s also an important relationship that so you know you can it&#x27;s just you can think of time in terms of rotation and that makes a lot of sense you know time is recurring uh you can think of that in terms of Music also in terms of Music Theory um you know that&#x27;s the you know the double helix or whatever of uh of Music Theory uh as you as you go up in in frequency you know you&#x27;re going around in a circle and so you end up coming back to the same note but you&#x27;re twice as high so you&#x27;re act you know when you in music when you go around uh the you know up the scale the scale is the shape of a um a circle well a spiral because you end up a little bit apart but the octave is in the same place as the original note and then the second octave is in the same place so you&#x27;re going around like that and that has to do with frequency so that is a measure in time anyway we&#x27;ll flush that out more as we uh you know cover those topics but uh stay tuned for tomorrow for RS 2106 dimensions and displacements thanks for tuning in today have</p>
