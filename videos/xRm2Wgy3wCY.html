            <p>foreign [Music] first I&#x27;ll clarify we are fully generally available so we&#x27;ve got almost commercial ready we are commercial already importantly you know building on the comments of my you know co-panelists it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really a test and learn mentality and it&#x27;s following the pattern that&#x27;s been established over the last 50 years of the internet and so open Quantum safe work was fantastic to frame out the logical way to start thinking about well how do these New cryptographic Primitives fit into the internet as we know it because nobody can rip and replace but what we&#x27;re finding is the first moves everyone&#x27;s saying look I wish I could do everything but I can&#x27;t usually control the C and B to C whether it&#x27;s customer for B2B or consumer I can control the E the employee so a lot of the early use cases are in those spheres of control how do I Quantum secure Communications between two offices how do I con you know Quantum secure web access you know whether it&#x27;s restful API or UI traffic but again a website I control a browser or a desktop I control how do I secure document access between parties that have to exchange it they&#x27;ll get into secure SharePoint Quantum secure SharePoint it&#x27;s upon a secure exchange right the patterns are there but it&#x27;s because you have control you have both ends of the pipe the two hands that have to shape and therefore you can try it you can learn it you can understand it you can understand what it does to Performance the resource requirements Staffing the skill sets and on the iot side again it&#x27;s the closed systems when you see both ends we&#x27;re seeing a lot of medical device folks if they have a breach and so for them it had really lightweight environments so they need something fast and powerful cryptographically military a lot of advanced applications but a lot of the early use cases are drones because they&#x27;re living on the edge they&#x27;re not core systems they want to secure them they don&#x27;t want the bad guys to get the data and therefore it&#x27;s an easy space to get started and speaking of space you know we all dream of the day when we have Quantum satellites doing 2kd from a tangled qubits and that&#x27;s going to be awesome when it happens but in the short term a lot of the emphasis especially on pqc and digital algorithms is on transect so the security of the transmission the security of the Rowdy is where there&#x27;s a lot of immediate interest and immediate deployability</p>
