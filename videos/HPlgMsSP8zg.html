            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>anytime we&#x27;re working on an episode i&#x27;m looking for conspiracy theories related to what we&#x27;re talking about and of course there are always conspiracy theories one of the interesting ones that i came across researching nikola tesla was the free energy suppression conspiracy theory which is really long to say but the gist of it is that um they believe that there&#x27;s advocacy groups and government regulations that are controlling uh the energy sources and the technology that we have today uh suppressing what we are actually capable of using perpetual motion machines extraterrestrial devices obviously this is a bit crazy but when you do look at the data there uh is some interesting anomalies i guess you&#x27;d say uh with some of the things that we are capable of and what we&#x27;ve done in the past with nuclear energy and tesla&#x27;s stuff so a hokey thing but you know the government has done worse things so hard to know what to believe out there</p>
