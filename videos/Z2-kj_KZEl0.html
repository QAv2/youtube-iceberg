            <p>Did you know that over 5,000 energy patents have been classified and hidden from the public under national security orders? These aren&#x27;t just random inventions. They&#x27;re breakthrough technologies that could change everything. The Invention Secrecy Act allows the government to seize any patent they claim threatens national security. But here&#x27;s what&#x27;s really happening. Inventors of 0oint energy devices allegedly face intimidation, confiscation, or worse.</p>
<p>Some researchers claim they&#x27;ve cracked unlimited clean energy from the quantum vacuum itself. Yet, after successful demonstrations, many of these inventors mysteriously disappear or their work vanishes. Why would free energy technology be suppressed? Follow the money. The fossil fuel industry is worth trillions of dollars and unlimited clean power would destroy that empire overnight. Former patent examiners have testified about systematic suppression of revolutionary energy devices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some theorists believe this technology already exists in classified military programs. We&#x27;re still burning ancient fuels while clean unlimited energy sits locked away in government vaults. The question isn&#x27;t whether the technology exists.</p>
