            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>think I didn&#x27;t set my recording button here okay all right well I forgot this that might start the recording here so I&#x27;ve just started it so can we do my introduction here which is that this is the the C and PS John&#x27;s come back to philosophy society science chat and you all are doing us a little bit late since I forgot to press the record button but I&#x27;m your host Franklin who and we are discussing tt Browns work on electric radix from this book the aunt secrets of anti-gravity propulsion so we&#x27;re just looking at liquor technology and definitely it does it does seem to work but the question is does it work in vacuum or not and you know there are conflicting reports on that so let&#x27;s see here now they have some other examples of experiments that they&#x27;ve done here and you can see there&#x27;s like simple saucer shapes here and they&#x27;re claiming that they were able to get actual that levitation of the object heavier than the original than the original weight of the object so let&#x27;s see here we&#x27;re on page about a hundred here and a lot of this is still TT Browns work so on chapter four here they start trying to explain how these things work so this is called an etheric explanation that they that these that these effects are easier to explain with the use of a theory I mean use of an ether so here&#x27;s that here&#x27;s our quote here&#x27;s that&#x27;s from a standpoint of this new physics modern physics concepts used in the conventional world such as relativity theory quantum electrodynamics and quantum mechanics are referred to as classical concepts that is they are regarded as terribly outdated and here&#x27;s an interesting paragraph according to Ray unlike today&#x27;s classical physics the new physics does not begin the physical observables in developing its treatment of physical phenomena rather it postulates the existence of an underlying reality consisting of an inherently unobservable Seltzer subtle substance called an ether which filled all of space then it defines all of its fundamental quantities at that sub physical level physical observable will then emerge as mathematical solutions to equations defined in terms of these more basic processes this new physics regards time and space and absolutes and and views Einstein notion of relative time and space as fundamental incorrect physically observable phenomenon such as length contraction and clock retardation which relativists normally interpret as alterations of the space-time continuum emerge as manifestations resulting from motion through the absolute ether thus the ether concept so long spurred by the academic establishment turns out to be this turns out to be central to this highly classified new physics and he&#x27;s interviewing some guy he calls ray but his is his actual identity has been hidden to keep his identity safe so that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s something saying that okay that there is this new physics that there is an ether and that everything is based on that that that ether and that Einstein concepts of the space time and relative time and are in fact completely incorrect so I would think that that would hit a chord with a lot of us dissident scientists who who say that you know Einsteins Ron blah blah blah but don&#x27;t have a lot of detail on that so let&#x27;s see your pal had a question is there any indication here at perpetual motion about which Robert D hilter&#x27;s said that the universe including the solar system it&#x27;s perpetual motion machine for all practical purposes well in in the book you know they mentioned this concept that they&#x27;re trying to make machines which are overunity meaning that they they extract more power out than they are using but last week we had Jeff cook here who had a concept of perpetual motion like the solar system being a perpetual motion machine and that was what that was in fact his entire point saying that that kind of thing is in fact a perpetual motion machines of the moon just continuously rotates around the earth and never stopping then that that is a form of perpetual motion [Music] and palate asking are we in conference mode or our microphones are muted now generally speaking all your microphones are muted but and so but if you want to speak you need to go and unmute yourself on here on the lower left it should be a little microphone icon and you need to click that in order to speak and so this is an open conversation so if you have a question I want to make a comment then you can go ahead and unmute yourself or you can be like pal and just put a put something in the chat box and we&#x27;ll talk about it and I can show it yeah you got your camera there okay I see a you can opening link there it says please start your can have you started you can yeah yeah yeah so it&#x27;s a simple triangle with foil and a wire around the top I don&#x27;t know if you can see the wire yeah we can see the wire but you have to lift up your lifter a little bit higher tickets in the camera you have to play to put it over your face right so what are you using for the legs there that means like a fairly heavy construction I use straws for the angles yeah they&#x27;re solid wood dowels the ones that I&#x27;ve seen it wasn&#x27;t constructed at it like toothpick kind of things and and your wire is all curly is there a reason for that it&#x27;s the finest wire anyway the voltage supply was 25,000 volts I move around it just kind of just wiggle a little bit [Music] now my exhausted right now now I have a Van de Graaff generator definitely you turn on Van de Graaff generator you put stuff around it and death things are definitely being attracted to that they have like discharge ball and when you&#x27;re discharging the the sparks I mean you can physically feel it you know pulling and pushing you definitely there&#x27;s a lot of of course in that in that case there&#x27;s really no question what the force there the force involved on that would just be simply the electrostatic force of the opposite charges definitely attracting attracting things to the so that is definitely one kind of force that we that we know about which is the electrostatic force but these lifters experiments are trying to create basically a one-way kind of thrusting force it&#x27;s easy enough to get like two things to stick together like getting two magnets to stick together and you can you know one magnet will definitely attract and pull the other but can you just get a situation where you have a singular thing like one magnet and then somehow have it just continuously be driven off in one direction without there being any reactionary force one of they typically call these things like reaction list drives and you know whether the more recent attempts that you know there&#x27;s this been college like the emdrive it&#x27;s basically a microwave horn would be it would be one of the more recent attempts on this that I&#x27;ve heard that I&#x27;m not sure that even that produced any any real excitement about this electro Gura vidiq propulsion here so apparently according to this book we already know how to do this stuff it&#x27;s just that this is all black ops stuff that is being held back from us so the only hope would be for one of us this isn&#x27;t scientists to replicate these things because apparently the man is not gonna let us have this stuff but this is all this this whole section here is about what Townsend thought of ether physics so here is his quote he says for a certain phenomenon it is desirable and almost necessary to assume the existence of an ether in order to evolve a satisfactory explanation an example is the force of gravitation particularly the electro gravitational effects with the phenomenon of the movement of a dielectric is such an example much of the work is based on facts derived from actual experiments which cannot be static fact satisfactorily explained without the existence of an ether process for that substantially these qualities so Brown thinks that that&#x27;s and that&#x27;s certainly required so in Chapter five they have a section called the u.s. antigravity squadron okay so this whole section is about it if the United States did in fact develop this technology and of course the the skeptics question is and where is it word where do we see that so the assertion in this book is that we see that that technology actually in the b-2 bomber so there&#x27;s a lovely picture of the b-2 bomber and the assertion is is that the b-2 bomber is in fact a kind of electrogravitic airplane so they&#x27;re showing that that they&#x27;re charging the plane up so that has a positive leading edge and while it spits out negative ions out the back so that is one interesting idea that you know how do you generate the very very high voltage difference that would be needed to achieve these effects and the idea is that you have a jet engine and you have it blowing through an electrode and basically that strips the electrons out and puts them out into the the exhaust stream which creates a very very high charge you know you&#x27;re basically pumping out all the electrons from from the plane and that will create a very very high differential charge you know this is similar to say how Van de Graaff generator works where you have rotating belt which takes charges from one place to the other but since there&#x27;s no ground in you know when you&#x27;re flying the middle of the air you still have find a place to dump those electrons and apparently just dump them out into the exhaust of your jet and create these effects [Music] so Peter say is it yes pal entropy oh I see you have a question about what is entropy so why do you think entropy has to be accounted for in this this kind of gravity effect [Music] [Music] well you&#x27;re saying that everything should run down so how so you&#x27;re doubting whether a perpetual motion machine can be made that you think that even the solar system will eventually run down I mean theoretically yeah go ahead what would [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well I would say that as humans we went a few things that can reverse entropy you know if I just let my house to go with if you have a bunch of kids you know that&#x27;s entropy that everything will get Messier and Messier and Messier now the question is does your house get just infinitely missing and the thing is no it doesn&#x27;t because eventually you have to go back through and clean your house and reverse the entropy and make things meter and so you can always reverse entropy at a cost of energy so you can harvest energy from the Sun and you can use that energy to cause reverse entropy so entropy is not that&#x27;s not something that you cannot defeat and there will always happen you can always do work and reverse entropy in my opinion empathy is only applicable to a closed system if it&#x27;s an open system then you can put energy through the system and the system will become more ordered and decrease entropy yeah exactly that we can always take outside energy and reverse entropy now my opinion is on perpetual motion machines is that what you with you to really be looking for is a way to harvest the ambient energy like the room that I&#x27;m sitting in is at about 70 degrees and there&#x27;s actually a lot of energy in that room temperature the molecules are running around at something like 3,000 miles per hour so there&#x27;s plenty of energy available here to say charge my cell phone but the problem is is that nor the harpes energy typically you have to go from an area of high energy to an area of lower get there low energy there has to be some differential present let&#x27;s see here oops what happened I think my screen just did something weird here just lost my camera or something did you guys just see a change in my camera or something it wants to do anything let me see if I care it&#x27;s like I can draw but I don&#x27;t want to do that how did I get into this mode I [Music] think I&#x27;m in a white boat whiteboard mode or something well there&#x27;s my picture again let&#x27;s see here I am not quite sure what happened there why is it why are at the top left maybe with white and black to the top left of the screen disappeared well I see the record button there I don&#x27;t want to hit that Oh someone else is sharing did someone else share something okay so now I put that website back now if I stop the sharing okay so they came back apparently someone else opted to share their screen and we were looking at that so [Music] so we have a question from Peter Parker Gere about [Music] about whether we believe in aliens now we did have an earlier discussion about that when we started up when we first came turning up the Moody and I was talking with Ian about you know how do they build these megalithic structures and there&#x27;s the popular show ancient aliens on the History Channel which is really all about that theory that it was some alien race that the mitla that was used to create these megalithic structures and things like the pyramids and that they possessed anti grilled the art structures I mean that reminds me that there is one modern megalithic structure called the Coral Castle and that&#x27;s in Florida which is apparently built by this skinny little guy single person but this thing contains like rocks which way you know several tons and not only did he build it once but he decided to just like move it all those tons and you know no one pretty much saw him really do it but once again he was able to move all this stuff by himself but apparently without the use of any special equipment so I&#x27;m kind of wondering why you know this guy that doesn&#x27;t mention the crystal castle in in his book here because that&#x27;s definitely a example we see a lonely looking in the Indian dick index here see whether he mentions that no no [Music] that there is some kind of anti-gravitational technology in use by that guy and perhaps by the ancients or you know if you believe in the ancient it was the aliens who did that so do do we believe in aliens well I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of aliens because I&#x27;ve not seen or interactive that we see a lot of evidence that perhaps they exist now that but the the topics of aliens is also part of this book I mean one of the assertions is about all of these alien UFO observations may in fact just be black ops government programs a bit about that so you know we&#x27;re saying that we&#x27;ve got some of these from the aliens I think like Merv on modern United States space program said basically we had help and help from the aliens that was his claim you know it&#x27;s pretty remarkable that we went from like practically nothing to building a rocket that goes the moon and in a matter of a decade you know how is that possible to go from nothing to being able to watch a rocket to the moon successfully in such a short amount of time you know I kind of implied that maybe we had some help or maybe just really really smart but but if that were true then why did we go through all the trouble of building these large chemical rockets well obviously we could use electric gravity methods to go into space so that would be my other questions like one why did they build these Rockets but any case getting back to the b-2 bomber so they&#x27;re saying that this entire that the b-2 bomber is in fact an electro gravity net is positively charged if that charge and there are claims that you know when people touch the b-2 bomber they will they&#x27;ll get shocked of condensation around the V tube and this is a black-white picture but they claimed that loud around it appears to actually be electrified and actually glowing is the claim so while this thing is running it may be in fact highly charged and may explain some of the operational characteristics of the b-2 bomber so perhaps these secrets in our production airplanes so maybe maybe not [Music] but you had a question about the origin of Earth and the origin of man now you&#x27;re breaking up I think from somewhere else their name speculation I mean lately I&#x27;ve been been watching Battlestar Galactica and that that&#x27;s the whole idea I mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that life here began out there and that life was actually hid by some alien race once again that is the ancient alien hypothesis so and directed there Evelyn beans so that we could be their slaves and do whatever they want could if that were the case then we should still be the enslaved race that they designed us to be so maybe it&#x27;s a good thing that you know miRNA an alien digging for gold that&#x27;s just a shiny yep so they didn&#x27;t they&#x27;re concentrating the gold and and later on they&#x27;ll come by and take it all the way that is certainly one that people have had maybe quite where we are always we do speed getting out in space or whatnot [Music] human beings with this anywhere don&#x27;t be like your hamsters escaping the cage and running around your house right okay so there&#x27;s another section here section seven about microwave propulsion and this is just the idea that you create a tight microwave beam and you aim it at something and it pushes it which i think is a fairly straightforward thing I&#x27;m sure that probably works let&#x27;s see if I get any pictures of this here and microwave phase conjugation here so for example this is a picture of a let&#x27;s see here I can&#x27;t see the ground as I can&#x27;t see the picture too good oh there we go because I kinda have to cover up my camera in order to do this but you know we have a UFO and it&#x27;s got some beams coming out of it and they are saying that that is how UFO propulsion is is done so he mentions things about Tesla and once again Browns and they mentioned that they seen you can get the runaway mode which could cause them to explode so that would be the problem here so that&#x27;s nine is unconventional flying objects like that this is where they they claim that a lot of these things are actually devices created by the unit but they do mention you know the Roswell incident here so they think that and there&#x27;s they think that daily to actually did arrive and there is memos here indicating that they&#x27;re really taking that seriously so are there aliens Roswell may have been a we heard you there so you said that you know there people have been people have they&#x27;ve seen aliens I haven&#x27;t heard about that deaf is suppressed I mean definitely like the the former head of the Canadian defense as clearly stated that that we do know a lot more about the alien so that they&#x27;re there they are there that wasn&#x27;t the most public ones I recently heard them declaring that yeah we know this we know about the aliens we know about the alien technology and that we&#x27;re just all keeping it hush-hush right so it&#x27;s up to us dissident scientists to research this and bring it out in the open because no one else will although if you try to you may find out your laboratory gets burned down or something or something horrible happens to you always seem to be the case [Music] it takes money well I think I thought you the money would find you I don&#x27;t think that would be a problem although you do have to get enough money to actually do your successful experiments but that&#x27;s another area of controversy because there have been a lot of say charlatans who claim to be able to do stuff and people give them money to try and do it but so where&#x27;s my antigravity car then right still don&#x27;t got it right so I think for for sure no one&#x27;s been able to defeat gravity and then in an economically viable way because I think if they did we would have seen it by now now there is a mention here about Bob Lazar and Bob Lazar is like the famous case area 51 where reverse engineer to the crow that he was examining and these things theoretically have these gravity projectors and it can it can project either an a gravity or B gravity so the a gravity would be attractive the be gravity would be repelling so depending on how you turn these things on and off you can get the spacecraft to move in different directions so you would like aim these three beams and he wanted to go forward you just put you know more force on the back lines and less force on the on the front lines and then basically the craft would fall forward due to these these beam gravitate errs so that&#x27;s explained you know these pictures here that&#x27;s one of the anti-gravity secrets this is they explain how the UFOs work here of course has anyone been able look great it&#x27;s a thing maybe United States government has but you have not readily seen this sort of thing available Franklin just some questions have occurred late as you think they think about that well then I would have in my possession but I see how does he make a living can you hear me here you&#x27;re breaking it yeah I think I came out my bandwidth-limited and so my questions were just a little more information about the author lab wallet and I&#x27;m just wondering what he does what he does for a living and I mean it is a million author of these books and in conjunction with that how does he how has he obtained all the secret information about what was happening in Nassau NASA and what&#x27;s happening in the Defense Forces and so on if so he is in danger because he has subject confidential information which is promulgated one other thing that occurred to me when you read one or two of those quotations is that he&#x27;s not sort of like a post einsteinium in the sense that he that he he he talked about the ether theory and absolute space he seemed to be going back to Lorenz theory because he&#x27;s accepting length contraction and time dilation but he&#x27;s accepting an absolute etheric space of this is the same at the same time so I don&#x27;t if you got any light on those from the blurb on the well what does the back say here see he is the president of the starbursts Foundation an interdisciplinary research institute and holds advanced degrees in systems science and physics the author of genesis of the cosmos earth under fire decoding the message of the pulsars and sub quantum genetics he lives in New York that was probably a the starburst foundation is probably his own foundation here so I&#x27;m looking at I&#x27;m trying to I&#x27;m not trying to Google him to see what else he does here and I&#x27;m not seeing a whole heck of a lot here other than he&#x27;s the author of this book [Music] interesting ideas and hypotheses given by writers such as this but that frequently they&#x27;re short on objective evidence as you say repeatability and sometimes they&#x27;re a bit self-serving just promoting the road where so I&#x27;m just a little skeptical and just asking these questions just for a bit of background yeah so it looks like this guy just like like any one of us which is you know that&#x27;s basically just an independent researcher and as far as the where he gets the information for this so apparently he&#x27;s done a few of his own interviews like the b2 stuff he&#x27;s got some connections but a lot of the other stuff like TT Browns work Tesla&#x27;s work is is commonly found on the Internet so like many books this is an aggregator of information which is which is already pretty available on other sources you know all this stuff about Bob Lazar you know you can go read about that in other places so in some ways you know other than the stuff he&#x27;s revealed from his own personal interviews you know this there aren&#x27;t any other you know secrets that you probably couldn&#x27;t find someplace else like probably you might have been able to see well probably you could probably see most of it I would have to say I mean I have seen most of it in other places so I think that&#x27;s how I would respond to that so this guy he&#x27;s like a nobody but yeah but he&#x27;s written this book and you know he&#x27;s got his own foundation and and and you know that&#x27;s how that&#x27;s how he does things so there&#x27;s another section here of the sural effect which is also another thing that you could easily look up on the internet I mean I think I think a lot of this stuff the induction of the internet see the source materials for a lot of this stuff really I mean prior to prior to the invention of the internet you would have to go to things like books where they&#x27;ve actually gone and you know collected and curated all the information but that&#x27;s what books your nightspore because the story to respond that briefly things that he needs credentials and i think most of us disciplines would say no I certainly would say no and there are people with them great credentials on paper you know from the mainstream who are speaking nonsense every single day of the week so III merely ask the question to see where he was coming from and of course some dissidents are not any less likely to be self-serving you know so I just really asking a question flat basis but no I don&#x27;t think he would need any Orthodox credentials and it also seems to me from what you&#x27;ve read that he&#x27;s actually not a true dissident he seems to be accepting the fundamentals of modern physics in a way that most of us would probably question you know maybe he said he had the data creation system science and physics perhaps more more than the most standard dissidents [Music] let&#x27;s see here so I don&#x27;t know if you guys heard about Searle effect but apparently this is some kind of generator and one day when he was playing around with this thing it apparently lift it off and hit the ceiling okay well not only can this thing generate energy but it&#x27;s something to do with antigravity so this is a series of rollers with magnetized magnetite rollers going in opposite directions but let&#x27;s see here&#x27;s a more detailed picture of the swirl here and I think I have seen people attempting to you know replicate these things I&#x27;m wondering if I go do a quick search here on YouTube on the sural effect where that I would see something because everything is on YouTube these days absolutely oh and fix my radiator on my car and then they&#x27;ll go look up on YouTube and it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s like three or four videos on how to replace the radiator on my exact model year car all right yes everything give me about on YouTube so let me see Cyril effect I bet you there&#x27;s a lot of videos on that so let&#x27;s see it let me just share my desktop here so here we have lots of videos and there&#x27;s someone doing a update a lot of people are trying this stuff here so here&#x27;s the video of the UFO with built and flown by John Searle a lot of people who are making these replicas but I wanted to see someone flying this thing [Music] the SCT effect demonstrator number one I have no doubt people have been trying to build these things but [Music] that how do we know with what these these think there&#x27;s things we&#x27;ve seen on the YouTube is a real or simulated well on YouTube you never know whether anything&#x27;s real really I mean there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot of fake stuff on YouTube none of my stuff minds you all my stuff is real but you know they show a lot of things like for example they showed an example of you how you can use a cell phone and CD and two doublea&#x27;s to do levitation you know and they show this video and you know you can see the thing levitate and it&#x27;s like okay where the watch so no you can&#x27;t believe everything you see on YouTube that stuff is legit but I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve seen like for the sural generator other than people creating interesting but that isn&#x27;t another section on this book here and how this works so then they have an experiment to see here we&#x27;re on the section here on electrogravitic wave experiments here and high-voltage electric gravity experiments going back to tt brown stuff you know they happen where you know skepticism from people who have looked at these experiments to indicate whether these things are either being driven entirely just by ion wind or whether it&#x27;s like say an electrostatic attraction force and there&#x27;s a section on black hole discovered at NASA here I&#x27;m not exactly sure what that was about there&#x27;s something about the Columbia disaster here saying that Browns aerospace technology had been implemented on a space cell like Lumbee a disaster would never have happened so I mean that this interesting point that if we know if we knew about this kind of technology since the 1950s then why would we invent and spend billions of dollars on something that looks like this face settle and or why would we not protect it or give it some of these some of these special capabilities and there&#x27;s a section here entitled NASA a military front organization perhaps because one of the speculations that NASA is in on this thing here you know I think they have done some honest attempts of replication of these types of things so that that would indicate that well now maybe NASA is not complicit and then maybe all of this electric gravity stuff is a bunch of hooey who knows but you know his I believe last chapter here the technology that could change the world so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying is that if this if this is true according to Ray who is the it was the black projects guy that he and that he had spoken to but he&#x27;s saying that so apparently the behind-the-scenes individuals who can monitor black world research and decide whether or not it stays classified are following a program of controlled evolution if these powers that be determined that the world has advanced to a point where it can handle a new technology they will allow it to be introduced this leaves us with the question of whether this alt chosen group is itself sufficiently qualified to be making these kinds of decisions with problems like global warming global deforestation acid rain widespread pollution of the oceans radioactive waste overpopulation hunger and the AIDS epidemic we mean ever-larger shouldn&#x27;t at least some of this knowledge be declassified to help the world some members of the black program community feel that it should and as a result they are making efforts to push things in the more liberal direction so there you have it that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on Illuminati it&#x27;s keeping it down and I think you know that the basics of the book here be propulsion I mean that&#x27;s kind of interesting that you know maybe there are this group of people who are actually controlling the dissemination of additional additional knowledge now I kind of feel that you know that there may be some kind of global universal rule I can start track there is the the prime directive which is that you are not to interfere with the evolution of a society so perhaps if say one of us dissidents figures it out you know that would be okay but you&#x27;re not allowed to get the information directly from the outside alien technologies perhaps what might be going on but so I&#x27;m just gonna open up for discussion here so what do people think about that you know the things that it&#x27;d be discussed in the book here anti-gravity propulsion let&#x27;s see here you can unmute people you want I see we have Cornelius here [Music] I can mute all that I can&#x27;t unmute people that&#x27;s interesting so pal what did you think I see you&#x27;ve got your microphone open [Music] [Music] so you don&#x27;t know what to believe I mean that&#x27;s I kind of have that same problem [Music] like you know the question was asked you know do we believe in aliens and it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like well I mean I&#x27;ve never personally run into any but if you look at all the pictures and all the stories about about it it&#x27;s like how could all of that be just made-up right well I guess that gets into the philosophy of science in that typically we would you know have some kind of hypothesis something like you know how gravity works and so like where tt Browns work he&#x27;s saying that you can get these anti gravitational effects by using electricity and then we would have to do experiments that with that would only be true if their hypothesis were true but I mean this is a philosophical question of how do we decide anything is true or false you know in the court law we have two opposing sides just give their arguments and then a jury decides but you know jury could be wrong [Music] [Music] well I got no budget I suppose because usually what people do to try and sort out back in fiction well I don&#x27;t know when you think about it fiction can sometimes be very convincing you know if you go into like the entire fictional world of say star wars you know all of that which seem to be which seems to say make logical sense you know they have things where they can you know go faster than I to have lightsabers they have all kinds of technology which seems to make sense so it wouldn&#x27;t seem to be it would be kind of difficult to say that you know that is false versus we have in the real world we have things like aircraft carriers and jet planes and and bullets we know that that&#x27;s true versus spaceships and ion beam weapons and and faster than light travel right [Music] [Music] well I guess that the question of the universe right maybe Ian maybe you have a compact I mean is there is there some some method we can universally apply to separate fact from fiction I think maybe Ian had something to say about this well yes I have been thinking about it as you&#x27;ve been discussing it and pearl has been making his points and the earlier question about whether one believes in aliens or not I mean my quick response to these things I think is similar to yours Franklin I neither believe nor disbelieve I mean them I I accept that many things are possible you know it&#x27;s possible that aliens came and started civilization here and so on and so forth but I will not believe it until I have incontrovertible evidence now the difficulty there is that I&#x27;m being skeptical about everything but you see that I believe is a safer philosophical position than fragility because credulity is what primitive man house or you know unsophisticated people they just accept everything not confused about the world and they just want to accept an explanation so they accept certain things that fed appear maybe outside our normal everyday experience and that leads to credulity just you know accepting things just because they say so so I would need some very hard repeatable and testable evidence to accept any of these phenomena however I don&#x27;t dismiss them out of hand I mean it is quite possible that for example to make megalithic tombs were put up and you have a you know egg crystalline forms of rock in the structures and they were saying that if you have the sort of M transmitter at Crystal transmitter which can tune into the the natural frequency of those crystals you could get the box to levitate and that&#x27;s the way the megalithic monuments were constructed now that is possible but I&#x27;m not going to believe it until I have pretty incontrovertible evidence so first about Mike Lee is really for one of skepticism whilst holding an open mind on all these phenomena I don&#x27;t that if that answers your question about my position yeah I mean that mm we do have like some explanations from the ancients about how these things work I mean we can work that with with our modern explanations for example when you mentioned that you know there&#x27;s a crystal structure and that if you hit it with the right frequency that you can perhaps get it to become anti-gravitational so like I can work that kind of with my own theories because I believe that the gravity itself is just a simple electrostatic attraction and that the earth is positively charged and therefore the the dipoles or or crystals for example must all be pointing in one direction towards the earth so the idea being that if you want to take any object and make it anti-graft No you have to break static force between the dipoles and the charge and the one way of doing that is if you take the dipole if it&#x27;s pointing downward like it always should be then you make it point like this way here oh you should get the dipole to either point in the sideways direction or or basically any other action other than its natural direction which is down so if you were to sit there and just vibrate you know anything such that you could mess up the electrostatic attraction then perhaps you might be able to get an effect like that but that&#x27;s kind of like how I might you know fit in some information like that about like how the megalithic structures perhaps are oriented so I still have to come up with my anti-gravity gun which does exactly that which goes and messes up the messes up the the orientation of the dipoles in any object and then causes them to levitate so that that&#x27;s on my to-do list I just wrote that down we have a create anti-gravitational gun but that&#x27;s just an example we how we we can get some ideas and how things but what do you think of the pencil Deanna&#x27;s already kind of pointed out there a lot of this stuff is already relatively relatively available on the Internet maybe arty I was kind of only what did you think of the contents of the book this is something you might be interested in go out and buy the book do you think b-2 bomber I do I guess I&#x27;m of the theory that the UFOs are actually somebody here on earth actually figured this out and maybe it&#x27;s our government I suspect it might be and that&#x27;s nothing to do with aliens I don&#x27;t believe I think it&#x27;s just technology here on earth that we haven&#x27;t been shared yes that&#x27;s fine so I think there&#x27;s a lot of things the government doesn&#x27;t tell us yeah I&#x27;m thinking my own personal opinion on this is that you know I&#x27;m fairly convinced by this stuff from Bob Lazar who says that you know there were aliens who who crashed and that we reversed reverse engineered their technology but that a lot of the things that we do see as UFOs are things that the United States government has actually built based on China reverse engineer some of this technology so that&#x27;s Bob Lazar is claims I would think that that would that would make the most plausible sense to me I would imagine but in any case I think unless one of us can levitate one of our automobiles off the ground that no one&#x27;s going to be no one&#x27;s gonna really believe anything that we say so no one should believe me now what you believe anything that Paul says until we can actually put get the rubber off the road I think is what was what we have to do okay so we&#x27;re getting towards the the end of the conference here so I think I&#x27;m going to do a little summary here listen without any questions so we have been talking about this book the secrets of anti-gravity propulsion and I believe like a lot of it did have to do with the idea that gravity is related to electricity and really actually not so much anti-gravity because it&#x27;s more of an electric effect I mean a lot of TT Brownsburg it didn&#x27;t it would work in any direction as I&#x27;ve done necessarily negate gravity but so a lot of a lot of content in this book is along those lines and the other significant thing is that they&#x27;re saying that you know he did his own interviews with a guy called Ray so he got a lot of like insight information about how the United States government does being actively suppressed because we&#x27;re just not ready for it and that but this this technology has been incorporated into some of our modern aircraft like the b-2 bomber theoretically shows students of having incorporated in order to get the special performance characteristics things like I don&#x27;t know perhaps hovering or something but he also mentioned the UFO technology for example talking about Bob Lazar and his claims that we reverse engineered UFO technology but that the aliens are here and that whole thing that yeah the aliens are here and that they they have the technology and we&#x27;ve got a lot of problems on the earth here that might be solved by using that technology or maybe we&#x27;ll just blow ourselves up it&#x27;s one of those Pandora&#x27;s box things maybe swen set out you know you can&#x27;t put that back in and what would people use it for you know maybe they would use it full weapons who knows that&#x27;s what tends to be that happens all technology you never know what&#x27;s gonna get useful or it&#x27;s a ultimate end so let&#x27;s see here on the sural of patents and in here but I think probably the most interesting thing here is this all this why has the b-2 bomber on its cover that perhaps that the DC bomber uses these antique alright well thank you for I think that will do it for this week&#x27;s other topics that you would like to discuss please eat me calm and that will do it you</p>
