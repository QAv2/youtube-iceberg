            <p>[Music] Do electrogravitics experiments really show anti-gravity? Imagine a world where machines could flow or fly without traditional engines. That idea has fascinated inventors and scientists for decades. Some experiments seem to hint at anti-gravity effects. But what&#x27;s really going on? Electrogravidics experiments started with Thomas Townsend Brown in the early 1900s. He noticed that applying high voltages to certain asymmetric capacitors caused small movements.</p>
<p>Some believed this was a sign of anti-gravity, a force that could counteract Earth&#x27;s pole. The setup involves applying thousands to hundreds of thousands of volts between two electrodes. One electrode is sharp and small, the other larger and smooth. This creates a corona discharge that ionizes the air around it. The ions are positively charged and attracted toward the negative electrode.</p>
<p>As they move, they push air molecules backward creating a force called electro-hydrodnamic thrust. This ion wind can lift or move the device, but it is not anti-gravity. It&#x27;s just a form of propulsion based on pushing air, not changing gravity itself. Early experiments by Brown and others showed forces that some thought were gravity related. For example, Irwin Saxel used electrically charged torsion pendulums.</p>
<p>He observed changes in oscillation during solar and lunar eclipses when high voltage was applied. Some believed these results pointed to gravity effects, but later scientists explained them as electrostatic interactions or environmental influences. Modern tests with sensitive equipment have tried to find any signs of true anti-gravity. They have not detected any forces or mass changes beyond what known physics predicts. These experiments have shown that what looks like anti-gravity is actually just ion wind or electrostatic effects.</p>
<p>In fact, no credible scientific evidence supports the idea that electrogravitics can manipulate gravity. It remains a curious phenomenon of electrical propulsion rather than a new force. So, while these experiments are fascinating and show how electricity can produce movement, they do not prove the existence of anti-gravity. They are a reminder of how inventors have long dreamed of defying gravity using electrical tricks. But science has yet to find a way to make that a reality.</p>
