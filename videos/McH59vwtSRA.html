            <p>did and so did Herz for doing you assume a material ether which everybody did when they first started the theory even Maxwell believed in a material that hasn&#x27;t made it into theory that was one statement that he made one of his Prim a phrase some of Maxwell&#x27;s work Nar narrowing it for our purposes in terms of how it is applied to the energy from the vacuum work that we&#x27;ll be addressing overall yes Maxwell had one Vision in of what he thought was the primary reality in electrodynamics was the potentials heavy side and the others thought the potentials were mysticism they weren&#x27;t even real uh if it was not force it had no reality in the physical world it&#x27;s all right most scientists thought that so he thought that these were just mathematical niceties that Maxwell played around with so one of his real jobs he said you know these things ought to be murdered from the theory that was one statement that he made one of his primary reasons was to get rid of the potentials and he got rid of all of them but two heavy side heavyside did and so did Herz doing the same thing and so did Gibbs doing the same thing in forming vector algebra and Vector electromagnetics the equations for example that are taught today at University is Maxwell&#x27;s equations are not Maxwell&#x27;s equations are tall they are heavy sides truncated equations um but anyway heavy side took the view that you know these potentials are mystical we&#x27;ve got to murder them from the theory and we got to get rid of them and so they did oddly in today&#x27;s modern physics we know the potentials are what&#x27;s real and the force field is an effect made in matter after something much more fundamental interacts with the matter that hasn&#x27;t made it into electrical engineering yet in 50 years since we&#x27;ve known it maybe it will one of these days migrate from the physics department across the campus to the building where the electrical engineering department is and get them to change the thing when you assume force fields in space you assume a material ether which everybody did when they first started the theory even Maxwell believed in a material ether how would you define that material ether is that there&#x27;s a thin gas a thin material gas filled in all space and there&#x27;s not a point in a universe where mass is absent that&#x27;s called The luminiferous Ether it was destroyed in 1887 by the Michaelson Morley experiments the El all the electrical exp uh equations all assumed this material ether and still do they never changed a single equation what they did one day is they got up and announced well there&#x27;s no material ether so we&#x27;re not using one and they kept right on with the same equations all assuming the material ether uh what you do in a case like that it does not allow you to engineer Force you have to start with force and you automatically into what we call inpic engineering you&#x27;ve beaten nature and in a wrestling match with nature you&#x27;re fighting forces all the time you don&#x27;t have to do it that way if you just flow the energy in Freely and transfer it and shape and form the energy as you wish and then interact that will matter you form powerful forces without ever having to wrestle nature and that&#x27;s the way to do engineering negative entropy engineering which will be the engineering of the future if we ever get it born anyway Maxwell&#x27;s equations still had a much greater variety of things that you can do electromagnetically than our people can do today at the universities</p>
