            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In March of 1992, Aviation Week broke a story about the B2 stealth bomb. It used an electrokinetic effect in its wings, producing a Biffield Brown effect. The B2 surfs its own electrostatic wave, the negative cloud chasing the positive wing. This is an exact description of Towns and Brown&#x27;s work. And the Biffield Brown effect is literally named after him.</p>
<p>And the B2 was built by the merged Northrup Grumman, whose major investor, Floyd Odlam, was the same guy that invested in Towns and Brown&#x27;s company, Guidance Technologies, in the &#x27;60s. I guess Towns and Brown isn&#x27;t just the wacky fan guy</p>
