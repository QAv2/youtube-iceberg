            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational uh educational Channel where I cover different uh people who&#x27;ve spent their whole life working on stuff that is very valuable but they never got any type of recognition and so you probably have never heard of what they&#x27;re doing or you vaguely heard of it or something that effect today is video number 198 on the reciprocal system of theory which was a theory of everything that was um promulgated by Dewey B Larson uh back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 but he left a lot of books and articles behind spent about 60 years developing the reciprocal system uh the last 30 of which he was writing books uh with a um deductive approach once he came up with this fundamental postulates then he um began to deduce a theoretical universe and then more or less compared his theoretical Universe with the universe that the scientists had observed and measured and to see how they would compare um how they would match up now Mr Larson&#x27;s theory states that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it&#x27;s made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time that&#x27;s why he calls it the reciprocal system um it&#x27;s a lot based on a kind of a mirror images and um motion is basically a fraction or a relationship between um time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator and all of the really fundamental uh qualities of Dynamics and mechanics are relationships between space and time so you can get rid of the MKS System of Units and you can just plug in a time and space system of units for example speed we know speed is time over space or space over time 10 miles the bike is going 10 miles per hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time but if you invert that you have a relationship between time over space it took me three hours to move that thing 20 feet that is energy energy is time over space but you also have time and space in multiple Dimensions because as part of his postulates he posits the idea of coordinate space and coordinate time we understand coordinate space x y z coordinates um three dimensions of space or time are three dimensions of space but Larson also posits three dimensions of time it calls it coordinate time that&#x27;s something that is a foreign concept to Legacy scientists and um comes into play in Larson&#x27;s system um when you&#x27;re dealing with what he calls the cosmic sector now there are is also as part of his fundamental postulates what he calls um clock time and clock space clock time we&#x27;re familiar with that is you know time is always getting later and later and later and later and we recognize that and have for a very long time but then there is also clock space clock space is that things are always getting farther and farther and farther apart there&#x27;s a progression of space or a flow of space This Is Us these clock aspects are both scalar motions these are motions that have a magnitude but they have no particular direction and you would Envision this by taking a balloon and putting a bunch of dots on it with a magic Market when you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but in no particular direction you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other but in no particular direction the farther apart they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other or toward each other and uh that is what Larson calls a scalar motion and that is the progression of space and that was actually observed by the Hubble telescope way back in the 1920s all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other so that is clock time and clock space the other aspect in his postulates of time and space is that they both come in discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time they are not continuous they come in chunks the chunks are very small so you don&#x27;t really see them in the case of time the chunk is uh so small that um over six uh quadrillion of them fit into one second and uh for space I believe it is uh uh 20 million of them uh fit into one um uh one meter and um when you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light and so the speed of light represents a midpoint of the universe or a no point Larson uh at times calls it the natural reference system uh you can think of it as the origin of the universe there is a half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and half of the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light this contradicts Einstein&#x27;s dictum that there was uh that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe this is true when you&#x27;re talking about the material sector which is the sector of universe the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light but this the opposite is true when you&#x27;re referring to the cosmic Universe where uh everything is moving faster than the speed of light the speed of light is actually the minimum speed of that universe now we generally see these relationships in space in the material sector you have coordinate space and you have clock time these are familiar to us um and these are what the scientists use for observation and measurement in the material sector the cosmic sector is generally unknown to us and manifests mainly as things of having to do with consciousness the communication the alphabet perhaps um and uh in the cosmic sector everything is moving faster than the speed of light you have uh coordinate time and clock space and these are unfamiliar Concepts to us um but by the reciprocal postulate we can extrapolate so everything that we know about the material sector can be transferred over to the cosmic sector with the caveat that we just have to invert the roles of space and time and so we can understand everything about the cosmic sector just by extrapolating from the material sector so this uh basically doubles our understanding of the universe right there from uh Larson&#x27;s reciprocal postulate okay now there&#x27;s a million other things to say about that but um we are going through Larson&#x27;s book called Nothing But motion that he wrote in 1979 it&#x27;s primarily on Atomic physics and we&#x27;re in chapter 14 which is called Cosmic elements and uh you know so this is looking at this Cosmic sector he had already gone through the material elements in the earlier chapter the elements of the periodic table are combinations of motions so an atom is basically a certain amount a integer a discrete units of two-dimensional primary rotations two-dimensional secondary rotations and one dimensional well he calls them electric but one-dimensional rotations and so those are the two the three numbers a b and c it uses the notation just like a bat a dash B Dash c those are the three numbers that he uses to determine the elements and now uh he&#x27;s looking at the cosmic elements and so uh you would think that all you have to do is reverse the roles of space and time and that&#x27;s true to a certain extent but there are some other factors that come into play such as observation we observe from the material sector we see space but we do not see time the only way we see time is how it affects space and it affects space in a reciprocal manner again the idea that I would use is the white dwarf star the white dwarf star is an explosion that goes beyond of a star that is going beyond the speed of light when it goes beyond the speed of light that it that explosion then occurs in time rather than in space and we do not see time we only see how it affects space and so what we see is the reciprocal of an explosion in time we see an implosion in space and that is why white dwarf stars are tiny and super dense because they have exploded in time and so um when we observe across a boundary there&#x27;s also a certain amount that&#x27;s lost in the translation so we have to take these things into account in addition to the idea of inverting the space-time relationships when you cross over into the cosmic sector now Larson is going over the uh some of the Legacy science behind the cosmic elements what they thought the cosmic elements are and they believed that the cosmic uh cosmic ray primaries are atoms of ordinary material elements so we&#x27;re going to go over his list of the reasons why this isn&#x27;t this is not true so we&#x27;ll start right here in the absence of any known alternative this amount of evidence has been sufficient to secure General acceptance of the conclusion that the primaries are atoms of ordinary material elements when the issue as to its validity is raised however it must as it must be when an alternative appears it is clear that there are many counter indications in the empirical data the most serious items are the following one the speeds and energies of the primaries are too high to be compatible with a production with production by ordinary physical processes no known process or even a plausible speculative process based on conventional physics is able able of producing energies that extend up to the vicinity of 10 to the 20 electron volts as expressed in the Encyclopedia Britannica quote how to explain the acquisition of such energies is a disturbing physical and cosmological problem two with the exception of some of the relatively low energy rays that are thought to originate in the Sun most of the primaries have energies in the range which indicates speeds in the neighborhood of the speed of light in as much as some decrease in speed has undoubtedly taken place before the observations it is quite probable on the basis of the observational evidence that the Rays originally entering the local environment were traveling at the full speed of light this is another indication of an extraordinary origin number three while the distribution of elements deduced from the cosmic ray charges approximate approximates the estimated distribution in The observed universe as a whole there are some very significant differences for example the proportion of iron atoms in the cosmic rays is 50 times that in average matter lithium has been reported to be as much as a thousand times as abundant the cosmic rays therefore cannot be merely ordinary matter drawn from the common pool and accelerated to high speeds by some unknown process they must have originated from some unusual kind of source these anomalies in the charge spectrum of the cosmic rays are given little attention in current physical thought probably because they have no known explanation but the significance that such deviations from normal abundance would have if confirmed was clearly recognized at the time when the first indications of these deviations were observed for instance Hooper and Scharf made this comment quote an excess of heavy nuclei would suggests the necessity of reconsidering our fundamental ideas on the origin of the primary radiation end quote number four all of the major products of the primary Rays have extremely short lifetimes if they do not undergo collisions before this time has elapsed they decay in flight to particles of lower Mass and equal or longer lifetime there is much available evidence to indicate that this is also true of the primaries for example in some of the observed events a transient particle leaves the scene of the event in a continuation of the line of travel of the primary and carries the bulk of the original energy the straightforward interpretation of such events is that they represent processes in which the primary decays to the transient particle and continues on its way the existence of a substantial number of high energy pions in the incoming stream of particles is another item of evidence pointing in the same direction as similar but earlier decays of primaries will produce pions with very high Energies it has been estimated that as much as 15 of the incoming high energy power particles are pions the conclusion that can logically be drawn from the observation from the observations is the prime that the primaries of the same general nature sorry is that the primaries are of the same general nature as the known transient particles and that the entire cosmic ray phenomenon is a single process taking place in a succession of DK events a process in which an atom with some strange and unusual property is converted first into other similar but less massive particles and then finally into products that are compatible with the local environment okay so those are Larson&#x27;s four uh basic reasons why he suspects that the primaries are not simple material atoms a Pion is just one form of what they call mesons and a Meson is in Larson&#x27;s idea is a cosmic uh Adam I believe who we will go on and figure this out the consideration summarized in the foregoing paragraphs indicate that the current explanation of the nature of the primary cosmic rays is not correct they point to the conclusion that these primaries are not atoms of material elements as now believed but atoms of a special kind which have characteristics similar to those of the transient particles and are produced under some unusual conditions that lead to entry into the local frame of reference at the full speed of light since we now find from the theoretical development that there is a continuing inflow of cosmic atoms which are atoms of a special kind that according to the theory enter our environment at the speed of light and are subject to Rapid decay in the manner of The observed transient particles the identity of the theoretical and observed phenomenon phenomena is almost self-evident an outstanding characteristic of the results obtained from the development of the consequences of the postulates of the reciprocal system of theory one that we have had occasion to mention several times in the preceding pages is the way in which they resolve long-standing and seemingly extremely difficult questions in a surprisingly simple manner nowhere is this more evident than in the case of the cosmic rays where the finding that these incoming particles are atoms from the high energy sector of the universe clears up many the many previously intractable issues in this area with remarkable ease the basic questions what are the cosmic rays and where do they come from are answered automatically by the theoretical discovery of a sector of the universe in which objects with the observed properties of the cosmic arrays are indigenous the particular properties that characterize the constituents of the cosmic rays and distinguish them from the constituents of Aggregates of ordinary matter are naturally the ones that are the most difficult to explain on the basis of current theories which try to fit them into the material system of phenomena but these explanations are practically obvious once the existence of the cosmic sector is recognized okay we will uh uh proceed from there tomorrow and maybe review a little of that but uh uh basically he&#x27;s saying that uh these are cosmic elements and not Material elements that uh are being labeled the cosmic rays and um I think uh in the next in this chapter in the next chapter he will go over this process all right well thank you for tuning in we will be uh going over this tomorrow um so stay tuned or tune in tomorrow um don&#x27;t get discouraged by the complexity just let it wash over you and listen to my videos over and over and you&#x27;ll pick it up um all right have a great day</p>
