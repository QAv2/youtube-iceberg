            <p>understand and we also describe how this is operating but the why behind it is kind of banal you know in the sense of uh it&#x27;s money and power so let&#x27;s say you have something that would fit on a little table this big and it&#x27;s a generator and it&#x27;s pulling energy out of What&#x27;s called the quantum vacuum or Zero Point Energy field which was proven to exist back in the 50s now physicists have described this energy field if you had a coffee mug the amount of space in that coffee mug has enough potential power to boil off all the oceans of the world quote unquote it&#x27;s what Tesla called not the fake car company actually Nikola Tesla um I call it fake Tesla cars because if they&#x27;re plugged into the grid they&#x27;re not real testless we&#x27;ll get into this um but those that energy field is uh everywhere and you can tap into it and when you tap into it you&#x27;re tapping into this energy field that can be converted to electricity or thrust so is the energy field is it everything in between objects is that it&#x27;s not just between it&#x27;s within so if you take let&#x27;s take the chair you&#x27;re sitting in or I&#x27;m in it&#x27;s occupane a volume of space when you get past the molecular to the atomic level of this and then subatomic the quarks you get this into this pluripodent it&#x27;s like the the foam at the surface of the deep ocean okay that all of matter is fluxing in and out of the early Lockheed Skunk Works man-made UFOs were called flux liners flux liners yep so they were pulling energy from this Quantum vacuum flux field very Advanced physics I mean we understand it very well I want to put your audience to sleep going into the archana of the physics of it but the point I&#x27;m making is that was mastered decades ago this is this technology has been around for for decades uh well about a hundred years that there has been empirical evidence of this energy field Nikola Tesla called it the infinite energy field um there are others who discovered it all the way back to the late 1800s now they didn&#x27;t they didn&#x27;t have the physics down of what was happening but in terms of just observing the phenomenon empirically you know here you you set up a high voltage system suddenly more energy is coming out than you&#x27;re putting in those are called over Unity systems or free energy because once you get it tapped it&#x27;s just flowing right and so that means that every home business car manufacturing Village in Africa would have be able to have a device that would not be very expensive frankly to mass manufacture that would generate all the energy they need for all the needs that we have for a modern civilization and this would be wonderful there&#x27;s no pollution there&#x27;s no radiation and once you have the system there is no cost there&#x27;s no refueling the bad news is that if you&#x27;re an oligarch a global oligarch controlling the macro economic system Big Oil big Global Systems and let me translate for those of you in the Middle East are vital National Security interests translates to one word o i l oil energy so the problem is you know if that technology were to be disclosed it&#x27;s a you know it&#x27;s a quadrillion dollars it&#x27;s a thousand trillion dollars or more in proven assets oil gas coal Public Utilities that are obsolete it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like a Royal typewriter or a horse and buggy that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re protecting so the entire energy field everything that has anything to do with energy becomes completely obsolete at this point yeah and all which and and all Transportation Systems internal combustion engines jet engines Rockets surface roads so now surface rows I say that only because when you take that same physics and do a torsion a counter rotating field you can get what&#x27;s called an electrogravidic effect where or anti-gravity pop culture term is a terrible term it&#x27;s not anti-gravity but you can collect create this electromagnetic field where an object becomes essentially weightless and can move this is why you if you look at the radar tracings of these things these objects can be moving at 200 000 miles an hour make a right hand turn and there are occupants on these now you know I mean any pilot knows if you had the g-forces of that your brains would come out of your nose there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;d be fatal but because it&#x27;s calling correcting for 1G and there&#x27;s a sort of a bubble an envelope in space-time that this object is moving in there&#x27;s no limit to what it can do so we don&#x27;t feel the G they don&#x27;t fill it and go straight up you know at like one of the radar things we have from Belgium from I got from the Belgian Air Force was an object that was at you know slightly above AGL a few feet above ground level and it went from there to Boom like 100 000 feet and in one radar swoop you know boom we have a lot of cases like that that we&#x27;ve collected and you know the question at this point is how is that happening well we know how that&#x27;s happening and so I here&#x27;s the issue with disclosing all this when you get past the superficial level here&#x27;s a machine here&#x27;s a device here&#x27;s this the scientists like myself are going to say well how is it doing that I mean if they have a thinking brain which of course is a big assumption now with our educational system collapsing it&#x27;s sorry to say but God I mean the kids that are now trying to get educated in the system now God help us all so but the the fact is that&#x27;s going to be asked now what&#x27;s interesting is that the Pentagon has officially said those objects that are that were have been released of the Tic Tac and other UFOs that have been documented with sensors on chips onboard aircraft and in space while they&#x27;re not disclosing Those sensors but I know what they are those are are physical objects moving without any known means of propulsion go look at what&#x27;s been said by the Pentagon now what the person who said that the Pentagon says we don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re moving because that spokesman hasn&#x27;t been read in to these deep black projects that are in this parallel universe of the secret government it&#x27;s been my job to collect the actionable intelligence the documents and the people who know this and put it together and put it in the briefings for people so I&#x27;ve provided this to every minister of defense and secretary of defense for the four of the five eyes which are of course you know U.S Canada Australia UK I have not done it for New Zealand but and what I&#x27;m in every single case when I met with these guys either they&#x27;re former or current mod heads or what have you they&#x27;ve said we were never read into this so at this data point let me extend the data point globally so some years ago there was this this really amazing guy named of Lord Hill Norton he was a five-star Admiral they used to call him a c-lord don&#x27;t you love I mean I love the British they&#x27;re fantastic a Sea Lord and he had been head of the mod which means in the UK you&#x27;re head of MI5 MI6 like rcia and stuff but he was also head of the military committee for NATO and I met with him at his house in Wiltshire now in Hampshire in England some years ago and he asked me to come because he wanted me to bring the briefing document that I put together for the president I think at that time it was the late Clinton years and I said all right I&#x27;ll come over and I went over with my four daughters and wife and they went off to see the Salisbury Cathedral and I went and met with this former mod head and he was livid he says this never came across my desk I was never read into this and I said yet I have files from your own mod about the landing of one of these objects at the dent Waters of randles from forest bent Waters Air Force Base no kidding yep I have the I have the documents I have the trace Landing I have the U.S military Air Force people&#x27;s testimony that were there so at this point I have about 1100 of these folks what&#x27;s a trace Landing when when one of these uh in this case it was an extraterrestrial vehicle not one of the man-made ones so we call them etvs for the ones that are of extraterrestrial origin the ones that are man-made are often called arvs alien reproduction Vehicles meaning that they&#x27;re simulating not totally but simulating the um energy propulsion capabilities of what we&#x27;ve reverse engineered and studied since the 40s okay so we&#x27;ll get into this in a moment how what&#x27;s the technology transfer Arc from the 40s to now and that&#x27;s very interesting it&#x27;s going to be in our new film called The Lost century and how to reclaim it is the sub caption title but the minister of defense was Furious and and you know he was a bit bombastic and kind of you know piercing blue eyes a real character and um and he was I think he was hurt I mean if you have that lower responsibility and you find out you were zoomed I&#x27;m probably the most important military and intelligence issue in the 20th century in 21st century he and he said well why wouldn&#x27;t they have told me that it becomes personal for these men and I said well let me ask your question with a question he said oh what do you mean he thought it was being an impertinent yank which I can be but but uh no I was doing it as sort of a a way of sort of illustrating this point and I said well what would you have done if you had found out that there was an organization and a project global global that had engaged in assassinations Wet Works of innocent people killings so cie term what works for you know if you&#x27;re on the watch group list which I have been on um and that is engaging in all manner of criminal activities up to including drug running has embezzled trillions of dollars from Western economies and they have the technologies that would save the Earth&#x27;s biosphere in a generation in poverty but they are now an existential threat to the world and to the United States in your country United Kingdom and he almost jumped out of his chair and says I wouldn&#x27;t have stood for it for a bloody minute like that just in a rage and I went well that&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t tell you hey everybody I&#x27;m Sean Ryan click here to subscribe to the Sean Ryan Show YouTube channel for the hottest and most compelling interviews that you will not see anywhere else
