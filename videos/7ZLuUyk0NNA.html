            <p>In this video, we explore the observer effect. The profound principle that your very act of observing alters reality. In quantum physics, the famous double slit experiment shows that particles behave like waves of possibility until observed. Then they collapse into a single outcome. This reveals a deeper truth.</p>
<p>Consciousness is not passive. It&#x27;s creative. Your attention literally shapes matter. This aligns with the ancient hermetic principle of mentalism which teaches that all is mind. The universe is mental.</p>
<p>Reality begins in consciousness. What you focus on you influence. What you expect you shape. Spiritually the Bhagavad Gita says man is made by his belief. As he believes so he is.</p>
<p>Your beliefs are not just internal. They become the architecture of your external world. If your thoughts are rooted in fear, you&#x27;ll perceive a fearful world. But if your awareness is grounded in peace and faith, you&#x27;ll attract a reality that reflects that. You are not separate from what you see.</p>
<p>You are a co-creator. The observer effect reminds us that by changing our inner state, we change our outer world. So the next time you look out at your reality, ask yourself, &quot;What am I choosing to observe and what am I unconsciously creating?</p>
