            <p>hi everyone just a quick update to show you the setup which is all ready to go got the reactor which has the likkle mesh and the palladium inside and nothing else I sucked out all of the air I will suck out more air again in a second just in case any bits have come off the mesh in the meantime then I&#x27;ll be pumping hydrogen into here so there won&#x27;t be any air inside so there&#x27;s gonna be no risk of any kind of explosion or anything so the hydrogen will go in perfectly safe and then it&#x27;s going to sit there with the nickel mesh and the Palladium and what it&#x27;s going to see what happens the idea is that if cold fusion is going on then the temperature inside will go above what it would normally like to sit her so in this case today it&#x27;s currently 185 so if it goes significantly above that then there&#x27;s an extra source of heat going on inside at this point I won&#x27;t be able to say for sure that is cold fusion I need to do a few more experiments to contrast and compare but it is a very important step towards showing the cold fusion is happening inside this reactor so I&#x27;m going to get going [Music] okay so I vacuumed out even more air staff bits and pieces that might have come off the nickel mesh has been heated so that&#x27;s all gone now I&#x27;m going to for some hydrogen I didn&#x27;t is being made in okay the hydrogen is being produced by the little machine but there&#x27;s still air inside here as well so we want to kind of flush everything out so I&#x27;m going to do that by sucking it through very gently [Applause] Ciccone hydrogen has been made its parsing out through here and out of the window I&#x27;m doing this to make sure that I don&#x27;t have any air left in the little kind of in the little connecting I do want to make sure only a hydrogen is going in and now we&#x27;re ready to open up the valve and send the hydrogen into the reactor and here we go switch off to close the reactor already close this valve close that bow off with the pump off with the hydrogen generator so now there is hydrogen inside the reactor only hydrogen no air so it&#x27;s perfectly safe I&#x27;ve currently got hydrogen inside this tubing still so I want to get rid of that so that we&#x27;re even more safe and now we wait</p>
