            <p>on July 10th 1856 during a violent thunderstorm Nicola Tesla was born at the moment of his birth a lightning bolt struck nearby and the Midwife exclaimed this child will be a child of the storm perhaps his Destiny was already written the Thunder rumbled the dark sky was torn apart by bright lightning people watched in fear from their Windows while inside a small house a new life was about to be born on that stormy night in 1856 Nicola Tesla opened his eyes to the world his mother Dua Tesla writhed in pain as she struggled a flash of lightning illuminated the room and at that exact moment little Nicola took his first breath nurse said this is a bad Omen a child of Darkness has been born mother said said no he will be a Child of Light was it fate perhaps because this child would one day be known as the man who controlled electricity Tesla possessed an extraordinary memory and an ability to visualize complex machines in his mind even as a child he designed intricate mechanisms and had an insatiable curiosity for electricity Tesla was different from other children he me memorized everything he saw performed complex calculations in his mind but what truly set him apart was his imagination at gra University of Technology one day a professor explained how inefficient direct current Motors were the entire class seemed to accept it but Tesla thought differently young Tesla but why don&#x27;t we use a rotating magnetic field that way we can operate a motor without brushes or contact points in that moment the idea that would change the course of history was born Tesla had envisioned the future in 1884 Tesla arrived in America and began working in Thomas Edison&#x27;s lab but soon he clashed with Edison while Edison championed direct current DC Tesla had a superior Vision Al alternating current AC in 1884 Tesla stepped onto American soil with only a few coins in his pocket and a head full of dreams but he was determined to change the world Edison once offered Tesla $50,000 saying make AC practical Tesla succeeded but Edison refused to pay saying you don&#x27;t understand American humor Edison said elect electricity will move forward with direct current Tesla alternating current is dangerous and useless Tesla said but alternating current is more efficient we can transmit energy over long distances Edison said while laughing you&#x27;re not American Tesla you just don&#x27;t understand our humor at that moment Tesla suffered a great disappointment but he would not give up Tesla left Edison and ignited one of the greatest energy Wars in history in the end alternating current one today the entire world runs on Tesla&#x27;s electrical system the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair Tesla was here to prove the power of alternating current Edison claimed he would fail and then the moment arrived a switch was flipped and the entire Fairgrounds were bathed in light alternating current had illuminated the dark KN of Chicago the war of currents had been won by Tesla alternating current would change the future of humanity Tesla&#x27;s ultimate dream was to provide the world with free wireless electricity to achieve this he built the Revolutionary Warden Cliff Tower this Tower had the potential to transmit power wirelessly across the globe but for oil and coal companies this was a nightmare the warden Cliff Tower a project that could illuminate the world without wires Tesla&#x27;s main financier JP Morgan withdrew his support saying free energy how do we make money from that the project was abandoned the tower was demolished and Tesla&#x27;s greatest dream was lost the financiers withdrew their support the tower remained unfinished and in the end it was destroyed Lin in the 1930s Tesla claimed to have developed a death ray a weapon capable of destroying enemy aircraft from miles away but mysteriously all records of this project disappeared Tesla also claimed to have received signals from extraterrestrial beings and believed he had intercepted Transmissions from space could he have actually discovered something revolutionary in his final years Tesla lived in isolation and poverty when he died in 19 1943 the FBI immediately entered his hotel room and confiscated all his documents for years these papers remained classified What secrets did they hold time travel wireless energy technology or something even more extraordinary what kind of world would we live in today if Tesla&#x27;s projects had been fully funded wireless energy would have made fossil fuels obsolete flying cars and advanced transport portation systems could have emerged decades earlier perhaps the world would have united through Tesla&#x27;s Innovations rather than Waring over resources if Tesla had lived today what kind of world would we have flying cars free energy cities powered by wireless electricity perhaps someone never wanted that to happen the year is 1943 in a small hotel hotel room in New York an 86-year-old man sits alone that man is none other than Nicola Tesla The Genius who revolutionized the world&#x27;s electrical system yet he was never recognized as a hero nor were his inventions given the credit they deserved but why was Tesla silenced why were his inventions suppressed and what if he had been fully supported [Music]</p>
