            <p>hello everybody out there welcome to my channel this channel is focused on educational development for people who are curious about some of the latest uh and greatest theories of everything and uh Magnum opuses from obscure sources and um esoteric writings that are um a little bit hard to access and any other type of uh you know uh cosmologies or all-encompassing theories that um might really benefit your life but they&#x27;re being suppressed and haven&#x27;t really gotten to see the light of day and today is our 397th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory of one dwey B Larson Mr Larsson grew up in the United States and uh lived from 1898 until 1990 around 1959 he put out his two fundamental postulates after a few Decades of working out the Kinks he put out just two short sentences about uh How the Universe operates and then uh over the next 30 years he uh developed uh those fundamental postulates into a theoretical Universe about uh through a process of deduction uh if this then that and um if my two postulates are correct then my universe would look like this and so he took that uh theoretical universe and basically compared it to the actual uh empirical I won&#x27;t say actual but the empirical universe of the modern scientists uh who had um you know these expensive Laboratories and telescopes and Adam Smashers and um you know they had compiled all kinds of data about uh the periodic table and uh all the different stars and galaxies that are out there and so on and uh Larson&#x27;s Universe Larson&#x27;s for free universe or for minimal cost Universe uh Compares quite um strikingly with that of Legacy science and when there is a conflict uh usually it seems like Mr Larson&#x27;s um uh alternative uh works out better so Mr Larson in my opinion basically beat an army of uh well-funded scientists over the course of uh actually Millennia uh just one dude with the powerful theory that he had and his ability to deduce today uh so basically uh the um First Fundamental postulate lays out most of the uh territory and then the second postulate is just kind of a almost a throwi in uh the first postulate is that uh uh the um universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and then the second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian now one thing that Larson doesn&#x27;t say in those two postulates is that when he says motion he&#x27;s referring to what he calls a scalar motion a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction and uh something that you would Envision using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the dots will be moving away from each other every dot is moving away from every other Dot and even the locations between the dots are moving away from each other um but in no specific Direction that&#x27;s a scalar motion and uh that motion has been obviously observed uh by scientists but never investigated for its significance until Larson came around and uh he uses it as the foundation for uh what he&#x27;s talking about now yesterday we talked about how he or he talked about uh the concept of a distributed scalar motion and that&#x27;s basically if you take that that motion and then you rotate it and so the effect is basically spread out over the course of a rotation and uh he uses that to explain many other things as well so today is the second day that we&#x27;ve gone over um his paper here that is called the physics of motion and um so if you want to listen to the first part of that paper go back and listen to yesterday&#x27;s video he will go over in detail scalar motion and how he you know how he sees the importance of scalar motion and where it plugs into his theory and um we&#x27;re going to go through the second part of that paper today um hopefully finish it but maybe not um and then you know the other important part of the theory is just that the is a uh motion is the relationship between space and time which sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time that hasn&#x27;t really been recognized uh even though if you look at the most basic kind of motion speed the car is moving 10 m an hour there is a re iCal relationship between space and time if you multiply the speed by two you can see that you can say now the car is moving 20 m per hour 20 miles of space in one hour of time or equivalently you could also say that this uh car is now moving 10 miles per half hour you can either multiply the space by two or you can divide the time by two a reciprocal relationship so that uh is at least a prima fascia um demonstration that there is a reciprocal relationship between space and time but he says that it is more all-encompassing than that and he he bases everything on um that concept so uh we are about to start a section in this paper the physics of motion that&#x27;s called The Mystery of electric charge I also keep in mind that in uh Larson&#x27;s theory of electric charge has been um very uh very much maligned by some of larsson&#x27;s followers they feel that uh especially Dr Bruce pet feel that lson got several things uh wrong about uh the electric charge uh the El electrical magnetic and electrical systems in general okay in conventional scientific thought the electric charge is accepted as a given feature of the universe its properties are likewise accepted without explanation either as to their origin or as to their nature the charge manifests Itself by by exerting a force on objects of certain kinds within a certain region of space a charge at Point a for instance exerts a force on a test charge at point B somewhere within its range this effect appears to indicate the existence of action at a distance a concept that is philosophically unacceptable to most present day theorists to avoid conce in reality uh to this objectionable process they assume that the charge at location a is surrounded by a field the force is thought to be transmitted through this field and it is the field then that exerts a force on the test charge at location B there is no clear understanding or general agreement agreement as to what as to just what this hypothetical field actually is Einstein contends that the charge quote calls for calls into being something physically real in the space around it and that this something in is the field other physicists disagree uh PW Bridgeman dismisses the whole idea quote it is only by an uncritical analogy he says that we form the concept of a field independently existing in its own right he adds that instrumentally the distinction between field and action at a distance appears to be meaningless as the only feature of this situation of which we have actual knowledge is that the charge exerts of force the first step toward a better understanding is to take a closer look at the concept of force with particular reference to its relation to motion motion is measured on an individual mass unit basis as speed or velocity that is each mass unit moves at this rate on a collective basis motion is the product of mass and velocity which is momentum formerly called quantity of motion momentum equals mass time velocity the time rate of change of the motion is acceleration on an individual mass unit basis and it is force the product of mass and acceleration on a collective basis es Force equals mass time acceleration thus Force could legitimately call be called quantity of acceleration a term that would reflect its true nature by definition force is a property of an accelerated motion not something that can exist in its own right wherever there is a force there must be a motion of which the force is a property once this point is recognized the role of force in physical action becomes clear the basic physical process is the transfer of motion such a transfer consists of a simultaneous decrease in the magnitude of one motion a negative acceleration and an increase of equal magnitude a positive acceleration in another motion the force or quantity of acceleration is a measure of the magnitude involved in the transfer in firing a rocket for example the force exerted by the combustion produ uh products on the rocket is the quantity of acceleration transferred from these products the product of the mass of the rocket and the acceleration imparted to it is the quantity of acceleration received by the rocket except for losses in the process these two quantities are equal the status of force in general as a quantity of acceleration a property of a motion obviously applies to the force exerted by an electric charge but present day physical s science cannot find the motion of which the force must be a property so far as the physicists are able to determine the electric force originates directly from the charge although they have been unable to discover how it originates furthermore to the physicist force is a vector quantity that is it has a specific direction as well as a magnitude but the force exerted by the electric charge is not a vector it is a distributed force a field these discrepancies have thrown the whole situation into confusion in the Wonderland of present day fundamental physics the physicist can see the uh grin of the chesher cat uh the electric force but they cannot see the cat the motion of which the force is a property so they ignore the definition of force that they have set up the definition that is the basis for all of their subsequent applications of the force concept they assume that the fundamental forces are autonomous entities existing in their own right indeed they go even farther and characterize these forces as the primary physical entities a typical statement T taken from a physics text asserts categorically that quote the gravitational force the electric force and the nuclear force govern all that happens in the world this leaves the antecedence of the forces such as the electric charge suspended in thin air without any connection to anything else if the force is the fundamental entity what is the charge the physicist cannot answer this question the general tendency is to evade the issue by contending that there is no answer as one author puts it when we have said in what uh condition objects are when they are electrically charged we have said all there is to say end qu another tells us this the question what is electricity so often asked is meaningless we must have in physics something behind which we do not uh something behind which we do not go if it were not electricity it would have to be some other conception under the circumstances it is not surprising that there are major differences of opinion as to the nature of force and its place in the physical picture in spite of the general agreement as to how it is to be defined Richard feinman attempts to rationalize the basic contradiction by advancing the Curious contention that force is quote more than a definition meanwhile the enthus enthusiastic followers of Einstein claimed that he may quote made the concept of force unnecessary by reducing it to Geometry what this amounts to as lwh Hull points out is a return to Aristotle&#x27;s idea that there are various kinds of natural Motion in various parts of the universe it portrays the gravitational force as having a nature and origin totally different from those of other forces a conclusion which as H as Hull indicates is a step backward in the continuing effort to unify physical Theory once the existence of distributed scalar motion is recognized all of these contradictions and discrepancies clear up almost automatically the electric force is a property of a motion by definition the fact that this force is distributed in the form of a field shows that the motion of which it is a property is not an ordinary vectorial motion the force aspect of which is a vector but a distributed scalar motion the force aspect of which is a field as the electric force is a property of an electric charge We Now find that it is necessarily it necessarily must be a property of a distributed scalar motion it follows that an electric charge is a distributed scalar motion so the question what is an electric charge is not meaningless after all it is true as asserted in the statement quoted above that we must have something be behind which we do uh behind which we do not go but it is a serious mistake to stop too soon it is a mistake to treat something like an electric charge or force or the force that it is um that it exerts as fundamental when it is not fundamental when we go a step farther and identify the charge as a motion the answers to the long unanswered questions quickly emerge as soon as we know what an electric charge is the reason why it exerts a force is clear because a distributed scalar motion extends over a three-dimensional space it is an accelerated motion one of the one of the properties of any Exel accelerated motion obviously is a quantity of acceleration that is a force the reality behind fineman&#x27;s question that force is more than the defined quantity also becomes evident in explaining his statement Fineman notes that in dealing with Force the tcid assumption is always made that the force is equal to zero unless some physical body is present we can now see that the presence of this physical body is not something in addition to the definition of force it is implicit in the definition force is a property of emotion and the existence of identifiable motion involves a physical body okay uh we&#x27;ll move on to the next section here which is called motion and stationary charge the biggest obstacle in the way of recognizing that the electric charge is a motion is the observed existence of stationary charges how can a stationary charge be moving it clearly cannot move move vectorially if it is stationary in the reference system because vectorial motion is motion relative to that reference system recognition of the charge as a distributed scalar motion provides the answer all objects in a scalar system all galaxies in the galactic system all spots on an expanding balloon and so on are moving relative to each other but in order to represent such a system in a stationary frame of reference one of the moving objects must be arbitrarily coupled to the reference system in such a way that it is stationary relative to that system in the galactic system the location of our own galaxy is the point that is tied in to the reference system the position of our galaxy is the reference reference point in the balloon system the reference point is the point at which the balloon rests on the floor since the motion of our galaxy or the spot on the balloon surface that rest on the floor still exists irrespective of the way in which it is represented in the reference system that motion has to appear to the reference system as motion of the galaxies or spots with which the reference objects are interacting thus the measured recession of Galaxy a includes the motion of our own Galaxy away from a as well as the motion of a away from our galaxy similarly the motion of spot X on the balloon surface outward from some other spot y does not appear as a movement of x if x is stationary if x is the stationary point in the reference system nevertheless the motion of X exists and increases the separation between X and Y it follows that the motion which does not appear in the reference system as a change in the position of X is included in the representation of the motion of Y outward from X the situation of a charged object is similar such an object is moving either inward or uh toward all other members of its class or outward away from them but in the reference system it appears to be stationary its motion therefore manifests itself as motion of the interacting objects the facts revealed by the scaler motion investigation will be unwelcome to many perhaps most scientists old ideas like old shoes are comfortable and even though scientists are um committed to the advancement of knowledge in their field they find it distressing to be faced with the necessity of changing some of their basic concepts but we have no choice when we undertake to ascertain how nature operates we have to accept the world as we find it whether we like what we find or not those who are in the Forefront of scientific research have long realized that the simple view of physical reality that we associate with the name of Newton is untenable in the light of present knowledge and that the universe is actually much more complex the only question at issue is the nature of the complexity at least some of the simple ideas of long standing will have to be sacrif sacrificed but though it may be hard for most individuals to change their ideas as to the nature of something that they believe they understand as well as they do motion the Readjustment of thought to a minor matter compared is a minor matter compared to the bewildering mathematical and conceptual complexity that has been introduced into physics in the last 100 years by those who have been trying to solve the outstanding problems without the benefit of an understanding of scalar motion and its properties furthermore there are many uh compensations for the loss of the old and cherished but mistaken traditional ideas about motion every advance in knowledge clears up some of the previously existing difficulties and a big Advance such as the discovery of distributed scalar motion solves um a great many problems one of these is the longstanding mystery of gravitation what has been said about the electric force in the preceding paragraphs is equally applicable to the gravitational force Mass like charge is a distributed scalar motion that is not recognized as Emotion by present day science gravitation is an AS ECT of that motion that is the gravitational force is the force aspect of the motion that is uh called Mass just as the electric the electrical force is the force aspect of the motion that is called charge magnetic magnetostatic phenomena such as the force exerted by a permanent magnet are in the same category we will have to recognize that there exists a magnetic charge a distributed scalar motion analogous to mass and the electric charge there are of course differences between these three types of phenomena even though all are distributed scalar motions it will not be possible to explain the reasons for these differences within the limits of the present article but a full account will be given in a book to be published shortly in addition to the clarification of basic physical relations that follows directly from the recognition of distributed scalar motion this forthcoming work will also show that by combining the new knowledge of the properties of scalar motion with some well-known facts whose full significance has not here toor been appreciated particularly the fact that the electric charge exists only in discret units it is possible to establish on a purely factual basis the true nature of a wide variety of hitherto poorly understood phenomena but only in the field of basic physics not only in the field of basic physics but also in astronomy and cosmology all right that is the end of that paper the physics of motion by Dewey B Larson and uh I got lost there a little bit um but um the basic idea is that the universe is made out of motion but it is made out of a specific kind of motion called scalar motion modeled by a balloon with dots on it and um if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other um um lson really calls that the progression of the natural reference system and if you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other and that uh is analogous to gravitation and um that explains um Force at a distance uh there is no Force at a distance they it just appears to be that way when you assign a reference point that&#x27;s when you get directional motion is when you assign the reference point not before that the scalar motion itself is um not um directional and a distributed scalar motion is when you pile on rotation in addition to that uh that motion and then so the uh motion itself gets distributed over a circular path or a um surface path and um all of that basically you know uh helps Larsson be able to explain gravitation electricity electric charge and magnetic charge as all different forms of distributed scalar motions uh we will actually be uh reading that work that Larsson was referring to at the end uh called basic properties of matter and um he will go into this in more detail uh probably excruciating detail so um but again if these things kind of get you lost don&#x27;t fret just kind of persevere your way through it and just try to grab what you can and uh mull it over at a later time don&#x27;t dismiss things out of hand just because you&#x27;re they&#x27;re unfamiliar um just kind of persevere and move through it and eventually you know your subconscious mind will work on it and uh you might get more clarity than you originally thought all right well thank you for tuning in today and uh stay tuned for another video tomorrow thanks for tuning in</p>
