            <p>hello my friends here I am at night in the van and I just need to get this content out to you and I had a friend asking for it after I put the post in the on the channel um a post of a picture directly from bearden&#x27;s one of bearden&#x27;s books um about these concepts of what comprises a photon and what comprises a graviton so let&#x27;s just jump right into it and I&#x27;ve got the diagrams here in case I need to to recheck to make sure check for accuracy so let&#x27;s look first at translation so um translation is um release of stress and then we also have um scaler potential which is stored stress stress like potential but he refers to it as stress and translation so have translation and we have scalar potential which is um it&#x27;s basic basically this scaler potential is building up that stress and then the translation is the release of that stress so with the scaler potential we have the energy going in like this and then with this being the electron here and with translation we have two kinds of translations so we have this is the electron it can move in a straight line like that which would be a longitudinal wave sometimes called scalar waves and the electron can also move in sort of a curly cath which is um what I&#x27;ve come to know as transverse wave so the electrons traveling along this path here and the energy is being dissipated perpendicular to the direction of the wave so these two kinds of translation which we&#x27;ve looked at before in terms of longitudinal waves and transverse waves and then we have this uh scalar potential as like stored stress let me see if so this is also the E field he calls it I can&#x27;t tell you what that is yet the E field and this is the B field you see that I&#x27;m kind of going off the edge here so so that&#x27;s that so I just wanted to look at that first is two so in the caption he has it as um linear media translate horizontally passing a frequency without changing it right here so the frequency is going to pass without being changed at all the longitudinal waves whereas here with the transverse waves uh we have the nonlinear media translate vertically changing your frequency that is passed to it so here the energy the frequencies are shifting here the frequency stays the same and this has to do with harmonics as well uh but we&#x27;re not going to get into that right now because I don&#x27;t can&#x27;t guide you yet so let&#x27;s just go to the next part just going directly following his gravito Biology book and so next this is a this is the fun one here okay so we&#x27;re going to look at this is positive time and here we have negative time negative time gotta love it you don&#x27;t got to love it but I got to love it I do love it and so here we have an electron a virtual electron a lot of virtual stuff beardance world and in our world I guess too but okay so here we have our electrons now this is an electron they&#x27;re not both electrons I guess this is an this one here is an electron so it&#x27;s a negative charge and it&#x27;s moving forward in time now here okay so this is one call this Lambda which refers to the length of an oscillation so this one here is called a positron positron is a negative charge moving backwards in time the negative time stream that is a perfect mirror of our time stream perfect mirror of our world but everything is going in the opposite direction but if we were in that time stream we would look like we&#x27;re going in the opposite direction that time was flowing backwards for us from that perspective so this is a negative charge moving backward in time I&#x27;m doing the best I can y&#x27;all hope this is okay um yeah how cool is that that for an electron to exist in our reality a positron exists in this parallel reality and this is part of the whole antimatter concept A lot of this science is learning what the words mean and knowing that there can be many synonyms for the same concept can be many different words to describe the same thing okay so this is this whole thing right here is a photon Photon the construction of a photon is one is the whole thing including the part that&#x27;s going NE in negative time okay now on to the next piece and we just had to go over that first but these are fundamental building blocks that it&#x27;s like training to continue to be able to Journey it&#x27;s like sometimes there&#x27;s like necessary training to keep going um cuz if I&#x27;m going to show you all stuff Beyond this we got to make sure we cover the basics and that includes me making sure I&#x27;ve got it all keyed in so now this is the fun part here well it&#x27;s all fun but so here okay so this here is a graviton and this is um this aspect is pH uh so this line right here indicates that same Photon that we just looked at the solid line and but then this right here this is the antiphoton so this is a proton has a spin one and the antiphoton has a spin one so this whole thing is a graviton that has spin to okay I&#x27;m not an expert by any means with this but this is a coupled Photon and Photon and antiphoton pair so they&#x27;re coupled together here two photons Photon and an antiphoton so from what I can tell a grav you know if you look at this diagram here you can see how this is one Photon and then if we wanted to add that aspect in we would add another component to it I as far as I know right um this is little by little but you know I&#x27;m not I just kind of wanted to show this to you all even though it&#x27;s still early for me what a graviton is so there you go I just needed to get that out to you all it&#x27;s pretty raw you know this could be a lot more polished but then it would take a lot more time and energy and then it would delay getting it to you and you of course can find bearden&#x27;s gravito biology let me just confirm that this is from yeah this is from gravito biology so it is online somewhere in a PDF form if you want to copy the PDF you can email me I&#x27;ll put my email in the show notes CU I have a PDF that my friend sent me and it&#x27;s very hard to find this book in physical printing copy anyway okay hope that was good hope that was good enough for you all there is um a a digital monitor that we&#x27;re getting set up to be able to better uh spread this information some um people I&#x27;m friends with that are also wanting to help teach the same science and I&#x27;m learning a lot from them and they&#x27;re learning from me and this is all Cutting Edge stuff in a lot of ways you all not many people that know beardin work even in in the small community of people that I&#x27;m in that are looking at this stuff some of them have not really taking the time to look at it so um I definitely hope to get into Whitaker&#x27;s material as well because beardon references him a lot and Whitaker waves and the work he did so really looking forward to finding out more about Whitaker and his contributions but there you have it for now uh we have the electron and the positron we have the photon and the antiphoton coupling together to create a graviton and this coupling and decoupling of photons in the virtual realm is what generates a lot of the physical reality so there&#x27;s a lot of virtual stuff going on when we look at those um fundamental layers which helps us better comprehend how this is a holographic reality as well so okay so much love sparkly beautiful pixels of light that you are thank you for joining again and I will see you all soon take care</p>
