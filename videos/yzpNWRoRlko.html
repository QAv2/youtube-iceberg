            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I&#x27;ve been talking to people as recently as earlier this week in Netherlands where frankly there are objects that are still being seen by military personnel that cannot be engaged or shot down with the world&#x27;s best counter UAS technology. And this just mute me silence from much of the media who accept the lame explanation from the military that these are just um Russian drones. I mean, the implications of that, if that&#x27;s true, are extraordinary because not only does it mean that the Russians are actively and aggressively surveilling key strategic sites in Western Europe and the US with impunity, it means that we lack the ability to shoot those objects down because those objects are so advanced. And yet, what&#x27;s the noise coming from the uh the rest of the legacy media? Crickets. &gt;&gt; Absolutely, Ross.</p>
<p>So, we possibly could be in danger and we&#x27;re out of money is what you&#x27;re saying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh, I mean, I I just think there&#x27;s something mysterious going on with the ongoing so-called drones mystery and the um hypocrisy of much of the legacy media and giving the issue stick back in February 2023 compared with now with an ongoing issue that I think is far more serious is just quite extraordinary.</p>
