            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>This conversation explores historical records, research, and personal perspectives on UFO disclosure, theology, and government [music] secrecy. It&#x27;s presented for educational and investigative discussions. Viewers are encouraged to examine the evidence and draw their own conclusions. But when you get up into these upper echelons of the conversation, the questions aren&#x27;t are they real? Are UFOs real? Those questions are already answered at that level. It it appears that the famous Eisenhower treaty, what&#x27;s sometimes called the Greta treaty, is real, that it did happen, and that we&#x27;ve struck a Fouian bargain behind the scene, specifically with the Grey alien faction.</p>
<p>That is criminal because we have allowed citizens of our nation to be abducted against their will. Hello amazing people. Welcome to the Ryan Files. This is the first episode of year 3, and we&#x27;re not easing into it. We&#x27;re [music] going straight to the heart of the mystery.</p>
<p>My guest tonight is Timothy Alberino, explorer, researcher, and author who exposes the connection between ancient history, biblical prophecy, and [music] the modern UFO and alien disclosure movement. What you&#x27;re about to hear isn&#x27;t science fiction. It&#x27;s a story that&#x27;s been unfolding in the shadows for decades. [music] Because the truth hasn&#x27;t been lost, it&#x27;s been hidden. And as the walls of secrecy begin to crack, one reality becomes undeniable.</p>
<p>We are not alone in the universe. This is Disclosure. Let&#x27;s dive in. Hello amazing people. Thank you for joining me this week on the Ryan Files with special guest Timothy Alberino.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a researcher, explorer, and author who unites ancient history, biblical prophecy, and modern technology in one powerful narrative. His book, Birthright, the coming posthuman apocalypse, reveals how humanity&#x27;s divine inheritance is being challenged by transhumanism, alien deception, and artificial intelligence. Through the Alberino analysis, Tim exposes the mysteries of lost civilizations, the Watchers of Genesis 6, and the rising posthuman world. For me personally, Tim was instrumental in the genesis of the Ryan Files. His work pushed me to go deeper, and that&#x27;s when the world started to finally make a little bit more sense.</p>
<p>Timothy Alberino, thank you so much for joining me this week on the Ryan Files. I really appreciate you coming on, Tim. We met years ago in oh gosh uh in Peru um &gt;&gt; yeah with a trip with Blurry Creatures. Um kind of a crazy time in my life how that all came about and the the reasonings behind it, but what an amazing trip and an honor just to spend some time with you and and whatnot down there. But I follow you.</p>
<p>Uh you&#x27;re a busy busy man, man. And I know you&#x27;ve got a lot going on. We just brought you on this week to just you&#x27;re uh it doesn&#x27;t really matter what you talk about. It&#x27;s always interesting. So I appreciate you coming on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. Yeah, we we met in Cusco. Uh you you were you joined my uh my e public expedition I did to Cusco a few years ago. And I remember the first time I met you, you walked in and I thought, my god, I didn&#x27;t realize that Elvis was on this trip. So, it was uh you know, and and I didn&#x27;t know you were you were an Elvis impersonator.</p>
<p>I had no idea. So, that was uh that was really cool. And that was a great trip. Um we had a lot of fun, but thanks for having me on. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m game to talk about whatever you want. &gt;&gt; Well, I appreciate it, man. I&#x27;ll tell you one of the things that I&#x27;ve really been getting into on this side of things and then just following what you&#x27;re into. Um, always interested in this alien deception, whatever you want to call it, whatever the correct terminology is. We live in this world where I think more and more and more there&#x27;s this soft disclosure going on.</p>
<p>Um, where um I mean it just feels imminent. It&#x27;s around the corner in some way, shape, or form. Um, but my my interest in it goes deeper because it seems like there&#x27;s just so many, you know, when you get into the uh new age side of it and whatnot, man, it&#x27;s like the prime the pump is primed uh for something to happen and there&#x27;s already a devout following of this stuff that&#x27;s going to be treating it like gods, so to speak. So, um, always interested in finding out what&#x27;s the latest and greatest when it comes to, uh, disclosure, um, you know, aliens, uh, craft, are they real, all kinds of stuff. So, anything you got on that topic? &gt;&gt; Well, I&#x27;ll start with the the [clears throat] last question.</p>
<p>Are they real? The answer is yes, they are 100%. So, um, I interface with obviously obviously with with the general public in regard to this topic, but also with people who are members of clandestine UFO research groups, members of Congress and and and whistleblowers and I can tell you that, you know, you have the lower level conversation that&#x27;s happening in the public space and there&#x27;s a lot of chatter on X on social media about uh about UFOs and and the nature of UFOs and are they real and crash retrievals and so forth, but when you get up into these upper echelons of the conversation, it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s the questions aren&#x27;t are they real? Are UFOs real? Those those questions are already answered at that level. I mean, the the crash retrieval program, nobody doubts the existence of the crash retrieval program. Those aren&#x27;t the questions that are being asked. The questions that are being asked at those levels are how do we get access to these um to the special access programs? the facilities where this where the the SAPs and the USAPS are being conducted.</p>
<p>How do we get hands on the technology? And what is what races are we interacting with? What is the agenda of these races? How long has the United States government not has the United States government been interacting with these things, but how long have we been interacting with these entities? And what has been the nature uh of our inter of that interaction? What kind of bargains have been struck? um these are the these are the questions that are taking place at the higher level. So you have again you have the internet chatter, you have the you know you know the the the interest of the general public who are still stuck in this um [clears throat] in this cycle of debate especially among Christians in regard to the existence or non-existence of of these entities and and but at the higher levels it&#x27;s way way way beyond that. So um so yes the aliens are real and whatever that means to you aliens simply you know and when I use the term alien um I&#x27;m talking about a a sentient species that is nonhuman. Okay. And there&#x27;s a lot of debate as to whether or not that species is indigenous to the earth or does it come from somewhere other than planet earth.</p>
<p>And I think the answer is both of the both of these answers both of these uh questions are valid. And the answer is yes to both to to both of the questions. Yes, they have been on the earth for a long time. And when I say they, there&#x27;s not one thing involved here. There&#x27;s various things involved.</p>
<p>Yes, they have been on the earth for a very long time. uh in in probably some of them at least one particular race longer than the human species but but but they also don&#x27;t come from the earth um at least some of them and I I can say that with a great deal of confidence because I approach it both from a uh a databased orientation but also a biblical orientation. So I have a paradigm that is uh as you know and as my audience knows a paradigm that is that is founded on the biblical narrative but also um I&#x27;m always familiarizing myself with the the data set and with the facts that have been presented to me behind the scenes. So, um, you the the debate really gets hot around the the the question of of of a the nature of these beings and b the providence of these beings. And and there&#x27;s two things that I can say at this point unequivocally.</p>
<p>The nature of the beings is biological. Okay? The nature of the beings that we have evidence of, and when I say evidence, I&#x27;m talking crash retrievalss. I&#x27;m talking bodies. It&#x27;s biological. That&#x27;s the nature.</p>
<p>And what and not it&#x27;s not our biology, but it&#x27;s biological. And the providence of these beings is very very likely not planet Earth. Although they have bases here, although they&#x27;ve established presence here and have been here in some cases for a very long time. Some of them, I don&#x27;t think the grays, by the way. I think the grays have been here probably since maybe the mid 1800s.</p>
<p>Okay. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that there haven&#x27;t been forward operations, surveillance operations or forward teams so to speak that have that have come here in preparation for the establishment of bases. Right? So if we were going to uh invade a foreign country, the first thing that we do is we send the CIA and we send the elements of the intelligence community to embed and then we send the SF guys, the special forces teams uh to embed and to prepare in in a forward operation to prepare the invasion to prepare for the invasion force or the combat force that would be coming behind it. and to establish bases to to um integrate into the culture and so forth. This is the way that that we do it and that every modern nation does it.</p>
<p>So, uh in the same way you you could have had let&#x27;s be specific to gray aliens. You could have had gray aliens send coming to the earth, surveilling, establishing bases before um before the uh before they arrived in mass, let&#x27;s say, &gt;&gt; right? And that could have gone back hundreds perhaps thousands of years, that activity slowly integrating, slowly building the bases under the sea, under the ground. Um, but certainly the abduction phenomenon does not go further than the late 1800s. So if the if if the primary agenda, if the prime objective of gray aliens is the abduction phenomenon and the breeding program, then they they likely were not here or at least not very active on Earth until the mid to late 1800s. I&#x27;m probably giving you more information than you were looking for here, but &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But this is you know my assessment has my assessment hasn&#x27;t changed over the last five years let&#x27;s say the things that I suspected before have been concretized have been um affirmed through my interaction with various elements in this world and I and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to go back to this point I was making earlier. I&#x27;m seeing there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s an interesting rift that&#x27;s formed between the public conversation and and the conversation that&#x27;s h that&#x27;s happening at the higher levels. Um the special access programs absolutely exist and these are where the the you know this is where the legacy program is housed within these compartmentalized special access programs and those programs because because of the freedom of information act were once housed under the the government the DoD let&#x27;s say generally speaking the department of defense but because of the freedom Freedom of Information Act that that citizens can now make inquiries into programs to find out what the government is doing. They decoupled the legacy program from the DoD from the Department of Defense from the Pentagon apparatus and and compartmentalized it with within various programs under the opaces of the aerospace contractors. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you know, maybe maybe about six, [clears throat] seven, eight, maybe even up to 10 of them. And so what this has done is it&#x27;s made it almost impossible. It&#x27;s like um the it&#x27;s like the the the proverbial shell game, right? Where you where you&#x27;re just you&#x27;re you&#x27;re constantly shuffling the cups and and and and hiding the marble and you can shuffle it around and the American public there&#x27;s no oversight. the American public.</p>
<p>And when you talk about Congress, you&#x27;re talking about the American public. These are the representatives of the American people. There&#x27;s no oversight. There&#x27;s no constitutional oversight. There&#x27;s no congressional oversight anymore.</p>
<p>So now you you have what what are essentially rogue elements, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; who are in possession of of extremely important information and exceedingly advanced technology. And they don&#x27;t interface with each other. There&#x27;s no conference of aerospace contracting companies. It&#x27;s all compartmentalized and then even within the aerospace apparatus within each company the information is is further compartmentalized and and the activities are are subcontracted. So the aerospace company let&#x27;s say Loheed Martin they can have a program that&#x27;s that&#x27;s reverse attempting to reverse engineer this particular aspect of a crash retrieval asset.</p>
<p>Right. propulsion system or something and they may not have the whole thing. Another another contractor may have the other piece of this puzzle, right? But over here at Loheed Martin, they they have, you know, this is this is sequestered within one of their what one of their special access programs. You need the right clearances and the individuals working on this do not really interface with each other. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s compartmentalized to such an extent to where there&#x27;s almost no sharing of knowledge and then certain aspects of certain aspects of this are are subbed out.</p>
<p>Right? So you may have a military contra an aerospace contractor who h owns the facility and and is housing some kind of uh exotic craft or material non-human but they have a recovery program of their own that&#x27;s being operated by a subcontractor. You see what I mean? So, so I&#x27;m just trying to uh express how complex this web is, how how complex this network has become and to some extent the government has lost control of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. So imagine you as if you&#x27;re a happen to be a congressman and you are making inquiries into the legacy program, you are immediately faced with this impenetrable web because even if you encounter somebody that knows something, they only know one aspect.</p>
<p>They they can only pull on one thread of this network of this web. And so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s so highly compartmentalized that it&#x27;s difficult to imagine that there&#x27;s any one person who has a handle on the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow. &gt;&gt; And so when that happens, you get rogue institutions.</p>
<p>You get rogue organizations. The technology falls into the hands of of nefarious people in some cases because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s outside of basically it&#x27;s it&#x27;s outside of con constitutional oversight at that at this point. And this is, you know, one of the primary concerns at the congressional level is this needs to come back under constitutional oversight, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This needs to come back under the oversight, you know, not just of of the Pentagon, but of Congress. And so there are efforts being made behind the scenes, very noble efforts, very strategic efforts to try and re in this mess. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>in the effort to hide this stuff from the American people and because of the Foye Act, they&#x27;ve created a web they&#x27;ve created an absolute um chaotic mess that is out of control and and in in one aspect of this is understandable because you know we want to hide our secrets from our adversaries. So if if citizens can make foyer requests, you can start to expose programs, legitimate national security interests um that are that can be damaging to to the United States, to the security apparatus. Um that&#x27;s understandable, but that wasn&#x27;t the full motivation. I don&#x27;t even think it was the primary motivation. The primary motivation has been to hide this reality from the American populace and then from from the citizens of the world.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s financial interests involved and then there&#x27;s there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a power struggle involved behind the scenes. And then I think above and beyond all of these motivations is that there have been serious crimes committed, crimes against humanity. And I would I would go further. I I would I would cast I would frame this in a theological context and I would say severe transgressions against the God of heaven, against the maker himself. So, you&#x27;re dealing with sinister activities that are criminal and that if this if the truth of what&#x27;s been going on for the last, you know, five decades or so comes to light, then there&#x27;s going to be a lot of criminality.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s going to be a lot of people implicated. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to implicate elements of the United States government. the certainly the military-industrial complex and it&#x27;s going to be some of the most sinister things anybody has ever imagined that have been taking place and to some extent to some level we have been complicit in antihuman activity and and what I mean by that is the potential creation of hybrids human alien hybrids both on our side of the equation on the human side and on the alien side because we&#x27;ve covering up the um and implicit in the complicit rather in the alien abduction phenomenon. And what I mean by complicit in it is that I do believe and I think the the more I press the more I the more I interact with people behind the scenes, it it appears that the the Eisen the famous Eisenhower treaty what&#x27;s sometimes called the Greta treaty is real that it did happen. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>and that we&#x27;ve struck a fouian bargain behind the scene um specifically with the grey alien faction that is that is really um I guess the the the simplest term would be criminal um because we have we have allowed uh citizens of our nation to be abducted against their will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and subjected to subjected to a breeding program &gt;&gt; and because that&#x27;s what it amounts to and and in exchange we received tech technology technological insight from that faction from the gray so you know that&#x27;s one of the more [clears throat] I would say that&#x27;s one of the more controversial and explosive revelations that&#x27;s come out in the creator contract Eisenhower that&#x27;s come out in eupfology over the decades and and as I said it&#x27;s shockingly it from my point of view again understanding the lore but then communicating with people at the higher levels it looks like it&#x27;s true looks like it happened. &gt;&gt; Well you just unpacked a bunch there Tim [laughter] uh I wouldn&#x27;t expect less. Uh so I I oftentimes think about this in the same way as uh AI.</p>
<p>We talk about AI all the time and like you know Elon Musk a few years back was like hey let&#x27;s just slow down for a second. Well nobody&#x27;s going to slow down because the moment this company slows down this company gets ahead or this government gets ahead. Nobody&#x27;s going to slow down and the guard rails are going to be taken off. Um and it&#x27;s kind of scary just I mean this is a snowball effect avalanche effect going down the hill. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very similar in that uh these companies um or these special access programs, they have a lot of power. Knowledge is power. They therefore they have a lot of knowledge and they they have a lot of power and the fact that they want to keep it that way. I that&#x27;s human nature. But do you believe that we live in a world today, and this is this is kind of the thing, like do we live in a world today where we can trust every person in Congress? And I&#x27;m not man, I&#x27;m not downplaying.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, the answer is no. We&#x27;ve never lived in that world, &gt;&gt; right? So, because I mean, you can just I&#x27;m not going to name names, but there&#x27;s a couple people I can imagine getting this information, you know, about leaks happening all the time. that that comes into probably play as part of the the problem. It&#x27;s not an excuse, but you know, it&#x27;s just is it is it possible for it to change, I guess, is what I&#x27;m asking. &gt;&gt; Well, the there is [clears throat] a there is a very valiant effort, a valiant war being raged behind being waged behind the scenes to bring this uh to bring these what amount to illegal activities right now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. under the oversight of Congress and and let me rephrase that to to um to rectify to expose to some extent and to rectify the illicit activities that have been happening behind the scenes and to bring the legacy program under um back back under the control of of of the governmental apparatus, Congress and the Pentag Pentagon basically the the Congress and the Department of Defense. So uh and that that effort is real. It&#x27;s not feigned. Um and there there are individuals in Congress and and in government in general and some of the agencies who are determined and who who are running ops to try and get this done and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re met with a lot of resistance.</p>
<p>you know, at the congressional level, it&#x27;s not necessarily like some of these guys are threatened. Some of the congressmen have been threatened directly and um I know that that but uh but it&#x27;s more like rather than a direct confrontation. So what the government does in response as soon as as soon as the narrative starts getting out of control and you know everybody everybody has a cell phone with with relatively good camera on it, you can&#x27;t hide the phenomenon anymore. you can&#x27;t tell people that the phenomenon isn&#x27;t real, which is what they used to do. Um, so the the response is and now Congress is taking begins to take a an an interest in the phenomenon and and you know, let&#x27;s go back to the publication of the New York Times piece back in 2017, the Nimits incident and so forth.</p>
<p>So what does the government do in response? When I say the government, I&#x27;m referring to um the disclosure fact. I mean, the the nondisclo the non-disclosure faction, what what my friend Richard Dolan describes as the secrecy group, the group that wants to keep the lid on all of this and wants the status quo to continue in regard to the cover up. What do they do? Their response isn&#x27;t to try and shut it down and come out and and reject the claims that are put forward in New York Times. Rather, what they do is they create an a a a an investigative office at the Pentagon, Arrow. And it&#x27;s like, oh, hey, we&#x27;re interested in this phenomenon also, and you know what? We&#x27;re going to investigate it.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;re going to create Arrow, the all domain anomaly research office, [snorts] and we&#x27;re going to lead the charge in in investigating this. And then we&#x27;re going to then we&#x27;re going to brief Congress on on what we find. And so it&#x27;s that was created to satisfy the public interest curiosity and to give the illusion that the government&#x27;s also interested in this topic. And we&#x27;re going to get to the bottom of this. but also arrow was created to diffuse the growing interest at the congressional level in the Senate and and and House and to dissuade further investigative efforts.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And so how do they do that? Well, what Arrow does is it takes it&#x27;ll take, for example, I know this for sure, okay? I know that this is what they do. They&#x27;ll take, you know, 10, let&#x27;s just put a number out there, 10 incidents, UFO incidents, and they&#x27;ll do this in a briefing with the the Congressional UAP caucus, for example, and they&#x27;ll have the congressman there, and then they&#x27;ll go through 10 incidents, and they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll take layups, right? Incidents that are easy to debunk, and they&#x27;ll debunk nine of them conclusively, conclusively. You know, this is a Myar balloon. this is a flock of seagulls, whatever, conclusively debunked. And then they&#x27;ll have this 10th one where they go, &quot;Nah, this one we don&#x27;t know about yet.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re we&#x27;re still looking into this one.&quot; &gt;&gt; Right? And so what this does is it it gives the illusion that this official Pentagon office is interested in getting to the truth but at the same time is deflating the expectations of the congressional members the the especially for in the UAP caucus and dissuading further inquiry into the topic &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and it&#x27;s a very very high level psychological operation And it&#x27;s also it also gives fodder to the skeptics because they&#x27;re just going to parrot what Arrow the the the findings of Arrow. And it is a it is a very efficient way to control the narrative both again at the congressional level and at the in regard to the public conversation that&#x27;s revolving around this topic. And it&#x27;s been very effective. And then and then what happens is you get and this isn&#x27;t necessarily a psychological operation. This is just the this is just a product of the UFO community, right? the UFO research community is then you get hearings and uh we&#x27;ve had three so far and these hearings are conducted in the beginning in in in good in in they&#x27;re all conducted in good faith but the hearings are conducted at a at a at a at a let&#x27;s say um they&#x27;re conducted at a fairly highly professional level in the beginning because in the very beginning, the situation hasn&#x27;t yet been um compromised by by particular certain UFO celebrity figures haven&#x27;t compromised the scene yet at the congressional level.</p>
<p>And so you just get you get whistleblowers and then you get really inquisitive congressmen and then they they interact and then you get some explosive revelations and the congressmen are taken back because they&#x27;re most of them are green in in regard to euphology. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And you get a you get the most explosive revelation which was the original one from from David Grush. And Grush reveals because Grush worked in intelligence.</p>
<p>And he reveals that the legacy program is absolutely real that we have recovered nonhuman, you know, quote unquote spaceships or something like whatever the terminology it was. Um and and biologicals. And you get the the you get that what what people refer to the ontological shock &gt;&gt; that hits the congressmen who are making these inquiries because they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re not familiar with eupfology and and you get a very visceral and real reaction and and that first herring was was very impactful, powerful. But then what happens is you&#x27;ve get the the and and I don&#x27;t want to say this to denigrate anyone in particular, but then the UFO circus comes to town. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And particular personalities begin to attach themselves to congressmen and congresswomen and and and then and then the the the whole thing begins to degrade in in in regard to because you have a power struggle. You always have a power struggle among UFO personalities. Everybody wants to be the guy that&#x27;s most connected and that the that the public goes the go-to UFO guy, right? And and so that that that is in the mix now. And then and then and I&#x27;m just sort of look at I&#x27;ve been in meetings and and and regarding UFOs and stuff lately and and so this is all sort of what&#x27;s been what&#x27;s been percolating in my brain and it&#x27;s I&#x27;m just sort of dumping it on you right now. That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, so you have this this situation in which these original explosive allegations um hit the public and there&#x27;s a genuine response. It it forces a response. It forces a an inquiry at the congressional level and and the Pentagon to create the um all domain anomaly uh um research officer. arrow, whatever the acronym stands for. I&#x27;m not sure if I got that right.</p>
<p>And then you have in the public, you have a a you have a lot of newcomers to the topic who flood social media who who before 2017 were not interested in the topic, &gt;&gt; right? But after the New York Times publication of the Nimitz incident and especially leading up into 2020 and the and the first hearing, you have this new interest in the public space and all these people who were who were not students of eupfology for the last several decades. They flood the zone with all of these new fangled ideas about the phenomenon, &gt;&gt; right? and all these, you know, all of these these these following the the the celebrity culture and euphology and coming up with all these new fangled ideas and and so so there&#x27;s a lot of chatter down here like I said in the beginning at the public level at the at the level of the public discourse there&#x27;s a lot of chatter about interdimensionality and supernaturalism and time travelers and and all these different things. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. and and and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not rooted in OG euphology.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not rooted in in all of the research that that that that&#x27;s been done, the foundational work that was done in various aspects of the phenomenon um over the decades. And &gt;&gt; we&#x27;re talking about research that was uh compiled by by excellent eupfologists such as the late Leonard Stringfield in the realm of crash retrievalss or or alien abduction, you know, guys like uh Dr. David Jacobs and and um Bud Hopkins and Carla Turn and so forth and all of these people who sort of laid the foundation. We have acred because of their research a body of facts, a body of evidence and a body of facts in regard to the phenomenon that has been that has been in recent times discarded to some extent. Discard is not the right word.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s the all these new people who&#x27;ve come to the topic are just unfamiliar with this material. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because their knowledge of the phenomenon starts in 2017. &gt;&gt; Right. And so what I&#x27;m trying to convey is that there&#x27;s this, as I said, there&#x27;s this this there&#x27;s this disconnect between the lower level public discourse and then the higher level discourse with actionable information up here, &gt;&gt; right? and certain certain facts that have been established at this level based on based on um uh the realities that that are known crash retrievalss, biologicals so and so forth.</p>
<p>And all of this upper level reality, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is a confirmation of the old school euphology. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m conveying this right.</p>
<p>So you&#x27;ve got this confirmation of all the old school eupfology, guys like Stanton Friedman, for example, and all these guys that that postulated certain things, but the but the new UFO community is unfamiliar with that. And so they&#x27;re still playing the game of they&#x27;re still playing with all these new fangled ideas. &gt;&gt; Well, they&#x27;re also trying to play catch-up. uh you know, &gt;&gt; right? But not catching up in regard to [clears throat] familiarizing themselves with with with the decades old research and eupfology. Rather, they&#x27;re just following the celebrities, &gt;&gt; right? And those old &gt;&gt; attaching themselves attaching themselves to one personality or the other.</p>
<p>And so, you know, or or they saw this documentary or that documentary that&#x27;s been made in the last 5 years. And so that&#x27;s the state. What I&#x27;m trying to do for you, I guess, Ryan, is and in my own mind here is organize my thoughts and and and and um convey the current state as you were asking the question earlier, the current state of disclosure and and and this this you know what&#x27;s what&#x27;s beginning to look like a circus um a disclosure circus more than anything. Um, and so that&#x27;s my personal perspective being both down here at the public discourse level, but also up here at the upper echelon of the discourse that&#x27;s happening at the governmental level and so forth and and whistleblowers. Um, and then [clears throat] and I&#x27;ll add one more thing.</p>
<p>And then you get individual you get whistleblowers, &gt;&gt; right? what what what the UFO community has been looking for for decades, whistleblowers at the congressional level. You get whistleblowers who come forward, David Grush, Lou Alzando, primarily those two, they come forward and they they reveal information that is a direct confirmation to the old school uh to the work of the old school eupfologists. and their and and their testimony is rejected by a huge portion of UFO Twitter or UFO X for example because nothing because the there&#x27;s the the the idea the perception especially since COVID the perception is if there&#x27;s a whistleblower that&#x27;s being that&#x27;s being taken seriously at the congressional level then it&#x27;s got to be misinformation disinformation or deception right so the very thing that eupfologists have longed for for decades. Testimony at the congressional level happens in confirmation of what we&#x27;ve known for decades because of that you that foundational uh that that euphological foundation that&#x27;s been laid by these you know old school researchers and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s rejected out of hand by so many people. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&#x27;s so frustrating to me. And the reason that they were rejected is because, oh, this person was connected to the CIA or this person was military intell or air force intelligence, so obviously they&#x27;re lying to you, right? I went and saw &gt;&gt; because &gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead. I&#x27;ve been I&#x27;ve beenating long enough. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s cool.</p>
<p>I went and saw Lou Alzando uh talk last year and um it was a great talk. Um, I I appreciated it. But what was so funny is the moment I started telling people about it or I, you know, just said, &quot;Hey, I went and saw Lou uh online.&quot; But everybody and their mother was coming back with like, &quot;Oh, well, you know, he&#x27;s, you know, he&#x27;s just out there spreading disinformation.&quot; So, you know, there&#x27;s like you said, there&#x27;s this. [clears throat] It&#x27;s like, &gt;&gt; yeah. And then and then you can ask them, well, what what specifically, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; is the disinformation? Well, Lou is attached to Army intelligence or the CIA.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No. No. That&#x27;s not that&#x27;s not that&#x27;s not a description of the disinformation, &gt;&gt; right? All you&#x27;re doing is saying, &quot;Well, because this guy was associated with XYZ, or even because he he unwittingly, and I know Lou, unwittingly published a couple of UFO UFO photos that turned out to be a in one case a chandelier, and the other case like irrigation circle, and was very embarrassed about it, and very apologetic behind the scenes about it. Um, and I think publicly because the guy makes a mistake and he&#x27;s associated with the intelligence community.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just everybody writes him off. He&#x27;s a he&#x27;s a disinfo agent. He&#x27;s a liar. He&#x27;s this. He&#x27;s that.</p>
<p>Well, I don&#x27;t care about any of that. All I care about are the claims. That&#x27;s it. What is the testimony? What is David Grusha&#x27;s testimony? I don&#x27;t care who he worked for. I don&#x27;t care.</p>
<p>What is his testimony? What is Lou Alzando&#x27;s testimony? That&#x27;s what matters to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is Admiral Galidet&#x27;s testimony? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t care about this other crap because this is all drama. This is all reality TV drama that happens on social media. All that matters to me are the claims.</p>
<p>And the claims that all of these individuals have made conform to what has been known in eupfology for decades. So you have the body of evidence down here, the data, and the testimony of the witnesses conforms to the data. So from an objective perspective, they&#x27;re telling the truth. So where&#x27;s the deception? Where&#x27;s the deception? Where&#x27;s the misdirection over here? And what they&#x27;re saying is in direct contradiction to Arrow. So what Lou says and what and what David says and what the other whistleblowers have said is in direct contradiction to the messaging coming from Arrow.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the official Pentagon apparatus. That&#x27;s the one you should doubt. &gt;&gt; And and you know, are some of these individuals telling the whole truth? No. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They haven&#x27;t been authorized to tell the whole truth.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. And people say, &quot;See, if they&#x27;re authorized to say something, that means it must be by de facto deception.&quot; Because why would the government tell the American people the truth? Because the government is not monolithic. The government is made up of people. People like you, people like me, people like the audience listening to this podcast. It is made up of people with different persuasions, different moral compasses and and these some of these individuals believe that the lid should be sealed tight on this topic.</p>
<p>The public does not have the need to know and that natural national interests national security interests are reign supreme over everything. That&#x27;s the disclosure that&#x27;s the uh secrecy group. And then you have individuals over here who&#x27;ve said this has got gone on long enough. The American people need to be informed at some level because there&#x27;s criminal activity over here and we need congressional oversight. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s the other group.</p>
<p>Both of those groups exist simultaneously. They&#x27;re both fighting behind the scenes. These are it&#x27;s a factional it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a um it&#x27;s a factional contest that&#x27;s happening behind the scenes. So yes, you have element elements of the governmental apparatus, the intelligence community, the military-industrial complex who are attempting to keep the lid tight on this thing and discredit everybody and anything that has to do with it. But then you have this side with the whistleblowers.</p>
<p>And there are, let me tell you this, there are a lot more whistleblowers that have come forth behind the scenes. Not publicly. Why haven&#x27;t they come forth publicly? Because there is no uh there is no official apparatus in place to protect them and their families and their pensions. There&#x27;s no apparatus. And um Congressman Tim Burchett tried to draft he drafted legislation and he had the support of of Berles and and Luna and others at the congressional level tried to get it passed to protect whistleblowers and it keeps getting rejected.</p>
<p>So So why don&#x27;t more people come forward? Because they don&#x27;t want to die. They don&#x27;t want their families threatened. They don&#x27;t want their careers ruined. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we had someone come forward, David Grush, whose whose professional career was ruined. He basically became unemployed after he came forward.</p>
<p>And it it it caused him a lot of grief. And thank God that uh um um Congressman Eric Berles had the insight to employ David Gush himself. So now Gush is working in in at Berles&#x27;s office. very strategically and they&#x27;re doing a lot of great work behind the scene. By the way, &gt;&gt; those guys are are are doing a lot of great work behind the scenes and they don&#x27;t get the accolades they deserve.</p>
<p>Instead, they get all the, you know, criticism. They don&#x27;t get the accolades they deserve. And and so that&#x27;s what h that&#x27;s just one example. David Gush, military, a distinguished career in in the military and in the intelligence community, comes forward to tell the American people that that about the legacy crash retrieval program. And his what happens? He becomes gainfully unemployed.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s really the right way to say he becomes unemployed, right? and unemployable, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; In the profession that he spent his life &gt;&gt; um uh building, you know, uh um building up a uh his uh what&#x27;s the word I&#x27;m looking for here? um his portfolio, right, in his professional career. And suddenly he&#x27;s kicked out &gt;&gt; because he told the truth and people wonder why more whistleblowers don&#x27;t come forward. And that and and there were threats behind the scene against him, his life, not just his career, his life. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And so so the the the main problem we have is there is no protection for whistleblowers.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no protection. protection for their their lives, the lives of their families and their and their careers and pensions. And that&#x27;s part of the battle happening behind the scenes. So you have the dis you have the disclosure faction fighting for protection for whistleblowers and you have the secrecy faction fighting against it and and and as this battle is taking place at the higher echelons, you have you have dozens and dozens of whistleblowers coming to the congressmen and to the various governmental apparatus who are coming with stories and are coming with information, but they&#x27;re not going to go public. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Until they&#x27;re waiting for this this infrastructure to be put into place that will protect them, that will that will allow them to tell the truth without destroying their lives. &gt;&gt; And all of those hypocrites on social media and UFO X and so forth who say, &quot;Well, they should come forward no matter what and tell the truth.&quot; You wouldn&#x27;t, &gt;&gt; right? Easier said than done. you would not do it. If your if your life was going to be threatened, the lives of your family members and your and your financial future, you wouldn&#x27;t do it. So, um it&#x27;s very frustrating.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m both encouraged at what I&#x27;ve learned and I&#x27;m both very frustrated. I&#x27;m frustrated by the public&#x27;s response to a lot of this. And um and there&#x27;s, you know, you&#x27;ve got these you&#x27;ve got these, you know, these uh debunkers out there, professional debunkers on on social media, the guys who interact with my posts or whatever. And they&#x27;re simply not, you know, they&#x27;re looking at it from the same level as as the lay person. When I say lay, I just mean the the the the general public.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re just looking at it from afar. They&#x27;re not privy to the information at the upper echelons. They don&#x27;t know. And so they&#x27;re they&#x27;re trying to debunk something down here, but they&#x27;re not in these conversations up here. And were they in these conversations, they wouldn&#x27;t they wouldn&#x27;t be skeptics anymore.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I get it. &gt;&gt; So So So it&#x27;s a very interesting landscape right now. And um and I I don&#x27;t know if you want to talk about the Atlas situation because I I know a lot of people are and I know you&#x27;ve done that already on your your show, but I know a lot of people are very anxious about Atlas right now. &gt;&gt; Well, I I do want to talk about Atlas. Let me ask you one question and I don&#x27;t know to what degree you can even or want to talk about this, but let me just throw it out there.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a student of World War II history. Um find it fascinating. um you know, World War II Germany, uh the technology they had, obviously the war goes the way it goes, Operation Paperclip, um during some of this time, uh stuff with Jack Parsons freely admitting, hey, you know, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m in the occult and I&#x27;m using my occult connections to get knowledge to make the best rocket ever, you know. Um and then I&#x27;m going to go out in the desert and do the Babylon working with Elbron Hubard. Occult is what I&#x27;m talking about.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a lot of connections with the occult in World War II, technology and whatnot that fostered, some might say, a an occult connection in government uh in some of these higher technological um you know, programs and whatnot where you&#x27;re trying to get information from the other side. Does any of that in any way, shape, or form play into this this struggle? Because, you know, you start talking about abductions. Uh Harvard uh professor said there&#x27;s like 21 points where it&#x27;s the same thing as SRRA. Um you know, there&#x27;s a lot of just occult connections with &gt;&gt; Well, let me contest that right away. Alien abduction, SRA have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There are no points. Okay. So, the only thing that you could say is both of these are traumatic incidents. Sure. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s it.</p>
<p>The the alien because there&#x27;s there&#x27;s there&#x27;s an understanding of alien abduction at uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s an inch deep and a mile wide on the internet. Okay. And it&#x27;s been conflated with um it&#x27;s been conflated with demonic activity. Um it&#x27;s been conflated with satanic ritual abuse. It and and that but the there there&#x27;s no data there.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just opinions. It&#x27;s chirping birds on podcasts and stuff. And it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s information in some cases. Information that has been fabricated out of whole cloth. &gt;&gt; Information that has has been generated by the fantasies of mentally [snorts] ill individuals that has been perpetuated, propagated on the internet and has been has been taken as fact.</p>
<p>And so you have a fantasy world over here, not just not just um not just into which the abduction phenomenon is accommodated, but but but all kinds of things that is not based on reality. You have particular individuals out there who are mentally ill who have who are perhaps themselves uh victims of abuse, sexual abuse maybe by family members and who have who have recast their abuse recast themselves that let me rephrase this who who because you can&#x27;t live let&#x27;s okay let&#x27;s break this down psychologically. So, let&#x27;s say that, and I&#x27;m going to close the loop on this in a minute, but let&#x27;s say that you have that you have endured un unthinkable sexual abuse in your life by especially family members. And that strips you of dignity, of your dignity. It it steals your dignity away.</p>
<p>It gives you a a it it causes you to have to carry this perception of yourself around. That&#x27;s a victim mentality. Not not a victim mentality that that you know we talk about in popular culture, but but but a a victim almost like a victim psychosis where you know this happened to you. You were defenseless to stop it and it it diminishes your self-worth. It robs you of your dignity and you now have to go through the rest of your life carrying this ugly burden.</p>
<p>Right? So what some people do, especially in the severe cases, satanic ritual abuse for example, what some people do in order to cope, it&#x27;s a coping mechanism. in order to be able to survive in the real world, right? To go to your job and and and go to the grocery store and buy groceries and pay your taxes and and and interact civily with your family and friends. What you what people do is they recast the they reframe rather this terrible incident or this episode in their life. They reframe it and they they they change the parameters. They change the details.</p>
<p>They change the story into a fantastical narrative and then they recast themselves in the narrative not as a victim but as a hero. &gt;&gt; Okay? And when you do that, you&#x27;ve taken the trauma, this ugly, terrible uh um traumatizing event, you&#x27;ve reframed it, you&#x27;ve fantasized it. Let me give you something a little bit more specific. You&#x27;re raped when you&#x27;re young. You take that scenario and you change it so that now you&#x27;re not just raped by your dad or something.</p>
<p>You were a participant in a top secret program that was breeding Nephilim and that you were, you know, you were you were an assassin. and you were trained to be an assassin within this program and so forth and so on. And Joseph Mangle, it wasn&#x27;t just your father who was raping you. It was Joseph Mangle who was who was doing experimentations on you. And then and then I&#x27;m weaving in, by the way, narratives I heard from individuals personally over the years.</p>
<p>Yeah. and and then you weren&#x27;t just this, you know, this unfortunate uh child who was subjected to this uh abuse by his family me member now cuz that&#x27;s a victim. Now you&#x27;re the hero in the story, right? And now you&#x27;re going to come forward and expose this conspiracy cuz cuz you&#x27;re now the hero figure. This happens all the time now on the internet. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And these individuals, they get, you know, I&#x27;m going to use the the modern term platformed. Um, and and then their stories get picked up in cyberspace, propagated, and it begins to form a it it it gets integrated into people&#x27;s minds as reality. So now you have a you have reality in which a reality in which these people&#x27;s stories are true, but they&#x27;re not. And now people are basing now people are using this this substrate this this this foundational um this foundational story that they&#x27;ve heard to to derive from it doctrine in the worst cases to derive from it a perspective of the UFO phenomenon to derive from it a perspective of whatever. And so you have literally a fantasy world that&#x27;s just burgeoning burgeoning online right now.</p>
<p>And and it&#x27;s within that fantasy world that the abduction phenomenon is related to sexual um satanic ritual abuse. Because when you when you look at the data again going back to the OG euphologist the data acred by very competent researchers very very carefully. It doesn&#x27;t conform whatsoever to satanic ritual abuse. It doesn&#x27;t conform whatsoever to out-of- body experiences. It doesn&#x27;t conform whatsoever to near-death experiences.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t. It is its own unique phenomena. Its own unique phenomenon. And it doesn&#x27;t, by the way, conform to the stories of sky people and fairies and gnomes and all of that medieval um lore. Right.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry, Jack. Um, for those who are huge Valet fans, and I&#x27;m a fan of valet myself, Jacques Valet was was his equation. I mean, uh, that&#x27;s not the right way to say it. Um, um, what&#x27;s the word I&#x27;m looking for? His comparison of the abduction phenomenon with the fantastical stories from medieval times is invalid because the phenomenon does not comport. It does not conform to those fairy tale stories.</p>
<p>It is systematic. It is methodical. It is the same everywhere at all times. And there has never been ever in the history of mankind a systematic program of abdu alien abduction like has been happening and is still happening and has been happening since the late 1800s. This is a unique thing.</p>
<p>This it stands alone and and people for whatever reason are desperately trying to lump it into again satanic ritual abuse or or the like the and the thing with Valle is is that the phenomenon has been wearing different masks so to speak. You know, back in the medieval times, the the alien presence was presenting itself as fairies and gnomes and sky people and so forth to conform to the the cultural zeitgeist of the age. And then today, the phenomenon is is now wearing the mask of the gray alien and the flying saucer and and conforming to the um the cultural zeitgeist of the modern age. And then if we go back to the turn of the century, the phenomenon was presenting itself um within the cultural context of this of steampunk fantasy. Jules Vern, for example, with these, you know, this was called the mystery airship phenomenon in which people were seeing these these these large um magnificent airships with balloons and propellers and all these kind of things and and pilots, human pilots.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s Jules Vern steampunk. And so they said, &quot;Aha, the phenomenon is just conforming to the cultural zeitgeist.&quot; Well, the the problem is it&#x27;s not accurate. Let&#x27;s let&#x27;s talk for a second about the airship phenomenon back at the turn of the century. The airship turn of the 20th century. The airship phenomenon, two things.</p>
<p>A, a large body of that material is fantastical, embellished, uh, sensational and totally invalid. Okay, a huge percentage of that. It was newspapers who at the time periodicals were in competition with each other. They did this with giants also by the way. So you have a lot of the material is very fantastical and and the objective of the newspapers was to was obviously to attract attention with these wild stories, right? So you can shave off even with the stories of giants and the the recovery of the bones of giants.</p>
<p>You can shave off like 80% right now. You can shave it off of the airship stuff and of the giants. You can that that top 80% is fluff is foam, right? But you&#x27;re left with 10 to 20% of reality when it as it pertains to giants as it pertains to the quote unquote airship phenomenon. And and when you deal with that last 10 20% again after after removing the fantas fantastical element you have concrete historical fact both with the Smithsonian&#x27;s own records in regard to the recovery of the bones of giants and undeniable records that have that that pertain to that. Abraham Lincoln who talked about the the the bones of that ancient race of the of giants.</p>
<p>um they&#x27;re in the mounds of America, right? [snorts] And then on the on the euphological side, you have accounts of craft that are completely entirely consistent with a modern UFO phenomenon. Saucers, cigar- shaped craft, gray aliens, the whole deal, right? So, the phenomenon wasn&#x27;t changing its aspect. It wasn&#x27;t presenting itself conforming to the zeitgeist of that era. It was we were fantasizing. We were injecting our cultural um our our our cultural the word I&#x27;m looking for here.</p>
<p>Um our let&#x27;s just say our cultural ideas, our our cultural concepts is what I was looking for onto the phenomenon. Okay. So, but when you distill when you distill the information down to raw data, you have something that looks very much like what&#x27;s going on today. And the reason why I bring that up is because the same the same is the case for the abduction phenomenon. When you when you when you remove the foam from the top of the cup, so to speak, and you deal with just the data and the reality that can that that has been um confirmed and affirmed with many cases, thousands of cases of abductees, cases, by the way, which I&#x27;m still getting today and people I interact with and who come to me all the time, the abduction phenomenon has not ended.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not over. The the breeding program, it went into it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s maturated. It&#x27;s entering new phases, but it&#x27;s not it didn&#x27;t go away as so many talking heads on social media want to say. It&#x27;s not true. It has not ceased.</p>
<p>When you distill that down, you have a body of data that is conclusive, right? It&#x27;s a systematic program and and and the purpose of the program. It&#x27;s not experimentation. It&#x27;s not messaging, by the way. It&#x27;s not new age messaging. Abductees, for the most part, unless they&#x27;re screen memories, unless they&#x27;re recounting screen memories, do not receive messages from gray aliens.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re just subjected to the breeding program. Sperm is taken from the males. Eggs are and overtaken from from females. Um um zygot are implanted, fetuses are harvested, so and so forth. And that&#x27;s the reality.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s that&#x27;s what&#x27;s been going on in the beginning and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s still going on today. Although now we&#x27;re dealing with what Dr. Jake Jacobs describes as as uh advanced human alien hybrids, hubids as he denominates them and their integration into human society. Okay, that&#x27;s where we are today. So, um, and that&#x27;s sort of what I was talking about earlier, and I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll shut up here, but that that&#x27;s what I was talking about earlier when I was saying that there&#x27;s a disconnect between the new fangled ideas being propagated by the newcomers to the UFO research community who who don&#x27;t have deep roots.</p>
<p>And so, you have all of these wild ideas popping up. And meanwhile up here at the upper echelons, you know, people are dealing with the stone cold facts which conform to the data that has been acred over decades by competent eupfologists. And that&#x27;s that&#x27;s my soapbox uh uh pontification. Well, you you covered a lot and kind of opened my eyes to some things to uh um maybe a little bit of discernment uh as you go through with this all this stuff. I do have some &gt;&gt; and I&#x27;m not implicating any of the guests that you&#x27;ve had on your program.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know who they are. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So, I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not taking aim at anybody that you&#x27;ve talked to because I don&#x27;t know who you&#x27;ve talked to. &gt;&gt; Right. No, no, not at all.</p>
<p>I um I do have some people coming on um people from MUON and whatnot that are OGs kind of in the community. Um it&#x27;ll be interesting to talk to them and hear some of their perspectives and whatnot. So um that&#x27;s it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s all fascinating. It&#x27;s a little scary might be the wrong word. Maybe it should be the right word.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. But um it&#x27;s out there, man. And I I appreciate someone who can come on and just kind of lay it out there. I appreciate it, man. Thank you.</p>
<p>What about this? Uh &gt;&gt; well like I said these are the these are the thoughts that have been that have been that that have been ruminating in my mind based on again my interaction in the public space and then my interaction with the other group that&#x27;s at the higher echelon. So &gt;&gt; I got you uh we got this comment we&#x27;ve talked about it on on this particular program. There&#x27;s so just like the UFO thing there&#x27;s so many different sides to this. Uh some some are, you know, this is an alien spaceship. Uh some are no, it&#x27;s just a comet.</p>
<p>Um &gt;&gt; maybe the truth is somewhere in between. I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; You know, what&#x27;s your thoughts on it? &gt;&gt; Okay, so there&#x27;s not a whole lot that anybody can say about three Atlas. Let&#x27;s start there. Avibe is really at the center of this.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s really been highlighting this and and and drawing a lot of attention to it and raising some alarms. Although I think Avi probably behind the scenes thinks it&#x27;s a natural body, but we should be asking questions. We should be um not rejecting the possibility, not rejecting offhand the possibility that there could be something much more interesting going on here, that there could be an artificial component to this. That&#x27;s where I am. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I believe that it could go either way at this point.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a 50-50 in my mind. You could have this could be a natural body that is of course displaying some very unusual attributes. Um or you could be looking at something much more interesting. You could be looking at something artificial or you could be looking at something artificial embedded into something natural, right? Like you could be looking at some sort of a a probe or something that&#x27;s been that&#x27;s been concealed within a a a cosmic body. You know, there&#x27;s a lot of there&#x27;s a lot of play there.</p>
<p>Um, the comet is unusual. The the body rather, we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a comet. The object is unusual. It&#x27;s displaying some very unusual attributes. At the very least, it&#x27;s forcing astrophysicists to kind of rethink some things that they thought they had figured out.</p>
<p>And um NASA has has initiated some of its protocols um recently that some of its um I&#x27;m trying to think of the uh um exact terminology here. I can&#x27;t think of it off the top of my head, but NASA has initiated some of its protocols. And I think this there may be something unprecedented about this um protocols that pertain to potential impacts &gt;&gt; of of um of cosmic bodies. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Or something else.</p>
<p>Maybe a potential impact slash invasion, right? Something along those lines. Now, that&#x27;s not to say that anyone is necessarily expecting a invasion of aliens, but I&#x27;ve been told that there are that that threeey atlas is definitely causing a lot of consternation in DC. um it is being taken very seriously definitely by NASA and and at the DC level there&#x27;s a lot of trepidation right now and I think part of the part of the um alarm at the governmental level is the possibility of a near-earth pass because as we can&#x27;t really it&#x27;s hard to predict the trae tra trajectory of this thing because it&#x27;s not conforming to um what we thought were the laws of physics in regard to these bodies these cosmic bodies coming into our solar system and so there&#x27;s definitely some concern about an impact but there&#x27;s also concern that this thing is artificial and that I can tell you that I can report so Um, nobody really knows at this point and any and there&#x27;s a lot of fake images and stuff circulating. By the way, we live in the age of AI now. So, don&#x27;t believe anything you see um in regard to images.</p>
<p>Uh, nobody knows what this thing is. Nobody. And I&#x27;ve talked to people, you know, who have connections with the intelligence community and even at that level, nobody really knows what this thing is. Everybody is watching it. And there&#x27;s a lot more concern about it behind the scenes than than the public is being told.</p>
<p>And and and Avi is being I think honest. I think he&#x27;s just conveying the the honest perception of a lot of astrophysicists behind the scenes like this thing doesn&#x27;t look entirely natural. So either it&#x27;s either one of two things. either A we&#x27;ve got a lot of gaps in our knowledge about how cosmic bodies move through the solar system or B we&#x27;re right about what we think in in that regard and this is not a natural cosmic body. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s it.</p>
<p>Those are the options. So Avi Avi posted the other day um I don&#x27;t have it in front of me but he posted something to the effect of you know take your vacations before I think it was October 27th or 29th. Um, in other words, he expects us to have a lot more information about this thing, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; in just a few days because it&#x27;s going to be coming close enough to where our um to where our telescopes and some of our orbital telescopes and earth-based telescopes are going to start to get a much better look and have a better idea of the trajectory. And the question is if we and you know the real problem now is you have a lot of um you have your big telescopes the Vatican Observatory the ones that are in Arizona the ones that the government operates in universities operate around the world and those are very very high-owered telescopes but the technology that was available only in those kind of telescopes 15 years ago is now available to uh amateur uh astronomers. All right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, you have a lot of amateurs who are going to be aiming their telescopes at this thing. So, you&#x27;re not really going to be able to uh cover it up if it&#x27;s a freaking spaceship, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Is the point. So, you know, it&#x27;s going to go around the sun. That&#x27;s the current trajectory. Uh some people are saying it&#x27;s not going to make a really it&#x27;s not really going to come close to the Earth.</p>
<p>Others are saying it very well could. So the the the the point is I think that the the hype around this object is is warranted. It&#x27;s warranted. I cannot tell you whether or not this is an artificial or organic body. I think it could be either at this point.</p>
<p>Um I just don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough I don&#x27;t think anybody has enough data. Now I and and this is interesting to me because I have heard behind the scenes. I&#x27;ve heard some chatter behind the scenes and from various sources that there is a body that is approaching the earth. There is a a object that&#x27;s coming and it&#x27;s not three atlas. It&#x27;s further off in space, deep space, and it is it has been identified as artificial or at least allegedly identified as artificial.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s got a lot of people legitimately worried because that one that one &gt;&gt; in in some respects is it&#x27;s much more definitive, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That is artificial. And that one&#x27;s way in the background and that one&#x27;s not showing up for a couple of years. So, &gt;&gt; does it have a designation yet? &gt;&gt; No, not that I&#x27;m aware of. And I heard I&#x27;ve heard this chatter from various sources, &gt;&gt; you know, and and um so and of course then you have you have um uh shoot, what&#x27;s his name? Uh Jeremy Corbel. There&#x27;s this there&#x27;s a a video of him circulating where he was in some kind of an interview and he said that we&#x27;re going to be told that there&#x27;s this body coming in from outer space and it&#x27;s artificial.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a spaceship or something and it&#x27;s going to be a lie. He&#x27;s out there saying that and I don&#x27;t know what his sources are. Um maybe the same as mine, but um I don&#x27;t know about it. I I haven&#x27;t heard anything about it being a deception. All I&#x27;ve heard about is there&#x27;s a high degree of confidence that it&#x27;s artificial.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s not Three Atlas. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, is Threei Atlas, you know, again, let&#x27;s go over the three possibilities. Is it A just a cosmic body that&#x27;s defying some of our ideas about how those bodies are supposed to move around in our solar system? Is it B, a spaceship? because I mean that&#x27;s what it would amount to an artificial intelligently controlled object or C is it the is it the combination of both is it something artificial embedded in something organic to disguise it to conceal it &gt;&gt; as it moves into our solar system um but yet it&#x27;s the trajectory is being manipulated right those are the three options and and I and I and I I don&#x27;t lean in any direction specifically at this point I I think they&#x27;re all val I think they&#x27;re all equally valid.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, there&#x27;s something else that could be &gt;&gt; Yeah, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s anomalies. I just had uh um Dr. Rogers on it talking about whistleblowers at NASA &gt;&gt; uh guy 31 space missions doctor on the stuff and says he saw a aircraft in a hanger that was a saucer that had the US Air Force logo on it. Anyway, uh he wanted to talk about three IILs, too. And and you know, one point he made was there&#x27;s a lot of nickel.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re seeing a lot of nickel. Well, nickel in natural, you know, formation, there&#x27;s going to be a lot of iron with it. You have to extract nickel from iron. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re not seeing a lot of iron. We&#x27;re just seeing a lot of nickel.</p>
<p>And um that you that&#x27;s kind of an anomaly. So there there&#x27;s no doubt that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s anomalies. I do find &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s no question that there&#x27;s anomalies. I don&#x27;t think any the consensus it seems to me the consensus in the uh astrolog astrological community is that this is anomalous. This object is anomalous um and it is portray it has attributes that are unusual and unexpected.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s there there&#x27;s no question about it. So it it&#x27;s I don&#x27;t think Avi is is making noise about it just for attention. I think he&#x27;s just publicly conveying, as I said earlier, what astrophysicists are thinking and saying behind the scenes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s significant.</p>
<p>Even if it just turns out to be a natural body, um, we&#x27;re going to learn a lot. We&#x27;re going to have to readjust some of the things that we that that that that we thought about the nature of these sort of objects, their their trajectories, their attributes and and and their physics when they when they come into our solar system. So, it is significant. There&#x27;s no question about it. And there&#x27;s people out there who are taking advantage of this story as they do with every story to inflate it to conflate it to to uh enise their own uh and grandise is the right word.</p>
<p>Embellish the story to take advantage of of the attention and get more subscribers. That&#x27;s always always going to happen. But the reality is nobody knows what the hell this thing is. That&#x27;s the reality. Nobody knows.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s interesting to me because I&#x27;m hearing from some sources that this other thing we know about that&#x27;s further out and moving faster, by the way, that we we this one we know about, but this other one in front of it, nobody knows. So, it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a strange paradox. Um, but you know, if Avi Lobe is right, then just in a few days, we should have a lot more information. There you go.</p>
<p>There you go. &gt;&gt; And don&#x27;t take a vacation before the 20 I think it was 29th of October is what he said. So, and that&#x27;s probably hyperbole, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah, absolutely. Interesting times to be alive, Tim. No doubt about it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, there&#x27;s a lot there&#x27;s a lot of movement. there&#x27;s a lot going on and and um it&#x27;s from my perspective it&#x27;s it&#x27;s especially interesting because you know years ago um when I began in this field 10 years ago or whatever 12 years ago I had a lot of um I had a lot of hypotheses related to ancient history related to you know alternative historical narratives related to giants related to aliens and things like this. And it&#x27;s it&#x27;s interesting as I get older and and as I&#x27;m interacting with different people how some of these ideas, some of these hypotheses are becoming concretized into just stone cold fact and I&#x27;m able to just say, &quot;Yep, that one&#x27;s true, that one&#x27;s true, that one&#x27;s true. This one not so much.&quot; And um it it is a very interesting time in which you know in which um people are feeling more comfortable. People who who&#x27;ve had experiences in the military, in the intelligence community or or whatever who&#x27;ve had experiences.</p>
<p>Um the environment is different today because you&#x27;re not going to just be written off as a cook as a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist. People are taking these testimonies much more serious today than they would have been taken a decade ago. And so people are coming out and we&#x27;re talking about people who have proof of their involvement in these operations, people who&#x27;ve been on the crash retrievalss, people who&#x27;ve who&#x27;ve seen who saw or heard about or have firsthand knowledge of the Kandahar giant, you know, these these kind of things. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, so 10 years ago, these were just internet conspiracies.</p>
<p>today there&#x27;s and the public doesn&#x27;t see this because these people aren&#x27;t yet willing to come forward as I was saying earlier publicly because there&#x27;s no protections &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but guys like me researchers who are in the field are interacting with these people because they&#x27;re coming to us first we&#x27;re like the first level &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and they come to people like us to sort of position and wait till the apparatus the security apparatus is in place so that they can come forward publicly. And let me say finally that there is an effort, as I said before, I&#x27;m going to say it again. There is an effort in Congress to put that whistleblower security to to construct that that um that mechanism, that edifice for whistleblower security. That&#x27;s happening behind the scenes. So, um it&#x27;s going to get crazier is what I&#x27;m trying to say.</p>
<p>Uh, I just like to I just like to know the truth. I think I can speak for everyone, you know. Um, I think it&#x27;s time, you know, it&#x27;s beyond time. And, um, as we move forward, uh, exciting to know that maybe maybe something new is around the corner and maybe we&#x27;ll be able to wrap our heads around this a little bit more. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, some things are right around the corner. So, uh, like I said, in regard to the Atlas thing, maybe we&#x27;ll all be in three days from now. Maybe maybe maybe the history of the world changes. I personally doubt it, but but but maybe it does. Who knows? &gt;&gt; I gotcha.</p>
<p>Uh Tim, how do people get a hold of you, follow you? Uh Alberino Analysis, get your books, all that stuff. Let them know, man. &gt;&gt; Well, you can find my material. I mean, I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve written a couple of books. One, the Birthright, which is uh uh available on Amazon.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve written introduction commentary to the book of Enoch. my own edition of the Book of Enoch, which I published with Nate Henry and Luke Rogers from the Blurry Creatures podcast. That&#x27;s available. I believe we have our a website called bookofenoch.com. I should know this, but I think it&#x27;s bookofenoch.com or blurry bookof.com.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t remember. I can&#x27;t don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re the safest bet is to go to Amazon and and look for our book of Enoch. Um uh you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s it it has us as the author. So, um, if you&#x27;re interested in those publications, I have another publication with those guys coming out shortly before Christmas hopefully.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m working on some other things in the background. Um, if you want to see films I&#x27;ve made that that I&#x27;ve made that are unpublished and conference material that most people haven&#x27;t seen or just interact with me directly or interact with with the people other like-minded people, join my community, the Elino Analysis members community. Uh it&#x27;s growing rapidly and it&#x27;s some of the most intelligent um people that that I encounter anywhere and people with incredible experiences we have in there. We have we have people from every walk of life in that community. We have we have congressional people in there.</p>
<p>We have uh podcast personalities in there. We have um researchers, historians, theologians, scholars. We have uh uh people who are uh interested in Bigfoot topic, aliens, theological stuff, end times, whatever. It&#x27;s all there and it&#x27;s really constructive conversations in an environment that&#x27;s conducive to learning. Not an environment that fosters um hostility.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s social media. That&#x27;s social media. This is an environment in it&#x27;s a no troll zone. Um, and that doesn&#x27;t mean that everybody thinks the same. No, everybody comes with a diverse array of opinions and respectfully debates those opinions or engages in a dialogue around those opinions.</p>
<p>We do live, we do live streams, we do book, we have a book club. We&#x27;re currently going through Birthright, my book, and um, I&#x27;m updating some thoughts and we&#x27;re going systematic through through Birthright. So anyway, that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m hanging out most of the time is at the the albinois.com. I&#x27;ve been neglecting my YouTube channel, which uh um I&#x27;m going to try [clears throat] and remedy that here, but I have a YouTube channel, Timothy Albrino, and then of course you can find me on social media, X and X, and um Instagram. And I do have a Tik Tok account, which again I neglect, but I do have a Tik Tok account.</p>
<p>My handle&#x27;s always the same, Timothy Alberino. There&#x27;s only one Timothy Alberino, baby. And &gt;&gt; you said that like Elvis. I kind of like that. Um um and I do have a website, tenny.com.</p>
<p>But hey, was it was great catching up with you, Ryan. And um congratulations on your podcast. &gt;&gt; I appreciate it, man. Hey, and you just keep on keeping on. You&#x27;re your your voice is uh an important one out there, and I appreciate all your research, everything that you do, man.</p>
<p>Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you. And I encourage everybody to to to track with you and and your podcast and if they can to go see your show in uh in Branson. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I intend to at some point.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m telling you, I&#x27;m a big fan of Elvis. So, &gt;&gt; I intend to come see your show at some point before you retire. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You got to tell me when you&#x27;re retiring and I and I&#x27;ll make sure I get get to Branson to see your show. &gt;&gt; Man, if you got a conference or something, man, [music] come on down.</p>
