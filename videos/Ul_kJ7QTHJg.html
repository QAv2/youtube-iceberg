            <p>but through which we will explore this new system let&#x27;s first check up what do we really know and next we will examine our foundations and the third we select space and time and the fourth we reset a New Foundation and the next we clarify space time and motion so and lastly we start at the beginning first what do we really know conventional science starts with several assumptions let us look at some of the quantities involved in the physical sciences for example we have a number of fundamental physical quantities which are defined distance time Mass angle electric current temperature Luminosity amount all these quantities are just quantities of different kinds no one knows what they are made of in other words one cannot define space time and other quantities in terms of simpler quantities we rely on intuition and assumptions well let us treat if we can clarify this with some examples ready matters first and most fundamental definition which any one of us would have come across during our study of physics what is mass and the textbook answer is mass is the amount of matter present in a body now here&#x27;s a point to be noted both matter and Body in essence mean Mass hence this definition is nothing but a tautology mass is Mass and this definition is hence an assumption the Lighter Side empty space let&#x27;s look at the definition of space according to the Encyclopedia Britannica a boundless three-dimensional extent and again here we are encountering the same thing boundless and extent both use the meaning derived from the word space itself so whatever spaces its properties are again assumed to be true and complete space may have other properties too but we always start with this assumption time and time again time has always confused people right from the beginning of time what is time a measured or measurable period a Continuum that lacks special dimensions well the first part uses the word period which is nothing but time itself the second merely mentions that time is not space in other words it is distinct from space and so the model of story is we make do with the existing fundamental quantities as we do not know how to reduce them further it is necessary that we identify a new fundamental quantity this is the first step for a theory of the physical universe foreign to make sure that we understand how we are looking at the physical Universe first let&#x27;s check out a conventional view completely Mass something called matter exists which is hard measurable and resists a push in other words exhibits inertia this thing exists in a setting of space this thing also exists in time hence matter exists in a background of space and time this is our assumption about Mass space it has a property called volume and it has three coordinate Dimensions x y and z it is stationary that is measurements of space itself do not change with respect to time 5 meters would remain 5 meters today and tomorrow and Ever After we also assume a euclidean geometry of space at least in classical physics and a linear nature for clarity we shall call this kind of space as coordinate space because it involves the three coordinate dimensions let&#x27;s look at the view of time 2. the only thing we know about time is that the flow of time is registered on a clock it is a uniform unending progression it is distinct from space and there is a cyclical nature with respect to space this is a pretty simple thing as a clock returns to the same point after every period of time and a clock is a special representation of time hence we shall call it clock time the next important thing is concerning motion matter moves in coordinate space in some amount of clock time looking at the example via CHF running who&#x27;s at one particular point at 12 15 and who&#x27;s at another particular point after 15 minutes and the displacement of that person is what we measure in coordinate space and the time which we measure associated with the motion is clock time hence this is the old foundation in which we build our entire system of Sciences we assume that it consists of independent entities called Mass space time electric current temperature Luminosity Etc at this point we conclude our examination of the old Foundation now let&#x27;s put on a new set of spectacles and ask some questions what if space time and matter with different aspects of the same quantity what if the properties of space and time as we know it are just special cases and what if the unknown properties of space and time show up n and as matter one thing seems clear space and time are distinct so this gives us the idea that they can be identified as two aspects of the fundamental quantity now we know that the ratio of space to time is what we call as motion so we set up a new Foundation in which the fundamental quantity of the universe is motion something called motion and from that all things come out Mass space time electric current temperature Luminosity Etc they are all different kinds of the same quantity motion hence motion is the only thing since space and time are distinct aspects let us Define them in terms of the fundamental quantity space and time are the two aspects of motion this will be our definition of space and time so every physical quantity is a motion or a combination of motions a massive emotion an electron is a motion as a heat light and all the fundamental forces the theory must be able to explain the properties of all these quantities and it does do so as we shall see later a reciprocal system if you remember this is the name of the system so why the word reciprocal because we have to examine how a space and time distinct all we have said is there are two aspects of motion we call the distinguishing point of space and time as the reciprocal nature in other words space and time are reciprocals of each other this would be described in another presentation called reciprocity all the other properties are common to both space and time that is the important point so space was originally recognized only as coordinate space time was originally recognized only at clock time now we know that space and time should have similar properties other than the fact that they are reciprocal so this gives us a new idea there should also exist coordinate time and clock space in other words time can have three coordinate dimensions and space can behave like a scalar progression these are the header to unrecognized properties of space and time so now we have a generalized form of space and time pace one aspect of motion which includes both clock space and coordinate space time another aspect of motion which includes both clock time and coordinate Prime the question comes to your mind because we are speaking about space time and motion a space and time primary in other words when we say Space by time is equal to motion do we mean that the space and time are the constituents of motion or something more primary than motion no motion cannot exist without giving rise to space and time and space and time cannot exist without giving rise to motion in order to illustrate let us see some examples the heads and tails of motion let us make an assumption that motion can be represented by a coin the two sides of the coin are space and time if you notice there can be no sides to the coin if there is no coin and similarly if a coin exists it has to have two sides let us look at the diagram we have represented the coin as motion once had a space another side a stand the motion of the coin is motion and one side goes to another side which means that space and time are two aspects of the same coin one is heads and another is Tails which is which is up to us the ins and outs of motion let us assume that motion is represented by a box that would mean that the inside of the box is time or space if we want it and the outside of the box is space or time if we want it without a box there is no inside and no outside hence motion implies space and time and space and time imply motion these two do not exist without motion and vice versa looking at the diagram will clarify the things you have the box as motion we have space on the outside and time on the inside or time on the outside or space on the inside it is very clear that neither time nor space has any meaning if there were no box so let us summarize the view of the reciprocal system motion is the fundamental quantity of the universe it is the content as well as the container unlike conventional science where matter is the content and space and time are the container it has two aspects related as a ratio these two aspects are space and time and we cannot have either existent without motion they are the superset of the coordinate space and clock time that we use normally so let&#x27;s start at the very beginning with these ideas of motion space and time we shall look now at the postulates these postulates are very important the fact that they are the basis for the further development of an entire system of physical theory in the beginning there were two postlets and the Word was motion basic postulate one what the universe is the physical universe is composed of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time basic postulate 2 How the Universe Works the physical Universe confirms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is the euclidean
