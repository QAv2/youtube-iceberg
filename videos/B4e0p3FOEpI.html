            <p>[Music] huh we&#x27;re down in new jersey past the new york bridge we got a jumping lab with some far out kids chasing flying saucers with their tears and sweat the physics that they learned on the internet we gonna build a saucer gonna make it fly we teach the world some physics with some math on the side go go go falcon go yeah go falcon go let&#x27;s go falcon go yeah go falcon go yeah go show us the truth we used to study ufos from an old film track and now we&#x27;re building prototypes in the shop out back we&#x27;re testing out theories for the world to see we&#x27;re hard drive fulls of files anti-gravity now so now we&#x27;re talking science as we peg it apart we may not be there yet because it&#x27;s just a start well go go falcon go go falcon go go falcon go yeah yeah go falcon go yeah go show me the truth his mother told him someday he would lead our kind to understand the way in which our world is designed illuminating science that was lost to the past or hidden from the present by some bureaucrats i pray that someday we can trap some light with a smart skin craft we could be first and fly yeah go go go all right yeah we&#x27;re here at the anti-gravity lab and i hope you enjoyed my song um we&#x27;re here uh with jeremiah um uh and mark of oh and uh the falcon space crew and we&#x27;re here with uh the very special guest andreas i&#x27;m so glad to be here thank you very much yes ma&#x27;am alien scientist who wasn&#x27;t happy enough to be a wrist monkey no he decided he had to go full on alien scientist yeah that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s it i&#x27;m so psyched to have you here to uh to check out what we&#x27;re doing today i know in every respect we were trying to get this started earlier we weren&#x27;t even sure if we we could do it if the internet was going to go down if the world was going to end uh but um we decided we uh we&#x27;re here and we&#x27;re live and um you know it&#x27;s just uh it&#x27;s just insane insane uh making history well what and being part of history here for history um so we&#x27;re at the anti-gravity uh making science great again at the lab here um we&#x27;re doing a the podcat knob experiment um we&#x27;re going to be yeah experiment what is that again well there&#x27;s two parts experiments really um there&#x27;s there&#x27;s there&#x27;s this impulse gravity drive generator and then there&#x27;s the rotating superconductor one that&#x27;s the one that nasa replicated with uh um and with brantley and all those those other guys um yeah that&#x27;s an interesting thing like they kind of like they had some anomalous effects that they observed but then they ran out of funding for it and um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s super interesting because it&#x27;s not like the only research that&#x27;s ever been done into superconductors and strange effects like gravitational drag or where called kinemastic effects or kinemastic fields lots of different theories have gone around the physics community over the past you know 70 years regarding what the heck just gravity is and no physicist out there has a real theory on a strong theory on what gravity actually is or can explain it sufficiently what exactly it is the best the best one i&#x27;ve seen out there was a was a video that was done on on black holes i think it was like with leonard susskind and uh stephen hawking and it had i can&#x27;t find it anymore but we got to do the experiment where they had the waves in the tub and they had the two ships and uh that there&#x27;s all these waves going around in the sea of the what wave of the water the water represents kind of like the space time and that as those waves ripple around between the two ships there&#x27;s this sort of dampening of some of the waves because of whatever effect it is between the two ships that some of those waves get damp and what happens is the waves on the outside bounce around and then the waves on the inside are dampened so that there&#x27;s more pressure together and the chips eventually go and touch and then they&#x27;ll eventually just sit there and stick together to me as well objectify the metric so like looking at it as a dimension and it seems like we have to look at it more like a dimensional yes a fluctuation within the electromagnetic fields that are there yeah that is like the vacuum of light that it&#x27;s sort of this this uh this this zero point energy that sort of surrounds us this black body radiation you can never cool something down to you know absolute zero because then it stops radiating it doesn&#x27;t know where it is in the universe so it comes back into like this interaction is key to holding the whole universe together like things can&#x27;t exist outside of of this sort of wave space yeah and um understanding um our our universe in terms of this wave space and electromagnetics and i think an entanglement is i think key to under cracking is in the gravity puzzle i think that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s a lot of people this idea of entanglement but like if you really get down to like this idea of like ordered mouse traps out from something that we&#x27;re calling random like there&#x27;s definitely sequential events and we have to start using like neural nets or something but it seems like this experiment&#x27;s a great one because it allows you to start at least trying to find a metric finding a way of observing and measuring so that&#x27;s really sweet well yes this is like ripples we&#x27;re we&#x27;re observing you know ripples in space time or um i mean this is these are anomalous experiments that physicists discovered over the years and and they reported them um other labs you know were able to test these i i i guess the most successful replications were with the giovanni mona niece who wrote a book on all this uh he did a lot of work with pod putnov and a lot received a lot more better criticisms than the work that you know martin tashmore and others had done for esa and and also the the nasa experiments where they got like they they had like almost it was like right 400 000 if something it was almost 500 000 in funding why did they shut it down you think is just because of the like general timing and space you know it&#x27;s just a lot of politics at nasa it&#x27;s the bureaucratics one thing that like they can&#x27;t get things done as cheaply as we could do it in this lab here right it didn&#x27;t cost us half a million dollars to to set up and do this uh rep you know small scale replication and this is on par with pretty much what what i saw from nasa that yeah the videos that we saw out of nasa most of the stuff they&#x27;re doing i mean like you know they&#x27;re kind of their best bet is to kind of ship it off to discovery program get other people to do something with their labs they&#x27;re doing maker spaces they&#x27;re kind of hoping for this yeah i think they&#x27;re kind of hoping for this too because the politics at nasa&#x27;s it&#x27;s like these scientists want this they&#x27;ve studied a lot of technology but because of the politics at nasa it gets to this pro it gets to the stage and then they just scrap it for parts and then they shut down the program they say oh we ran out of money and you know all this where where do you go now and all these scientists get reassigned to other things and you know whatever has funding at the time and it&#x27;s really uh it&#x27;s sad and there&#x27;s a lot of you know there&#x27;s a lot of dissent within the scientific communities we&#x27;ve seen too because people a lot of people come seeing this and come forward you know they&#x27;re like oh nobody&#x27;s talking about this stuff and i&#x27;m like we&#x27;re doing videos on it and talking about this kind of stuff and then people are coming forward and being like oh my god thank you someone&#x27;s finally talking about this like i don&#x27;t understand why nobody nobody is talking about this anymore well that&#x27;s one of the good things about your channel actually like the fact that you go through and try to find some of these documents that nasa&#x27;s got but like they&#x27;re so obscure basically because they came from one project or another project that&#x27;s been shut down yeah but if you get all that paperwork together you get a pretty good idea for like how to really do this some stuff i mean you get a lot of ideas of stuff that they&#x27;ve tried and then you get to the the what it really gets to is the engineering and then the numbers of like can we actually build something with this you know is this thing going to fly is it so we can do something with this like and then how do we what&#x27;s what&#x27;s the actual effect going on narrowing it down so we take all these experiments we we&#x27;ve been working on the bandura jeremiah has been like focused on the bandura experiment really uh working with uh richard van durk himself getting amazing you know we&#x27;re able yeah this is amazing because we&#x27;re setting up these communities we&#x27;re getting these people the scientists come forward small community too they&#x27;re like we&#x27;re interacting more and more with the people that are doing that you know like they have to we have to well it&#x27;s awesome they have to because because who&#x27;s going to take this on you know the next generation a lot of these guys are getting up there in age and and someone&#x27;s got to be there to take the torch and take it to the next level and then really also approach it with a fresh young set of eyes to be like well this was all garbage and you know this is really you know this the the meat and potatoes you know what we need to be like you know focusing on you know that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot of meat and potatoes i mean there&#x27;s a lot a lot of stuff to chew through in the that database though the database that we&#x27;ve set up and the work that&#x27;s being done there um by those individuals is absolutely exceptional and uh we have we have now a ufo database of just scientific and technical information yeah i wouldn&#x27;t call it a ufo database yeah but the other thing is like anomalous aerial vehicles is probably a better term a lot of people get confused and they think immediately bigfoot or like well they see the alien in the military oh my god this guy has to do with aliens i had a couple scientists that didn&#x27;t want to work with me because of the alien thing they&#x27;re like oh let&#x27;s that&#x27;s all like you know that there&#x27;s no california there&#x27;s no such thing as an alien it&#x27;s only an undocumented worker so you know right you guys are used to this yeah you just have to call it something else man like it&#x27;s all right i guess i guess but but hey you know the whole idea is that it&#x27;s science that&#x27;s that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot of sciences it&#x27;s it&#x27;s so obscure it&#x27;s alien to people because they&#x27;re like yeah they&#x27;re like there&#x27;s no way nasa did this there&#x27;s no way last nasa worked with this guy on lightcraft international like that was one thing we dug up recently i posted a couple videos of that light craft technologies and stuff apparently that that took off they found a way to um put the microwaves on board to have them actually on board the craft itself rather than you know transmit it from the ground but that&#x27;s also been a thing with the uh 5g or any kind of kind of cellular system is this idea that theoretically you know it&#x27;s not just a weapon or it&#x27;s a technology you can do for all kinds of things you could have ionic lifters that are basically like a solid state as a cue ball rack and then that flies around you know it&#x27;s pretty sweet well then it gets into near field and far field effects because like a lot of those electronics are in the range you know especially when you&#x27;re talking about the 5g and that that frequency range it&#x27;s um those are those kind of electronics like the 5g they have to have a lot more towers because the range is a lot shorter right higher frequency the range is actually a lot shorter than the 2.4 gigahertz stuff which actually has a much longer range and it because it it&#x27;s a lot it has a lot more bouncing hence one of the ideas of having repeaters in crafts but like that&#x27;s also another thing that&#x27;s interesting about nanotechnology because once we&#x27;re able to do this on a large scale we can start looking at how to do this on a smaller scale well that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on right now with the technology that&#x27;s where this is this field is at right now when we look when we look at with the with the whole terahertz thing that uh tom delong did and uh you know yeah you know did it himself which is really cool yeah yeah he got sober he got up really early in the morning sorry no no but he tipped us off too like they tipped us off to some of that stuff which uh you know you look at it and then it&#x27;s like why did they give that that piece of that meta material to the us army when they should have given it to the air force because i went i was doing research on terahertz right and who&#x27;s working on it and then i found this whole thing about this terahertz lab at wright patterson yeah where they had this guy who was bringing home documents and i did a whole thing you know you know who did terahertz in the 70s john trump also if you start looking for john trump&#x27;s terahertz videos from the 60s 70s you can see videos of him talking about yeah crazy using vacuum tubes because like i i&#x27;ve been meaning to explore that whole john trump connection it&#x27;s pretty weird deeper you know dark journalist has been covering this uh quite uh quite a bit yeah on some of his podcasts well you guys see that cat video too right the time travel cat lady and she&#x27;s talking about the connections i mean there&#x27;s a lot there with john titor it&#x27;s some interesting stuff i i must say you know i&#x27;ve been doing a lot of my own research because we have the database too so we&#x27;re going like just basically i&#x27;m just going through the scientific literature chasing down bibliographies and papers and sources and figuring out who was working on what when and then you know the work that i&#x27;ve done a lot with patel tracing it back with john wheeler who worked for patel got in his fbi file a year ago and and tracing through all the work that john wheeler did with um you know from quantum gravity with einstein and then back to the quantum non-locality this whole this whole issue of the wave space right the entanglement space that that&#x27;s the biggest controversy in physics this er epr you know einstein i mean it&#x27;s screwed because metaphysicists with bright colored hair have always kind of made quantum physics look bad but if you start like really looking at this idea of um harmonies and resonance patterns and there&#x27;s like a frequency really to orbitals so you have like locality and frequency you know well that makes more and more sense in terms of entanglement because theoretically yeah everything&#x27;s everywhere but there&#x27;s moments that really shine and that&#x27;s kind of what we&#x27;re held together by you start to see like entanglement more as like causality and then that makes it but that really offends our generation they don&#x27;t like the idea that anything that they do has a consequence that is like physically directed it&#x27;s like karma actualized but if you figure that out then you figure out entanglement because then you&#x27;re able to move anything back to the locality of where it was originally and where it&#x27;s going you can perceive that in the future i mean theoretically so it&#x27;s not just any gravity like that&#x27;s like space time travel at its finest and this is what goes back to like the people that were studying it you said so i go to like you know you have to look at the top physicists in the country like who they would have went to with these materials and and this this sort of stuff if you take that alien alien uh the whole ufo alien side of of interpretation of things that you know the vatican and others have recovered off-world vehicles and analyzed this stuff and then we got dr gary nolan working with jack valley on pieces of you know material that are allegedly from off-world vehicles that that the public has ac has now access to which is that&#x27;s amazing it&#x27;s crazy if if that&#x27;s true which i you know you got to think like the drake equation says it&#x27;s very you know i just can&#x27;t believe that we&#x27;re the only ones out there and so there has to be some sort of these materials around somewhere if even if they you know came from an ancient you know dyson sphere that exploded right you know a supernova years ago that landed on earth to just you know they have to be out there in the geological record which carbonato diamonds that&#x27;s one of the things that i brought up yeah um but volcanoes have completely screwed up all of our radios because like anything we&#x27;re looking at carbon now we have to see the volcanoes are affecting the dating it&#x27;s like making inconsistencies in every dating system that we&#x27;re using yes yes so so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s lots of controversies in in revel in physics and inside but you know like the order of the dolphin and seti right like the connection with echo the dolphin to seti oh wow so john c lilly who was like the dolphin experimenter for the cia because he had cia agents that were dolphins you know you have like airport dogs you might as well have well hold on my friend adam would know about this he&#x27;s like an expert this is the weirdest thing about the drake esque this is a great one the drake equation in the financial scale so originally seti was started at um in the virgin islands at like saint thomas island by john c lilly and live chat though yeah we checked it out why is there no live chat oh there&#x27;s all kinds of problems with live chat tonight well okay we&#x27;re gonna do this really quickly though so like seti was just it started literally because john celia got his group together and said we&#x27;re able to talk to dolphins and start creating the ssi ecco echo program and so everything has to do with like looking in with radio to outer space is actually also looking interspace towards elfs and vlf bands which is a huge part of this but yes we&#x27;re now in hawthorne which is another important part of this i don&#x27;t know if this is recording we should check us out real quick yeah no there&#x27;s still chat yeah he&#x27;s working on fixing the sound and fixing the vlog are they not able to hear us is there a problem with the sound yet so guys uh if you guys um want to send us some money for a new sound board um i guess i should have brought the others down the soundboard that i had but i don&#x27;t know not getting hearing for me very bad hearing we&#x27;re talking yeah well so what&#x27;s interesting by the way hey i&#x27;m in dreams yeah nobody can hear yeah yeah you can hear me pretty good okay i&#x27;m andreas exertis and you guys have probably seen me before if you check out you know like tim poole adam krigler uh associated with them but check out my youtube exertis xirtus and then also there&#x27;s twitter you know andreas exercise and we&#x27;re doing all kinds of crazy stuff all the time looking at ancient history looking at nimza looking at all kinds of ionic lifters and that kind of technology but it&#x27;s kind of cool to be in hawthorne because there&#x27;s hawthorne in new jersey and there&#x27;s hawthorne california which is like you&#x27;ve got like nikola tesla and you got the tesla company so the tesla company in california they&#x27;ve got hawthorne which is the spacex lab but now we&#x27;ve got hawthorne new jersey&#x27;s alternative propulsion labs which you know started as an engineering conference that just went like full-on funded and is doing everything it needs to do to make and you know anti-gravity but really alternative propulsion ionic lifting every kind of experiment possible and um you know right now you can see you can see in the background our buddy here mark uh israel is doing some work i want to like check out um his uh battery system he&#x27;s rigging together some lithium batteries you want to talk about that oh these are nickel metal hydrate batteries okay um travis can you hear me yeah it&#x27;s gonna happen can you hear me okay good so um we&#x27;re connecting together some nickel metal hydrate modules here to power the coil for this take on the potluck experiment and i think jeremy got into this earlier that there&#x27;s different types of popcorn experiments um there&#x27;s also different like levels of you know of things that you can add to this experiment such as putting it all in a vacuum that we weren&#x27;t able to do yet it is pretty difficult to set up something like that but we do have it inside of a coil and we are impulsing it with a large amount of current rather than a super high voltage so this is 613 joules of energy uh going into the superconductors via a thyrotron sorry guys you look alright can you see that also you want to talk a little bit about your vacuum tube oh so this is the um thyrotron that came out of the uh um yeah the berkeley labs linear accelerator so this actually came from berkeley and they took apart the accelerator and sold it on ebay and i actually built this this whole setup in order to power it um this entire device is going to be floating at around 35 000 volts so we have a high voltage faraday cage here and there&#x27;s all different types of electronics needed to power the tube you have to give it some static voltage of 6.3 volts and then you have to apply a high voltage grid that&#x27;s all controlled via a fiber basically a light sensor over here so we&#x27;re going to shoot a laser through the side in order to trigger it it&#x27;s going to be a pretty cool experiment and we hope to see the results in a pan on the floor cheering do you want to show us what you worked on today this thing right here yeah let&#x27;s get right in there i&#x27;ve just got to change one layer so that&#x27;s why i put these support blocks on here prototypical so here&#x27;s basically what we have inside there we&#x27;ve got a brass bolt taper head phillips slider to a copper disk that&#x27;s one millimeter thick as wide as the ybco discs which are one inch disks and they are bonded at three points so we have a proprietary bonding agent combined with ccto calcium copper titanium oxide i think and a nickel silver powder and then we have just a plain pbo in the middle and on the other side we have a uh mixture of the pvo and a copper powder and the reason why we&#x27;re putting the metal powders in this material is the pvo is actually not very conductive so by cramming them full of these metal powders and sandwiching these plates on the ends of the ybco we&#x27;re able to get some connection to the surfaces of the ybco which are ceramic and very very hard to bind to and so the other side is just the duplication of the first side except for the binding between them and then that&#x27;s sitting inside of this little chamber here so i&#x27;ll pick that up for a moment to kind of show you what&#x27;s going on here careful with it so earlier uh your camera man right now mr alien scientist cut out these two wood discs for us and we screwed them together with eight standard household screws to create a nice bobbin which we won by hand this is 13.5 gauge very heavy build insulation copper wire and inside of the center is a piece of pvc to insulate the voltage and then that assembly you can see the top of the bolt there the top of the bolt is one of those brass bolts shown in this image and another one sticks out the bottom that&#x27;s our other terminal and so that makes up the load that we&#x27;re going to discharge the thyrotron with through this uh to the output of this capacitor and just grab as much current in here as we possibly can at superconducting temperatures now we have to have the magnet on for the time that it&#x27;s going in transition our superconductor through its phase of not superconducting to fully superconducting so that it locks in the field created by this electromagnet and that&#x27;s what those batteries are for they&#x27;re going to supply somewhere around 30 amps or so into this coil for about one minute during that transition phase to lock the field in sweet these uh batteries by the way are straight out of our scrap pile and what are we using to uh take measurements uh where are we gonna just gonna look for observable effects any kind of in the water yeah at this point and then before we set up anything to take data right because this is such a it&#x27;s such a fringe type of experiment there&#x27;s so little known about exactly what makes it work and what doesn&#x27;t now multiple laboratories have attempted to replicate this work and have failed for one reason or another and so uh seemingly the only people that can get this to work are the inventors themselves that be poor and pog cut off so this is more of like a uh unruly combination between poor and podcanoff because we&#x27;re not using poor&#x27;s proprietary mixture of superconductors and dual substrate junctions we&#x27;re using more of a popcorn off style mixture where we have two different superconductors where joseph&#x27;s conjunctions are formed between each plate and the connection between the two superconductors and also like popcorn offer using a slightly higher voltage 35 000 volts in this case instead of four is much lower 9000 or so uh so we&#x27;re going more on the high voltage side because we have a thyrotron which has given us that voltage rating and because we&#x27;re going to get a little more current through this thing at a higher and that&#x27;s dr claude p-o-h-e-r for anyone that wants to go look that up yeah very interesting experiment it&#x27;s a uh it&#x27;s a much more i guess refined version of packing off that is if it works but again nobody has really successfully replicated it at this point which is a problem so we&#x27;re just doing a basic pass fail because we&#x27;re not even sure what like we said the conditions are that make it work so if this does actually do something if it does produce the effects that we&#x27;re looking for then or any effect at all then we know we&#x27;re in the right direction and we can start worrying about taking actual measurements of this thing right now our test is going to be simply placing some water in this pan and reflecting an image of a grid off the surface of that water in the dark which will give us a nice disruption pattern that we can see if the surface of this water moves so if a beam does come out the bottom of this thing or the top we&#x27;ll definitely see it at the bottom on the top we can place something very lightweight like maybe a piece of styrofoam just to see if anything moves or quite frankly if it seems to be doing something i&#x27;ll just stick my hand there and see if i can feel it we can put like a a little small neodymium magnet on a little floating thing in the middle of the water too to see if there&#x27;s like uh i&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s gonna be a big magnetic involvement but that&#x27;s not going to indicate whether or not we actually have a gravity involved that&#x27;s something yeah yeah that&#x27;s like if it goes straight through the wood and it passes right down then we can stick our uh our target inside of a faraday cage and we can test it that way that is if it does anything at all there&#x27;s also the very likely possibility that this thing will blow itself to pieces because it&#x27;s kind of a prototype blend of bonding agents so we&#x27;re not really sure how well it&#x27;s going to work we did cool the stuff down earlier and it survived liquid nitrogen cooling and it did not debond which was really really good but how much electricity are you running through there again 35 000 volts okay so in joules in joules 613 okay that&#x27;s right we were talking about that 613 because it&#x27;s the laws of uh right that is if we charge it all the way but according to the laws of equivalency it seems like there&#x27;s enough copper wire there to support that it&#x27;s just if anything else because the screws explodes so hope for the best well all right this is pretty exciting how do you feel about this experiment um i&#x27;m pretty excited about it i think it&#x27;s gonna be i think it&#x27;s gonna be pretty interesting not gonna lie we could change the course of the future um yeah very likely yeah i wouldn&#x27;t be surprised either way guys continue to send in your questions we&#x27;re looking at the chat and now we&#x27;re able to see yeah hey i&#x27;m really i&#x27;m reading the live chat now over here so if you guys have any questions um please post them and we&#x27;ll try to get them asked um science is happening yeah i&#x27;m sorry about the volume levels guys uh the control wires i need like basically i just need two control wires attached but yeah looking at this is just unidentified like literally from the power supply right so that&#x27;s the same that was like you just have like if you look through whatever you&#x27;re thinking like the literature about an unidentified identified craft you&#x27;re gonna hit some roadblocks so it has to be like a vehicle that&#x27;s anomalous you start to see anomalous vehicles all the time because you&#x27;ve got companies that are making them you&#x27;ve got governments that are making them you&#x27;ve got companies making them for governments that don&#x27;t even know that they&#x27;re making them for the governments yet you&#x27;ve got skunk works yeah you know you&#x27;ve got all kinds of different things that count as a nominal how about north rumman a private quadcopter doing amazing stuff and then you got chile look at south america and you see some pretty weird you know chinese and russian hypersonic uh you know stealth drones yeah and you know bolivia that they brought in a million chinese and a million russians to live there like for some like jets they made some deals with china for some military equipment so they brought him in for the military equipment but they probably also brought in fabrication technologies start making some of the crazy stuff they&#x27;re working on so we&#x27;re seeing all over the world you know lots of anomalous vehicles that&#x27;s not even there it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not a question of if they&#x27;re there it&#x27;s more like what are we looking at and so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s fun to look at these experiments some of these experiments are doing like sound experiments to see if you can levitate with sound they&#x27;ve been some pretty interesting results from that um yeah we&#x27;re not doing anything with sound just in examples you know in terms of all these experiments right now we&#x27;re supposed to be you know electric this particular i want to do some sona we were talking about that earlier though before though we do use sound though we were using a uh ultrasonic vibrator for many of these experiments in their preparation like to build the to build the eq to build the equipment to build the components it&#x27;s a great way to get the um you know particles inside of epoxy spread out evenly are you using the sonicator i&#x27;m so kind of like um jeremiah can tell you about it your transducer it&#x27;s a pretty large one 100 watts for a single transducer or so they claim it can sustain about 50 watts continuously and at 75 it gets hot about two minutes but whatever if you cool it down it&#x27;s good for 100. either way yeah 35 kilohertz and and the sound waves travel up through the epoxy or cement mixtures with powders mixed into them and because those powders are being hit with sound waves and there&#x27;s a liquid inside of those things you end up getting a nice even distribution as the particles bump into each other and sort of ride the wave as the pressure of the epoxy or cement pushes everything into a nice even contingent mixture because it allows everything to flow basically you have constant motion so nothing really gets stuck that&#x27;s a good answer so uh how are the pyramids built bro 20 second answer beer oh i&#x27;m not talking about that quite yet but i&#x27;ll give you an answer to that we all have theories we got a theory jeremiah has a theory that i&#x27;ve never heard before how about how about the idea that most of the sand was it was a lot higher there the nile river was actually a lot higher uh during the time that the pyramids were built and that they could have just flowed these blocks down the river and like dropped them right off anyways um there&#x27;s a bunch of different interesting theories on the pyramids man i love that kind of stuff but but uh again you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s all about you know until someone discovers something and shows something out there there was some interesting stuff that i had found about uh there&#x27;s there&#x27;s some experiments with muons and silicates i guess the cavities and some certain silicates are a good size for muon resonances and that these muon resonances can create a sort of quantum phone uh similar to like the polarity on condensate stuff that i was talking about without polarity cytons inside of crystals or inside of you know other materials with surface plasmon uh but who&#x27;s got the hot mic so someone&#x27;s someone&#x27;s is that me maybe i think it might be it&#x27;s probably picking up you doing the uh the screwing and bolting uh yeah i have to yeah as unfortunately that you know he&#x27;s doing screwing and and doing work in the background so you&#x27;re gonna hear all this stuff so sorry guys for the you know hopefully you guys can hear okay there we go i can barely hear i&#x27;m a middle-aged guy yeah i&#x27;m sorry man you know so much rock music so much for rock music again um we&#x27;re trying to uh you know we&#x27;re trying to um do anti-gravity do antigravity experiments you know go through the literature of all these and all those experiments and then we&#x27;ll see if we can get it to work and then see what what are the mitigating circumstances that allow it to work and then how do we break it how do we get it to turn off and what&#x27;s absolutely required what&#x27;s absolutely essential and what isn&#x27;t you know where&#x27;s your black maybe we&#x27;re not right because we don&#x27;t have the backyard we got everything right except for the vacuum chamber you know that was the one that&#x27;s that&#x27;s like the one piece we&#x27;re missing right jeremiah is the vacuum chamber down yeah for uh for a full experiment a few things not just the back yeah we&#x27;re missing the i think it was in here that is not so much the actual mixture of the superconductor as it is the junctions between each individual part of the superconducting assembly and so that could be done with the mixture or could be done theoretically with two separate normal superconducting discs if there&#x27;s a if there&#x27;s a correct junction in there we don&#x27;t expect a large effect if uh anything it&#x27;s probably going to be very small almost unobservable but we&#x27;ll see we&#x27;ll see what happens so um the question is where do you guys study physics at um uh the internet is the one of the best sources for physics mit open courseware uh there&#x27;s a cornell open course where there&#x27;s a whole number of universities that are putting all their courseware up online and all their all their academic materials especially now with covid19 uh forcing a lot of the academic uh and community into using zoom calls and other uh online methods for for teaching and uh educational outreach so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a better time than ever to to educate yourself with materials online i would stay away from you know other channels like you know i&#x27;m not going to mention but there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot of people that you know if they&#x27;re not using math and you&#x27;re not really learning math and and you know um real core science then i guess that then i would stay away from those kind of things yeah i&#x27;d say like for the most part this requires actual experimentation and like so for the most part we want to see someone teaching you tutorials on how to do the math how to do the actual observances and you know how to make the magic measurements so you can do experiments properly which really just means documenting your experiences and so you want to look at you know like mit courseware anything on that kind of copyright or property left rather so there&#x27;s archive.org and also library and odyssey now are really great to find things they&#x27;re not just you know it&#x27;s great fun youtube content creators but there&#x27;s a lot of good information and content on youtube and stuff too but like yeah yeah i i guess um i but i did go to school i didn&#x27;t go to bridgewater state university i studied under uh dr edward devlin and uh dr thompson you have a base for the wood and um that&#x27;s where i studied physics anyway uh because a lot of this stuff they don&#x27;t really teach in universities a lot of it&#x27;s like really fringe and universities don&#x27;t want to really get involved with with um you know science that&#x27;s kind of like on the outs outskirts like that until it&#x27;s really well established and it&#x27;s not no longer dangerous to be involved with it i guess yeah so you&#x27;re lucky if you&#x27;re in california you know ucsc basically can get away with a lot and then there&#x27;s a good stuff in san diego too i mean like in general though online now you can get all of it so it&#x27;s like the best thing just to watch the life and figure out which ones um really likes are the right ones for you yeah certain teachers are better than others you know like you find like all right well that might be supposed to like this but i but i like you know this other video i found and this dude teaching me linear equations this guy&#x27;s way better uh another really great math channel nj wild burger um you know observers yeah walter lewin has like some excellent excellent courses that are so much fun to watch because he does walter does live demonstrations and it&#x27;s hard not to actually love the physics demonstrations that he does which is why you know people that&#x27;s why he has you know love uh learned to love physics as part of his channel theme but yeah it&#x27;s great it&#x27;s great and uh all good demonstrations are fantastic it&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s what feynman understood it&#x27;s it&#x27;s what so many other great physicists that that have really helped teach the youth and bring a new generation of kids into science have have discovered is that you don&#x27;t want to just tell kids you don&#x27;t want to just uh give them paperwork you want to show them some live demonstrations to say this is tangible stuff this actually can take you somewhere you can do something with it right amen yeah and there needs to be more of that really there needs to be different things and then the the go-between between the math and applying the math and being like all right well how do i take this situation and then turn it into a number and a way i can work it right in numbers and back and forth i absolutely love white boards totally love them but i love demonstrations more i love walter lewin&#x27;s demonstration skill on a whiteboard the way he can draw dotted lines oh yeah i&#x27;ve never seen that i can&#x27;t compete with that and they&#x27;re all perfect i&#x27;m like it&#x27;s nuts it&#x27;s nuts dude it&#x27;s like yeah the guy&#x27;s a machine man but anyways um no we&#x27;re trying to put together the um pocklinoff demonstration and we are literally minutes away from doing this yeah popping off poor it&#x27;s hard to call it either one i&#x27;m not really sure i&#x27;m gonna call this but it it is what it is you&#x27;ll see all the components and you call it what&#x27;s today&#x27;s date january 6th the january 6 2021 experiment um jeremiah you ready we&#x27;re going to get some high voltage armed up here in just a moment how about i test the uh ultra magnet first i would highly recommend testing your circuit first okay i&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to work but i&#x27;m pretty sure it is too kind of worried how much how much current we&#x27;re going to get off of this you could probably run that really off just one half of that battery pack be a little bit better for the coil that wouldn&#x27;t make any difference because well the coil is going to be you know slightly higher it&#x27;s going to get hotter if you had enough higher voltage than 12 no this is i understand that but the entire the pack is in parallel right so it&#x27;s 16. oh wait never mind yeah never mind go ahead that&#x27;s fine okay click all right give me a second let me go ahead and pull one of those magnets 36 amps 36 amps that&#x27;s fantastic did we find pod queen of yet we&#x27;re emailing him um we&#x27;ve sent a bunch of emails to poglin off and reached out to him but um i haven&#x27;t actually got a hold of him he hasn&#x27;t got a hold of us yet and um let&#x27;s uh let me give that a try i want to feel what the vehicle looks like oh yeah like that did it turn it on yeah all right let&#x27;s get some close-ups on this disc here so we can show this this thing that&#x27;s a problem it works okay now we just need a way to switch you want to show the um you want to turn on the electromagnet for a second so people can see what it&#x27;s doing okay ready can you uh whoa hold on first he&#x27;s going to see the magnets for a little bit so you can see the magnets okay three two one there we go go ahead i&#x27;m turning the electromagnet on and off it likes to really uh like fly out of my hand here we go let&#x27;s try again so you can you can see the field is going through there we&#x27;re pulling about 35 36 amps right now which is not bad that should create a sufficient field to publicize it i have literally no idea as many as i could put on there by hand until i got uh until i ran out of space pretty much oh it is what it is now all we got to do is put in the liquid nitrogen and get the high voltage going so we need to move this to the center of the room so all right just give me give me a little space okay now uh the grounding can we um turn it this way yeah that&#x27;s fine yeah we can do that that&#x27;s sweet what is this for the water that&#x27;s for the um top of the uh case on top of that case oh yeah sweet looking inside of here man poor guys watching this crazy wobbly footage all right i don&#x27;t know i apologize to everyone you know we&#x27;re just trying to do this right right here like that yeah do we have we don&#x27;t have another bolt though we should have another bolt i would hope so how about i just put bring it in from under from underneath and come to this side that&#x27;s fine sorry oh yeah there&#x27;s no lasers in this experiment uh what is cool though though there is a laser oh there&#x27;s a laser oh yeah we&#x27;re not gonna run it yet but if it works we will it&#x27;s more as a sensor though um it&#x27;s a control it&#x27;s what can trigger that one yeah so it triggers or your cameras the poor ccds man i&#x27;ve blown out so many cameras it&#x27;s pretty bad and it&#x27;s easy to do very much so you&#x27;ve blocked out your ccds too you know what you just want to uh drill a hole you&#x27;re just gonna go straight okay that&#x27;ll work you got it ancillary to the high voltage i&#x27;m gonna get the uh you want to talk about some cool stuff though um on june 25th 1995 the first bose einstein condensate was created in a physics lab won the nobel prize and what do we got with some live streams let&#x27;s see oh this is my camera so um they did it in a uh by laser cooling and trapping uh rubidium atoms and they were able to create the first bose einstein condensate and then uh in the years since um we&#x27;ve been able to create many more bose einstein condensates and uh condensed matter states and i think that um condensed matter states is really interesting so what bose and einstein determine is that if you take the de broglie wavelength of all these um things when you cool stuff down super cold the de broglie wavelengths actually get longer and longer and stretch out inside of all the material until they they form until they form a condensate where they all go to a single wave function so they all behave as a single wave function and act as a single um a single wave function essentially like a single a single atom almost which is uh which is super interesting and has a super interesting consequences and super interesting physics that occur as a result and that&#x27;s led to a lot of different uh interesting research in the um 25 years pretty much since then to where we are now um with their abilities to uh oh yeah you should be building that sorry careful sorry we got a lot going on we&#x27;re getting the this uh this experiment set up but bose einstein condensates and condensed matter um are super interesting i think super relevant to what&#x27;s what&#x27;s sort of going on here running a little low so i&#x27;m gonna have to we have we have a super cold uh the thing is that that we&#x27;ve probably created both einstein comments and they just weren&#x27;t confirmed and really measured and and actually you know definitively measured until safety glasses safety glasses so anyways uh they probably weren&#x27;t actually they probably were actually made several times before uh that but but but we actually never detected them or actually comparing them with a measurement until 95. so um in the morning because now we&#x27;re able to we&#x27;re able to create and detect a lot of these condensed matter states that&#x27;s going to be enough using what are called surface plasmon and um well anyways what i think is going on in this uh this knob experiment is um that is some sort of polarization non-linear effects coming out of this coming out of this this sort of you&#x27;re breaking this vacuum structure limit and actually um causing non-linearity to occur which caused these ripples in space time that actually uh and this is we&#x27;ve been born against doing this experiment actually they said someone saw someone told us that you&#x27;re gonna start creating ripples in space time and that that there there&#x27;s the the g-man the fed agencies out there that are going to detect these ripples in space time and know that we&#x27;re doing anti-gravity experiments and they&#x27;re going to come to your lab and and steal all your equipment they&#x27;ve already been here they&#x27;ve already been here and they didn&#x27;t bother us like they&#x27;ve already been here to our lab we publish this stuff on on youtube dude like if they don&#x27;t know we&#x27;re doing this already dude like come on like they&#x27;re not doing their freaking job i&#x27;m sorry i thought that was ridiculous um i i can&#x27;t stand like some of the paranoid people out there and some of the people that get all weird about about this man like we&#x27;re doing it and and like you&#x27;re not gonna get no g-men or anti-gravity people who are gonna show up to your house and break laws to steal your equipment you know it&#x27;s that&#x27;s just asinine and those people are um yeah they didn&#x27;t shut down todd&#x27;s lab they didn&#x27;t shut down hathaway&#x27;s lab they haven&#x27;t shut down uh they haven&#x27;t shut down anyone else&#x27;s lab i know of wayne&#x27;s names i know tons of labs however they did shut down my lab but it wasn&#x27;t the men in black it was the city because i see the building i was renting that i had my lab set up and the city came by and said this building is unfit for human habitation it is too old and literally falling apart so uh they kicked everybody out forcibly and so that was the end of that milwaukee lab space but i am going to be setting up again and uh pre-assessing some bigger experiments now i&#x27;ve been operating out of an apartment and doing a lot of research there and making major progress actually on a small desk in my apartment but uh it&#x27;s time to upscale again how&#x27;s everyone doing tonight man we got a healthy stream going 135 people now joining out there this is it&#x27;s double what we had earlier that&#x27;s great uh welcome everybody um we&#x27;re going to be doing our environmental anti-gravity experiments and some live tests tonight with the podcast impulse gravity generator experiment i&#x27;m followed by a couple other uh cool um perfect cool experiments we&#x27;re going to um yeah we&#x27;re trying we&#x27;re trying our best to reach out to uh more more scientists and more labs who are involved in this and we&#x27;re trying to break the uh break the wall of silence and the wall of ridicule and um you know try to try to break down those barriers with this subject and um and let a lot of other scientists working on this know that it&#x27;s okay it&#x27;s our right to come forward that we have a whole documented history of plenty of really really smart people working on anti-gravity going going back a number of years including uh you know cecil dewitt and and john archibald wheeler who wrote papers with albert einstein so um you know you look up super conductors in gravitational drag 1966 there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a paper on that you can find by cecil do it and it will talk all about um you know some of these experiments that they did back then with uh with with rotating super conductors very very interesting um relevant nowaday to the poglet nova experiment and what we&#x27;re what we&#x27;re running into and learning about here um again uh the time we&#x27;re we&#x27;re trying to uh you know just break down that that that wall of that stigma and that taboo that the issue of this being a taboo science because you know it&#x27;s 20 21 right now um people are people are angry they also they&#x27;re they&#x27;re so angry they just really i really i should crazy stuff today that happened uh down in washington and uh we might be on the verge of a civil war and a revolution in this country um and i want there to you know i want to there needs to be a revolution in science and and a revolution in a lot of ways not saying that i think you know that the people down there i took them off because have our best interests or really care about what&#x27;s going on here at all or or anything but um we need you know hope for the future and you know if we keep raising our kids to think you know to believe in all this this nonsense that you know these distances are too far and that you know all we have is rockets and that anti-gravity is not real it&#x27;s it&#x27;s never gonna be you know don&#x27;t touch it i i i just swear we&#x27;re going to lose we&#x27;re going to lose some of the best scientists that because they&#x27;re never going to become scientists because they&#x27;re never going to be interested in science because they&#x27;re going to see it as this dead field where there&#x27;s no freaking hope and there&#x27;s just all these stigmas and all this this high bar that you have to set and you just have it&#x27;s all about you know repeating and memorizing and spitting out equations and and uh and memorized facts from you know and and and formulas and it&#x27;s never going to be about you know it&#x27;s never going to be back to the core of what it&#x27;s supposed to be about which is you know experiment you know what it is um reliance on experiments experiments should you know nature should you know be the ultimate you know arbitrator of competing hypotheses because everyone&#x27;s got an idea everyone&#x27;s got an opinion of how you know things work and what&#x27;s really going on out here in this crazy world that we all live in but honestly okay so gravity is die electricity so you know what it&#x27;s do you know what dielectric do you know what dielectrics are uh yeah dielectricity oh yeah there&#x27;s the electrics talk about electric so we&#x27;re talking to somebody that watches theory of pocket though first off oh so okay that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s the thing it&#x27;s half right it&#x27;s half right it has to do with that function but it&#x27;s not as simple as a static field it&#x27;s a dynamic field which is to say the dielectric nature or the saturable properties of the universe space-time itself the aether if you will is only one of the two factors required you also need motion of a field or you need dispersion of energy you need to give energy from one system to the other to create a gradient because without without the flow of energy you don&#x27;t have any force i just want to you could think of atoms right the coolest thing about about like what we learned about atomic physics and nuclear physics is that you can think of atoms like these tiny little spinning tops that are magnet also magnets and and have electric properties as well depending on you know how many how many of these electrons are floating in their their outer shell and that depends on you know that that gives so much physics and so much understanding to like the mathematics of how these atoms work and how they interact with each other um but certain certain atoms are what are called insulators so so the the electrons are really tightly bound you know they&#x27;re like a they&#x27;re like a tight spring and they&#x27;re really closely held to the nucleus of the atom and um what happens is those negative and positives um unlike uh unlike a conductor where those things jump off um inside of an insulator you get um these kind of polarizations that that happen and uh that&#x27;s why insulators are dielectric materials because there have electron structures that are tightly bound to the atom and that causes the um that causes the uh the material to be able to be polarizable so that when you put electric field across it all these all these little atoms inside the material will line up with their polarities and that some that cumulative effect of all those atoms working in conjunction over the whole material caused the material to gain a polarization in in the direction that you uh you you met you uh put an electric field across it um so that&#x27;s kind of what a dielectric is and that&#x27;s not what that&#x27;s not what gravity is at all um but nice try um in any case uh let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let&#x27;s talk about some other stuff let&#x27;s see uh who else wants the permitti permittivity of free space means space time is a dialect yeah he&#x27;s got now that comment is right the permittivity of space is what we&#x27;re effectively saturating we&#x27;re putting a large amount of energy into a very small space and we&#x27;re effectively saturating it so it it has properties like a dielectric and it can go through different state changes or certain properties of space can be modified by the adding of fields strong fields into that space so yeah it does i mean we&#x27;re treating space like a dielectric but it&#x27;s not simply to say that gravity is dielectric it has a dialectic nature it&#x27;s one of its components but i&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s that&#x27;s not the whole equation it&#x27;s not just simply saying space is dielectric therefore gravity space is dielectric gravity is a emotional field that has to do with losing energy from one system and giving it into another and it has to do with the fact that the energy is a gradient yeah i agree it&#x27;s a power dis dissipation um and you can think of it as that problem um the way that you know todd deciato described i think is that that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a good way of looking at um gravity in terms of you know it&#x27;s a good approach anyways it is thinking of it like this but in any case um i had another question here that i wanted to read um brian kelly hey what&#x27;s up man thanks for joining uh nick&#x27;s uh the usual guys man this is awesome to have you guys here should we have maxwell i just want to give a quick shout out oh i also want to give a quick shout out to um tech planet there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a youtube channel out there called tech plan and everyone should go out and check this youtube channel and check check their latest video out that they did on his anti-gravity you know real or not by this guy tech planet um he mentions falcon space and alien scientist in the video so thank you for the shout out thank for the plug i appreciate that kind of stuff and uh the people out there that share this and and you know other journalists out there that re uh you know that follow this and and share the news um and give us a plug i&#x27;m gonna give you guys a plug too um another one is divine frequency um i found her channel too uh this guy this woman um yeah she does some pretty good stuff man she&#x27;s got some good uh she&#x27;s got some good videos she&#x27;s a real professional journalist and she&#x27;s going places uh doesn&#x27;t have a lot of subscribers doesn&#x27;t have a big channel yet she&#x27;s still growing but i i tell you she&#x27;s she&#x27;s someone to check out and look out for so i just want to give a quick plug to uh those two people um go check those channels out and subscribe to them and uh spread the word um you know more and more people need to get interested in this um you know the people that that that scoff or laugh or are like these guys are you know are these guys seriously you&#x27;re gonna be left in the dust because this is serious this is this is very serious okay um a lot of this was kept very you know tongue-in-cheek uh classified in a lot of you know you know tight circles for a number of years and um it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s um it&#x27;s definitely uh it&#x27;s definitely real science that&#x27;s going on here um this but as far as uh as far as what we&#x27;re trying to do because the you know we just approaching it from the the the best way that you can approach it rather than just repeating the information out there and being like talking about it like we&#x27;re actually trying to build it and see if it works and trying to get it to work no it either it works or it doesn&#x27;t and if it you know put this back and we&#x27;re gonna see because there&#x27;s some interesting videos that this guy tech plan had also talked about this dude in russia building some things that that that supposedly fly and stuff and um you know if that stuff&#x27;s real man we&#x27;re gonna eventually build it and we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna do it we&#x27;re gonna do an expose here on this channel and show you how to build it at home and and really reveal it to the world and uh even if we don&#x27;t find it in the meantime we&#x27;re going to go over a whole crapload of history of you know nasa and government anti-gravity research all the stuff that&#x27;s now declassified uh that that was you know super secret space program stuff we&#x27;re going to be declassifying it you know here um not really declassifying here just educating you on it because it&#x27;s already been declassified it&#x27;s just out there they just didn&#x27;t tell you about it or where to you know then average hey we declassified this here you know it&#x27;s not like they they go and hand out all this stuff and then give it give it to everyone it&#x27;s it&#x27;s then up to you to go and find it then put all these pieces together so we&#x27;re doing that work right now for you um and you know if you guys have done some of that work yourself we we we do appreciate the work that others out there in the community approach us with and help us um to build our knowledge base and understanding of these uh this history um because it is quite an interesting history that&#x27;s um not not it hasn&#x27;t been told enough and the story hasn&#x27;t been talked about enough so um we&#x27;re hoping that uh we can get some of that information now the ten dollars from harry harry tow one i love you fellas and the lab keep up the good work thank you so much hairytell eta on the experiment power up how long are we going do it does this guy go taking the last connection right now so they&#x27;re making the last connection now go you might want to all right we&#x27;ll give them a chance go two minutes t-minus two minutes go grab a beer go grab go grab a snack go go go to the bathroom whatever you do two minutes go go let&#x27;s break whoever needs to go on the stream and we&#x27;ll come when you come back we&#x27;ll be ready to run this experiment i&#x27;m speaking of grabbing beer i know some people have uh talked about drinking on the live stream just keep it keep it related so yeah i mean first i would say also if you haven&#x27;t checked out chartering nova&#x27;s discord you can look at some alternative propulsion things they&#x27;re looking at as well and some of the talk write it down tartarus yeah all right so people know how to spell that like tart like a fruit tart man like like a bunch of retarts uh tartar twitter there we go drinking and thinking man hey you know it&#x27;s a good comment good comment oh god set oh yeah the skunk works for cookie recipes yeah that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to basically doing reforming them for their cookie recipes and and then also being like all right so this brown substance that they talk about what could that be or would we go through the things and did it&#x27;s got to be chocolate it&#x27;s got to be chocolate chips right and you know it&#x27;s brown it&#x27;s a little chunky you know it&#x27;s gotta be chocolate chips and then we try it let&#x27;s try it and then when you you know so that&#x27;s it is very entertaining it fits we&#x27;ve got like a pretty good discord and you can look up all sorts of different subjects including historical ionic lifting and different flying technologies even some of the dielectric stuff that jeremiah was talking about where it fits in terms of dimensionality looking at that as well so give it a shot if you&#x27;re interested in other and also we have like literature different books from you know just disclosure uh of just declassified books like you were saying pdf files yeah yang things on the vril things on the hyperborean things like everything you want to find we have all the books at target nova so check that out yeah if you&#x27;re interested in going and digging deeper back into the knowledge base to look through some of that old stuff so you know sometimes people find some interesting things in there with it with the you know you know the geometry even people showing me crop circles stuff and being like what could you make out of this and i try to like think take something geometry is neat right i mean that&#x27;s lots of mathematics that&#x27;s that&#x27;s geometry you gotta be down with that you gotta be down with geometry you can&#x27;t hate on geometry well you can you shouldn&#x27;t but at the same time like looking at dielectricity even is an interesting thing like trying to look at the dimensionality of photons and electrons as something other than objects is an interesting thing because there are multiple ways of looking at things right because it&#x27;s not just this linear model i drew this as a really basic linear model that&#x27;s what they teach you like as an undergrad to understand this but that&#x27;s not all that&#x27;s going on there&#x27;s there&#x27;s there&#x27;s spins there&#x27;s uh there&#x27;s this is representative almost of angles because you have certain amounts of electromagnetic angles and propulsion that&#x27;s actually happening in terms of a constant there&#x27;s no constant i mean there&#x27;s variables and frequency of variable so this is what sort of when you think of yourself moving like everywhere at once there&#x27;s a wave function you know yeah it&#x27;s like uh you know because yeah you know that&#x27;s what it says you get this wave function with this bra and this cat and that&#x27;s like one side of it and then you you slap them together and boom and then you got your hamiltonian yeah and if we hadn&#x27;t looked at it based on how it reflects the in reality or how you know material environment is affected by it then how are you going to look at it so you kind of have to you know it&#x27;s like there are other ways that you might describe it but in terms of how it affects you it kind of is a big deal you know i was reading a recent thing um i got a hold of this patel document from 1967 called uh battelle recompressed and there was a whole bunch of lectures that were put on by these 30 sciences all right are we two minutes in let&#x27;s go experiments people don&#x27;t want to hear about all this boring theory [ __ ] man we want [ __ ] fly yeah first i want to just test it before it warms up see if the laser is gonna be on this side am i right who wants to see some [ __ ] fly guy come on let&#x27;s go still warming up no it could be it&#x27;s not uh i think i should uh change the uh sensitivity on that try now go back yeah that&#x27;s better okay that&#x27;s your switch to turn it on and off right yeah i&#x27;m just shining this light i can make it a little bit more sensitive because right now we have all this light coming in from the side i know it&#x27;s not triggering i should cover it if it untriggers no it&#x27;s just triggered continuously now try now of course you gotta get it shut off it is off oh yeah it should be good it&#x27;s good oh yeah our light powered switch is working it&#x27;s just uh adjusting the sensitivity and i&#x27;m going to move it to the sensor a little bit over i&#x27;m not triggering anything is it just on no it&#x27;s off so this thing supposedly podca built this thing and it was able to like blast concrete like through through like walls 30 feet away or something i heard some really crazy stories about this thing like you know and i just you know i&#x27;ve never s there&#x27;s a lot of stories and not a whole lot of evidence man that&#x27;s this well that&#x27;s kind of the point i mean that&#x27;s like defying uh material science rules and it&#x27;s also kind of interesting because a lot of what we think about newton&#x27;s thing and what we believe and don&#x27;t believe about noon it would be nice if an apple had fallen in the water instead of on his head because he was doing like a buoyancy rule in terms of gravity as well okay yeah perfect what about like lenses and for pusco because you think about these open material can&#x27;t go through the lens well clearly it can that&#x27;s not the question right so what is it with these materials like so so like there&#x27;s different densities and then you know the air density of water is different than air and the density of the material also is is you know changes the speed of light of that material i thought that that&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s super interesting is the density is like the function there&#x27;s no speed of light that is like a constant speed right i just like to mess with you with that it&#x27;s like so if you can create these you know materials that are you know you know likes the best identifying even um you could potentially be creating you know um things with negative refractive index that uh something with a refractive index so low and then if you get it going to the same thing you basically get light to trick it and i think it&#x27;s a signal this is going to be actually a pretty fast experiment once we do it but you got to get the angle so that you can see the um reflection on the water come over here and see what that looks like with that idea that light is really just a response to particulates on the surface of anything that&#x27;s being bombarded also messes with intake yeah it messes totally with entanglement that is gravity a surface how big of an area do we need for the uh cross lines you know i do too kind of because you uh especially when you look out at the ocean like how does it have all that water [Music] the the yeah you know balloon versus uh anything in the water that&#x27;s sinking up and down why whales are able to be as big as they are like blue whales like it kind of defies our understanding of gravity except for the fact that it&#x27;s probably just surface tension which you know everything is electrostatics so that at the end of the day is true anyway right so if gravity is all surface tension with this like electro like static things on the surface of things then we could change these surface effects to you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re going with this man these surface these super these smart skin technologies and these skin coatings i mean the people that we we&#x27;ve said like have this technology and have been developing it and kind of the ones that everyone in the ufo community thinks reverse engineered this from aliens you know patel they just got a contract to build these smart skins for like lockheed martin right yeah where the heck did that come like if this isn&#x27;t real this isn&#x27;t going on you know if you make it public like basically classifying something means eventually that information comes out after 20 years right right making it corporate right patents last a lot longer right a better form of copyright it&#x27;s a way better form of secrecy too because then you can&#x27;t go after this stuff with foia because it&#x27;s like no we don&#x27;t have any files on that it&#x27;s you know we never got any of that so we don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re no you know we have everything on bait the base is accounted for in our inventory mad scientist guys i think it might be in here i don&#x27;t know why this these might these mics you see it&#x27;s so we got to talk into this label side right here in this mic all right legit still though this is important at some point we got to do more on surface tension because that&#x27;s like yes but yeah i like this discussion on regret where where all these that&#x27;s why i am so glad you were down here and and there&#x27;s a whole a bunch of us comments on uh from our viewers out there in youtube land said i&#x27;d like they&#x27;re so happy to see andreas down here in the lab and having like a open-minded just discussion on on gravity with me yeah you&#x27;re gonna have to like i mean everybody already knows that whatever their high voltage on it yeah it has is already outdated it doesn&#x27;t matter who you are how old you are how recently you graduated it&#x27;s working your definition on what&#x27;s working now it&#x27;s working now right and that&#x27;s always going to be the case really is and it seems like it&#x27;s going to be something really ridiculous or it&#x27;s like going to be occam&#x27;s razor and if it&#x27;s akram&#x27;s razor then we have to go back to like anything like before the last 300. so i guess uh are you ready to go super connection all right we&#x27;re gonna run it all right all right we&#x27;re gonna run this are you guys ready bust out the liquid nitrogen let&#x27;s get ready they are wearing safety glasses off camera just so you know we&#x27;re going to put those on later so he&#x27;s pouring that right into the pvc pipe it&#x27;s going to get right down inside there and uh cool down that superconductor to our critical temperature once it hits that critical point i guess i was lucky my uh chamber has not been tested yet but it apparently is holding the liquid knife yeah i don&#x27;t see any on the table beneath uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s success i was leaning on wood because i mean just as good i hope so well you know which this is good rhymes oh there might be a little bit dripping down you know i just saw a little drip or something i don&#x27;t know what that was i just saw something in there but uh we can fire up that electromagnetic coil that will put our super conductor under me yeah that&#x27;s the problem that&#x27;s no good oh it dripped out it did but we didn&#x27;t even hardly see it it must have been heating up everything as it was going that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s not good you might need a lot more liquid nitrogen than that i would pour it i would pour a pour some more because the pvc and everything else is warm did you see anything coming down the bottom he&#x27;s seen one drip he said i see one drip oh one drip but there was no like streaming okay all right now let&#x27;s fire a freaking blast through that thing and step back everyone step back let&#x27;s fire something through we have to wait i&#x27;m just gonna sit here and watch it to see if it uh if it leaks out or if it actually you can see it coming out the bottom a little bit here i&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s coming up or yeah it might be i don&#x27;t know where it is it is uh i feel it a little bit is coming off the bottom okay it is okay so let&#x27;s just do it now we still have to cool it down it&#x27;s still not super conducting we&#x27;re losing it okay so just get get on the uh get on the high voltage the high voltage ready and we&#x27;ll do it yeah look at where we&#x27;re seeing it in the tray now it&#x27;s actually opened itself up i hope this is enough okay we&#x27;re generating heat here from the coil so we got to really do this fast uh we&#x27;re getting there i&#x27;m definitely getting there but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll stop bubbling because we&#x27;re generating heat it should be not bubbling from the inside okay i don&#x27;t know how we&#x27;re going to tell if all right we gotta wait for that that liquids all moving on the bottom yeah we gotta we gotta stop that we got to turn off the light over here put something under it to catch that that&#x27;s okay it&#x27;s still got enough minutes to actually go through the process that&#x27;s fine the smoke the smoke might be blown away too that could be kind of cool you have to get the uh don&#x27;t worry about that don&#x27;t worry about the catching then just let i mean the smoke on the tray there may actually be useful to analyze whether it&#x27;s working yeah okay so let&#x27;s just zoom back so we can see both you can&#x27;t beat it no no you have to be back here i want to see both this is a high power pulses oh yeah you don&#x27;t want that camera anymore no okay we have we&#x27;re we&#x27;re way very recent don&#x27;t touch the table like that okay should i put a little more just a little more just a little more and then we&#x27;re gonna fire it we&#x27;re gonna see if we get any effect on down there okay it&#x27;s filled up okay whenever you&#x27;re ready stand by we&#x27;re gonna start out at uh a little bit lower voltage we&#x27;re gonna go to about five six kv one second one second let me get let me get a close-up on this charging current oh wow oh i can see that that&#x27;s cold that&#x27;s 10kb and standby we&#x27;re going to try to trigger it this is at only 10kb all right safety glasses on whoa well that&#x27;s why i said safety glasses on yeah that played off we&#x27;re gonna find out in just a second oh my god okay was there any uh shake though on the water before the um shake off see man i just shattered our whole container i jumped a mile we shattered that hole just fell apart yeah please tell me you were seeing the water on the camera though because i wasn&#x27;t able to look at that so i we could we got on the camera wait is it still high voltage in there well i turned it back look at that all that pvc charge because that pvc was frozen man okay don&#x27;t touch any of this wayne&#x27;s calling we just blew up a stack of capacitors it&#x27;s not smoke oh sap is super conductors i thought you know hold on all right guys don&#x27;t touch that with your bare fingers like good god it&#x27;s separate don&#x27;t worry i&#x27;m isolated from ground well enough to be able to do it i&#x27;m just wondering i&#x27;m just talking about the frostbite you&#x27;re gonna get from touching something that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not even cold enough to really give me frost but it takes a lot longer for thermal energy to actually leave your uh in your hands and be cold how long do you have to hold your finger in liquid nitrogen before you like lose it well oh every single jungle oh look at that completely blown blown to shreds [Applause] let&#x27;s do another one okay yeah i&#x27;ll warn you next time though and first off shut this thing down because it&#x27;s drawing power and it&#x27;s going to overheat if we don&#x27;t shut it down yeah oh let me just clean it up what the hell man ah that was awesome sorry about that all right luckily no one was really in danger but it sure didn&#x27;t make me jump this is why charter know it makes rainbow safety goggles i was thinking like should we use the uh resistor yes i guess that would have been a good idea i guess i&#x27;m glad i did i stopped at you know only uh 10kb wow well um that was cool oh did we shut this off yet yeah i just pulled it good this is where we need the high speed high speed camera this is what is it for you got a big magnet somewhere yes we got a big magnet part of this experiment can&#x27;t dodge it oh no no i want a magnet to pick up the superconductor that&#x27;s sitting there it&#x27;s this we still got a super conductor it&#x27;s totally not anymore yeah i mean no it&#x27;s not crazy it has to be right it has to be right at that temperature yeah man the helium would get it beyond that for a little bit but not at room temp not around here now holy did you guys see that no it just happened so um we poured liquid nitrogen inside of this pvc uh holding container where our apparatus was and of course um we have another apparatus by the way when you stick things in liquid nitrogen um they freeze we haven&#x27;t tried out this one yet brittle um so what happened is when we sent this pulse through through this so this high voltage pulse it caused a rapid heating and expansion of gas um in that area which blew the the um frozen pvc pipe apart and uh you can see some pieces of that here um completely blown blown apart um that was amazing guys that was that was uh that was almost as good as it working it might have worked we have to review the uh the footage it might have worked i doubt i doubt we got anything on there i mean i doubt it it did work i didn&#x27;t expect it to blow itself to pieces that was a high possibility and it&#x27;s clearly what happened says the anti-gravity work 0.1 seconds new record the record yeah a lot of these experiments are you know hours days or months of setup and then okay that was like super low power man like suggesting polycarbonate i think we said together oh yeah what we&#x27;re doing next uh that&#x27;s the next one right here polycarbonate this is this is carbon right here this is a uh this is basically two sheets of graphite that are bonded together with the same super secret material and uh we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna put magnets on either end that&#x27;s a crazy magnetic field and then there&#x27;s we&#x27;re gonna put the same impulse through it you know with this same setup those are much thicker pieces of carbon also all right the other graphite the graphite&#x27;s like about half an inch thick or something right yeah it&#x27;s probably about seven eighths i think right yeah it&#x27;s pretty thick so we were talking earlier about uh about tom delonge and ttsa and you know so we actually wrote a whole song about this um earlier and uh maybe it&#x27;ll be a good time when we break this experiment down i&#x27;m gonna bust out we&#x27;re going to um the second variation of the experiment first so the second variation the experiment most of the components are the uh all right so let&#x27;s do this let&#x27;s run an experiment first and then uh i want i want i want to i want to show everybody this the other song we got because this is jeremiah what&#x27;s up you guys are going to need something required for the terminals i need to go get the other magnet and bring it in here with lots of caution gloves folks gloves bro if you knew what kind of work i did with these hands that sounded suggestive i don&#x27;t need [ __ ] gloves bro no people that see this stuff on the internet but i&#x27;ve never actually worked with dangerous magnet there are there are time relevant factors in terms of how fast you can respond dangerous magnet yeah not really working i&#x27;m not worried about i could pick this stuff up i i&#x27;ve handled these materials before you know it&#x27;s just pvc you know i&#x27;ll wash my hands before i eat or put them in my mouth or atmospheric nitrogen you could die dude look at this freaking alligator clip it&#x27;s just like [Music] that is awesome we&#x27;ll try again with that was that was epic book but it was a fun one it was an epic failure this is the next attempt at this experiment all right i gotta get some let&#x27;s clean this up where&#x27;s our uh let me get a dustpan in a room um get this uh i want to clean this up a little bit so we can get it cleaned up for our next uh explosion i mean experiment oh i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t know if the uh what&#x27;s gonna explode here come on that&#x27;s what everyone out there is waiting for come on who came here something interesting you know if this thing would work i&#x27;d be fascinated this is a very interesting device here just uh you know give me a give me a thumbs up or a smiley face if you want to see stuff blow up so what do you think should we make the high voltage side the small one yeah and then the top well so this one is uh larger than that one so it would have like a more zeroed in effect yeah set it on top of a pc ppc because on that table i mean you&#x27;re a little close on the voltage side oh [ __ ] shouldn&#x27;t have taken this out there watch out yes all right i need uh one of those presidentes we&#x27;re trying to figure out what kind of beers to get and uh i saw this one about the pre president you know i was like oh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s like the good one to get for it for today you know it&#x27;s just the best beer we could possibly buy for today is president beer because there&#x27;s we don&#x27;t even know who the [ __ ] president is i mean trump doesn&#x27;t look like he&#x27;s leaving you know see i appreciate that you clear up the metaphor because i was just gonna walk around and just sip on this like suggestively yeah but this generation doesn&#x27;t get subtlety no no they don&#x27;t they they don&#x27;t get sarcasm or jokes or stuff like that anymore yes whoever he or she is okay let&#x27;s get these out of here all right yeah guys so uh who who thought that was going to happen i mean kind of like a lot of people predicted that there was going to be a civil war and breakdown in this country i certainly predicted it i think most of us it&#x27;s like clockwork man it&#x27;s like queuing on and and can you get new water for that working again there you go yeah i want to get lost on it everyone came here to like get their mind off of the uh the civil war that&#x27;s currently brewing in this country and and the uncertain the fate of the future war is never what&#x27;s so civil about war anyway oh god how do we get it we&#x27;re the peak everyone everyone stopped watching we reached our peak at that experiment everyone&#x27;s like all right it&#x27;s done i&#x27;m over that&#x27;s all i came to see man guys don&#x27;t don&#x27;t don&#x27;t don&#x27;t leave yet don&#x27;t leave yet you&#x27;re missing all the good stuff man keep it away from anything yet presidente is haitian it&#x27;s not even spanish dude this guy commented let me remind you kalabhubaka you don&#x27;t think i speak creole too posers i&#x27;m a poser how much creole do you speak you don&#x27;t even speak spanish let alone okay sabroso see this guy knows thank you flew the bird watcher man uh honestly uh we appreciate we appreciate being corrected you know i appreciate it figure out what size local sciences see baby yes guys so um what gauss are those oh what gals electromagnets are for the winter so those uh so this this uh thing we&#x27;re setting up now let&#x27;s let&#x27;s zoom in on this this uh setup i got going on i&#x27;m gonna go through some camera work guys because um let me take it off and go up hold my beer famous last words okay here we go all right so what are we working with over here this is these are those are drills oh yeah so i&#x27;m going to drill a hole in the table so that we can put this lead through for the ground um i was thinking jeremiah was actually thinking of just this way straight to the ground there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that at all straight up over here it&#x27;s a little bit long of a lead but it&#x27;s not longer than you know probably not much longer overall because we&#x27;re going straight too i wouldn&#x27;t worry about it i&#x27;d say just go for it okay i&#x27;ll just go for that direction already that if you can just move that capacitor over a little bit maybe twist it around save yourself a little space no but i want the current to go all the way through this long wire this long uh oh you want to delay it i just want the current to go through guys as well this is like oh yeah i thought we were going to get this other experiment set up all right let me take the water out yeah goodbye okay now let&#x27;s set it up there we go and uh this is a copper plate copper disc going into a piece of graphite it&#x27;s about about a one millimeter thick it&#x27;s going into this is a piece of graphite and it&#x27;s bonded uh to another piece of graphite with what is this in the middle there it&#x27;s the proprietary body that&#x27;s our proprietary bonding high percentage of bismuth powder mixed with bismuth powder and i think i put a little iron in there too so one of the interesting things that uh podclit i mentioned in video five of the interview i have with him is is that the super conductor disc that he used was a bilayer disc it was a special uh a special thing about this bilayer superconductors and that and that layering effect of these two superconductors touching each other at that layer boundary is very interesting very interesting things happen at that boundary two different types of quantum states um one called uh fermionic spin states and uh the other of of uh polariton condensate um is what they they now believe is is uh responsible for causing these anomalous effects and um so anyways this is this is not uh super conductor discs these are graphite and um but this this is a second variation of the pogbanomics so what what exactly are we hoping to achieve and do with this this here um with the graphite velocity and so even though it&#x27;s a highly resistive material it&#x27;s its drift velocity happens to be relatively high because it doesn&#x27;t have a very large number of free electrons to immediately give up but it&#x27;s also a non-linear material so as you increase the current you just get knowledgeable effectively very large quantities of electrons moving really really quickly so the idea here is electrons enter the circuit conventionally through copper and copper leads but when they hit the graphite they&#x27;re going to accelerate very very quickly because the drift velocity is present in the graphite then as they begin to accelerate and try to reach the ground point they&#x27;re going to hit a barrier and that barrier is made of the proprietary bonding agent and the bismuth mixture so they&#x27;re going to have to actually bore their way or tumble the way through that barrier layer first before they can get to the other graphite disk and continue with their forward momentum to reach a ground point and we&#x27;re hoping that the sudden velocity change through all these layers will end up causing the electrons to effectively radiate their momentum downwards or upwards so we will see a deflection on this water very interesting so it&#x27;s sort of like again this is like breaking that light like uh breaking that instantaneous barrier um and uh trying to my microsoft so i&#x27;ll talk to that this thing from now on anyways uh i can&#x27;t wait to see some stuff blow up and then after this experiment we&#x27;ll do the song okay after that we&#x27;re gonna do the gyroscope song and then gyroscopes i can&#x27;t wait for the song this is going to be epic guys you guys are you know and also uh get tom delonge on here too he&#x27;s going to enjoy that song too oh he&#x27;ll just love you for that one so we&#x27;re going to do is move that capacitor as far as i can possibly go without falling off the table yeah that&#x27;s about it that&#x27;s about it you guys uh i think we&#x27;re gonna need another lead or i could just set this up sideways move that over that way angle angle slide this like this there we go can we do this yes we can you know we can do this mark&#x27;s done woof i&#x27;m not going to call it the greatest contact method in the world but it&#x27;s working geez okay it&#x27;d be much better to uh you know to bend this actually it&#x27;d be much better to bend the end of this clip in there which we should do who wants to hand me a pliers needle nose or other uh i would be very careful with pliers there yeah the pliers just bending this not that just the end of the clip see i&#x27;m going to bend it up so if you have you&#x27;re right in your very powerful magnets don&#x27;t worry we&#x27;ve got plenty of space almost 18 inches oh i thought you were doing it right in there okay heavens now now with magnet this large here you go oh actually i do need that i think i need to get these out of here yeah they&#x27;re going to be pretty tough to get out of there push up but this may be wow that&#x27;s a lot of holding force yeah those magnets are really stuck in there with that giant oh no nude if you walk one at a time yep i&#x27;m just going to oh yeah look at the look at this how hard that is to control oh got all these crazy forces in there there&#x27;s two of them they&#x27;re three inch diameter uh magnets with i think around 300 pounds of lifting force each there&#x27;s two sticks yeah they&#x27;re an inch thick they&#x27;re stupid n52s these are pretty freaking powerful it&#x27;s amazing is that that quantum vacuum is not empty the empty space isn&#x27;t really empty well what&#x27;s really wild is that this magnet that i can barely even hold on my fingers because the incredible force that&#x27;s there and this other magnet on the outside they&#x27;re not actually interacting directly they&#x27;re interacting through the physical medium that transfers the electromagnetic energy from the rotation of the electrons and this magnet to the rotation of the electrons and that means these atoms are reacting they&#x27;re reacting against space not themselves it&#x27;s relativity because these these electrons in these materials are moving at the speed of light and they&#x27;re moving in opposite directions and then when you bring them close to each other they have this relativistic effect that kind of warps space time around them i think it&#x27;s just as simple as when you have two gyr two things spinning together they want to attract and when you have two things spinning in opposition they want to push apart now it&#x27;s the um the center the axis that you&#x27;re looking at for their spin rotation is from different directions therefore north and south want to attract because they&#x27;re spinning in opposite directions from their own vantage point that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re spinning in the same direction around i mean the vantage point is from the other side is there any papers on this that you know of i i i used to know one simplified our grounds this strip right here on the bottom yeah a wide bus bar that wide bus bar right to the bottom that y bus bar goes to earth ground but it also has a much shorter path from the ground to the capacitor to the bottom of that so we aren&#x27;t going through the whole entire thing to the earth ground how&#x27;s everyone doing out there on the live chat tonight uh greg chase uh wants nick said to develop nixa we&#x27;d love to see other people doing experiments anyone wants to post videos to their experiments yo yo tell everyone to like and subscribe no i don&#x27;t think so you&#x27;ll see it don&#x27;t forget to uh yeah julian julian labor uh latour for anyone who wants to know right now we&#x27;re waiting for the tube to warm up yeah we gotta wait for this tube to warm up man you actually see a purple glow which you should probably get in on it&#x27;s like turning your amp on you know it&#x27;s like tuning one of those old tube tube amplifiers on you got to wait for them to warm up and before you can start jamming on the thing because you know the tubes don&#x27;t like yeah it works right now if it was working properly this particular tube takes like several minutes to warm up alien scientists watch me yeah dude we&#x27;d watch you sometimes too dude i i i think i&#x27;ve checked out that dude&#x27;s channel i&#x27;m gonna have to go check out some of his uh videos and stuff too yeah anyone anyone who&#x27;s uh doing this kind of stuff man um please show us and i&#x27;ll check out your channel yeah look at look at andreas zurtus&#x27;s channel this is check out my channel i&#x27;ll check out your channel maybe definitely bro i&#x27;m not feeling that smart i don&#x27;t know sweet uh can you grab me a beer yeah thank you presidente el presidente is that a vote for el presidente el presidente this is the haitian beer right this is haitian spaces i&#x27;m not going to tell you what i&#x27;m saying anyways uh in any case um where&#x27;s the doggy yeah where&#x27;s the dog we&#x27;re gonna give that would someone give a ten dollar donation come give that dog some freaking snacks go give that dog some snacks she&#x27;s hiding out she&#x27;s hiding out we got her a little we got a little pen back here so that she can be safe and uh it&#x27;s the the the um the dog&#x27;s pen is also a faraday cage um as well as a dog cage so that you know she doesn&#x27;t get electrocuted by the high voltage experiments right right the biggest safety very safe and yeah right just making sure that we&#x27;re in between so mark will take the fatal blast for your pocket save the dog pockets check them out do you see a purple flash jeremiah jeremy do you see a purple part yeah i see it from here jeremy how about you see that zoom in on that they&#x27;ll see it where is it oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let me see this yeah you&#x27;ll see a purple electron emissions that means we&#x27;re ready our tubes are working they&#x27;re fired up prepare themselves okay we need to pay attention close attention to that make sure you get the water and the uh apparatus in camera view when we do this okay so i got to get both of the i got you want me to put on the yeah you get the water and the camera let me let me put on the tripod so it&#x27;s still because i can&#x27;t hold it that still yeah i agree that&#x27;ll be better for a video analysis later better for a video analysis later for people trying to play this back and watch it everyone record the time stamp that this is this experiment&#x27;s going down so that we can 7 59 p.m we&#x27;re at midnight away from midnight after midnight as soon as he&#x27;s ready we&#x27;re gonna let tom delong have this song [Music] after midnight charging midnight thursday 12 a.m coming up we&#x27;re going to charge a 10 kb okay definitely seeing this thing draw the current and i&#x27;m hearing it too i don&#x27;t know about all that do it again because i didn&#x27;t wait okay [Music] can we pour that i saw something in the water i saw something in the water no shine that laser down on that water so i can see that i didn&#x27;t see it where&#x27;s the laser i&#x27;m gonna go over there no you know what wayne just told us to do and it was a good advice he said get that thing off the table that it&#x27;s discharging on stick it on the ground so it doesn&#x27;t get vibrations from a possible impulse discharge so wayne&#x27;s right let&#x27;s do exactly what he said let&#x27;s get this thing on the ground oh it&#x27;s a good idea how about we should i put this underneath yes please just like for a black background we&#x27;re just doing it in the black background yep yep hopefully we can still see this yeah because it&#x27;s just shaking from the thing right exactly i mean that&#x27;s not a good test it&#x27;s a little bit isolated on those wheels but still it would be nice if we had an air table or something to keep it completely isolated that&#x27;s okay we just we&#x27;re just going to wait for that to stop moving around and then wait for the water to settle yeah i want to try and laser through it because all i can see is black down there i&#x27;d like this oh we need a light source pull that out and give me that light please and then i will set you up with a great reflection i need a chart reflection i need that chart or a chart okay a chart paper a graph we will make this work watch this no problem and we&#x27;ll put this behind here and you&#x27;re going to be able to see this oh that was perfect go back go back yeah just go back to right over here other side i can see that oh you&#x27;re hitting the reflection off the front i can see that much better in the camera so you got a nice defined grid pattern yeah careful about that thing let me take a quick look at the cam well you can actually see it down here should i just be focusing the camera on the water um on the uh yeah can you come down and reduce it let&#x27;s bring this camera going at a sharper angle let&#x27;s bring this one going right at the water oh can you see okay yeah can you do that it steady yet it&#x27;s steady can you bring that other camera up hold on jeremy okay three wait for it he&#x27;s getting the cams hold up i wanna i wanna i gotta get in a better position because this is like yeah just they&#x27;re gonna be extremely cautious that thing is deadly powerful and live right now yeah because i i want to get back a little bit because i&#x27;m like yeah my head&#x27;s like right next to it what you need to do is actually reduce the height here if you don&#x27;t mind i&#x27;m just going to screw with your camera set in here because right now the angle of that paper is buried underneath the tray and it&#x27;s an unfortunate consequence of the way we want to just split but now we can actually see the entire grid over the surface which is going to help our data later so let&#x27;s just do that one focus on that yeah that&#x27;s fine all right so this one&#x27;s gonna focus on the grid and then we&#x27;ll have the other let&#x27;s have the other camera see the overall experiment so people can watch that on the other camera as well okay let&#x27;s put that up on the whiteboard you can hang it right on the whiteboard yeah if this thing does anything if anybody&#x27;s seen anything then this will definitely tell us the uh auto stabilization on this thing is tricky no no no just i want this one to have the full view because this one&#x27;s getting the small view out of here i&#x27;m on the court hold on okay now i can&#x27;t see it at all so you guys you guys are gonna have to tell me if something happened okay yeah you&#x27;re gonna have to watch it real closely so this is uh audience participation time okay i&#x27;ll tell you when it fires or you&#x27;re gonna hear when it fires can you get this other camera up on the are you guys ready okay three two one [Music] oh well it appears that you&#x27;re no longer a glowing purple now uh could be the battery drained out yep i think your uh battery is a little dead do you have another one yes you do okay powering down can you go build that and work on it out there with the battery so so i could do the song while we&#x27;re wait while we&#x27;re waiting oh he&#x27;s just going to pop it right in it&#x27;s going to take only a moment and it&#x27;s already hot right now which will make it a lot shorter time okay well you&#x27;re going to have to do it the old-fashioned way unfortunately try a screwdriver with a long handle that keeps your hand away this time it&#x27;s your turn to do that i&#x27;ll get the battery you know i don&#x27;t know we have the uh the mega the giga home resistor yeah we do okay who wants to see some pop jeremy hey jeremy i&#x27;ve got to kill this cap you want to get this [Music] plug if you want to absolutely here no no let&#x27;s get the camera on it what are you doing with the camera oh my god this needs to be on this needs to be on the main thing this small one is going down here to film the grid [Music] okay oh that&#x27;s convenient can uh can can we get on with like uh i don&#x27;t know discharging this deadly capacitor here i wish i&#x27;m using that one yeah don&#x27;t burn off too much i&#x27;m not gonna even touch the tip i want to watch this okay okay guys get ready for an explosion it&#x27;s not gonna be an explosion i&#x27;m just discharging it stand by close your ears fire in the hall get it on the wall wait christmas wait just wait hold on mark get the [ __ ] camera set up people are trying to watch this [ __ ] dude i&#x27;m holding the screwdriver i will tell y&#x27;all when i&#x27;m gonna fire it take it easy folks okay all right we&#x27;re good go all right three two one boom boom oh there that was okay that wasn&#x27;t that hard folks that was not that hard okay no i just wanted to film that man okay we got all this oh man everybody wants to get it now and i agree but people want to get that energy they want to see a piece of that man you know how are uh our boost and bucks doing as far as temperature goes are we still in the green zone or are we quite hot how many more president days are you [ __ ] going to drink um until we run out bro until they decide which who&#x27;s going to be your actual president bro like you know is is is trump really gonna resign or is he gonna just hold on to like forever you know i can&#x27;t wait to play my tom de long song for these people about ttsa they&#x27;re gonna they&#x27;re gonna laugh their balls off and if they&#x27;re oh i can&#x27;t wait for that too i already left mine off man i ain&#x27;t got none anymore i left them off earlier there&#x27;s a bigger problem here and we should just shut it down oh uh oh well let&#x27;s let&#x27;s just go old-fashioned on this damn thing with a regular switch i&#x27;ll start building one in the meantime let&#x27;s move this out of the way so jeremy can play his song i just need the lead off that capacitor high voltage lead we&#x27;re discharged now disconnect get this set up all right all right you&#x27;re gonna run the camera andrea the big battery did they i hope i don&#x27;t mess this up how many more presidentes are you going to drink man [Music] as many as it takes homes you want to get one of the lounge chairs i&#x27;ve got one i&#x27;ve already got one i don&#x27;t want a lounge chair that has arms bro i&#x27;m trying to play guitar that&#x27;s true all right so what&#x27;s happening with ttsa what is happening with ttsa dude they&#x27;re like broken up i mean steve justice and elizondo left so what is it tom and hell put off now they&#x27;re going to build a craft together yeah tom and like an eight like an eight-year-old guy scientist who&#x27;s like how&#x27;s this soldering still you know how much how many engineers how many like team yeah i&#x27;ve seen earthtech.org they got some you know a guy in his daughter right or something that you know this dude and his daughter he&#x27;s teamed up with that&#x27;s that seems to be it i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t really know i haven&#x27;t seen any videos or any any like you know them talking about anything disclosing you know real i thought disclosure i thought this disclosure was supposed to like really kick off it was supposed to get like big disclosure i think you&#x27;re looking at it right now yeah wow don&#x27;t know what happened with tom what happened with aliens you saw what happened in israel that was massive with the high machete there was another minister that just came out right now and said that it&#x27;s all true yeah i don&#x27;t know about all that stuff man i think the uh the uma mao you know that the intergalactic visitor that that guy at harvard alby loeb&#x27;s talking about is is super interesting and uh that&#x27;s what the mainstream uh disclosure is all about well we got to bring the mainstream scientists into this too because when the aliens show up we don&#x27;t want everybody like freaking out and being like dude like they&#x27;re going to show up when we figure it out and show everyone how it&#x27;s done that&#x27;s how it goes in star trek right that&#x27;s how that&#x27;s how that&#x27;s how it happened in first contact so what happened to that like skin they had that that like uh adam&#x27;s that adam&#x27;s project they had that meta material that they got from like arts parts and you know what was yeah right he used to pay her rent for years well she did cattle mutilation investigations yeah she&#x27;s very into that and i think she got it from him and then she brought it to ttsa and they sold it to the defense department apparently for a whole bunch of money to uh i don&#x27;t know sound guys investigations you think we&#x27;re good i knew i need something here to hold this so i can i can read it off read my lyrics i kind of want to look at the camera oh yeah here&#x27;s awesome guys all right um yeah so i got a song i wrote about you know tom delonge what&#x27;s going on yeah we all we all kind of chipped in and wrote this song and all the lyrics to come up with this because uh we&#x27;re gonna do it with a blink 182 song you know but um we all just you know steve steve harwell yeah steve harwell&#x27;s the guy&#x27;s name he&#x27;s cooler um that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a band it&#x27;s a very similar you know band from the same era you know but it&#x27;s more more popular and more famous because it was in the movie shrek which they really hit it right getting you know in those kids movies because all the kids see it and then they grow up with it and it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re instantly like wicked famous and popular but yeah it&#x27;s just so we we decided to do a cover of smash mouth instead of instead of a blink 182 song because you know if we just covered blink 182 we might lose half the audience so but anyways uh i um you wanna do this you wanna you wanna you wanna play the song for him go ahead [Music] that&#x27;s it you hear it some somebody once told me that tom delong&#x27;s the only rebel rocker out there who cares about these ufos so he had to poke his nose in a subject that was in his so he teamed up running and he never stopped gunning straight to the turrets that he polished up front didn&#x27;t make sense when they promised text took your donations spent your dollars and cents and so much to say so much for sure tired of you faking disclosure and now they got nothing to show you&#x27;ll never fly if you don&#x27;t know oh well hey tom you were a rock star till you joined t tsa hey tom where&#x27;s your saucer you&#x27;re an imposter investors got played now everything&#x27;s splintering cold when elon gets to mars we&#x27;ll all be old somebody once asked me how do they fly so fast i have to understand the physics of space tom said nope you&#x27;re all just dopes i&#x27;m gonna build a ufo myself and i&#x27;m teaming up with doctor strange well three years running and i haven&#x27;t seen nothing just carry it on a stick and a whole lot of fluffing but the media men beg to differ judging from the hole in your ufo picture now trust is thin over the smart skin when it was time to bring the terror herds in you gave our evidence to the department of defense and told a story that didn&#x27;t make sense oh hey tom you were a rock star but went to bed with ttsa well hey tom you&#x27;re a rock star get your blink on go home and play there is no need to cry ttsa ain&#x27;t gonna fly oh who wrote that who wrote that we all did we wrote that [ __ ] so all right so yeah we&#x27;ll show tom some guitar skills and since tom wants to impede on the ufo community in the in the ufo territory that was mine long before he ever showed up on the scene and started pretending to do real disclosure um you know like so i can do i can pretend to do music and pretend to write songs too damn tom reached out to you like a while back now i&#x27;m pretty sure he did because when i was you know ed foucher contacted me he&#x27;s like you know this guy claiming to be a rock star have you ever heard of blink 182 i was like that band sucks and he&#x27;s like oh so i shouldn&#x27;t talk to this guy i was like that guy&#x27;s an idiot like what&#x27;s he gonna add to the team and he&#x27;s like oh you&#x27;re right you know and that&#x27;s that was like the extent of tommy long and then here it comes out with ttsa like a year year after that all went down and then because they were funding the idiots that&#x27;s where they wanted to start they wanted to get this this i i like how dark journalist calls them this bobo this guy that was just used because he&#x27;s like wants so hard to be part of this like this this thing but doesn&#x27;t really understand you know anything about the phenomenon out here and see real science i would love to have a debate with them like you know and have wrestling match wrestling match with tom delonge dude i don&#x27;t know the guy&#x27;s like he always joke he he tends to joke around about the probing stuff a little bit too much for me you know like he made those dick jokes on joe rogan it was like really awkward and uncomfortable you know what i mean like like like they weren&#x27;t even funny i was like ah he&#x27;s gonna be disappointed when it comes to this the only pros around here are those attached to the fluke multimeter you guys wanted a probe you&#x27;re my temperature you should try to set up your gyroscopes well while you&#x27;re actually doing that i need to build a switch should we just leave this absolutely well i think you should slide that out of the way all right let&#x27;s do the gyros last and then we&#x27;re gonna uh cause he needs to build a mechanical switch for this yeah i&#x27;m gonna go ahead and construct one glasses thirty-five oh wow dude when the laser hits your eye it&#x27;s going to like it&#x27;s going to break into a bunch of different frequencies and like yeah think about that this is what you&#x27;re wearing see right now you&#x27;re looking at the spectrum of every light source in the room and uh if everything was dark and you just had one single light source you could effectively analyze it wearing those glasses yeah yeah you almost could like get you know it&#x27;s like a spec i like spectroglass you know when you drive you can see light break up and give you like 90 feet of depth perception one color right yeah it&#x27;s one color yeah because it&#x27;s lased because it&#x27;s coherent coherent light we&#x27;re trying to make coherent matter who has the line that you&#x27;ve seen yeah very close when you just looked at that i mean how sharp was that that line on the gradient was it pretty sharp what on the laser yeah there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s no diffraction whatsoever there&#x27;s no yeah because it doesn&#x27;t have it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t split into it tries to split it into different frequencies and there&#x27;s only one frequency there so it just can&#x27;t sharply define it yes you can use it absolutely you could yeah for for you know just gotta go back to the early 1900s those things and change the world oh my god okay we&#x27;re ready to do vimana let&#x27;s talk you know mercury vortex engines and stuff like who knows anything about mercury vortex engines i don&#x27;t know nothing about those you know i i wasn&#x27;t like this guy making videos on that [ __ ] like 12 years ago or nothing you know i don&#x27;t know much about them either they sounded like pretty low like really low hanging fruit and i thought eric leithwaite really took care of all this stuff but um on aipac i noticed that a gyroscope was spinning and processing and the base that it was on was also spinning in the same direction as the spin the procession and everything else and i was wondering out loud what would happen if you had two gyroscopes spinning in opposite directions on the same floaty would you get linear momentum and this guy again gamble said yes actually it will work and here is the device working you know he pulled it off the from from his uh uh from his bench right there and they showed us a video of it working and i noticed that it was sort of pulsing and he explained yeah that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s only two you just leave it there&#x27;s only two uh gyroscopes so i said why don&#x27;t you put four he&#x27;s like oh we couldn&#x27;t do that yet so uh right now we&#x27;re on the second prototype of this device if you watch jeremy&#x27;s previous channel when a previous video when he was here we did it with the forge iros but um the setup wasn&#x27;t built very well and started to fall apart very quick very early on in the test so right now we built it much better and we&#x27;re gonna try the same experiment with a little bit more finesse it&#x27;s going to be kind of interesting so stay tuned yep i like this rig you guys came up with much better than the one that was uh that you had here last time we tried to run this experiment so this uh so this a little bit more background with this gyroscopic um a little bit more background with this gyroscopic propulsion and stuff uh eric leithwaite was the guy who invented the maglev in 1962.</p>
<p>and professor laithwaite um did a bunch of series and a bunch of different movies and documentaries about magnetism back in the day and just the odd properties of magnetism and how it worked he was really convinced that magnetism had something to do with ant with gravity it was um dedicated a large uh large a lot of monetary of his life towards his later life after making after making a lot of money off the maglev invention and the maglev patents um he spent a lot of the his money and fortune and and the later part of his life um investigating anti-gravity and gravitation um flywheels um you know the rotating gravity wheel there&#x27;s a video on veritasium i linked in the description of this video where you guys can go um watch a a video that veritasium channel did on on the gravity wheel and eric leithwaite in his time this time we&#x27;re research four and we believe that with more gyroscopes in a complex processional system you&#x27;re gonna get some unique properties this can also explain how the vimana&#x27;s mercury vortex engines possibly worked but it all comes down to what i find with the remote control and how that is able to you know bring about linear momentum so it&#x27;s really about it&#x27;s like a trial and error sort of system because remote control anti-gravity at your fingertips of a remote control that you normally use for remote control airplanes and because there is eight servos in the system i had to connect the front two and the rear two are like paired up so these two they move in in opposition to each other but they rise together on the controls so i could only like swing it back and forth these two together up and down together these two swing on different controller and go up and down together that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s set up right now and we are going to power it up first i need to power up the remote awesome let&#x27;s get this camera on here and uh you should check out the check out the work of peter delchow which is nimza so if you go to target nova also we have like the documents for somewhere earlier uh liquid magnetic uh liquid uh mercury powered crafts that are you know essentially but like in the 19th century uh charles delshau and peter menace i think peter menace set up um some pretty interesting experiments for um alternative propulsion electromagnetic crafts powered with liquid mercury oh that&#x27;s peter m-e-n-e-s m-e-double-n m-e-double-nis and madness and delshow charles dalsh d-e-l-l-s-c-h-a-u i&#x27;m pretty sure okay but if you go to charter renova we have like the documents so it&#x27;s faster to go tartary nova you know easy to find we&#x27;ll put it i&#x27;ll put a link in the description of that so you guys can go check out that that yeah oh nimza is a great fast way to find it too we have like a thing there&#x27;s so many of these documents it&#x27;s easier just to like come find them all like in the list this is actually like the robot i&#x27;m most fond of now it&#x27;s powering up so uh we&#x27;re gonna see if we can lock to space-time with these gyros and then by wiggling the gyros through these or like paddling motions we can literally paddle through the fabric of space-time um that&#x27;s a very good description see what happens it&#x27;s a pretty wicked sound as it powers up here bring it in close so you get the audio this is a pretty wicked sound from that he&#x27;s got audio on the mic though i&#x27;ll bring the mic in for uh to get this audio there we go all right anti-gravity three two turn [Applause] what is happening here [Music] uh something weird is going on with the uh with the servos so we&#x27;ll have to figure this out with the controller yeah the servo uh power supply it was working just a moment ago so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s try that just the servo controller [Music] okay that works fine oh i think the problems in this switch the switch broke earlier so um i might have to tighten it up and switch yeah that switch broke earlier and i had to take it apart so uh let&#x27;s just this is proprietary oh there it goes okay there we go so we&#x27;re having a little problem with the switch i&#x27;m gonna fix that switches we&#x27;re having problems we&#x27;re having problems with switches tonight aren&#x27;t we switching it up on us dude just like biden&#x27;s trying to do with the president yeah they&#x27;re switched up on us they&#x27;re trying to switch it up on us you know and everyone&#x27;s like ah we ain&#x27;t having that trying to switch up all the votes you know with the ballots the ballot count you know and the election machines that are you know just switching [Applause] okay [Music] who&#x27;s ready [Music] oh i see the problem i know i didn&#x27;t control it like that so i have to actually frame it in my mind in order to do that and in in opposition to right [Music] [Music] yeah right there the hope with the rotating things is we can create a whirlpool in space time and sort of use those vortexes and space time to push off of slightly and that maybe would be getting some you know momentum or some um acceleration through space time through through this action and if that&#x27;s the case then um you know we&#x27;ll be able to see that experimentally and uh and then we&#x27;ll be able to calculate it hopefully and determine if that&#x27;s consistent with the um the level of output we&#x27;re seeing in this uh experiment not that i think this could reasonably use for for propulsion especially not a device that could like get us off the planet maybe maybe this is synchronized in ways kind of like that all of them are synchronized to the symmetrical spin well this is also this idea that right that we got a big freaking mercury plasma you know a toroid like a size of a 300 foot diameter full of mercury spinning at really high speed and then you just flipped it all of a sudden that&#x27;s going to create a lot more force than these little tiny gyroscopes so yeah big thing with a big mass with a big um you know big angular momentum and then you sort of spun that in the right way and flipped it that you could um maybe you know get this thing that like you know like the angular momentum you accept this angular momentum point so it&#x27;s locked in this point you know where its center of mass is somewhere out in space or orbit and then you flip the whole thing over and then you know you can potentially get this you know thing to take off and move um you know a long distance through conservation of angular momentum but i don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a far out theory and but i i have seen it now you know some interesting um position entropy from the destruction of the [Music] the other thing that could be happening is that these these um the spinning motion is aligning atomic spin states or atomic nuclei for the quantum backing and that that sort of alignment could be responsible for you know what&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here the other issue like what most people say what most physicists say is that it&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s just a coefficient of static friction versus uh kinetic friction where it&#x27;s just you know there&#x27;s the things it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hot it&#x27;s it&#x27;s sticking up and then pushing off of something that&#x27;s that&#x27;s causing momentarily uh static friction rather than um you know kinetic friction well it&#x27;d be super negligible i know it would be super negligible so it says uh especially in this one there&#x27;s no real room for it to be pushing off of anything yeah um which is interesting because this this literally does move right one of the gyros is not working so [Music] careful one of the gyros stopped working though we flipped over but again you know what i&#x27;m seeing here is like that this this this system has an angular momentum which is in in this space and that by rotating these all things it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s again it&#x27;s conservation of angular momentum that&#x27;s what classic physics says about this experiment we&#x27;d like to see [Music] burger picture yes oh we lost the camera i&#x27;d like to see a more definitive break hey guys um we might we might be uh you guys know we know victor schauberger is the repulsion engine and uh what do you think about you know liquid mercury in a victor shower or spiral it&#x27;s kind of an archimedean spiral like well that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m thinking right that&#x27;s what i was i was saying you use liquid mercury instead of you know so you have a liquid um gyro instead of a solid a solid dry row and then the liquid gyro is it&#x27;s able to rotate more freely it has another axis of freedom uh of rotation to it so you could literally just have this this mercury spinning around inside of this vortex and then you can also additionally you know corkscrew it as it&#x27;s going around the vortex so you start to turn it in these these diff different corkscrew motions um and that uh sort of turning can cause a uh a sort of weird a weird pinch effect in the in the way that uh angular momentum is conserved in the entire system because because of the way that angular angular angular things work at the center of the toroid it&#x27;s a smaller angle and then the outside of the target it&#x27;s this longer angle so if you can get this if you can get this corkscrew thing going right as it rotates you could potentially get you know whirlpool vortices of electromagnetic whirlpool voicing that seems like the weirdest idea but if you could use some sort of like electromagnetic osmosis essentially to grab the difference right then you&#x27;re latching onto the fields or space time and and being able to spit these things off the back it&#x27;s a very interesting idea it&#x27;s a very you know it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a good theory and you know it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a good hypothesis that&#x27;s cool you&#x27;re open because i think they&#x27;re like the most um the most part ones are probably the best ones like that victor schaberger has got some pretty good stuff you know he&#x27;s interesting you know it&#x27;s again that&#x27;s old and then that goes back to like if victor schaubert was the real deal then then the nazis you know then then it gets more fair he&#x27;s [Music] gives more credibility to this idea that we had this a long time ago and that there was a secret space program hyper boring in the 1890s idea is that like the prussians were talking to pleiades you know i mean that that makes sense if you think of like that dyson spirit broadcasting like data and li-fi you get like a morse code light transmission like of course free energy would be like one of the first things you&#x27;d use to excite people like if you can use electricity you know oh the sideways but yeah i think if we were to try to build something um it would be basically something we&#x27;ve been built a number of times over we look at the mono we were talking about earlier so you know clearly there was already this idea of the vedic uh electricity and flying crafts that&#x27;s the same shape exactly as the black belt so it&#x27;s more of a repeat it&#x27;s not just that the germans had something you know cool man i i stand whole you know maybe there&#x27;s some hope for this that that that we will have anti-gravity in our lifetimes although it just seems to me if that if they were able to create this stuff in the 1800s or you know like 100 years ago and stuff why the hell can&#x27;t we create it now in our our lab you know so that&#x27;s a fair that&#x27;s a keep working man yeah yeah i got it though i figured out what it what it needs whatever you like yeah we could be just sticking on the bearing and we probably are but anyways how do you think guys yeah well i mean take a look here we go i mean i felt like there&#x27;s something there well here&#x27;s here&#x27;s the motion so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really straightforward and it&#x27;s just on the one that&#x27;s [Music] servos [Music] interesting [Music] it is kind of like rotating around a little bit pushing it a little bit man you know so if this is the kind of motion that we need to do and we can do it with these like two little gyros and it&#x27;s propelling this thing a little bit right now imagine if we took the same kind of motional effect and we started doing it to all the little spin orbits of these electrons or atoms in the in the surface of our screen coating or smart skin right so we had a smart skin full of all these these sort of dry atomic gyros acting as the surface mediator for this you know assuming that gravity and and these interactions are a surface phenomenon and then we have all these these sort of uh electrons or these surface particles moving in this this sort of um coordinated motion we could like maybe it would be a much more efficient way to atomically paddle through space time you know well well we&#x27;re starting to uh we&#x27;re starting to imbalance and stuff man anyways this is really cool i want to break this down because i want to get i want to i want to i want to wrap this stream up for the night we got water we got to do some stuff and get going but um this was really cool and and some interesting discussions and some interesting uh stuff to learn about and go forward um so this guy just said they&#x27;re construction workers no you&#x27;re a [ __ ] liar um you piece of [ __ ] i&#x27;m not a [ __ ] construction worker bro get the [ __ ] out of here bro i&#x27;m a physicist who does construction work for a lot for for a living get it get get your back straight bro um you guys should explore electro kinetic drive concepts further as can be improved hundreds of times compared to standard lifters that would be cool um come on this is the only mic that&#x27;s working so if you want to come over here and talk as far as the electro kinetic drives which mica which camera are we on this one here yeah as far as the electro kinetic drives yeah we&#x27;ve looked into them and looked into them and looked into them we&#x27;ve tried many many variations uh on electrokinetic tribes and we&#x27;re sort of stuck right now in terms of other things that we can try we&#x27;ve tried letharge and lead we&#x27;ve tried high voltage dc we&#x27;ve tried high voltage pulse we&#x27;ve tried ac plus dc we&#x27;ve tried uh different types of waveforms we have tried probably now 20 different varieties of materials from high k dielectrics to low k high insulating value dielectrics as far as brown gills and electro kinetics it&#x27;s a really tricky subject and so far from everything we&#x27;ve tried we haven&#x27;t really received any tangible results so if anyone&#x27;s got ideas or they know what that little trick is to make them work i&#x27;d love to hear about it all ears all right yeah so um anything anyone else have anything to say before we close the stream out um we still have to try out that last experiment how long do you think it would be for the uh switch probably too long for the stream i like to keep it going how many people are watching we&#x27;re down to a hundred now um i mean we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna do this experiment anyway so people are gonna watch this on the recycle so let&#x27;s just close it up it&#x27;s 12 40 i mean yeah i&#x27;m ready to close it up man i don&#x27;t want to be sitting here you know like dragging this on and and stuff man um so anyways people are going to bed uh yeah thanks thanks for watching man this is you know again this is this is gonna be um it&#x27;s gonna take a lot of work to get to to our path and and we&#x27;re gonna have to you know try a lot of different things and try a lot of these different ideas out and um of course you know keep keep going back to the drawing board figure out what we can do better you know and again this kind of setups you know you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re seeing this live you have no idea how much work went into this behind the scenes and and to preparate prep in preparation to get this all set up and put this all together so um give give a round of applause to everyone here to for for the team for putting this all together for you guys and um you know again you know if you guys can do it better um that would be great i would love to see more channels attempting to do this stuff and showing us you know up and being like oh these guys are idiots so we&#x27;re gonna do this experiment right and do it and and do it for real that would be great that would be the best best thing we could have you know some guy in the comments said he&#x27;s gonna make a channel mocking what we&#x27;re doing uh you know that that&#x27;s not that&#x27;s not gonna be that&#x27;s not gonna get us anywhere eric green you know so so again expanding the work yes we&#x27;re going to do that uh now he&#x27;s changing his tune oh i like to see his super conductors oh yeah he was kidding okay all right man i knew it i got it yeah you come down here to hawthorne new jersey we&#x27;d love to have you over only if you&#x27;re useful otherwise you know get the [ __ ] out who else the most jersey thing ever applause for falcon space thank you dr hunga oh yeah i have yes met that guy all right cool man yes um yeah construction is a great business to be in actually uh so anyone who talks crap about that you know like just just just look at the house that you&#x27;re living in it would you wouldn&#x27;t be there if it weren&#x27;t for construction so that&#x27;s right and we have to construct a flying saucer so if you want a flying saucer you got to come to the construction people bro if you want theories and and and you know fancy ideas and maps tom delonge one of the theories and plenty of channels he&#x27;s also very good at these like really cool animations build stuff actually put you know people actually build [ __ ] yeah come to the right place soldering eye or not a graphics card oh superconductors yeah tell me about superconductors i don&#x27;t know when i wake up that&#x27;s what i know i woke up this morning bought some super conductors yes dude flubber yeah oh that&#x27;s pretty much what it is you know you talk about the tile what about the tiles super conductors are kind of like tiles yeah they kind of feel like a tile um ceramics do it do yourself a fair gels and the foams and stuff and and some of those those materials right aerofoams arrow gels like do yourself a favor find me on also alien scientist twitter because i just put out a bunch of stuff on how to make some graphene at home and you can make a great aerogel from graphene which you can turn into a superconductor or you can add superconductive material to the graphene arrow gel yeah you need like uterine barium copper oxide for the ycbo superconductor we&#x27;re actually making some of that in the lab we&#x27;re going to make special superconductors to try this experiment on another level with larger discs and i actually have a friend of mine tom who&#x27;s going to be helping me out no different tom yeah and uh he goes by professor x in the book that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to call exertis different x professor x and he&#x27;s going to be down here helping us build some really large super connectors like three inch diameter i&#x27;m super psyched three inch diameter superconductor by the way is very large um in terms of superconductors they&#x27;re pretty hard to make in large sizes eric green keeps on talking what does he have to say yeah eric green check out exercise i&#x27;ll check your channel out too it seems like you&#x27;re interested in uh material science that&#x27;s also a thing i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like a disc uh disc to say that you&#x27;re into construction because like material science you know like the fact yeah for email you could you can email us at falconspaceprogram gmail.com just keep it to the engineering and to the stuff that we&#x27;re actually doing in the lab i don&#x27;t care about like big theories and stuff everyone has them just keep it to the engineering stuff and i&#x27;ll be glad to talk to you yeah if you&#x27;re interested in really weird theories though discord tartary nova click on the discord go yeah you can go like cool if you&#x27;re a real physicist and you&#x27;re into theories and stuff you can email me because i&#x27;m into like the theories i&#x27;m like the kind of the go-between for that that in the lab is is talking to the the physicist what&#x27;s your email address it&#x27;s the alien scientist at gmail.com so if you you got theories and stuff you need someone to crank through that and then like i&#x27;m the guy that takes that stuff and tries to turn it into like engineerable stuff yeah to give to the engineers and the lab guys so that they can go and build this stuff yeah so yeah again this is like the manhattan project uh 2.0 man for the next big uh the next big breakthrough in science it was you know it was atomic physics um you know almost 100 years ago that really changed the world and now it&#x27;s entanglement quantum entanglement and uh oh jake uh hemlock if you&#x27;re an iron worker if you&#x27;re local to us in new jersey we could use your help we need like some super pure iron for a big ass electromagnet it&#x27;s going to weigh a couple hundred pounds like we could really use somebody an iron worker in particular super pure super pure iron we need some really clean iron welding is good welding is good too yeah there&#x27;s nothing wrong with construction workers no that&#x27;s the construction workers are the best that&#x27;s like the reason that&#x27;s the reason why this is possible really is because otherwise you&#x27;re taught to be theoretical and not able to do anything in practice so having any practical experience with materials materials and building stuff yeah you build huge buildings man that&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s kind of like the opposite of like using tinker toys to become a construction worker it&#x27;s like you became a construction worker to work in nanotechnology kind of he&#x27;s just like a kid that had an erector set and he never grew up you know yeah that&#x27;s basically what it is which is interspace we&#x27;re trying to unlock that and everyone there&#x27;s a little kid inside all of us and somewhere along the line these bureaucrats and these these pencil pushers killed that little kid in you and they they sent you through it you know grueling four years of engineering school which killed all your creativity and all your hope for the for for anything other than you know what they jam-packed into your into your uh your skull at that age so so again this is this is what we&#x27;re trying to unlock because we&#x27;re never going to get anywhere in science if we continue to be in an echo chamber where everyone agrees and says oh no the anti-gravity is impossible these people are clowns and these people are ridiculous we all just sat in that echo chamber with the rest of the mainstream physics we&#x27;ll never get anywhere anywhere this is what we&#x27;re popping that uh that echo chamber really yeah what we&#x27;re doing we&#x27;re trying to show people we&#x27;re trying we&#x27;re trying to show people that it&#x27;s okay that you can have a beer and talk about anti-gravity there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it because it&#x27;s going mainstream anyways you know the uh the tic tac really this is one of those reasons why yeah what about these ufos ufos that shard out bismuth and metals you like why are ufos taking metal craps dude i don&#x27;t understand that you gotta exhaust something right yeah but why are like this piece of should we go weird metal and you know like it should be gold or something yeah or something i don&#x27;t know this is just weird this you know it&#x27;s bismuth it&#x27;s like this is what we poop out you know i never got that about the ufo thing man you know this myth is cool looking it does like the bubbles and cube cubic bubbles are neat but at the same time his point is true it should be gold or something that&#x27;s unlike the same like derivation of assault um maybe radiation is like another one he wants to say hi any metals at all i want to say your electro the electrostatic idea like the dielectric is an interesting key and the brain and the pressure sensitivity for some an oppositional theory to gravity is great the less like it has to be that it&#x27;s gravity being repel uh repelled but instead there&#x27;s like another theory that explains everything besides what we&#x27;re calling this mythic gravity that&#x27;s cool because i think that gravity is like often just being used as a word as an excuse for so many things so finding physical explanations for all of these things is actually helping us to find ways to defeat gravity as a concept gravity is not just the fourth force it could be like the fifth sixth seventh and eighth fourth it&#x27;s so ambiguous the way neal or how does neil degrasse tyson describe gravity it&#x27;s the thing that we don&#x27;t understand right that&#x27;s like a really lame thing you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to even have it then you know what i mean yeah it&#x27;s basically like god basically you&#x27;re saying that you&#x27;re a bat hanging upside down also the other simple possibility that gravity is actually a quote-unquote force that&#x27;s just the side effect of other forces we already recognize and have equations so i mean it sounds like god it sounds like veggie tales it sounds a little suspicious it&#x27;s almost cuz we know maxwell&#x27;s equations does we&#x27;re originally much more complicated and the heavyside gibbs modification of those equations effectively killed all the extra data so reducing eric green a large number of equations down to only four it&#x27;s no good there&#x27;s no way to do it and so you kind of have to start looking at things we can describe better like why is there buoyancy so eric green just said the so the closest thing is a ligo experiment that&#x27;s actually laser interferometer gravity observatory and we had one of the um assistants who actually put the ligo device together on our team like a year ago and um yeah he helped us build the uh faraday cages in the other room uh the dog knows yeah the dog knows anti-gravity she appreciates anti-gravity she&#x27;s just waiting for us to like send her into space i could tell the first russian so she&#x27;s gonna be the first anti-gravity flown space dog no she&#x27;s going to go on the safe craft we&#x27;re going to make the uh the robots go on alien scientists at gmail common it&#x27;s one word it&#x27;s uh there&#x27;s no spaces it&#x27;s all one word there&#x27;s that and it&#x27;s you know so that in case you can&#x27;t find it um yeah the brown notebook i have a lot of that stuff i have a lot of browns original stuff i got i just got some new new uh dump that cecil do it was um i got some pictures of sissel do it going in eric green is talking about your email address you said eric alien scientist at gmail is not a validation yeah i already addressed that you weren&#x27;t listening but um check your email um so you got the you got that all set up uh you&#x27;re already in space uh that&#x27;s very true um yes we&#x27;re we&#x27;re trying to get into a space with less gravity though um this is the red bull ufos nobody said that ufos look like turtles turtles never said that no no one said that about you know have you guys noticed man they haven&#x27;t not no one&#x27;s pointed out like the correlations between turtles and ufos look at it man anyways uh yeah this is cool stuff we got we got a lot of uh a lot of interesting theories a lot interesting um yeah in any case that was cool having a discussion on on anti-gravity with us and stuff and then you then you start reading the live chats and stuff i didn&#x27;t get distracted but anyways i&#x27;m tired we had a lot of we had a lot of good uh a lot of good people involved and today thank you all for the live chat and and those who did make uh helpful and good comments and stuff um it&#x27;s very appreciative uh please um please don&#x27;t forget to smash that like button uh subscribe and share this video with anyone you think who might be interested um or who might be smarter than us that could help us out well that&#x27;s always that&#x27;s always helpful to talk to people that are uh and i don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s smarter than everyone because everyone knows different [ __ ] dude it&#x27;s like the intelligence is a weird is a weird thing because everyone knows different stuff and has different skills and the only way you can really build stuff you can&#x27;t just have you just can&#x27;t just be like oh intelligence let&#x27;s just bring the smartest guy in the room and we&#x27;ll just get the one smart guy and he&#x27;ll figure everything out and do everything for us now you need a team then we&#x27;ve reached an age in humanity where information there&#x27;s so much data and there&#x27;s so much information that no one person can do it all themselves we&#x27;re not it&#x27;s not humanly possible to to to be able to handle the amount of information the amount of data that exists currently in in the world out there so so um you need to work as teams you need to break up uh you need to break up the the skills because uh as good as i am at media and doing all this media stuff i i can&#x27;t do it by myself man and my i have audio issues all the time so that still need to be worked out but again that&#x27;s why we have a team get get people with those skills to bring you know combine people with other skills combine people with other skills and then we bring all these skills together construction workers are number one dude construction skills are very useful bro if we&#x27;re gonna build it if we&#x27;re gonna actually build it we need construction workers to build it yeah we&#x27;re in we&#x27;re in jersey right now i&#x27;m i&#x27;m from rhode island and you know we&#x27;re all we&#x27;re all from you know locally so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s team up let&#x27;s link up um let&#x27;s let&#x27;s get let&#x27;s get um let&#x27;s get connected bro um join the network and and send me an email uh you know stay try to stay in the loop and um and get and get connected with us because we&#x27;re we&#x27;re trying to uh we&#x27;re trying to just build a better network of people that are serious about doing this and people that have you know desire knowledge skills and information and ideas to try and uh and especially people with their own experiments because man i guarantee you there&#x27;s somebody out there who&#x27;s who&#x27;s already figured this stuff out who knows this stuff and it&#x27;s just like come on share some information with us you know um you know help push disclosure along this is where disclosure is really going to happen it&#x27;s not going to happen with the government one day being like oh here&#x27;s the data dump we&#x27;re going to you know reveal all our secrets and tell everyone what&#x27;s going on and and then just it&#x27;s instantly going to open up and it&#x27;s going to be this post-disclosure world and it&#x27;s going to be the day after disclosure and then suddenly just after this one event in this one day that everyone&#x27;s just gonna [ __ ] wake up and be like suddenly informed and completely knowledgeable about you know what the hell is going on it&#x27;s not gonna be like that bro this is disclosure&#x27;s a process it&#x27;s a learning process an educational process and we&#x27;re all in we&#x27;re in a time of change right now in a time of torment um a time of turmoil sorry not torment a time of real real great turmoil right now there&#x27;s a lot lot of changes there&#x27;s a lot of chaos taking place and there&#x27;s a lot of things that are going to be ending and emerging there&#x27;s a lot of cycles that that are there that we&#x27;re going through right now on this planet and in this in this age and in this realm so um we need to be we need to be mindful of that and uh and know that you know things are coming together out there um regardless you know when things are falling apart they&#x27;re also coming together in a different way and that um you know we all need to work together as a community to achieve this because this is the singularity this is this is a pivotal time pivotal time for humanity in in human history um and it&#x27;s just great to be here um sharing it with you all and uh be part of it and hopefully we can uh we can be the ones to uh help even if we&#x27;re not the lab that discovers it i definitely want to be the one of the people that helped promote this and and and and share it with the world when it does happen because uh for the closing let&#x27;s get the uh let&#x27;s get everyone in the screenshot and let&#x27;s was thinking the same thing yeah let&#x27;s get everyone together let&#x27;s get a big long big screen shot guys um to anti-gravity hey travis you need to come out here too and then oh he&#x27;s someone&#x27;s gotta hit the end of the stream dude oh he&#x27;ll go back there and hit it yeah we gotta give some cred to our av guy for without him these cameras will be left to their own devices andreas you&#x27;re early oh well i don&#x27;t even think with the picture okay everyone yeah welcome to the last uh live stream of the new jersey gravity lab for a little while here and we&#x27;ll be back again in the future with more experiments for you yep thank you for joining and we&#x27;re over there hold on hold on recent tartarians oh we&#x27;re on that one okay let me switch it back let&#x27;s go back okay all right okay we&#x27;re ready now right all right now are we okay welcome and thank you for coming thank you take it easy folks recent tartarians yeah falcon space program</p>
