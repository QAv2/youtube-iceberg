            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel geared toward uh tuning you in to various theories of everything and how they might be used in a positive manner to enrich your life and uh today is the 284th video that we have done on Dewey B Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory and the reciprocal system of theory is a Theory of Everything Mr Larson has books on wide-ranging topics from chemistry to physics to astronomy to economics to a book on metaphysics which includes chapters on philosophy religion and psychology and some of his followers have extended uh his theory to subjects such as crypto archeology um he also covers dream interpretation uh so and uh if we do our job here we can uh kind of Coach you up to the point where you can take Larson&#x27;s Theory and you can use it yourself and apply it to the subject of your choice um that&#x27;s a little way off you know you&#x27;re gonna have to be a good student I&#x27;m gonna have to be a good teacher for that uh but um the potential is there and the theory is fascinating uh and it&#x27;s especially fascinating uh because nobody knows anything about this that there I I&#x27;ve been studying the reciprocal System since 2001. and uh in that whole time 22 years I have never met another person who has ever heard of it before not in person I know that there are other people who&#x27;ve heard of it before and uh there are quite a few of them that I know um you know through the internet and so on but in person I&#x27;ve never ever met another person who&#x27;s ever heard of it so um it makes me want to get up on uh you know the rooftops and scream it uh but people don&#x27;t really listen uh when you do that you know they just get on their phone and call 9-1-1 or whatever but um today we are looking at actually one of uh Mr Larson&#x27;s followers not followers uh in terms of uh you know a disciple or something like that but uh someone who studied up on the reciprocal system himself and then began to uh apply it and uh apply it to this to the subjects that he cared about and that&#x27;s Dr Bruce Perrette the late Dr Bruce Perrette who died back in 2020. and he left behind a lot of great material that almost Rivals Mr Larson&#x27;s over uh uh itself um Mr Larson died back in 1990 by the way and so um you know there are very few people that are still alive that are still working on this as far as I know but probably a lot more than I think um but the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that uh we live in a universe of motion the universe is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between time and space and that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between time and space the most basic idea the most basic kind of motion that we&#x27;re familiar with is speed the bicycle is moving at 15 miles per hour 15 miles of space in one hour of time space over time and you can see that reciprocal relationship if you decide that you want to double the speed now the bike is moving 30 miles per hour doubling the speed now the bike is moving 30 miles per hour but you can so if you double the space you&#x27;re doubling the speed but you can also say that the bicycle is moving 15 miles per half hour by dividing the time so you get the same results if you double the speed or if you have the time that&#x27;s a reciprocal relationship two and one half are reciprocals of each other you know you have reciprocals when they multiply together and they get exactly one those are reciprocals two and one half three and one-third three halves and two-thirds these are all reciprocals of one another um and in Larson&#x27;s system every kind of uh scientific phenomena that we can think of is a form of motion pressure is a form of motion electric current is a form of motion electric charge is a form of motion matter is a form of motion energy is a form of motion um electrical capacitance viscosity is a form of motion density is a form of motion and they&#x27;re all expressible using a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator with the caveats that Larson lists in his first fundamental postulate he has two fundamental postulates that he came out with in the late 1950s and they were the basis for all the books that he wrote he basically had these two fundamental postulates and from those he wrote uh his whole uh he came up with his whole theoretical Universe through a process of deduction and I go through the steps of his deduction in about 15 videos that I did about eight months ago called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system that shows the 165 steps that he took to get from his postulates all the way to you know the farthest reaches of astronomy and you know the farthest reaches of atomic physics uh and that&#x27;s another so the first uh caveat is that uh space now remember space and time are reciprocals so in general they have the same exact qualities just like three and one-third they have the same qualities that&#x27;s three but one of them three is in the in the numerator and the other three is in the denominator uh and vice versa in one one is in the numerator and one is in the denominator or vice versa now uh when you&#x27;re talking about uh time and space they both have the same qualities so uh one of those qualities is they are coordinate meaning that they have multiple dimensions three or maybe even more Dimensions x y z coordinates on a graph they&#x27;re three-dimensional we&#x27;re we&#x27;re accustomed to that idea with space not so much with time but time then also does have three dimensions or at least that has an aspect of its uh you know of itself that is three or more dimensions the second stipulation is uh that they are both scalar they both uh what Larson calls clock time and clock space a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no direction and it&#x27;s called scalar because it expresses different scales um you know it&#x27;s it really it&#x27;s the same thing regardless of the scale um and this holds true with Larson&#x27;s Theory the same rules that he applies to Atomic physics are the same rules that he applies to a astronomical physics um you know even though one is very very very small and one is very very very large they he uses the same rules um and so it once you learn the rules you can apply them to whatever scale that you&#x27;re on now the basic uh scalar motion is a fundamental part of Larson&#x27;s system so it&#x27;s good to try to understand it pretty well um the uh the basic idea with clock time is that the clock is always getting later and later and later and later um that is emotion that has no particular direction or no specific direction or you could say it&#x27;s in all directions the clock is always getting later and later and later now we&#x27;re accustomed to that idea of the clock ticking the progression of time or the flow of time but what we&#x27;re not so familiar with is clock space clock space is a scalar Motion in space and you can Envision this using a balloon with a bunch of dots on it you um blow up the balloon and all the dots are going to be moving away from each other but in no specific direction that you could think of as the flow of space if you want to fill in the center of that balloon and not just be on the surface you can think of it in terms of raisin bread if you put the raisin bread in the oven and start cooking it all the raisins as the bread Rises all the raisins will be moving away from each other that is a scalar motion and you know say if you have some kind of super yeast or something like that um you can put the bread in the oven and it might just be this size but when it when you bake it maybe it blows up to this size so you know it has different scales that it uh you know will occupy and but the rules will be the same at every point along along the line you know so the scalar motion is um something that you can measure the magnitude of but uh ultimately in the reciprocal system everything works the same regardless of what the scale is now there are some caveats to that too but that&#x27;s the general uh the general basis of that um now the uh one of the caveats oh well so I would just say that also in terms of clock space um the Hubble telescope has measured this uh in noting that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other so that is another way of thinking about the flow of space or the progression of space a scalar move scalar Motion in space now the third uh caveat is that uh space and time are quantized meaning that there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time they&#x27;re both very small but if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space and if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time then you don&#x27;t have time or I would say you you know you have zero space and zero time or you um you have to have a full unit before you have anything and then if you want to move up to a second unit then you have to have a full second unit or you just have one so that&#x27;s the discrete unit postulate and if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time and remember we identified uh space over time as speed if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light one over one equals one and so Larson calls the speed of light unit speed and for Larson and for a universe of motion you know the first thing that you have to be able to do to understand the universe of motion is you have to understand that there is motion even before there is anything moving motion precedes the thing that&#x27;s moving because it&#x27;s a universe of motion that&#x27;s the most fundamental thing that there is is the motion and the thing that&#x27;s moving actually is motion itself matter is a form of motion in Larson&#x27;s system motion is spaced to the time to the third power over space to the third power that is the equation for for matter just in the same way that the equation for Speed is space over time and uh you know if you actually want to plug it in you&#x27;ve got two-thirds of the parts there already um you if E equals m c squared energy equals matter times the speed of light squared okay so we said matter is time to the third power over space to the third power and speed is space over time you got to square that M E equals m c squared C being the speed of light so the c squared is s to the second power over t to the second power you multiply those out and you get T over s that is energy energy is time over space energies time over space and speed is space over time matter is space to the third pops time to the third power over space to the third power and so using that is a great way of checking all of the classical equations that the Legacy scientists have come up with and seeing how they balance out they should they should balance out if the equation is correct or and or if Larson&#x27;s uh you know uh assignment of Dimensions to them are correct and in one case uh Larson did assign the wrong Dimensions to electrical capacitance that eventually had to be uh corrected by Dr Bruce perrett um or at least uh that&#x27;s what I think you know it could be uh could be wrong but it seems to check out so that&#x27;s the thing about Larson&#x27;s system is it it usually it checks out you can you can determine over the course of time whether you&#x27;ve plugged it in correctly or not and Larson admitted that okay now um basically if you have the speed of light as your background speed that is the speed that&#x27;s always occurring you have half the universe that is moving so the speed of light is basically the neutral point or the zero point so you have half the universe moving faster than the speed of light and half of the universe moving slower than the speed of light Larson calls those the cosmic sector and the material sector respectively we know very very very little about the cosmic sector uh science wise but we know just about everything about the material sector but because of the reciprocal postulate we can determine or extrapolate to determine uh what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector because what&#x27;s going on over there is exactly the same as what&#x27;s going on in the material sector except that you have to reverse the roles of space and time simply in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and clock time clock is always getting later and later later in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time three-dimensional time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther apart so that is just a simple example of how um the two sectors are identical uh in in function um in general except that you have to re invert the roles of space and time okay now um Larson took that postulate along with the second postulate which is that the Universe conforms to the relationships of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean uh and the euclidean geometry has also been contested by Dr Bruce paret who contends that the geometry is actually projective um although euclidean geometry is a subset of projective geometry uh so it&#x27;s not a complete rejection but just an expansion of the geometry by paret but now uh Dr peret has written an article here that we&#x27;re going to look at uh today is I believe the sixth episode so if you want to start the article at the beginning you want to go back about five episodes but this uh article is written by Daniel Phoenix 3 which is peret&#x27;s pen name that he uses when he writes things that are a little bit more speculative in nature and peret has a wild imagination and he&#x27;s imbibed a lot of Science Fiction in his time and so he does get into things that are very speculative at times and this is no um this is no exception this article is called geoengineering Chemtrails harp timelines and Ascension and we are about to begin the section here that is called ele and Ascension e-l-e stands for extinction level events and El Es are not an end but simply a time of change happens all the time in nature happened with the Dinosaurs the hominids uncountable millions of insects bugs and varieties of plant life recent summaries say that the number of species going extinct has increased a thousand fold compared to a century ago but they aren&#x27;t just disappearing they are evolving and that is what is supposed to be happening with Mankind and other intelligent life forms on Earth humans are only the dominant species not the only intelligent one if the globalist had not started messing around with geoengineering and genetics some 50 years ago Humanity would have already been in the transition phase phase to a more complex form of life higher density expression of consciousness all the GMO foodstuffs we are exposed to on a daily basis combined with the chemicals used in climate modification has delayed certain natural processes from being initiated in Dewey Larson&#x27;s book beyond space and time which incidentally we read into the record on this channel uh over the course of about 85 or 90 videos probably about four or five months ago if you&#x27;d like to to go into that book in Dewey Larson&#x27;s book beyond space and time he discusses the life unit the origins of the living cell and the biological level of existence one of the more Salient points concerning biological structure is that it mimics Stellar Behavior again scale the rules are the same regardless of what kind of scale you&#x27;re talking about whether you&#x27;re on astronomical Stellar scale or whether you&#x27;re on microscopic scale or whether you&#x27;re on human scale uh you are dealing with the same rules so uh structure is that it mimics life mimics Stellar Behavior life is composed of a stable combination of matter and anti-matter uh anti-matter being called Cosmic matter from the cosmic sector in the reciprocal system that exists in three-dimensional time coordinate time this linkage also has its sublight uh below the speed of light spatial body and faster than light uh or uh Cosmic body or time three-dimensional time body components or temporal mind or soul is what peret calls it the soul it starts uh that&#x27;s our temporal uh mine or you know the same aspect as the body counterpart to the body or the reciprocal of the body and even continues One Step Beyond that into the realm of ethics and metaphysics hence the title beyond space and time life has remarkable similarities to the various stages of Stellar Evolution observed by astronomers when The evolutionary direction is corrected because uh as he pointed out earlier in this I think earlier in this article um the astronomers uh system of Stellar evolution is backwards they think that the oldest stars um are actually the newest stars and the newest stars are actually the oldest oldest Stars so back in high school you might have learned that uh that saying be a fine girl kiss me oh oh be a fine girl kiss me that is uh o b a f g k m that is the uh Legacy Sciences evolution of stars so if you start with an o star and then a b star and then an a star and then uh an F star but in peret is saying that in Larson&#x27;s system it&#x27;s actually backwards and it goes and the O star is actually the last one on this on the uh evolutionary scale so you would have to come up with a new a new um a little saying there Stars Are Born from a cloud of dirt and make a body the in the infusion of a soul as the compression of matter reaches faster than light motion and its eventual death in the glory of a supernova life can be thought of as twin Sons one in space and and one in time linked together in a controlled explosion of energy such that all the thermal extremes cancel each other out as Delan from uh the uh the show Babylon 5 stated we are star stuff and are inexorably or inexorably tied to the stellar and planetary processes of the solar system we have scratched the surface of these associations with Concepts such as astrology and metaphysics but only scratched the problem that has arisen is that for the last 50 years or so we&#x27;ve been blocked off from our genetic inheritance by Geo and Gene and genetic engineering the proper signals to do a little uh to do a life unit upgrade were not received when they should have been kind of like those people at the gym that wear headphones and don&#x27;t see the basketball bouncing toward their face despite people yelling look out they eventually get hit in the face and they are totally caught by surprise because they&#x27;re wearing headphones time to rip the headphones off of people and let them hear the warning signs and the signal to upgrade their psyche there is still hope but I don&#x27;t mean from extraterrestrials okay this section is called resetting genetic modifications and let&#x27;s see if we have time to get into this I think uh we should probably wait until the next uh session and uh yeah I&#x27;m sorry I probably went too long in my earlier explanation of the basics of the reciprocal system and didn&#x27;t have enough time to get into Mr Perez Dr peret&#x27;s uh paper here but um you know it&#x27;s pretty heavy stuff so you know take it in small doses and it uh it&#x27;s I think it&#x27;s good I try to uh explain the reciprocal system differently every time I explain it and so you have a collection here on this channel of 284 different explanations of the same thing and so you know hopefully every time I uh you know it doesn&#x27;t get that stale that that um that I bring in some new information or put together new information in a different way each time I explain it and so you can because uh the probably the best way to learn this stuff is through repetition just hearing it over and over and over again reading it over and over and over again until it kind of sinks in because you have to be able to really unlearn things before you um before you can learn them and you unlearn them by kind of being confronted with the opposite or a a con a diverging viewpoint okay well thank you for tuning in today and uh we&#x27;ll get to the next section here called resetting genetic modifications starting tomorrow have a great day</p>
