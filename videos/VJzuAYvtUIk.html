            <p>Jim latky there has been considerable speculation fueled in part by statements from the dod&#x27;s spokesperson that the $22 million that was secured by Senator Reid and his colleagues in Congress uh to fund this program and study had nothing to do with UFOs it was really just a study of future Technologies presumably by our adversaries that it was really just just that uh can you address whether oap was first and foremost an investigation of UFO phenoma why isn&#x27;t it made obvious in any of the documentation that&#x27;s been made public so far uh it was completely UFO related the reason you haven&#x27;t seen the documentation is we used a statement of objectives format for the request for proposal that is insufficient for anyone examining the contents of the contract they must have the proposal now within the proposal and in this case it was from uh Bigalow Aerospace Advanced space studies it&#x27;s clearly mentioned among the topics proposed a worldwide database of advanced uh Aerospace Vehicles there can be no ambiguity here this was being proposed as a UFO project now if you want to look at the tail end of the project you&#x27;ll find over a hundred documents required to be reported to the defense intelligence agency that were UFO related in part of course I mean they were large very large documents and you also have uh you know technical studies and you have that database probably the largest UFO database that exists in the world and is currently being used by the US military so so yes it was completely a UFO project one of the other things that&#x27;s been confusing for the public over the last almost four years the the New York Times and other major media Outlets reported that that $22 million went to ATP not to oap can you clarify the difference between ASAP and atip yes um the name atip was a nickname for assap for certain security reasons that we&#x27;ve put into the book um but the difference between assap with the nickname ATP at DIA and atip at the Pentagon is quite distinct assap had $22 million of funding it covered military and civilian UFOs yielding a massive database um it also had a main contract and subcontracts now a in the Pentagon as described in the Articles was basically zero funded looked at specific military UFO encounters and very important ones because they had film and it had no contract so getting back to how did this mixup occur I think it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not deliberate it&#x27;s not due to to to authors to television personalities Etc it&#x27;s the fact we were running not an official sap but a closed program I can tell you for a fact that within my own office they did not know except leadership that this contract was being run they had no idea whatsoever our security was that tight uh and also the fact is is that well I guess that pretty much says it that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the best example I I I can give uh Dr colum kellart you were a program manager at Bass can you describe in sort of broad terms the operation at Bass how many people were hired in what time frame and what did they do I mean was this a real investigation of UFOs and related phenomena and how did it work well I was hired in uh November of 2008 the oap program ran from September 2008 to late 2010 so one of the first um tasks that I had on coming on board was to put together a team of uh UFO focused investigators as quickly as possible so I was thinking back on this and between November 2008 and probably April 2009 I personally conducted about 300 telephone inter views</p>
