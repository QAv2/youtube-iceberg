            <p>have you ever had a chance to examine any materials that are purported to be from these UAP crash retrieval programs I have examined some materials uh very famous for people who are follow this area bisou magnesium samples U the downside is that it&#x27;s a very uh incomplete chain of custody but basically someone claimed that their grandfather had gotten this material uh which was a piece of bismuth and magnesium bonded together in a series of layers that were you know the size of human hairs I mean really terrifically detailed and so that was sent uh to uh Art Bell on a TV show and then he provided it to researcher Linda how and and uh when we set up uh an organization to the Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences we able to obtain that so we got that piece of uh material certainly is exotic to look at under microscope or whatever uh we ended up doing uh a crat What&#x27;s called the crat with the an army uh laboratory for them to examine it in in great detail it turned out that to examine it under the best of circumstances it had to go to an even better lab so they turned it over to Arrow the Alder name anomalies research oranization who then turned it over to orl uh which is one of our nuclear Laboratories that is so well outfitted and so they did a lot of analysis and uh we were supposed to get the results of that analysis but we were told we couldn&#x27;t see them because it was highly classified so anyway uh we complained about that because that was not part of the agreement and uh as it turns out uh it was highly classified not particularly because of what they found but because of it revealing what instrumentation the uh the laboratory had used to evaluate it and so but nonetheless uh two of us from the program Dr Eric Davis and myself we were flown flown to the Pentagon and we got to read the original reports and so on and so uh it was really uh an astonishing report there was no proof of uh isotopes that would be from an extraterrestrial location so the idea that maybe we could prove it was ET because of isotope formation that that that didn&#x27;t pan out but nonetheless they had to agree that the putting together of these kinds of materials that you can never get to bond together rather hardly at microscopic levels was really quite quite unusual in fact separately we had an aerospace Corporation spent a million dollars and mess up their equipment trying to bond these things together so in the end uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a mixed outcome no proof that this came from an ET crash was supposed to be rawell but on the other hand uh nothing that proved that you know it couldn&#x27;t possibly be the case so anyway uh we&#x27;re about to publish a long paper on on the details we got</p>
