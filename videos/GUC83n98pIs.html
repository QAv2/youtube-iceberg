            <p>oh [Music] [Music] well Welcome to our honest investigators Talk Shop show I&#x27;m your host Doug Bundy president of the Larson Research Center where we are unveiling the universe of motion today is Saturday February 27th 2016 and we&#x27;re sure happy to have you here in Parts one through three of this series we&#x27;ve presented a general overview of the work the purpose of the lrc Larson Research Center and uh and I&#x27;m just checking to see I don&#x27;t see any indication that the audio is feeding through so I hope it actually is darn uh but this thing should give me some kind of way to monitor it but I don&#x27;t have that uh at any rate uh we uh it looks like everything is coming through all right uh looking at other ways but so as I was saying we&#x27;ve uh shown the purpose of the lrc as well as the major acronyms that we employ and there&#x27;s a lot of them throughout these lectures so please refer to the videos of those previous lectures for orientation type information uh now this is again the seventh in the series in this lecture three the seventh and the final uh series uh in uh presentations 4 through six of this series we&#x27;ve explained what we might call seven major achievements of the lrc&#x27;s rst reciprocal system of theory based physical theory development all of these videos are available on our YouTube channel as well as on our website uh which are all entitled lrc physics if you go to our website at lrc physics.com and click in the left hand menu there there&#x27;s a it says online lectures and there are more all the lectures really that we&#x27;ve had uh since uh we did these live lectures in Clearfield Utah as well as lectures by other people that we think are important so uh right up to the last one that we did last week so check out our website there&#x27;s lots of things to discuss there and then come here uh for the live presentations on our YouTube channel and uh or I think you can even watch it on Facebook but uh here on our YouTube channel you can comment so the comment section there uh should be open and and uh you can submit questions and so on like that well um in our um last like I said uh uh previous in our previous lectures we&#x27;ve explained six major achievements of the theory of motion and uh let me see uh how uh we we would list those uh as shown here on this chart I just checking to see that I had uh Advanced the chart looks like everything&#x27;s okay all right so um assuming you can hear me now our first one explains how the physical Universe consists of two reciprocal sectors the material and Cosmic sectors this is due to the nature of of uh motion that uh where uh the progression of in three dimensions of the motion uh produces a unit motion where one unit uh of uh space uh progresses for every unit of time and that is identified as the speed of light so you have then uh entities that uh form that are less than the speed of light and then those uh that are greater than the speed of light which of course is not really recognized by what we call the Legacy system of physical Theory uh the the uh mainstream uh physics that uh that uh are the U main Endeavor of the Gentile Nations and of course if they in their theories if they have anything that&#x27;s greater than greater than the speed of light they call it a tachon then that automatically invalidates the theory because they uh understand Einstein&#x27;s theory that nothing uh no matter can go uh can uh actually have a relative speed greater than the speed of light and of course that&#x27;s true but that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t entities that aren&#x27;t matter uh that can uh form on the other side of that boundary well and so that&#x27;s the first uh major achievement it doubles the universe so to speak and explains a lot of phenomena astronomical phenom phenomena that otherwise is inexplicable as we will someday hopefully see then the second achievement explains the origin of light is discrete entities of scalar motion combinations known as photons of course propagating at the speed of light relative to matter now these uh are we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve shown how these combine uh automatically uh or I wouldn&#x27;t say automatically but the the probability of of the these uh combinations forming is quite High because of the orthogonality of space and time progressions so uh these turn into oscillations now we can&#x27;t uh explain how the oscillation start but because it it&#x27;s possible then it uh anything that&#x27;s possible can be so that&#x27;s the is that how we express it seems like we can express it better than that but um any anything that is possible I can&#x27;t remember exactly anyway the fact is is that because it&#x27;s it is possible to happen then it then it&#x27;s going to be somewhere in the universe it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to exist and then that also then um explains the origin of matter uh in terms of combinations of these scalar motion entities and uh these uh uh combinations are found in the standard model of particle physics that uh classifies the particles that have been observed uh uh in the last what 50 years 100 years um that are we call quarks and and uh those are the firion the leptons and the quarks are Fons and then we have another class of particles that are bons and they have various distinguish properties and the the Fons form uh these quarks and each Quark has an it&#x27;s antiquark and each uh lepton which is an electron or a positron or a neutrino or an anti nutrino they these have their antiparticles so the anti-particle of the electron is the uh positron the anti- particle of the uh nutrino is the anti nutrino and then of course you have the up quark and the anti- up quark and the down quark and the anti- down quark and so on so all of these are formed now there are three families of those and we uh but only one family is uh stable so we just deal right now with the one family that is stable and then as we get to the point where we can deal with the other two families maybe we will do that but uh that&#x27;s important then to understand well now that&#x27;s a third achievement the fourth great achievement of our uh theory is that it explains how these entities have the correct properties of observe quarks and leptons which can then combine in the proper way to form protons neutrons and electron uh constituents of atoms so they form first protons and neutrons out of the quarks and then the electron can join those combinations and form atoms and then uh that so that&#x27;s the fourth achievement the fifth achievement explains the trality of the standard model entities and U that means the left-handedness and the right-handedness that&#x27;s all in this it all comes out in the combinations of these uh proton of these Photon like um St units we call them space and time units to find more details or to understand the detail of this stuff we you can refer to our previous lectures but the important thing about the trality is that it enables us then for the to make the sixth achievement which uh explains beta minus and beta plus decay in terms of conservation of motion and that was pretty exciting that was a recent development and uh we talked about that in our previous lecture last Saturday uh so now uh we want to uh move on to our uh next achievement the theoretical development of um the uh um or not the development but the calculation of the atomic Spectra starting with hydrogen you know the theoretical development of the LST the Legacy System Theory community&#x27;s quantum theory that we call it quantum physics the theory behind that started of course with the discovery by spect spectroscopists that&#x27;s a difficult word to say but those that specialize in spectroscopy or the study of light and it started when they discovered that atoms of different elements absorbs absorb and emit photons of discrete frequencies and intensities that are characteristics of those atoms for example hydrogen&#x27;s characteristic pattern of distinct frequency shows five uh lines in the visible spectrum five discrete uh frequencies of light in the visible spectrum that are now named for Johan Balmer who first managed to formulate an equation to explain these phenomenon and soon after that joannas ridberg was able to reformulate balmer&#x27;s equation to make it generally applicable to the atomic Spectra of all elements that was a great breakthrough and that and other developments especially Ruthford results of his uh experiments quickly led to the proposed model of the atom uh which is composed of a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by orbiting electrons with the distance of their orbital paths determined by the absorption and emission of photons something that any High School physics student knows all about and those photons that are absorbed and emitted are of a a specific frequency as I said and that frequencies indicated by the pattern of their spectral lines and uh hydrogen has five let&#x27;s see I got forgot to change the to our uh SL our next slide there and I&#x27;m talking about it but these hydrogen lines uh are U calculated using their frequencies are calculated their wavelengths are calculated using the rid bir equation which is interpreted in terms of the atomic model known as the bore model the model that&#x27;s named after the famous physicist Neil&#x27;s bore and that&#x27;s where the nucleus is surrounded by uh orbiting electrons of course the subsequent development of quantum physics theory invalidated the bore model in some respects but it continues today as the only accepted model of the atom capable of explaining the atomic Spectra that you see here the red line at 6563 uh nanometers and then this uh bright green line or maybe Cayenne line I can&#x27;t remember the name of that color per forms what they call the Balmer series and uh he uh was able to calculate all six of them these five and one more that he didn&#x27;t even know ex had been discovered uh by uh using his uh his Cal the things that he uh a constant that he discovered by trial and error and and also um some uh rational numbers that he discovered based on the squares of of one two three and four so on like that so this resulted then in that bore model and it&#x27;s still used today even [Music] though uh it&#x27;s uh uh known not to be accurate in some respects so Dewey Larson though the author of the reciprocal system of theory rejected the entire structure of the bore model as he explained in his book the case against the nuclear atom and it&#x27;s a strong case in his rst based model the electron becomes an integral part of the atom and what is thought of uh today with the bore model as the nucleus of protons and neutrons is actually the atom itself in his model consisting of a combination of scalar motions identified as protons neutrons and electrons separately but which lose their individual identity as constituents of the combinations uh that make up the scalar motions identified as atomic elements however lson was never able to explain in his Works how photons were absorbed and emitted by the atoms of his model and a University Professor from India kvk Neu who seemed to be The Heir Apparent of larsson&#x27;s work in the early 1980s later uh after larsson&#x27;s passing declared that calculating quote calculating the electronic energy levels should be our immediate priority that is the society that the of uh rst devotees of Larson devotees uh because with this glaring Lacuna present referring uh to this uh lack of being able to calculate the atomic Spectra the reciprocal system cannot gain acceptance close quote this was written in his August 2002 paper that was submitted to the and presented to the uh Society International Society for unified Sciences was as it was called and his presentation is called the quantum qm approach is the qm approach inevitable was the name of his paper well you can see the problem here in this chart where the uh bore model has nucleons surrounding surrounded by moving electrons the Larson model the rst&#x27;s atomic model has atoms with internal combinations of scalar rotations that he describes as onedimensional two-dimensional and and then three-dimensional rotations but uh so it&#x27;s completely different in the way it works electrons confined to orbits defined by energy of absorbed and emitted photons is an important part of the bore model and enables them to to calculate this Spectra so easily but over on larsson&#x27;s model combinations of these scalar motion rotations existing inside of what he calls units space which is the time region we won&#x27;t get into but uh it introduces uh very unusual effects uh because of the change of the nature of the magnitudes that are part of that are inside that time region so it makes it much more complex it&#x27;s nothing as simple to explain nor to use as a B&#x27;s model and then on the other hand the energy of in the bores model the energy of absorbed or emitted photons follows the ridberg equation for hydrogen hydrogenic atoms that is atoms that are all ionized down to one atom then they can do this very easily when you get more than one I&#x27;m say I&#x27;m sorry I always make these mistakes uh that was I meant electrons that are ionized down to one electron they call them hydrogenic H hydrogenic atoms meaning they&#x27;re like the uh uh hydrogen atom that has only one electron because as you get more and more electrons with these more complex atoms then they Shield one another and it makes it difficult so they&#x27;ve never been able to solve what they call their wave equation Schroeders schro inures wave equation uh uh for these higher atoms because uh of the uh lack of of clarity due to the complexity that gets involved uh when you use the wave equation and you have so many electrons whirling around so uh on the other hand in Larson&#x27;s model the atomic thermal energy and I ionization level of the atom accounts for this spectral absorption and emission but that too is difficult because so many variables come into place so that&#x27;s never been solved lson in trying to do that uh finally gave up and went on because he didn&#x27;t want to be and we&#x27;re glad he did he didn&#x27;t want to be held up by trying to calculate that but on the other hand we have had the Liberty to work with it for years and so uh we&#x27;ve done so but then uh the next thing uh of course on the B&#x27;s model is that using that ridberg uh equation for H hydrogen hydrogenic atoms these levels uh in one one and two and so on as we&#x27;ve seen uh in the previous uh graphic here the uh these different levels here are easily calculated using the ridberg uh uh formula so it has actually been the foundation of quantum physics it&#x27;s just amazing even though as I said they know that electrons don&#x27;t have the spin that people uh talk about them have and they don&#x27;t really orbit in these uh orbits that are uh shown by by this graphic here but uh nevertheless they have been it has been the foundation of quantum physics uh but on the other hand for Larson&#x27;s atomic model those levels have never been verifiably calculated and therefore the rst science really hasn&#x27;t been uh founded in in that way and uh that so that makes a a big difference well now um neu&#x27;s idea was to admit to solve this problem uh back in 2002 uh was to admit that Vector motion wave equation the shro injury equation of the LST Community could uh actually be used after all in a scalar motion model of the atom which he envisioned as consisting of an atomic Zone and a nuclear Zone uh which he posited to exist in an unusual region of space and time defined by larsson&#x27;s work which resides within the unit of space and they call that the time region however the vector mathematics of neu&#x27;s approach was way beyond the reach of other rst researchers and anyone trained to deal with that mathematics and those complicated equations was usually disinclined to follow the unorthodox ideas of Larson after having invested so much time in energy uh in in the uh LST uh approach and the bore atom the bore model of the atom and the and the Stringer wave equation and all of the things that went in to uh calculating uh the various Energies things that consists of quantum mechanics well uh that&#x27;s the reason then that this suggestion of neb never really caught on among larsson&#x27;s devotees and the progress of the reech that research cease uh from that point on and uh since that time however Ronald satz another era parent of larsson&#x27;s work uh claim to have found the solution to calculating the atomic Spectra without actually specifying an rst uh based atomic model alternative to the bore model uh in in any other terms uh than what Larson had and Larson never really got down to very to uh the specifics or well he did he he got down to specifics but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re very complicated Concepts and and they have no way of being verified and uh they don&#x27;t there&#x27;s nothing in larsson&#x27;s model in terms of individual electrons so in this extension though of larsson&#x27;s approach trying to really finish what Larson started uh SATs derives equations from larsson&#x27;s theoretical development and those are then employed to calculate atomic ionization energies which supposedly conform to observations of atomic Spectra but with the use of such Orthodox Concepts and the unfamiliar notation that he used uses uh in in great quantity it becomes impossible to follow the development with any degree of certainty without spending an inordinate amount of time and energy to understand what it is that he&#x27;s trying to say so the progress then uh as a result of all this the progress of the theoretical development of the universe of motion remains stagnant and uh the progress of the reciprocal system of theory remains stagnant but that&#x27;s about to change I think if what uh I&#x27;m going to present in this lecture is valid so uh we uh we&#x27;ll continue then with uh kind of understanding what it is that uh um uh well I kind of lost my train of thought but basically we&#x27;re now able to show how the energy levels of hydrogen atoms simply follow the levels of sequential Bon magnitudes of photons as they are added to the magnitudes of the three s units s pipe T units of the firon electron without in changing their s pipe t balance now I know that&#x27;s a word that&#x27;s a mouthful but the the fact is is that we need to understand that that&#x27;s that really applies to this previous slide here uh the atomic Spectra of hydrogen is easily calculated using the ridberg formula and uh our uh new model rst based model we call RS small T atomic model and the calculations emerge from the consequences of U of the fundamental postulates of the rst and those combinations of scalar motions expressed in terms of the motion equations of the new scalar mathematics that we&#x27;ve introduced with that conserve Motion in their symmetry so that&#x27;s an important point that would be should be emphasized and then the scalar motion magnitudes of of these photons absorbed and emitted by the electron in the hydrogen atoms follows of the Balmer ridberg quadratic sequence exactly that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to show I don&#x27;t know what happened I I uh somehow lost uh my place there and skipped that slide but that&#x27;s uh if if this the point bullet points on this light hold up things are about to change so we&#x27;re going to start now with what it is that Balmer accomplished it turns out that the Balmer equation which ridberg rearranged developed from multiplying a sequence of unit rational numbers uh the denominators of which are displaced by 2^ squared times and then multiplying that times a constant that he obtained by trial and error see this was his original here he saw that this fraction multiplied by his constant which he called H later had to be uh changed to B for Balmer in order to keep it from being confused with h used uh for Plank&#x27;s constant would give one spectral line and then this fraction uh times the constant would give the next one and so on and so on so for these four he was able to show and and of course since these are fractions he could see that this would be actually 3^ 2ar over 3^ 2 - 4 or 9 over 9 - 4 is equal to 5 and this one then would be 4^ SAR or 16 over 16 - 4 which is 12 the same thing there you see times the constant and then this would be 5^ 2 - 5^ 2 - four again so that would be this Con this fraction here times this constant and so on for the next one which is uh actually uh uh 6 squ over 6^ 2us 4 which gives us this fraction which is equivalent to that fraction times this constant would give us the uh proper line there and that was amazing so it was actually the wavelength of those line Spectra Lambda that uh would be calculated by multiplying the constant and nobody knows how he really got that constant by trial and error times m^2 over m^2 minus n 2 where m^ 2 is 1 2 3 4 2ar uh and N squ is actually just a constant 2^ squar or four so you see how he was able to formulate the equation there so that Lambda the wavelength of that line Spectre is equal to his constant btimes the number squared over the number squar minus 4 and uh so that was he published that just as ridberg was about to publish something very similar but U this enabled Balmer to calculate five visible Spectra lines of hydrogen and then even another invisible one that he hadn&#x27;t yet heard about that but had been detected by someone else so um in uh this uh equation though is really interesting uh because of this number four why does the number four that caught my attention immediately because as those of you who have been following this series of lectures know knows the number four is the lowest number of units of scaler motion forming an uh the the St unit the first St unit that can be formed which we identify with photons in our theoretical uh development uh of theory our fascination with the number four even goes back to the Greek tacis which is based on four excuse me four levels of Dimensions which match the dimensions of larsson&#x27;s cube remember which has the point the lines the planes and and the and the uh uh cubic volume uh so there&#x27;s four magnitudes there so we have four dimensions counting zero and we have four uh magnitudes counting the point and so now here we have this fundamental magnitude of our Theory showing up in balmer&#x27;s uh work and he didn&#x27;t know why he just discovered by trial and error and we know that it&#x27;s the total Motion in the equation for the fundamental St Unit S pipe T unit and the number two squared or four shows up in the calculations then of balmer&#x27;s atomic Spectra that&#x27;s just amazing and uh I have to say I was highly intrigued when I saw that and wondered whether there could be a connection and it turns out that there is but before I explain why we need to understand this next uh uh chart this next next slide here which shows what ridberg did with balmer&#x27;s work uh noticing the number four it turns out that what he did was divide balers uh constant into the number four and that gave him uh the ridberg constant here his this come to be called his ridberg constant his constant named after him the ridberg constant for hydrogen and the others are there&#x27;s a in there&#x27;s another redberg constant that is slightly different than the hydrogen one but not by much but he got this one originally from balmer&#x27;s work by dividing the number four by balmer&#x27;s constant and that gave him then because of the inverse because it turns out that that Balmer well explain in a minute but that gave him the the inverse of what balber had which was is the wavelength of those hydrogen Spectra and so what the ridberg constant was equal to was one over the the um the uh wavelength and so it turns out then that because uh if you multiply balmer&#x27;s constant times redberg constant you get the number four which makes all this possible so now redberg is equal to four / by bombers and bombers is equal to four divided by rig bird in one case it&#x27;s the wavelength that is the result uh and the other is the inverse or what they call the uh wave number this is the wavelength and this would be the inverse of the wavelength or called The Wave number the number of waves that can fit in a in a in the wav length so uh as a result then uh the dimensions of course of bomber&#x27;s constant are nanometers that&#x27;s important so it&#x27;s a space Dimension being wavelength and so when you divide uh his constant by four his constant is about almost 300 well it&#x27;s approximately 364.5 nanometers divide that by four and it gives you 91 Point some odd nanometers which is actually the wavelength of the ionization energy for hydrogen the limit this was is extremely important and uh it follows uh that this magnitude then has to be the inverse of rigberg constant which is uh one over the redberg constant is 91 that limit that ionization energy limit is the inverse of ridberg constant which is 109737 31 or mostly expressed as 1.097 3731 1 * 10 to the uh 7th power so that&#x27;s a large number and the inverse is a very small number but isn&#x27;t that amazing that the inverse is the actual uh ionization wavelength of the energy required to ionize the the electron and that&#x27;s because of the way Balmer went about discovering what he discovered and what rig bird did with it all right so uh he took the number four and as a result we get uh this uh amazing relationship between these two constants but what if this number um let me uh let me before I go on let me have I not been okay so in this next slide uh we can see ridberg constant the result of it again bombers times rid Berg&#x27;s constant is equal to four but if you take his constant then he was able to manipulate the equation of Balmer and come up with this equation where one over the wavelength was equal to his constant Time 1 minus 1 over the square of the level that you wanted to calculate so if you wanted to calculate remember bomber had to start with level three uh in he when he first started out but because of rib Berg&#x27;s Insight he was able then to rearrange the equation and come up with this which shows that the difference between one and the inverse of the square of the level you&#x27;re looking for would give you the wavelengths as shown here and again it shows shows what the uh redberg constant is actually uh 1.09 they use 6.8 I I copied this from from Wikipedia which doesn&#x27;t exactly agree with what&#x27;s on Google but like they said it&#x27;s approximate but anyway then that gives us an energy level ionization energy level of the electron uh which is 13.6 electron volts divided by Plank&#x27;s constant times the speed of light so that would give us then rid BG&#x27;s constant now that see all these relationships are really really interesting and again it became the foundation of what we call quantum physics today so the result was uh that you could once he had rearranged the bombers equation like this then you could take any level and uh calculate the wavelength of energy of the transition of the electron so if we&#x27;re going from level two down to level one then that would be uh uh the wavelength of the uh um of the light the photons would that were emitted would be 121.5 nanom nanometers if you&#x27;re going up a little higher and coming down to one then it would be this number and so on each one of these numbers and finally the infinite one uh of the what they call the lman limit because this is the lman series uh then would be 991 uh 1 three or so that varies depending on the value of this ribber constant uh uh nanometers so uh as a result then we have this tremendous uh uh uh and mysterious relation between these two constants Balmer and ridberg and the number four which really series was starts with three and four and five that&#x27;s original one he started with so uh at any rate U it&#x27;s important to understand uh that uh this number four and how it relates well let&#x27;s take a look at it then um if we um uh recall that the equation of our fundamental St unit is uh s pipe T is equal to one over two plus one over one plus 2 over one and that totals the four pipe four and remember that the we reason we use pipe in one instance and the division symbol in the other is because we have these oscillating units on either side and those now are uh plotted over here uh with uh as we&#x27;ve shown before in other slides with u time progressing upward in the vertical axis and space Pro uh progressing in uh the horizontal axis in this direction and then we get reversals after one unit here the in the case of the of the uh space component it oscillates in one cycle uh over uh two units of time right so that gives us a space cation of one over two units of time where the one here is not a a uh a count of uh space units uh as we&#x27;re normally used to in this equation here but it is actually just indicating one cycle so one cycle would be uh in three dimensions would be a collapse to a point and then an expansion to a ball and then collapse and expansion collapse and expansion there&#x27;s two two parts of that uh cycle uh one down and one up if you will and uh that&#x27;s uh uh clearly analogous to what you have in rotation right because when we rotate uh from 0 to 180 degrees in One Direction that&#x27;s one unit of Pi and then as we return to the starting point we rotate in the opposite direction actually you can consider it the same Direction just as this is the same direction in time but actually there&#x27;s a reversal in the rotation because you&#x27;re going You&#x27;re Going uh from uh top to bottom let&#x27;s say and then in the next half you&#x27;re going from bottom to top and so that takes two units of time but we call it py radian so it would be one cycle uh of uh per two units of of Pi so uh we describe Ro ation uh as uh 2 pi radians and that&#x27;s the same thing here we can see that in both instances that here it&#x27;s time that&#x27;s collapsing and expanding and expanding collapsing and so on and it takes two units of space for each cycle to do that so we have then s uh in that sense equal to one over one cycle every two units of time and and T then one cycle in every two units of space and that&#x27;s important to understand because uh the we need we&#x27;re trying to relate our motion scalar motion equation to the well-known equation of energy that is used in the Legacy system of physical Theory where e is equal to H which is Plank&#x27;s constant times new or the frequency that&#x27;s measured in cycles per unit of time uh of of the radi ation and so Dimension wise that&#x27;s the same thing as saying all right the energy with Dimensions t/ s is equal to T ^2 / s * 1 / T the which is then this artificial uh uh configuration if you will of cycles per unit time so that is very easy to do if we consider these equations not as this normally would be one unit of of space the one unit of space that that goes uh first uh in this case uh increases over time and well actually because of the arrows going down we&#x27;ll say this unit of space after having increased in the previous cycle here where both time and space were were expanding then this decreases while time continues to increase and so we get the oscillation so that&#x27;s what that is showing accounting for all these cycles of motion two cycles one plus not Cycles let me say units of motion so that really we have two over two in the uh horizontal in the vertical and two over two in the horizontal which gives us four alog together you can see that right I mean sometimes it&#x27;s difficult for me to explain everything but um then we can interpret this as a cycle one overt in this case for energy uh in uh in another sense where the one isn&#x27;t one unit of space but one cycle which in in our case is actually two units of space but they are reversing anyway I hope that makes sense because it&#x27;s really important to understand that now um uh in our next slide we see the results of this and uh this is going to be important very critically critically important to understand that uh by dividing an S cycle by a t cycle which are of course inverses of each other it produces the square of the of the magnitude or the inverse square if the T cycle is divided by the S cycle as shown in this slide for six magnitudes of St so see here the uh T cycle uh is uh the time cycle is actually uh divided by the space cycle and uh of course uh to divide one rational number by another you you invert it and multiply it so that gives us 2 * 2^ 2 over 1 and so the magnitude there of that relationship is two squared where we have this uh time cycle or space cycle it&#x27;s it&#x27;s easy to get it mixed up this is actually a space oscillation given us a Time cycle if you will and this is a spa a Time oscillation giv us a space cycle so you can see if we divide um see and then I got them mixed up even so whatever but the point is is that the one is uh uh oscillating in Space over time whatever you call it and the other is the reciprocal of that with time oscillating over space so if you divide this one by this one you get two squared if you divide this one by this one you get three squared and so on four squar 5 squar 6 squar if you reverse those of course then you get 1 over 2 2 1 over 3 2qu 1 over 4 2 5 squ and six s so as the magnitude of these uh Cycles increases then you get this result well now that is extremely important and uh uh the motivation performing for performing this division operation is not all that clear at this point but the fact that the S&amp;T Cycles are inverses of each other implies that they go together as such since uh uh once this operation is is allowed uh everything falls into place as this next slide is going to show so let&#x27;s go to the next slide and I know it looks complicated but it&#x27;s really pretty simple it&#x27;s very busy but but it&#x27;s going to explain everything I hope everything about our St s pipe T periodic magnitude all right that are in expressed in terms of these Cycles so over here on the left we see what happens when we add those in our First Fundamental St unit we have one cycle of space oscillation combined with one cycle of spa of time oscillation and uh that then gives us uh as we just saw if we divide the uh the red here by the blue that will give us 1 over4 which is 1 over 2^ 2ar and uh same thing with now when we add two of these together so that we have two uh um what we call space units and two time units or what we uh in previous lectures have shown to be a symbolically represented by Green the color green in the middle of of red and blue a line of red on one end and blue on the other and to try to keep all this stuff straight uh we have two units so that would be instead of one over two as in let&#x27;s see as in this equation right here uh this would be just the the fundamental the First Fundamental if you will uh equation s pipe T equation then if we double that this becomes 2 over 4 and this becomes 4 over two and this becomes 2 over two and then that is equal to 8 over 8 or 2 * 4 pipe 4 and we&#x27;ve shown that in our lectures how the mathematics works wondrously like that so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re showing here but we&#x27;re showing it in terms of the plot of these things so here&#x27;s one uh over two on on this end and two over one here and then we go to the next one where that doubles we have two units uh of uh space oscillation and two un combined with two units of time oscillation but notice that the cycle now covers two units where here it covered one unit now I&#x27;ve made these smaller because as if there was three dimensions here to look at but they&#x27;re all actually all the same I was just trying to fit them all on one page so you see there then that the cycle of both the space oscillation now has a wavelength if you will a cycle length we could call it uh because this is a three-dimensional oscillation it&#x27;s not actually a wave it&#x27;s related to a wave but you see it&#x27;s two units to collapse two units to expand constituting one cycle and then two units to expand and I mean collapse and two units to expand for the second cycle and so on same thing here with uh with our uh time oscillation only this time it&#x27;s space member is is expanding out to the right so we have uh two units of of uh of a space uh uh oscillation to uh expand from zero to full uh full um two units of of space and then over one unit of time I&#x27;m sorry over two two units of time this is two units of space over two units of time and this is two units of time over two units of space the oscillation and then in the next one we add another one a third one and now that length changes to three units in both space and time so three units to collapse three units to expand three units to collapse and so on three units to expand I couldn&#x27;t put it all on there it&#x27;s truncated but then when we go to four it&#x27;s the same thing right now the length is four unit to expand four units uh I four units to to collapse four units to expand in same way on the reciprocal end four units and four units so these now notice it&#x27;s important oh D no uh it&#x27;s important to notice that uh they overlap and where they overlap we have we begin here with with the uh fundamental uh one over two oscillation and 2 over one oscillation the overlap is one square unit here then when we go to two the overlap is and that&#x27;s one squared and we then the overlap goes to two squar or four then it&#x27;s 3 squ or 9 4 squar or 16 and then if we were able to show the the fifth one that would be 5 squar or 25 so we really have a characteristic here of 1 2 2 2qu 3 2qu 4 squar and 5 squar built right in to our combination of St units I have to find my pointer again okay so now what I&#x27;ve shown are the transitions of that pattern which turn out to be the all important n^2 minus one uh uh pattern that is the basis of the ridberg and the Balmer equations so you see here uh where we then uh divide a a space cycle by time cycle or vice versa can&#x27;t remember how I designated them now but that gives us one over the one over two squared or four the fundamental thing that Balmer found in this that corresponds to the fundamental St unit and then we go to the next one which uh the equation I didn&#x27;t have enough room to actually show the equation here but it would be 2 over4 uh on the one end and four over two on the other end and so that would be a um I can&#x27;t operate this well enough this mouse requires me to click for the pointer and then that Chang anyway so I can&#x27;t show the equation but but if you look at the equation you&#x27;ll see then that it&#x27;s the next cycle is 1 over four and 4 over one and you divide those and that is equivalent to 1 over 16 or uh 1 over 4^ 2ar so we have 2^ 2ar 1 over 2^ 2 1 over 4^ 2 1 over 3 2 1 over 4 SAR and 1 over 5 squ so on which is the pattern you notice uh of bomber&#x27;s Discovery and rig Bird&#x27;s rearrangement of his formula and you can see this this is a called a a quadratic polom and it&#x27;s a n^2 minus one is a polinomial um the basis of the polinomial anyway so we can follow that same pattern that that Balmer saw because you see here one squared uh uh is uh 1^ 2 minus 1 is zero so this level would be zero but then the next level is uh 2^ 2 - 1 4 - 1 is actually 3 and then the difference between the zero level and this level three is of course 0 + three or three so the n s minus one value is three then we go to the next one and it&#x27;s 3 squar 3 squar ah geez I&#x27;m sorry I just can&#x27;t do this right 3^ SAR is 9 and uh minus the difference between 3 S and 2^ squar is five and then this level of three added to to that difference of five is going to give you eight right and that is this n^2 minus one and U and then the same thing with the others so we get the same pattern where we go and when we&#x27;re looking at the differences between the n^ 2 minus 1&#x27;s levels we get 03 8 15 and 24 if you analyze balmer&#x27;s equations that&#x27;s exactly the pattern that he discovered all right now bear with me I am so frustrated by the having to hold the mouse down and click it and then I anyway so I hope you see that now so if we then take those differences and multiply them by the constants in this case we&#x27;re going to use uh ridberg constant uh and multiply them uh by those uh of course you can turn this around to get the minus for the admission Spectrum where this is an inverted for ridberg constant it&#x27; be 1 over 1^ 2ar is 1 minus 1 over the level squared so if we do that we get linman&#x27;s series and I haven&#x27;t shown them all here but as many as I could so uh if you go to the last one it&#x27;s 9112 nanometers and that going all the way down to the bottom uh is the wavelength uh that uh of the of the ionization potential the limit they call it of the uh electron within the proton that&#x27;s always important to understand okay so but going from N squared or if you want to one uh 1 minus 1 over n^ 2 times ridberg constant you&#x27;ll get this difference here between uh you&#x27;ll go from 102.5 to 121.5 and that&#x27;s a difference of 19 nomers 5 point you can see the difference here uh those so the point is is that it follows exactly from these relationships which follow exactly from these relationships which follow exactly uh from Hello Mouse where are did you go from this relationship here which follows from this Rel relationship which uh uh follows from uh well I I don&#x27;t have it but it follows from our St units the properties of our St units so that then uh we have one more slide uh to show how it works you know how an st unit is added to the to one of the three St units of the electron notice that the electron has a charge of -3 which complements the charge of the proton combination of quarks and up quarks and down quarks which equals a positive three so that uh and these are units of motion not charge charge is considered to be minus one and plus one but but it&#x27;s made up of these three imbalanced St units all right and it comes out exactly so that the difference in the uh unbalanced motion of the electron is the complement of the unbalanced Motion in the proton exactly and so if you change that uh you would have uh you know that charge being changed but it doesn&#x27;t it never changes but it the energy of electron does change and so we can see then by when we add the first U uh St unit balanced St unit which is our fundamental uh that then would could be added to any one of these electron St units and that would be our first level and then another one added to another St unit or maybe the same but but it&#x27;s going to stay rather symmetrical uh the laws of nature being as they are uh favor symmetry so probably another one of these it could be this one or it wouldn&#x27;t matter which one but we&#x27;ve selected this one to show the addition of the second St unit with a value of uh 2^ squar and so that&#x27;s like n is equal to two and and of course we get the Lambda values that we&#x27;ve shown before out of each of these transitions if we go from we absorb it to to come to the level two and then emit it again we go back to level one or emit level one we go back to the ground state of the electron so in either case the electron ground state is 18 the total motion of the electron ground state is 18 pipe 18 so when we add the first St unit that goes up by four again so that&#x27;s a total motion of 22 pipe 22 and then the next one is an addition of four more units of motion which is 26 pipe 26 and then the next one 30 four more for 30 pipe 30 and we can go right on up to 46 pipe 46 which is the total motion of the proton at which point the uh uh electron is totally ionized and uh we are at 91 uh one two or whatever it is uh nanometers in terms of the uh wavelength and uh the frequency uh then times Plank&#x27;s constant is equal to 13.6 volts the energy is equal to to that so anyway it all works out really fine and this again is the linan series we could do the same thing for the Balmer series or the pasan series whatever just doing uh you know doing the transitions from the levels indicated for Balmer series it would be from this level to this level and all of them would be from a higher level in higher than three to in equal to two uh because that&#x27;s the way he discovered it because of the properties of numbers so anyway that&#x27;s it and uh of course we have a few conclusions to wrap it up with the first and most important one is that the work is preliminary we think this works but there may be a fatal flaw in it that we&#x27;ve overlooked or some other thing that because I do such stupid things sometimes I can&#x27;t believe it and I get embarrassed by them but but at least I&#x27;m trying that&#x27;s the only thing that can consoles me I&#x27;ve got to find a way to move forward with this because I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a very important advance in our understanding of phys the physical universe of the reality of the physical universe but this work is very preliminary very new and but as I said all indications so far are that it&#x27;s sound as far as I can see it follows just like the other achievements follow directly from the fundamental uh postulates the two fundamental postulates of uh the of the reciprocal system of theory now that&#x27;s important to understand because uh that&#x27;s really our validity right making sure that we are uh making correct conclusions uh uh deducing correctly the the uh um uh the implications uh deducing correctly the consequences of the fundamental postulates at each step along the way then we look to see how uh reality observation of reality uh either confirms or um or uh uh doesn&#x27;t confirm that that deduction that consequence that we have deduced from the postulates and so far they&#x27;re really following right along the line of what has been observed in the laboratory but of course there&#x27;s a long ways to go this is very uh a very new science but with the the important thing to understand about tonight&#x27;s presentation if this holds this having been the foundation of the uh science of quantum mechanics of quantum physics uh this uh bore model and their ability to correctly calculate the energy levels of the bore model and later we&#x27;ll see of the and they they fail at this a little bit but we have an advantage of calculating the actual energy levels of the elements the periodic table so we move from the standard model uh to the periodic table with this uh with this breakthrough now we&#x27; be able to actually calculate the energy levels not using the complicated Quantum mechanic quantum mechanical parameters of uh these uh orbiting electrons where they uh have an angular momentum and a spin momentum and and uh and then this level of uh energy uh determined by uh their the the radius of their orbit and take all that into account and then come up with the periodic table of elements uh on a basis of energy and they&#x27;ve never been able to do it completely they&#x27;ve only been able to do it in principle they call it but uh we uh have a better way of uh looking at that uh than they do we know the periods are not to in square as they have believed that they are and then so that doesn&#x27;t fit the actual periodic table but those periods are four in square again the number four being so crucial uh and so now that we have this ability to calculate the uh Spectra we uh are very confident that we can move forward with the calculations for the periodic table as we see it in what we call the wheel of motion you can find that online just just uh you can Google it I don&#x27;t think you need to use my name but uh just Google wheel of motion and you can find that or you can look for it on our site using our search uh function but any at any rate you can find that periodic table which explains uh a lot of uh why of how it is constructed as it is as uh 4 N squared when n is one four n is squared uh times 1 so four * 1 is four but when n goes to two then that&#x27;s four and there&#x27;s 16 elements and then when n is three that&#x27;s nine there&#x27;s 36 elements and when n is four uh 16 Time 4 that magic number four uh is uh 64 elements in the outer uh circle of the concentric circles that we call the wheel of motion well at any rate uh as I I guess I say as the third bullet here uh if this proves sound if this new development this new achievement achievement number seven proves sound with time imp the implications of it are just profound because by Chang ing the uh um atom the model of the atom we change everything else not just the periodic table the explanation of the periodic table but it ex extends to the the uh material slash Cosmic two sectors the two reciprocal SE sectors of the universe which feed one another and therefore uh eliminate the need for the Big Bang and all the attendant problems that that has explains why the universe is expanding as it is and also uh many many other things that we will get into with time that uh Larson was able to illuminate to a great degree because of these two reciprocal sectors of the physical Universe one based on Space uh and the other expansion and the other based on time expansion so anyway that IND this also indicates that ridberg constant and its inverse may be the conventional space and time units that we need to understand in order to do a lot of our calculations because by using the natural units it&#x27;s just numbers one over two or two over one but if we actually knew like we do with the speed of light what the actual number of meters uh you know per second is is uh then we would be able to do a lot more so those are conventional the speed of light is measured in meters per second and uh that Dimension is s overt is has been shown by um Xavier Borg to be uh the fundamental dimensions of the SI units so if we can convert between successfully convert between the conventional units and the natural units Whoa man this that would simplify the physics tremendously well uh so that concludes this historic I hope this historic presentation where for the first time we&#x27;ve presented the calculation of the atomic Spectra using scalar mathematics and the reciprocal system of theory cont Concepts I hope it ends up being as satisfying to others as it has been for me and so I&#x27;ll bid you all a good evening hope you have a good evening until next time this is Doug Bundy bidding you ad do</p>
