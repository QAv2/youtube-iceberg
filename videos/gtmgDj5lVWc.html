            <p>luke can i ask you this i i like tom wilson i&#x27;ve i&#x27;ve exchanged communications with him he&#x27;s an honorable man people speak very very highly to me of tom wilson my understanding is though and tell me if i&#x27;m wrong if you are aware of a waved unacknowledged special access program something that&#x27;s hidden the darkest secrets of all in the us government you&#x27;re obliged to lie about them aren&#x27;t you it gets even worse because let&#x27;s say hypothetically and i&#x27;m just saying hypothetically here if that document is legit the way in which that document found its way to where it did the fbi would probably launch immediately a fulfilled counterintelligence investigation uh because uh that&#x27;s not necessarily the orthodox way to capture those type of meeting minutes and the fact that a conversation like that may have occurred if it did occur in a car again i&#x27;m being very careful what i say here you know um there&#x27;s a lot of people that have reason to be concerned now does this happen every day yes absolutely people that these senior people that are going to sit there try to turn the screws they&#x27;re guilty of it they do it all the time i can&#x27;t tell you how many times i&#x27;ve been in the backseat of a limousine or a car and people are just having classified conversations senior leadership so it&#x27;s a little bit disingenuous but there&#x27;s real reason to be concerned here and and i understand why if if there&#x27;s legitimacy to that and again i&#x27;m being very careful here if there&#x27;s legitimacy to it why a lot of people would be very concerned right now because it could it could predicate a very uh intense criminal investigation</p>
