            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I do educational videos on this channel on many different subjects but uh we&#x27;ve been locked in for a long time here on the reciprocal system of theory I think today is video number 196 and the reciprocal system of theory is a theory of everything a grand unified theory a cosmology from Dewey B Larson and he rolled this out in the 20th century up until his death in about 1990 we are actually looking at his 1979 book called Nothing But motion and we&#x27;re in chapter 14 of that book called Cosmic elements now I apologize for yesterday uh my phone just overheated and it just shut off in in the middle of a sentence uh in the last minute of the video so um I just left it left it B uh I had a couple things going on and my phone was too hot to do a retake so um we&#x27;re going to start right where we left off or we&#x27;ll start that paragraph over again when we get started um just a quick uh rundown of the reciprocal system the basic idea is that we live in a universe of motion this universe is a universe of motion a Sonata Universe of matter it&#x27;s not a universe of energy it&#x27;s a universe of motion and matter and energy are merely two different uh varieties of them of motion motion is actually all of our scientific quantities are merely forms of motion and for Larson motion was the relationship between space and time now we see that in the most basic our most basic understanding of motion is speed the car is moving 20 miles per hour 20 miles of space in one hour of time space over time now it gets more complicated than that because uh in Larson&#x27;s first postulate he has two fundamental postulates from which he derives an entire theoretical universe and in his second uh in his first postulate he says that uh both space and time have their coordinate aspects meaning that they have three or more dimensions and uh so space we recognize generally is having three dimensions uh or more and time also has three dimensions or more which we don&#x27;t generally recognize uh so that makes the relationship between space and time a little bit more complicated because time can be multi-dimensional as well as space so speed is a simple kind of motion time over space but for example space over time but for example matter in Larson&#x27;s formulation is time to the third power over space to the third power so there&#x27;s multiple Dimensions that you enter into a relationship between space and time or kind of motion so matter is a kind of motion it&#x27;s a relationship between space and time but space and time in this case have multi-dimensions then uh space and time also have their scalar aspects which is really one dimension of scalar motion now Larson eventually makes clear that uh three dimensions of space um every scale every dimension of scalar motion encompasses three dimensions of space or time and uh a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it does not have a direction or it has any every direction and um you can Envision this by taking your magic marker putting a bunch of dots on a balloon if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other that is an outward scalar motion you suck in the balloon and all the dots are moving toward each other as an inward scalar motion there is a magnitude a speed of that motion but there is no direction there&#x27;s no specific Direction so that is another aspect of both space and time they have their what Larson calls clock aspects clock time and clock space we know we recognize that in in in time clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but in the same way space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart these are both one-dimensional scalar motions and again that one dimension of scalar motion encompasses three dimensions of vectorial motion the coordinate kind of motion then also time and space both come in only discrete units there is no continuity of space or time they both come in in chunks very small chunks chunks that we probably cannot resolve as being individuals but they do only come in chunks and when you have a exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you actually have the speed of light so the speed of light is what Larson calls unit speed and unlike Einstein who says that the speed of light is the max maximum speed of the universe Larson says that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and there&#x27;s an entire half of the universe that Larson calls the cosmic sector that is actually moving faster than the speed of light as well as the half that we&#x27;re familiar with called the material sector that is moving slower than the speed of light in the material sector we have coordinate space three-dimensional space and clock time progressing time we are familiar with that but in the cosmic sector the roles of space and time are reversed and so in the cosmic sector we have three dimensional time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther apart uh and we have a three dimensional time and so uh that kind of extrapolation Works in general uh so that even though we don&#x27;t know anything about the cosmic sector we can&#x27;t see the cosmic sector um we know everything about it because we can extrapolate from the material sector we have observed and measured the material sector and all we have to do to convert or extrapolate to the cosmic sector is reverse the roles of space and time so okay now um we are in his chapter called Cosmic elements so he&#x27;s uh you know we went through the elements the material elements you know your material hydrogen and your material helium and lithium beryllium and so on um and those were uh combinations of motions so for example oxygen element number eight is two primary two-dimensional magnetic rotations it is two secondary two-dimensional rotations and it is two negative one-dimensional rotations so that is Larson&#x27;s notation a b c a dash B Dash c as uh the three numbers that Larson uses to delineate the periodic table or the the elements of the periodic table so that&#x27;s how he Maps it out and um so in the same way in the cosmic sector uh he&#x27;s now developing what the uh the atomic um constituents of the cosmic sector look like what is cosmic oxygen uh well I would say naturally it&#x27;s uh the same two dash 2 Dash negative two but instead it&#x27;s based uh in the cosmic sector instead of the material sector and those motions are in uh space rather than being in time or they&#x27;re they&#x27;re in time rather than being in space okay so we&#x27;re going to take over here in the middle of this uh paragraph or in the middle uh at the beginning of this paragraph that I left off in last time okay furthermore gravitation in the cosmic sector acts in time rather than in space and the atoms of which a cosmic aggregate is composed are contiguous in time but widely dispersed in space thus even the relatively small number of cosmic Aggregates that we do encounter in our movement through time are not encountered as spatial Aggregates they are encountered as individual atoms widely dispersed in space we cannot recognize a cosmic star or Galaxy because we observe it only one atom at a time radiation from the cosmic aggregate is similarly dispersed such radiation is continually reaching us but as we observe it this radiation originates from Individual widely scattered atoms rather than from localized Aggregates and it is therefore isotropic from our viewpoint the this radiation can no doubt be equated with the black body radiation currently attributed to the remnants of the Big Bang okay just to let you know isotropic means that it&#x27;s uh kind of equally balanced in all directions and the other word there uh would be non-local so this is a term that Larson uses uh in conjunction or similar uh as a synonym to widely dispersed so if something is localized you can see where it&#x27;s coming from but where it is non-local that means that it is widely dispersed in all directions uh so this this is the phenomenon that Larson is talking about black body radiation this is a radiation that&#x27;s coming from all directions um equally and uh so that is that&#x27;s how we observe something from time because a direction in time is not a direction in space it is analogous to a direction in space but it is not a direction in space so if we we are going to view something in time we&#x27;re going to see it as being dispersed in all directions so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a way that when we are observing from our material sector again we see space we do not see time when we see time we only see time in the way that it affects space and it affects space in this inverse manner we were going over the white dwarf star yesterday uh we see a white dwarf star is an explosion an exploding star exploding faster than the speed of light when it crosses the speed of light boundary then we see it as an explosion in time but we do not see time we see only space so we see a white dwarf star as an implosion in Space the the inverse it&#x27;s exploding in time we see it as an implosion in space okay um next paragraph all of the somewhat Sensational suggestions as to the existence of observable observable stars and galaxies of anti-matter and the possible consequences of interaction between these Aggregates and bodies composed of ordinary matter are thus without Foundation the anti-matter fuel generators which Supply the energy for space travel in science fiction will have to remain on the science fiction shelves the difference between a cosmic star and a white dwarf star should be noted particularly both are on the time side of the dividing line so far as the translational speed is concerned that is both are composed of matter that is moving faster than the speed of light but the white dwarf star is otherwise no different from the ordinary star of the material sector the space-time relationship is inverted only in the translation translational motion of its components in the cosmic star on the contrary all of the space-time relations are the inverse of those of the ordinary material star not only the translational motion but also the vibrational and rotational motions of its constituent atoms and what is especially significant in the present connection the effect of gravitation consequently the white dwarf is an aggregate in space and we see it as such whereas the cosmic star is an aggregate in time and we cannot recognize it as an aggregate okay so that&#x27;s a key distinction there if you have a white dwarf star the white dwarf star is from the material sector and so we see it even though we can&#x27;t see time we see the inverse in space but it is localized in space because its atoms come from space it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a material aggregate but it&#x27;s it it has gained an explosion explosive speed that has carried its motion that explosive motion has gone out beyond the speed of light and so we see it only in the inverse uh as an implosion in space but a cosmic star is entirely in the uh Cosmic sector it&#x27;s atoms it&#x27;s molecules and uh its charges all of its constituents are in the cosmic sector so we cannot see it as an aggregate we see it as non-local which means that we see it as a dispersed aggregate dispersed over the entirety of space so we see it as a very low level energy over the entire uh aggregate of space uh which you would probably recognize as the Three Degree microwave background radiation okay uh next paragraph even though even those contacts which do take place between matter and the individual particles of cosmic matter or anti-matter that enter the local environment do not have the kind of results that are anticipated on the basis of current theory in present-day thought the essential difference between matter and anti-matter is conceived as a charge reversal an atom is thought to consist of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by a negatively charged by negatively charged electrons it is then assumed that the anti-atom has the reverse structure a negatively charged nucleus surrounded by positively charged electrons or positrons the further assumption then follows that an effective contact between any particle and its anti-particle would result in cancellation of all charges and reduction of both particles to radiant energy this is a typical example of the results of the compartmental nature of present-day physical Theory which permits an assumption to be used in one field of application and a direct contradiction of that assumption to be applied in another field both under the banner of so-called modern physics where the accepted Theory requires that opposite charges neutralize each other on close approach it is assumed that they do so where this does not fit the theory as in the electrical explanation of the structure of matter it is cheerfully assumed that the charges accommodate their behavior to the requirements of the theory and take up stable relative positions instead of destroying each other in the present instance both of these contradictory assumptions are employed at the same time the stable charges that somehow have no effect on each other are annihilated by other charges presumably identical in nature our findings are that wherever electric charges actually do exist the opposite charges ex destroy each other on contact it does not follow however that charge neutralization is equivalent to annihilation in actual practice only one of the reactions between particles and what are presumed to be anti-particles follows the theoretical scenario of annihilation the electron and positron do in fact annihilate annihilate each other on contact with the production of oppositely directed photons the anti-particle of the photon in the accepted sense of the term a particle equivalent to the proton in all observable respects except that it is negatively charged has been detected but contact of this anti-proton oh I&#x27;m sorry proton not Photon uh it uh yes okay I&#x27;m sorry the anti-particle of the proton in the accepted sense of the term a particle equivalent to the proton in all observable respects except that it is negatively charged has been detected but contact of this anti-proton with a proton does not result in annihilation of the particles into radiation radiant energy here the situation is not as straightforward as in the annihilation of the electron positron pair report bursts and mats and indeed it is not the interaction of these particles produces an assortment of transient and stable particles not essentially different from those which appear in other high energy energy interactions as these authors say different kinds of mesons are released in the process in the light of our new findings it is evidence that these are not Annihilation reactions they are cosmic atom building reactions we will examine the nature and characteristics of such reactions in chapter 16. okay let&#x27;s uh try one no uh I guess that probably is enough for today um now this is uh you know difficult again material uh we&#x27;re talking about something pretty abstract when we&#x27;re going into the cosmic sector but just recall that the cosmic sector is a mirror image or the same uh as what&#x27;s going on in the material sector at least on the on the broad scope and um you know so you&#x27;re not necessarily on totally uh unfamiliar ground okay we will uh take over tomorrow uh here uh with this next paragraph and thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
