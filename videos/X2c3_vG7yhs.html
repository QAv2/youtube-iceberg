            <p>[Music] hello and welcome back to reality check well this week we have a guest I&#x27;ve been wanting to get on for years he&#x27;s one of the Giants of UAP UFO research Robert Hastings the man who exposed the connection between the nukes that we have nuclear weapons nuclear facilities nuclear power plants and you U APS and today he&#x27;s going to explain how he came to the conclusion there&#x27;s a link but before I bring him in I want to paint you a word picture imagine a 16 17y old boy sweeping the floors at the air traffic control tower at malstrom Air Force Base in 1967 that was young Robert Hastings and he worked there because his dad worked as a US Air Force officer on the base and in the course of one evening he was summoned across to a radar screen by a friendly air traffic controller who pointed him to various Targets on his screen they were anomalous objects doing extraordinary things and from that moment on Robert Hastings was hooked and thankfully that was the case because Robert has provided us with probably one of the most invaluable pieces pieces of research into the UAP phenomenon it&#x27;s his work that has cracked an area wide open validated with corroborated US Air Force and other military documents a secret that the US Air Force has been at pains to try to conceal for 60 or 70 years the indubitable link between UFOs and nuclear weapons Robert Hastings welcome to reality check sir I am delighted to announce that we have a sponsor on reality check and that sponsor is none other than a martial arts God that when I was a little boy I worshiped intensely I had his posters on my wall and he inspired me to learn karate and other martial arts as a young teenager I&#x27;m talking about Chuck Norris when I was a little boy there was one movie that I went to watch about five times in 1972 called The Way of the dragon and it was Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris facing off against each other in the Coliseum in Rome it was just Mighty stuff and would you believe Chuck Norris is now 84 years old and while I have broken hands and knees and ankles because of my foolish interest in karate whacking boards in a dojo late into the the night Chuck Norris&#x27;s body defies explanation the man is 84 years old and yet he&#x27;s still got the Vigor of a man 30 or 40 years younger than him he&#x27;s still kicking butt and working art and what&#x27;s amazing is he&#x27;s stronger he can work art longer and has plenty of energy left over for his grandkids he did this he tells us by making one change and he says he still feels like he&#x27;s in his 50s his wife&#x27;s even done the same thing as well and she&#x27;s never felt better she says she feels 10 years younger her body looks leaner and she has energy all day and Chuck made a special video that explains everything and make sure you help us and Chuck by watching it if you go to Chuck defense.com Ross and click in the link below in this video it&#x27;ll change the way you think about your health now once again that&#x27;s chuck.com Ross click on the link in the description below to watch the video you won&#x27;t believe how simple it is just a reminder the legendary Chuck Norris is a whopping 84 years old and yet he&#x27;s got more energy than me and his body may be broken but for some reason he seems to be able to keep on going I want to know his secret I&#x27;m going to click on that link what he&#x27;s discovered that he could affect dramatic changes to his health simply focusing on three things that sabotage our body as we age watch his method by clicking on the link in the box below chuck.com Ross Robert Hastings welcome to reality check sir did you ever find out what those objects were on that radar screen that you saw as a teenage boy when you saw them being tracked on the malstrom Air Force based screens uh the FAA controller who pointed them out to me on his screen uh man named Bob grasser uh simply said these were unknown targets I was walking by emptying his trash can in a place called rapcon radar approach control and um we had had previous conversations about radar he knew me he knew I was interested in radar and for whatever reason he just kind of nonchalantly said we&#x27;re tracking unknown targets or whatever words he used and I recall after this many years getting very excited and peppering him with questions and I think he kind of did a double take and and realized I was drawing attention to us from the other controllers in the room and he kind of backed off and said why don&#x27;t you come back later and clean up well I cleaned the rest of the tower about two hours worth of work and when I returned to rapcon he clearly did not want to talk about it uh I worked every other day and uh two days later I caught him in the breakroom and I said were you tracking UFOs the other night and again he clearly did not want to talk about it however uh my father who by the way was a senior master sergeant not an officer uh worked at the NORAD North American Aerospace Defense command radar facility on base called The Sage building part of a a international network with Canada US and Canada he worked right in the military radar building and I went home that night and was very excited and you said I you know I think the radar you know tracking of UFOs went on tonight I&#x27;m not sure unbeknownst to me he made inquiries at work and a few days later he confirmed that norad&#x27;s facility did track the objects and that the rumor going around was that they were maneuvering near nuclear missile sites these were Bonafide UFOs so that kicked everything off for me you&#x27;re correct so obviously there was a connection that was alerted to you at that early stage that&#x27;s 57 years ago Robert 57 years ago you got twigged to the fact that there&#x27;s clearly a connection between UFOs these weird objects in our skies and nuclear weapons and it ended up with this magnificent book that I recommend to everybody I speak to UFOs and nukes extraordinary encounters at nuclear weapon sites which is your definitive explanation of all of the 167 plus witnesses that I understand you&#x27;ve interviewed who had Direct knowledge of these incursions can I ask you this is there any nuclear site that you&#x27;re aware of in the United States that hasn&#x27;t had a UFO incursion I can&#x27;t say that literally every nuclear weapons related facility in the US has been visited by UFOs I can tell you that all the major nuclear uh missile bases both the ones that were operational in the 60s and the 70s and the ones that are currently operational have been visited repeatedly year after year according to the sources that I&#x27;ve interviewed yes so as I understand it you became aware much later on as you started doing your research give me an idea of of what you found out about malstrom Air Force Base in the course of your research which of course was the the base where you&#x27;d grown up as a young teenage boy well I was a teenager as you said and I couldn&#x27;t really do much with this incredible information until I became older I went to college got married and in the summer of 1973 I happened to be researching various subjects in the library and stumbled upon some UFO books and magazines and discovered that Jay Allen heinik who was Project Blue books civilian scientific consultant for many years had a year previous to my experience at mstom had written an article in the Saturday evening Post Magazine the December issue in which he said that UFOs were flying over nuclear missiles at another base my not in North Dakota now that just took me a back I went holy cow you know that&#x27;s what I think went on at mstom and apparently that&#x27;s going on various places so that um that prompted me really to start seeking out inform formally very sporadically uh military veterans you might have knowledge of these cases and by the late 70s I had about 25 Witnesses who were in various positions in the Air Force but were personally aware of uh UFO incursions at nuclear weapons sites missile sites primarily and uh I was so intrigued by this and felt that it was such an important subject that the public should be made aware of the secret and I quit my job when went out on the college lecture circuit almost starved to death but uh began a career of speaking at public uh venues us colleges and and universities about this topic can I tell you Robert that the thing I want people to know is how reverently you are held by the people in the know not just people that I know on the inside who are aware of the connection between uaps and nukes and who tell me constantly that there is clearly some interest by whatever these nhi are in nuclear weapons facilities but also people like Lou alzando how put off all of these people who&#x27;ve spoken out about the issue they speak with absolutely huge respect for the work that you&#x27;ve done and the thing I notice is as far as I can see you&#x27;ve never been debunked you&#x27;ve never been Savaged by the spinetic debunkers nobody can lay a glove on you because the thing I admire about your work is you&#x27;ve been able to find firstand Direct witnesses to some of these incidents many of these incidents and moreover you&#x27;ve been able to corroborate them with US Air Force military records take me through how you did that and take me through the kind of corroboration that you found yourself discovering um the number of veterans that I encountered over time increased uh significantly after I went out on the lecture circuit in September of 81 I discovered that most of my lectures there were members of the military in the audience some of whom came up to me afterwards and said I know what you&#x27;re talking about I was at such and such a base and this is what happened some of them I asked each and every one of them whether we could discuss this later and you know get a formal interview from them some said yes some said no and uh over time one by one veterans came to me or I sought them out because I had heard through the grap Vine that someone might know something and one by one I learned that uh you know this activity had gone on um so I can&#x27;t tell you why I&#x27;ve been so obsessed by it but I figured if I was going to do this I should do it as well as possible I tried to take a journalistic approach I vetted these Witnesses I got what was called their dd24 records which confirmed the positions they held in the Air Force and at what bases during what time frames uh those kinds of documents wouldn&#x27;t have any reference to a UFO encounter they might have witnessed but it did confirm that they were who they said they were in the military and um so just one thing led to another and uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s so dramatic I I really retired from all of this in 2012 uh due to advancing age and some significant health issues I have but uh I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still going on today and uh if there are persons in the military exmilitary I should say who are watching this who want to contact me Ross can provide my contact information and um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m still interested in learning as much as I can about this so let&#x27;s talk about specifics Robert I mean let&#x27;s talk about say the Minot case in Dakota talk me through what happened what you discovered happened uh at any given base there were many many instances over the years which is why my book is 500 pages long uh at my not the most dramatic incident and perhaps at any base as a matter of fact uh was a conversation I had with a man named David Shure s Cur who was a Minuteman nuclear missile launch officer in the 1960s at that base and what he told me in 2007 and again I have audio tape record of all the conversations I&#x27;ve done with these gentlemen what he said was one night in 1966 or perhaps 67 uh his guards up at ground level uh he was underground of course in the launch control capsule uh his guards at ground level called down to the capsule and suddenly reported an object moving from missile to missile and it clearly was a self-illuminated object it was moving in a in a erratic manner that no aircraft could match and you know was clearly something significant uh almost immediately according to Captain Shure he told me that the launch uh activation lights on his console lit up in other words as this object hovered over a given missile that missile suddenly went into launch countdown which of course is terrifying I mean it had it gone to its conclusion it could have been World War II and so one by one he thinks it was seven or eight missiles uh he had to flip what&#x27;s called an inhibit switch uh to in effect neutralize this launch countdown what he heard over a a uh secure communication system that linked all the capsules together there were I think 15 launch control capsules at the base controlling 150 missiles total what he was hearing is this object moved up between his group his group of 10 missiles to the next group to the next group to the next group and over the space of about an hour virtually every group of missile called a flight of 10 missiles was visited by this object uh sh could not remember in 2007 whether other men were reporting other launch officers were reporting that their missiles had been activated but he knew his were and uh when he went to the base the next day uh you know it was the end of his shift and he was preparing to be de debriefed he and his Commander uh the uh squadron commander said to them nothing happen nothing to discuss go home now what sure what sure suspects is that other Crews had arrived at the base earlier than he he and his commander and they were debriefed and uh briefed debriefed rather and uh so people on the base already knew what had occurred they didn&#x27;t need to hear it again and again from various Crews that arrived back at the base but obviously you know tremendously important Incident That&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t understand though Robert why on Earth I mean accepting that it&#x27;s embarrassing for the Air Force and accepting that it shows that something was able to compromise the most secure coding and uh Protection Systems to stop these missiles from being activated but why on Earth would the Air Force want to suppress the fact that something was able to so easily activate their missiles I mean why I mean why why hide something like that I think in the first instance you really wouldn&#x27;t want to let the your adversary in this case the Soviet Union know that we were having trouble with our missiles being knocked offline or even activated uh as you know from another case at mster in 67 Bob Salis a former launch officer said that his missiles were knocked offline they weren&#x27;t activated they suddenly were dysfunctional um you certainly in the first instance would not want your adversary to know that your first you know um strategic line of defense or offense was was not operational more importantly I think uh the government just basically has decided for decades now that the public not only Americans but the world is not ready for the big secret that these things are from somewhere else they&#x27;re not humans that were flying these craft and so this is just another example of something that had to be hidden to keep the overall cover up intact that&#x27;s the really interesting part about your story I I knew because I interviewed as you know Robert Salis uh very early on in my Cadet ship into U apology and uh Robert basically woke me up to the fact that there were missiles that had been um deactivated like they were basically not able to if they&#x27;d wanted to launch they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to launch and that to me was if you like a demonstration by whatever these objects were that they could meddle with the systems but I didn&#x27;t realize until very recently when I read your account of U Mr Shure that in fact there had been what had also happened in the Soviet Union a demonstration of an activation of a missile now just explain to the lay observers watching this Robert how careful the encryption and coding and security systems are on missiles to stop them from being launched the fact of activation of missiles the fact that in the Shure case at um Min not you you had a situation where even though the president hadn&#x27;t issued a launch order there&#x27;d be no turning of the keys something had been able to do this um I&#x27;m not an expert as far as all the technical procedures involved with the missile systems I know what my sources have told me how things work in a general sense um but I do know that and Bob Salis has explained to this a number of times in each uh launch control facility which controlled 10 missiles each missile was independently segregated from the others in terms of electronics and for something to take down 10 missiles all at once uh was just not simply feasible or or possible based on their knowledge of the system and yet it did occur uh by the way it&#x27;s based on the time frame of the incident i w witnessed at the air traffic control tower it&#x27;s conceivable that I witnessed Bob sales&#x27;s event occurred that spring in March of 67 and it occurred in the evening I worked from roughly 7 to 10: p.m. and so I may have indeed witnessed what he was experiencing out out at the missile site um let me also point out that um I think whoever&#x27;s flying these craft are demonstrating first that they&#x27;re interested in the fact that we have nuclear weapons and that we&#x27;ve threatened to use them you know for 50 60 years now and I think that&#x27;s of concern to them uh maybe for altruistic reasons maybe for selfish reasons if they have plans and projects here on Earth if they&#x27;re involved in some way on this planet uh a massive nuclear conflict would affect their projects and and plans just as much as you know human civilization would be impacted when uh in the case of David Shore&#x27;s experience when the missiles were actually temporarily activated my opinion is that they weren&#x27;t uh they and the UFOs were not attempting to start World War II I think they were simply demonstrating hey we&#x27;re in control of your weapons whether you like it or not here&#x27;s what we can do and they probably knew in fact that David Shore and the other officers could shut down the launch and so they weren&#x27;t really generating you know they weren&#x27;t trying to start World War III we know the you alluded briefly to an incident in 1982 in the Soviet Union which Geor na uh journalist George knp has brought to our attention uh he smuggled he smuggled hundreds of documents out of Russia in 1994 some of which dealt with nuclear weapons related cases in the Soviet Union and in October of 82 in Soviet Ukraine there was actually an incident very similar to what David shur described to me where suddenly uh several missiles unspecified number of missiles went into activation were preparing to launch and for 15 seconds it appeared World War III was going to start and we now know from interviews that have taken place in the last 10 years in Russia that some of the men who were on site when that occurred they were just utterly terrified they thought it was World War III they had no idea what was occurring uh so again in my view my humble opinion is that these entities they&#x27;re not human uh are just simply trying to demonstrate you know you&#x27;re playing with fire you stupid humans you know you better think twice about all of this I was told once by a friend of Edgar Mitchell that he took the view that it was the non-human intelligences saying the kitties are playing with matches you know we we need to stop them from doing this full hearty thing have you ever seen in any of your research from any of the witnesses has there ever been any indication of any kind of malevolence or bad intention from the phenomenon that you&#x27;ve witnessed tampering or incurring on these sites not that I&#x27;m aware of you know I&#x27;m aware of things that read um both prior to the internet and now on the internet stories of what seem to be nefarious activity on the part of these entities but those seem to be few and far between as far as I can tell and um you know I who knows who they are and what they&#x27;re up to and what their intentions are but um you know on the whole you know I&#x27;m sure the people at the Pentagon AR aren&#x27;t happy about these situations but I view it as an encouraging development that somebody is uh you know demonstrating they can control our weapons and the Russians weapons and hopefully that&#x27;s for a good purpose so one of the things that you have been able to do Robert is obtain on Freedom of Information requests information that in military documents confirms some of these incidents that you&#x27;ve been told about uh can I take you to a few of those I mean for example in um August of 1966 there&#x27;s a document right Patterson Air Force Base um uh there was a report of a round dis object traveling um uh back and forth and up and down uh verified from 100,000 ft to 4,000 ft um climbed out of sight uh duration 3 and 1/2 hours incredibly detailed report um take me through that if you can recall that one or if you want to cite any other of these cases take me through any of these fois that you&#x27;ve been able to obtain well first of all I need to say that I made efforts beginning in the early 1980s to access documents through the Freedom of Information Act uh in particular my sources said that they had been debriefed by OSI Air Force office of special investigations agents and that&#x27;s probably where the interrogatories um existed the records of the the debriefings and so on I repeatedly tried in the early 80s to get documents from OS ey and got the door slammed in my face each and every time so I actually have not been successful in in accessing documents myself but fortunately other people have uh Barry Greenwood who is a very respected researcher and document uh analyst he&#x27;s acquired God knows how many documents and some of which refer to the nuclear weapons cases uh the late Todd Zeo who actually launched a lawsuit against the CIA in 77 I think uh access documents through the foa and uh the one that I think is most telling that I used to present in my lecture program was from Mom Air Force Base in November of 75 uh there were I think it was over a three- period there were multiple incursions of dis shaped craft and some were described as cigar-shaped flying around malstrom&#x27;s nuclear missile sites uh at one point the document indicates that jet fighters were launched to attempt to intercept these objects whereupon the the UFOs left the vicinity they waited for the Jets to leave and go back to base and then they came back and began hovering around the missiles again uh they clearly you know are playing cat and mouse with with the Jets so I think that was that&#x27;s a pretty good example of the kinds of incidents that I&#x27;ve been investigating so Robert what if any official military or intelligence or government uh comment has ever been made about the ation you make of a Nexus between UFOs and nukes um it&#x27;s more of an informal kind of uh surveillance of my own activities uh rather than I&#x27;m I&#x27;m unaware of any formal announcement where anyone at the Pentagon has gotten on a Podium and said you know no they&#x27;re not messing with our nuclear weapons that&#x27;s all wrong they they they don&#x27;t want to touch the subject so they&#x27;re ignoring it um but I began speaking at at schools colleges in universities in September of 81 uh as I mentioned earlier sometimes veterans attended my lectures I subsequently arranged telephone interviews with them in February of 82 when I got off the road after several weeks of my first uh efforts at lecturing about all of this I began calling I think it was probably six or seven Air Force veterans who had said they they&#x27;d be willing to talk with me and with their permission would record the conversations over the phone uh they they told me various things at various spaces during various time frames I would thank them for speaking with me and say something like you know someday I&#x27;m probably going to write a book and I&#x27;ll put your interview in the book everyone said fine I hung up the phone after each call and within a minute or two I would get another call nobody saying anything into the phone just Breathing heavily and then hanging up and that happened after each and every one of these calls to the veterans so I went okay I&#x27;m on someone&#x27;s radar you know someone&#x27;s keeping an eye on me all of a sudden and frankly it frightened me for a while I didn&#x27;t know what might occur next you know would I be uh physically assaulted would I be you know attacked in in legal way a legal way I just was the FBI GNA show up at my door I had no idea I knew I was you know skirting the law in in the the effect in the sense that these are still classified incidents as far as the Pentagon was concerned me publicizing these gentleman&#x27;s testimony was breaking the law was exposing classified information inform so I got that I knew that and I just felt that the Public&#x27;s right to know was more important than that principle and so I finally just decided after several weeks either I was going to do this or I wasn&#x27;t and I decided I was and so it&#x27;s been Decades of of efforts to find the the facts so aside from that obvious harassment was there ever any more overt threat made to you by anyone in authority to try to discourage you from doing what you were doing investigating the phenomenon over these nuclear weapon sites no one ever did show up my at my door um another researcher whose name I&#x27;m spacing at the moment uh gave him permission to try to find whether any agency had files on me he did get a confirmation from the FBI I&#x27;ve got the letter that they did check their index they found that they had records on me uh they claimed that when they went to search for those records they were missing which I don&#x27;t believe for a second uh as far as the CIA and the NSA the National Security Agency the letters I got from them said basically we can neither confirm or or deny nor deny uh so you know I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re watching me I&#x27;m sure that uh they they haven&#x27;t lost sight of whatever I&#x27;m up to uh we could spend a lot of time talking about the telephone and email issues that I&#x27;ve had even within the past week uh so someone someone&#x27;s keeping an eye on me it is what it is you went on to make a brilliant documentary UFOs and nukes the secret link revealed what was the key part in that film that you enjoyed telling the most was it the the Malmstrom or Min not incidents what were what were the events that you really enjoyed revealing most of all well let me say that uh over a several decade period I was approached by 21 different documentary film companies who wanted to do a documentary with me me and either because of their track record I knew what what some of their previous work was or the fact that they weren&#x27;t prepared to allow me to have editorial control that is what&#x27;s called Script approval I decline to be involved with any of them uh so in 2014 I believe uh a a very good friend and Wealthy benefactor named Jared Tarbell uh graciously provided the money for me to create my own do documentary uh I did the best I could I&#x27;m not a film maker but it&#x27;s gotten good reviews and uh what I&#x27;ve tried to do is just systematically go year after year and describe some of the cases that I that I was aware of um to to your point uh the most important case I think one of the most important cases it&#x27;s called The Big Sir incident uh there&#x27;s a man named Dr Bob Jacobs in 1964 he was stationed at Mals or excuse me vandenbberg Air Force based in California and he was the head of a photographic team they had a telescopic camera they photographed missile launches through and um one day in September of 64 they were just filming this rocket launch this missile launch and when they got back to base uh Dr Dr uh Jacobs was called into a man named Floren mansman major Floren mansman office and the projector was set up and there were two guys in grav suit sitting in the room not saying much and the major said Lieutenant Jacobs watch this and Jacobs was stunned to see that when the dummy nuclear warhead separated from the missile shortly thereafter a bright point of light came in out of nowhere and circled the Warhead and flashed four different beams of light at it before racing away whereupon the Warhead began tumbling and fell into the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles short of its Target now Jacob&#x27;s uh major mansman rather told Jacob&#x27;s you know this never happened don&#x27;t ever mention this again uh Bob Jacobs kept his silence until the early 80s he finally wrote an article in a magazine about it and at which point he began getting death threats over the telephone uh they actually even blew up his his rural mailbox at one point uh as they were talking to him over the phone so he and his wife were threatened with death after he went sto went public with this story about a UFO shooting down a nuclear warhead um backing up at the time major mansman it was not known for 20 years but major mansman has admitted in writing that he did a frame by frame analysis of the film using a magnifier and this little point of light on the film that circled the Warhead was actually a disc-shaped object with a dome and he could see enough detail that before each flash of light the four beams of light occurred this object pivoted on his vertical axis fired the beam and pivoted back so he could see a wealth of detail not not only about its shape but its actions and um you know that&#x27;s I mean how can you how can you not think that that&#x27;s amazing I mean you&#x27;ve got not only UFOs hovering above our missiles in the ground in their silos you&#x27;ve actually got them pacing in near space and on at least on one occasion shooting a warhead down to demonstrate their abilities let me just briefly add that in the last six months or so uh Lou alzando I heard to the grap Vine had seen this film while he was with atip and L alzando has now publicly confirmed that he didn&#x27;t see did indeed see the Big Sur film and that it showed exactly what Bob Jacobs said it showed now that&#x27;s a very important Point Robert because of course the film that you&#x27;re talking about has never been publicly released it&#x27;s always been withheld from the public and there&#x27;s always been some question mark about whether or not it still existed so to be very very clear you&#x27;re saying that Lou alzando and I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve watched the same interview and Lou does seem to indicate this he&#x27;s suggesting that he&#x27;s actually seen the Big Sir film where a dummy inert nuclear missile Warhead is knocked out by a UFO actually Lou had read my book while he was with that a tip uh how put off the scientist for the group presented a copy of my book to Lou uh he apparently learned about Big Sir by reading my book and subsequently attempted to get the film and he&#x27;s now on the record as saying he was provided with the film it did show what Bob Jacobs said it showed now I think it was in March of 23 uh this information was conveyed to Shan kpatrick of Arrow and Shawn allegedly looked for the film and claimed that he couldn&#x27;t find it uh and Lou&#x27;s response to that between you and me and the rest of the world was  and so you know that&#x27;s where we are that&#x27;s the last I&#x27;ve heard about this particular episode can I ask you this Robert while we&#x27;re here do you think that Arrow the pentagon&#x27;s UFO UAP investigation office is an organization that under Dr sha Kirk Patrick was credibly investigating objectively investigating the UAP issue for the public no I don&#x27;t I think it was a front Organization for probably CIA or someone like that I don&#x27;t think there was any serious effort or intention to seriously investigate the UFO phenomenon I think Kurt Patrick was a shill I&#x27;m afraid that anyone who&#x27;s going to be a successor in in that organization really has his hands tied whatever his personal belief and wishes may be uh I I have enough contacts I have a few contacts former and retired highlevel uh intelligence community and DOD defense department personnel who said you know this the the powers that be the people have kept the secrecy for decades they have not changed their stance they&#x27;re digging in their Hills they&#x27;re very set by Lou alzando and David grush and probably me and people like me who are trying to get the facts out and you know they&#x27;re saying to me don&#x27;t expect Arrow to do anything groundbreaking or Earth shattering in terms of revealing anything sub substantive so let&#x27;s come back to the Big Sir incident for a moment you made the point but I want to reinforce this with our audience because I to me it was one of the most persuasive things when I did my interview with Dr Bob Jacobs obviously you had Bob&#x27;s testimony as a witness saying that this is what he what happened he was with Florence mansman his commanding officer and in the presence of these two Spooks presumably from Air Force office of special investigations or something like that and he was told to shut up about it and really at the time it was his word against the National Security establishments that this actually happened but just to reinforce the point that you were making and this was a kicker for me in writing my book mansman years later when Bob Jacobs was being Savaged by debunkers and was being accused of making this whole story up about the Big Sir missile being knocked out by a UFO mansman showed enormous courage and corroborated what Dr Bob Jacobs said didn&#x27;t he he did uh I got probably 10 private letters written between Jacobs and mansman and other a couple of researchers that were communicating with them in which mansman says repeatedly that what Bob has said is 100% accurate again this was decades before Lou alzando confirmed it uh he did by the way at one point uh in several of these letters identify those persons in the office back in 64 as CIA officers and that they had shown his his uh that showed him their identification confirming they were CIA so I find it in among other things that the people who confiscated the film after the screening in the office the film was confiscated and flown back East quote unquote according to Major mansman um I find it interesting that it was not released to an air force uh group but was released to CIA and they do seem to be running the show uh multiple sources over the years have said publicly researchers and uh sources who have a background in the intelligence community community that the group that&#x27;s been running the show since the early 50s is indeed the Central Intelligence Agency so on its face I mean just that one incident at Big Sur you&#x27;ve got Bob Jacobs looking through a telescope or shooting through a telescope and then later on he sees the film that shows categorically corroborated by Commander mesman image of a craft of some kind a disc of some kind shooting some kind of light that essentially knocked out this missile I mean it&#x27;s quite extraordinary that there&#x27;s been no simple effort by the government to respond to that I mean if they if they if there was nothing to this you would think that they would make a statement and categorically deny it uh again I think that the strategy has been just don&#x27;t touch it you know you do not confirm or deny it um even if at some point when I think it has to happen eventually some president and hopefully in conjunction with world leaders are are going to let the citizens of the world all us humans in on the secret that this is in fact non-human intelligence they&#x27;ve been here for a long long time but I&#x27;m quite sure that they&#x27;re not going to be talking about these entities shutting down or activating our nuclear weapons for some time even after that announcement is made you you really don&#x27;t want to uh start out by talking about that kind of dramatic um you know you know development so it could be it could be many many more years before the confirmation of this nuclear weapons related activity comes to the four you focused a lot of your work obviously on nuclear weapons sites but as I understand it the the history of this phenomenon goes right back to even places where nuclear weapons were being built but also there&#x27;s a lot of sightings that are on the muon database I&#x27;ve noticed of nuclear uh Power sites where the craft or whatever they are appear to be taking an interest in nuclear power stations have you done any research or work into any of those other areas like for example the places where nuclear bombs are built or where power stations are operating uh I in terms of the civilian power plants no I have not I&#x27;m aware of the cases that have been reported publicly but I have not investigated those I sort of had my hands full with whatever other professional activities I had going on and um so I just focused on the military cases over the years but the first incident that I&#x27;m aware of really was before even the the the atomic bombings of Japan uh a man named Bud clim who was a former Navy uh fighter pilot during World War II his Squadron was stationed in Washington stat State at a place called Naval Air Station Pasco which was right across the river from the Hanford plutonium production facility that site created the plutonium not only for the Trinity site blast in New Mexico in July of 45 but also the bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki uh the Hiroshima bomb was a ukra uranium based bomb uh Bud clim told me in 2009 that on three separate occasions a self-illuminated bright object hovered right over the handford plant and his Squadron uh sent up a fighter a Hellcat prop FL fighter World War II fighter to chase the thing at which point the object moved away at a high rate of speed leaving the the plane in the dust that occurred on three occasions to Bud Clen now a researcher named Jan Aldrich subsequently found documents from the fourth Army that were Declassified I believe at the National Archives and indeed it confirmed there were three unknown aerial objects that had hovered over the handford plant in January of 45 so you&#x27;ve got uh a pilot testimony and uh documents confirming radar tracking of these objects that was a good seven months I think before seven or eight months before uh the bombs were dropped on Japan so whoever these guys are uh they were well aware that we were creating nuclear weapons even before they were detonated in in later in 45 so you&#x27;ve implied to me Robert or expressly stated in the earlier part of this interview that you think that these are some kind of non-human intelligence why do you rule out the possibility that it could be a foreign adversary uh I think um first of all that the incidents that are being described to me occurred in the 40s I mean the the and they&#x27;re describing craft that are silent that are capable of f flying thousands of miles per hour stopping instantaneously and you know things that no no country on Earth had in 1945 or the late 40s so I think we&#x27;re we were clearly dealing with an outside part party and U you know who knows are these from another dimension of reality are these from somewhere else in the universe and they&#x27;ve figured out how to travel between their star system and ours easily to come here repeatedly who knows what the bottom line answers are but I think non-human intelligence is probably the the best best way to describe what they are um let me give you the classic debunker reinder there which is why on Earth if there is and we all accept according to the firmy paradox you know there must be intelligent life out there but why would intelligent life be borrowed bothered with us primitive Apes why would they you know chug vast distances light years across the universe to come to this Speck of dirt and and and harass us about our nuclear weapons uh I I I take the argument back back to forward you know backwards to forwards and let&#x27;s start with the fact that this is going on and we&#x27;ve got credible sources saying it&#x27;s going on so it&#x27;s occurring so we have to find an explanation for it so rather than theoretically saying if I were an alien I wouldn&#x27;t do this I wouldn&#x27;t do that you know just let&#x27;s look at the available data the data are somebody&#x27;s here they have technology that are orders of magnitude beyond what we have they&#x27;ve been visiting our nuclear sit since the late 40s you can I think infer that something is going on that&#x27;s beyond the human scope or the human abilities human ability set so that would be my response to that I think you know self-evidently uh if these stories about recovered alien bodies and craft that David grush for example have described it before Congress last year if those are borne out then there you go you&#x27;ve got the evidence but until something like that is you know available in the public domain and there&#x27;s no doubt any longer I think all of us all we can do is provide our our best assessment of the available data and that&#x27;s mine where do you stand Rob on I mean I know Lou Alando for example often talks about the national security threat or the flight safety threat posed by these objects and some people often have a swipe at me actually for for reinforcing that and basically saying that by definition anything that&#x27;s breaking into National Security airspace and hovering over nuclear weapons facilities is by definition a threat that&#x27;s not to fearer it&#x27;s purely and simply a threat until we know what it is where do you stand on that what&#x27;s your view on the idea that this is some kind of national security threat I understand that Sal&#x27;s position I&#x27;ve spoken with him a number of times I was fortunate to have him all to myself for two days in 2018 to ask him every question Under the Sun um you know I know given his background given his responsibilities he has to be cautious he has to assume the worse uh people who for example like Jim sovan who I&#x27;m in touch with for former High LEL CIA officer you know his position is we have to be concerned about what they&#x27;re up to because it could be nefarious and I get that and you would want them to have that position uh it&#x27;s just my My Hope and my belief that it&#x27;s not dire it&#x27;s not threatening to our species uh if the Pentagon is uh using our best efforts to duplicate the technology you know in private if do we do indeed have crash craft they don&#x27;t want it come out made public that this is the case that we have alien visitors so to speak then in my view that&#x27;s not a good enough reason to keep the rest of humanity in in the dark forever and ever you know we need to know the facts and but I I understand Lou&#x27;s position on that it&#x27;s not just an American phenomenon either I mean that&#x27;s the other debunk splinting rent which is y you know why is this happening you know just over America you know the only ever seems to happen in America what&#x27;s your rejoinder to that anyone who&#x27;s familiar with citing reports they&#x27;re worldwide they&#x27;re Global um you know so certainly it&#x27;s not an American issue um I I you know I think it&#x27;s skewed depending on the country you&#x27;re in you probably hear more about your own country I don&#x27;t know that much about what&#x27;s occurred in Australia except the well-known cases that have been reported over the years so you probably have a much better handle on that than I do um so it is global anyone who takes the time to look at the available data uh before drawing conclusions will know that it&#x27;s not just an American issue so let&#x27;s talk about the other side of your experiences Robert because not only are you a dogged researcher and investigator you are also an experiencer and you and Dr Bob Jacobs only revealed very very recently in 2019 in a book called confession our hidden alien encounters revealed you revealed that both you and Bob were both experiences tell me about that um hither too I mean everything we&#x27;ve discussed to this point I&#x27;ve tried to put in terms of uh nuts and bolts data reports by military personnel uh that was my whole modest operand just to get as many of those guys on the record as possible possible um and so again I went on the elctric circuit in 81 uh in 1988 I was involved in a camping trip uh with several other people long story short what occurred during that trip led me to believe Beyond any question that in fact I had been abducted by non-human entities now uh the circumstances were such that I I went you know can this really be happening you know I I I never expected this it&#x27;s going to greatly complate complicate the fact that I&#x27;m trying to tell lecture audiences All Over America that this is a very nuts andb problem the military is up to you know their ears with this and they&#x27;re trying to keep it from the public if I suddenly from the podium tell people that I&#x27;ve been abducted by aliens what&#x27;s that going to do with my to my credibility uh Alien Abduction is just a subject that&#x27;s too far a bridge too far for many many people nevertheless uh from 1988 through the 90s into the early 2000s I had multiple experiences that I have concluded were indeed abduction experiences and um because I did want to maximize the usefulness that I might have convincing people about a nuclear weapons link with UFOs I chose to keep that secret it was a strategic decision on my part uh in 2017 I was diagnosed with a serious heart condition uh it&#x27;s a affected my ability to do the things that I&#x27;ve been wanting to do for the last few years but uh at around the same time Bob Jacobs who I ongoing contact with said you know neither of us are getting any younger uh if we&#x27;re going to be true to ourselves and not be hypocritical we really should tell other humans the rest of the story and so we just bit the bullet and and wrote that book and laid out as best as possible what we know uh has occurred to us now um my attitude is take it or leave it on the abduction phenomenon I get it if some people just can&#x27;t grapple with that uh if it hadn&#x27;t happened to me I perhaps would be more dubious myself but I really can&#x27;t explain away the things that have happened to me repeatedly which you it&#x27;s too complex a subject to go into here I I would like to at least get into some of the detail of what you mean when you say abduction can you describe to me a typical event that you&#x27;ve endured um one of the most dramatic um I was in a hotel room in Pittsburgh this would have been early 1995 uh I had already had a number of encounters that I had some conscious memories of and later uh got additional memories uh through Hypno hypnotic recall which a controversial subject in itself but I did have conscious memory of certain other experiences so by early 95 I was already aware that something was going on that was quite real quite alarming something that I couldn&#x27;t control um so I was in this hotel room in Pittsburgh near the airport and suddenly the room was dark I was awakened at night suddenly out of sleep and I got in my mind what clearly was a message a telepathic message that said we are here for you you&#x27;ve met us before and if one hasn&#x27;t had one of those experiences it&#x27;s really hard to explain how it feels or what it what it seems like but when it happens it&#x27;s quite clear that it&#x27;s real it&#x27;s not your imagination and no sooner had that happen I I uttered out loud they&#x27;re here I was scared I was terrified and no sooner had I uttered those words I levitated off the bit my body was airborne and I was heading up to the ceiling I was wide awake I was not dreaming I was not hallucinating I was not having sleep paralysis I was in the air heading up toward the ceiling and after perhaps five or six seconds uh I blacked out apparently because what seemed like the next instant the room was flooded with daylight I was laying back on the bed and several hours had passed now when I laid there and tried to gather my wits and go oh my God you know even with all the other things that had happened to me I never levitated you know literally levitated so I was trying to Grapple with all of that I finally got up and went outside well first of all I went to the bathroom turned on the light switch no electricity the the power had been killed in in the hotel there was no power they had a power failure uh I finally went outside and uh there was a fire engine in the parking lot with a fireman leaning against it smoking a cigarette and I said is there a fire in the hotel and he was waving a cigarette around and saying No it&#x27;s it&#x27;s real puzzling uh this hotel he pointed to mine he said the one next to it had a power failure overnight and then he turned and said all those restaurants on the other side of the street are on the same grid and they&#x27;re just fine so we&#x27;re trying to figure out why these two hotels lost power well if anyone&#x27;s reviewed a number of UFOs sightings and incidents in the literature power failures are something that&#x27;s a signature with many many cases where people are seeing an object and the power goes dead so I&#x27;m pretty sure I know why the power went off in my hotel um you know again I can&#x27;t prove any of this but it happened why why would a non-human intelligence want to abduct Bob Hastings uh that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve asked myself countless times I don&#x27;t have the answer to um I should add that of the 167 military witnesses that I&#x27;ve interviewed over the decades seven of them have had abduction experiences that I&#x27;m aware of and in fact uh this past June I invited him to my house here in Colorado and we were basically comparing notes and just trying to make sense of all of this uh you know what happened to you what do you think it is and so on but none of us has have any answers but um based on our our conscious Recollections in some cases hypnotically uh enhanced or retrieved explanations or or or memories uh it does seem they do seem to be genuine physical face-to-face encounter ERS with non-human entities uh the question I have asked myself not what is it and why is it happening because I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any answer to that is is this fact uh the fact that this has been part of my life and I haven&#x27;t mentioned that apparently it happened to me at least once as a child there is some evidence that I had an experience as a child is what I&#x27;ve done uh in terms of my research in terms of trying to get to the bottom of the military cases is that something I&#x27;m doing um subconsciously because of this other aspect in my life or you know is there a pric reason for it uh is there an outside influence in fact I&#x27;ve considered you know is somebody influencing me to do what I&#x27;m doing I have no answers to that it may be totally off-the-wall to think that but you know the questions go through your mind when these things have happened again and again um let me briefly say that in December of 2014 uh I awoke at my home here in Colorado and found a a short entity standing at the foot of my bed I was awake I was not dreaming and uh I was about to scream and before I could do that uh what seemed like the next instant it was bright Sunshine flooding Through the Windows and several hours that obviously passed now that&#x27;s been almost 10 years and nothing has happened to me for the last 10 years uh knockwood so you know it is what it is I don&#x27;t know most of what it&#x27;s about um but I know it&#x27;s physically real and it is occurring now I know Bob Jacobs when I spoke to him about this he told me he had woken up after these events with marks on his body and I recall one photograph he sent me of it almost looks like a tattoo on his on his body on his skin of little dots about eight or nine dots in a square shape have you ever had that kind of experience after I I I have looked uh again and again I if if it&#x27;s anything like that on my body after any of these experiences it&#x27;s very subtle I haven&#x27;t noticed anything I have found blood on my pillow on at least two occasions that I can recall and uh could not find any evidence of uh a cut on my face or insect bite or anything that would have been a source of the blood um so I have had that on two occasions um let me briefly add as I mentioned in the book Bob and I mentioned I forget the year I think it was 2018 I found blood for the second time on the sheet right under my chin and again it was clearly a spot of blood and I texted Bob real quickly and he went and checked his bed and he had found I forget the the time difference but he had found blood on his pillow virtually at the same time that I found blood on mine um which I find pretty interesting tell me about the triple digit thingy bob um this sounds very strange but but it&#x27;s enough enough experiencers have reported it it&#x27;s a real phenomenon um after my first abduction uh in 1988 as an adult at least um I began having nightmares uh about uh what seemed to be the abduction itself on each occasion when I woke up in bathed and sweat and scared to death it was 444 according to my digital clock and that happened more than once and I learned by reading the literature that other experiencers in particular a man named Ray Fowler who&#x27;s a leading researcher uh he&#x27;s actually the first person that talked about UFOs shutting down nuclear missiles he worked for a company Sylvania in the 60s that was one of the Minuteman contractors he had contacts at mstr he learned that these objects were hovering over the missiles and the missiles were going haywire uh Ray I think in probably the early 70s went public uh and said I&#x27;m an abductee and he started describing all of the experiences he had had and what he said and has repeatedly said is after his nightmares about alien abduction he wakes up at these triple digit times uh 333 444 555 and I now know from my communications with other uh abductees around the world many many people are experiencing this what it is why why it occurs we don&#x27;t know but I have a chapter in in Bob and my book uh called the triple digit thingy in which we describe the phenomenon is it a hint is it a tease uh is it just sort of you know a secret handshake somebody&#x27;s telling you you know these experiences are real and you know we&#x27;re going to kind of hint that they are we don&#x27;t know no one knows I don&#x27;t think but it&#x27;s real have you ever in the period when you&#x27;ve been engaging with these nhi you know in these weird abduction encounters have you ever tried to communicate with them um just speaking for myself um my memories of the actual encounters are so fragmentary I have no memories of that what I have memories of uh again both consciously recalled and sometimes under hypnosis is I they&#x27;re in control they&#x27;re not telling me anything they&#x27;re just moving me around and doing things to me um but but unlike some uh people who are very responsive to the hypnotic recall technique who can remember a very sequential kind of narrative this happened then that happened then then that happened I don&#x27;t have that uh fortunately or unfortunately and I just have these glimpses of basically being manhandled and they&#x27;re in control I&#x27;m not uh the entities that I see in all of my uh experiences are in fact what we are commonly calling Grays uh about four feet tall large bald Cranium big black eyes um and I do have these uh more than on more than one occasion what seems to be genuine telepathic communication they don&#x27;t speak with their lips do you feel any sense of malevolence from them uh I get a sense of businesslike activity they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;ve got something to do they&#x27;re going to do it your wishes or desires or fears aren&#x27;t of concern to them they&#x27;re just doing what they&#x27;re there to do and to get it done that&#x27;s kind of a very cold uh sense that I get from them yeah I I can imagine that during these encounters you&#x27;re terrified are you um yes quite clearly and um again when when I&#x27;m uh hypnotically regressed I&#x27;m just utterly terrified my entire body is is quaking with fear um and uh when I have conscious recall the the last experience that I described in 2014 where I set up off my pillow my lifted my head off my pillow and saw this entity entity standing at the foot of my bed uh I was about to scream I was just terrified because I knew something was going to happen so yeah the the overwhelming almost the the only sense is just utter utter fear and Terror now let&#x27;s sit back for a moment and accept Okay let&#x27;s just accept even though it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a big ask I mean obviously the debunkers would say this is all hallucination it&#x27;s all hypnotic suggestion but let&#x27;s say we accept that you have encountered an entity in your bedroom that you have been abducted by non-human intelligences why not be more overt what what can you speculate about what their possible game plan might be for doing such a thing um you know I I just don&#x27;t know that I have any special Insight even though I&#x27;m I&#x27;m subject to the these encounters um I&#x27;ve read what everyone talks about online you know and in books you know various opinions and theories about what they&#x27;re up to um I have a good friend named Steve Aspen who&#x27;s a Brit uh he&#x27;s a lifelong abductee in fact he&#x27;s a fourth generation abductee he&#x27;s written an excellent book called out of time which I highly recommend in which he talks about his experiences uh he believes as do other people who researched this subject that these reports of a hybrid program whereby these entities are actually uh retrieving sperm and OVA from humans and using it in some way that involves genetic I wouldn&#x27;t say experimentation but some sort of genetic program uh that is combining our DNA with their DNA he believes that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on I&#x27;ve read reports about that of course um I have no in all of my experiences I have no uh explicit memory of sperm being taken for example so whether they&#x27;ve done that to me or not I I have no memory of it uh so I think that&#x27;s probably a leading you know candidate for trying to explain um what might be going on with the abduction experiences I would also say getting back to the government coverup uh if in fact some government decides to go public with this and tell the world that this is real that we have visitors from from elsewhere you&#x27;re not going to be hearing about the abduction experiences from a government source for any time any time in the near future uh like the nuclear weapons cases that&#x27;s something it&#x27;s you know you&#x27;re just not going to talk about right away if ever um how how do you break it to your citizens that these entities have the ability to come into your home and take you out uh and take you somewhere and do things to you against your will that&#x27;s not something that any government is going to voluntarily admit to people so Bob in the spring of 2023 you actually showed some initiative and brought several US Air Force veterans to arrow to the pentagon&#x27;s UFO investigation office to give their testimony and these were people that you&#x27;d interviewed over the years about their UFO Encounters in Air Force ICBM Fields oper in various parts of America what happened um he&#x27;s given me permission to to identify him now um a a man named Kirk McConnell who was an investigator for the Senate armed services committee approached me in January of 23 and said I&#x27;ve been in touch with arrow um people at Arrow I believe he said sha Kirk Patrick in particular is asking me to ask you whether you would approach the veterans that you&#x27;re still in touch with uh to see whether any of them would be willing to talk to Arrow so I sent out a a group email and I think I got ultimately 11 confirmations from people including Bob salace um and some other people and uh they set up appointments they spoke with arrow somebody from Arrow and at the time they they were all very positive about their their experience they were treated uh cordially uh they were basically allowed to tell the story without interruption or without a lot of contradictory pushback and so for the first time having had these experiences decades ago out in the missile field uh to be able to present that information you know openly to a representative of the US military uh the gentleman that I that they spoke with were were military I&#x27;m not going to identify them uh but they were members of Arrow and uh they felt it was a good thing and they said so to me in emails however I think it was in April of 2023 when Sean Kirkpatrick went before Senator gilbran had a Committee hearing about arrow and said unequivocally that no information presented to Arrow up to that point indicated any evidence of an extraterrestrial involvement um all of my sources became very angry and indignant and said you know we&#x27;re talking about things going on in the 60s and 70s involving craft that don&#x27;t even exist today in in our Arsenal or this the Russians Arsenal clearly they had to be from somewhere else some other entities and so they felt betrayed they felt as if uh they had been used and they&#x27;re uniformly angry about their experiences with arrow um so I actually told them in the group email initially I said look uh I think you need to do this I think you need to talk to Arrow however my opinion is is that it is a front organization they&#x27;re not serious about investigating they&#x27;re probably a front for CIA or somebody like that and don&#x27;t be surprised you know if nothing comes from this but I could be wrong guys you know and miracles sometimes happen so I think you really need to speak to arrow and I think it was 11 of them did ultimately but once all that happened uh they felt uniformly betrayed uh a couple of them mentioned to me they learned that the interviews with the arrow representative weren&#x27;t even being recorded uh and if you&#x27;re going to have a serious investigation and take witness testimony you need to record what&#x27;s being said and arrow wasn&#x27;t even taking it seriously enough to even record their testimony Robert Hastings you&#x27;ve spent nearly 60 years of your life intrigued with and investigating the UAP mystery are we going to take another 60 plus years before we get an answer as to what it is I I hope not um you know I I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to happen tomorrow I think it&#x27;s just a question of time before it will happen meaning an official announcement of the reality of all of this um but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to happen you know in the next few months um whistleblowers are coming forward and talking about some dramatic things and so who knows the dam may break suddenly but um I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic it won&#x27;t be another 60 years it&#x27;s not going to even be another five years I don&#x27;t think I think uh not only Americans and Australians but people all over the world are going to know the facts in the relatively near term well Robert I hope you and I live to see that day Robert if people want to get in touch with you if there&#x27;s a whistleblower with some dark secret about a nuclear missile facility and UFOs they&#x27;d like to pass on to you or to me by the way um how do they get in touch with you uh I&#x27;ll just give them my email address which is UF Hastings aol.com and if anyone approaches me claiming to be a military veteran and having had an experience involving UFOs the first thing I&#x27;m going to ask that person is to provide their DD214 to confirm that they were indeed at the base and in the Squadron they said they were and if they&#x27;re willing to do that uh either you know tell me something off the Record or hopefully something for publication I&#x27;m very eager to hear from those persons and just to repeat too I really do strongly recommend this wonderful tone UFOs and nukes extraordinary encounters at nuclear weapon sites which is Robert&#x27;s definitive book on this subject he&#x27;s also done the documentary uh UFOs and nukes the secret link revealed and the book encounters that we talked about is entitled um confession our hidden alien encounters revealed and it&#x27;s co-authored by both Robert and Dr Bob Jacobs Robert Hastings it&#x27;s been an honor sir I could talk to you all day but I can see both of us are going to flag if we keep on going much longer thank you so much for speaking to me today thank you Ross uh you&#x27;ve been very supportive of my work over the years I greatly appreciate it it&#x27;s a [Music] pleasure thanks for watching go to joinn in.com to find newsnation on your television provider and please don&#x27;t forget to click that red
