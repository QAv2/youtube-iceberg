            <p>[Music] well I mean speaking of the Extraterrestrial hypothesis there are obviously potentially other places that it could have come from if it wasn&#x27;t um extraterrestrial that could be potentially non-human um and one of those would be obviously an ultraterrestrial possibility which we actually have a clip with how to play right now from the show where does it come from who&#x27;s behind it so I took that on as a challenge to say okay maybe the problem is that we&#x27;ve narrowed our scope too much so maybe there&#x27;s some group that&#x27;s uh hidden out on on the planet with these Advanced [Music] Technologies if we believe that our reality is the story that the story we&#x27;re in is in fact the way the world really is and when something doesn&#x27;t make sense it means you&#x27;re being pushed outside of your story the UFO phenomenon is trying to make us more aware that the story you&#x27;re in is actually not true that there&#x27;s another kind of presence or another kind of mind or another kind of life force that that is active in the world let&#x27;s open our blinders a bit and not be afraid to examine any potential hypothesis yes it could be ET coming from another part of the Galaxy but what are the other options and so I wrote a paper called ultraterrestrials which means that they&#x27;re hidden out here maybe there was some investigation of Earth let&#x27;s say Millennia Ago by some other species and maybe they have hidden bases on the ocean seabeds that are very Advanced we should be able to get data that either permits us to accept or reject the hypothesis wonderful I am a very big fan of the ultraterrestrial hypothesis um so Dr put off would you mind sharing just a little bit more about what your perspective is on the alter terrestrial hypothesis which posits that some observed phenomena May originate from hidden Realms or dimensions on Earth rather than purely extraterrestrial sources well since it hasn&#x27;t been uh pinned down exactly what is the source of these sightings and so on as a scientist I said okay we need to have a clean table we need to have every hypothesis possible on the table and then run each of them down with whatever scientific approaches we can use so I made up a list of you know like what could it be um well it might be extraterrestrial or maybe it&#x27;s interdimensional because our modern physics uh has additional hypothesis about other Realms that uh an other dimensional Realms that uh something could be emerging from uh maybe it&#x27;s uh for example uh maybe leftover atlantans from you know 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age maybe some uh some Advanced Society uh survived and have been running uh a parallel with us uh but hidden away in a mountain or seabeds or whatever and in fact it&#x27;s interesting to me that claimed interactions with such intelligences they&#x27;re always complaining about uh we have to clean up the environment we should stop nuclear uh exper nuclear bomb experiments and so on well you know maybe they&#x27;re hidden out they&#x27;re glad to do their thing we do our thing but gotten to the point we&#x27;re beginning to affect the planet which is their Planet too if that happened to be where they were and so it&#x27; be very reasonable that if they came forward in any way they would uh make statements like uh clean up the environment no nuclear tests and uh hide out by letting people be sure to think that they were extraterrestrial when maybe you know they&#x27;re not so anyway all those options put out on the table and then I think what we should do is attack each option and put up all the pluses and minuses and not let anything stand in our way and finally weed through the options and possibilities or it may be that that that many of them are true so I think that&#x27;s That&#x27;s the basis that I think we should we we should approach it [Music]</p>
