            <p>[Music] welcome to the bizarre world of quantum physics in this video we&#x27;re going to explore what happens when we look at an object in a different way in the world of quantum physics the act of observation can have a profound effect on the behavior of particles this is known as the observer effect when we observe a particle such as an electron we are essentially measuring its properties such as its position and momentum but in doing so we are also changing those properties this is because particles at the quantum level exist in a state of superposition meaning they can exist in multiple States simultaneously it&#x27;s only when we measure or observe them that they collapse into a single state this phenomenon has been proven through experiments such as the double slit experiment in which electrons were shot at a screen with two slits the electrons were observed to behave as both particles and waves depending on how they were observed this may seem strange and counterintuitive but it&#x27;s a fundamental aspect of quantum physics it&#x27;s important to remember that the way we observe the world can have a significant impact on our understanding of it thank you for joining us on this journey into the bizarre world of quantum physics we hope you have a better understanding of the observer effect and the impact of observation on the behavior of particles have a great day see you</p>
