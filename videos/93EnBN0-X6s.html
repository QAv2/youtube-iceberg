            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I recently fell into a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories about how the US government it&#x27;s always the US government is supposedly hiding some anti-gravity technology from us some way to access the energy of the vacuum and whatnot this isn&#x27;t an entirely new story but the recent episode was triggered by the cybertruck bomber that was when on the morning of January 1st the Tesla cyber truck exploded in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas it later transpired that the person had responsible for the explosion Matthew alen liberer had previously sent an email to a retired intelligence officer by the name of some shoe mate in his email iburger wrote among other things that what we&#x27;ve been seeing with Jones is the operational use of gravitate propulsion systems powered aircraft by most recently chin in the east coast but throughout history the us only we and China have this capability China has been launching them from the Atlantic from submarines for years but this activity recently has picked up I have no idea what a gravity propulsion system might be even theoretically and I&#x27;m a theoretical physicist who&#x27;s worked on gravity for more than 20 years of course that may just be proof that I&#x27;m a secret agent of the US government that German accent is all fake the idea that there&#x27;s some conspiracy going on to hide new physics has been a theme on social media since Mark andreon quoted someone associated with the actual US Government saying that they&#x27; made a lot of maths disappear during the nuclear era so Ben basically said look it doesn&#x27;t make sense because to regulate AI at the technology level you&#x27;re regulating math and of course we&#x27;re not going to do that like that doesn&#x27;t make any sense and you&#x27;ll recall that what they said was no actually we can classify math we can classify math and literally this was this is verba this is verbatim this is this is we we did we we we classified a whole entire areas of physics uh with in the nuclear era and and made them State Secrets like of the of the like theoretical physics yeah science physics uh we we classified them and made them State Secrets um and that research vanished um and we are absolutely capable of doing that again for AI we will classify any area of math that we think is leading in a bad Direction and it will and and at the same time we have Eric Weinstein who claims that he&#x27;s been ignored with his idea of geometric Unity which could help us make contact with additional dimensions and greatly Advance space travel what kind of power would have to be generated like what would be involved so what wouldn&#x27;t be involved is getting an entire planet to put a tiny dent in SpaceTime because that&#x27;s not going to work it would be a question of saying I know about more degrees of freedom are those degrees of freedom accessible maybe the new degrees of freedom are things we can play with at the engineering level and maybe they&#x27;re inaccessible just the way we can&#x27;t play with up quirks and down quirks directly if we can play with it then we&#x27;ve got so many new toys you have no idea new forces new matter new possibilities to flit in and out between dark and light matter but from an engineering perspective how how would you make any of this happen you would build something based on new plans that did something that nothing else could do so today I want to try and put these things into context can you actually make maths disappear and is it conceivably possible that someone has made the maths of some super propulsion devices in particular disappear to answer the first question yes you can make maths disappear that&#x27;s undoubtedly happened in the past and is still happening but it only makes sense if that math isn&#x27;t something that many other people could easily ReDiscover in the early days of the nuclear era there was a lot that physicists didn&#x27;t understand and the math was genuinely knew just exactly how which nuclei Decay into what and how much energy does this release and how many neutrons does this capture and so on these sorts of experiments are not that difficult or expensive to rip produce but they take time that&#x27;s leaving aside that you need to get your hands on some plutonium but maybe LinkedIn can help you out so this is one reason you classify maths to stay ahead of the competition however there came a point where the physics of nuclear chain reactions was so widely known that it didn&#x27;t make sense to keep this under covers any longer it&#x27;s another thing entirely with the technological details for how to build a good and efficient nuclear bomb it takes a lot of time in testing and tinkering keeping this Math&#x27;s top secret makes a lot of sense because it&#x27;s not something that anyone can easily reproduce when it comes to AI it&#x27;s a similar story as with nuclear bombs you don&#x27;t just build a$1 billion Frontier Model in your basement and play around with it if some big AI company works out a way for how to make that model super intelligent it can make sense to classify that maths exactly because it&#x27;s not something that others can easily reproduce that&#x27;s not to say that I&#x27;d Advocate doing this I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s possible and it would almost certainly work so much about the question of Math&#x27;s classification now let&#x27;s talk about the gravitic device or the idea that some Grand UniFi Theory will help us travel through the cosmos if you want to go a very long distance one possibility is that you do something very energetically expensive but the other possibility is grow the ruler to shrink the distance if the rulers and protractors that Einstein used he chose one through his equation are instead variables and you have full access to them if I wanted to go a very long distance the first thing I do is grow the ruler to shrink the distance then go the distance under that ruler and then i&#x27; shrink the ruler back Joe by the way is doing a really good job in his podcast in trying to get Eric to explain just how this unification based space travel technology should supposedly work and Eric basically says repeatedly I don&#x27;t know but the truth is more boring we know it won&#x27;t work if there are hidden sectors of particles in your grand UniFi Theory like there are in Eric&#x27;s Theory and in all other similar theories then we already know that we can&#x27;t do anything with them because if that was possible we&#x27;d already have found evidence for them this is a point I&#x27;m afraid that a lot of people including some mathematicians don&#x27;t understand about the foundations of physics you can&#x27;t just invent some new stuff particles forces extra dimensions and say hey it&#x27;ll help us travel through the cosmos you have to explain why if we can do anything with it haven&#x27;t we seen it already and know you can&#x27;t classify experimental data coming out of multiple International collaborations with several 10,000 people this is conspiracy thinking if physicists had seen anything new at partical colliders that didn&#x27;t fit into the existing theories we&#x27;d know about it what we do know is that if there is any new physics left to discover it&#x27;s forces or particles that are either a extremely weak or Ally interacting or B require extremely high energies to access or C it&#x27;s not new forces or particles I&#x27;ll explain this L point in a moment but A and B is why particle physicists all follow the same playbook for introducing new physics it&#x27;s always a fifth Force that&#x27;s incredibly weak or a particle that decays quickly or that&#x27;s very heavy and so on why do you think they&#x27;re doing this are they just not daring enough to invent something more interesting like a beam that opens a portal into another dimension that we can go through no they don&#x27;t do that because they don&#x27;t know any way to make something more interesting compatible with what we know already this isn&#x27;t something you need to classify there&#x27;s nothing there let&#x27;s then talk a little about those gravitic devices one of those conspiracy theories which been around for 50 years or so is the existence of a scal wave that&#x27;s supposedly a type of electromagnetic wave that physicists have missed for 150 years so it can be used to generate energy from the vacuum and also for advanced laser weapons and so on unfortunately in 2020 a paper got published on this in a peerreview journal which claims that the mathematics in question is omitted in the widely accepted version of electrodynamics presumably for purposes of weapons design secrecy can you introduce a new scalar wave or particle into the known theories yes physicists do this all the time but if we haven&#x27;t yet seen that Scala it means it either interacts very rarely with the stuff that we know or it requires extremely high energies to produce it can that couple to gravity sure but you see gravity is an extremely weak Force if you want to use gravity to create the acceleration of planet Earth you need the mass of planet Earth doesn&#x27;t matter how much new physics you introduce it won&#x27;t change the boring old physics what about anti-gravity believe it or not I wrote a few papers about the mathematics of anti-gravity just to show that it&#x27;s possible to do it consistently within the framework of Einstein&#x27;s theories but it&#x27;s not as exciting as it sounds because it turns out that anti-grav matter if it exists is not something that we can use even if we would find it even if we could produce it we couldn&#x27;t contain it or build anything with it stuff just goes through us like dark matter though it might be more clumpy the reason I was working on this was that I thought it could explain dark energy or dark matter it didn&#x27;t work which is why I stopped working on it it was not because the FBI threatened me now let me talk about the option C that no one ever seems to talk about on a very general level the question we want to answer is if there&#x27;s any new physics that goes beyond the theories that we have already how can we access it all the particle physicists do all the talk about strength Theory and quantum gravity and Grand unification and all this stuff is about accessing it with either higher energies or very precise meas measurements at low energies or by waiting a really long time because these are the only places in the minds of particle physicists where we haven&#x27;t looked yet this is why they want a bigger collider this is why they&#x27;re shooting nutrio beams through the ground underneath your feet this is why they&#x27;re building bigger detectors to find that one proton decaying and so on and in none of these cases even if they&#x27;d find some something could we do anything with it I know there are people who are going to complain about this again when I say this how can she be so sure it&#x27;s going to be useless because we know this from what it takes to find the stuff you don&#x27;t have to take it from me go and ask any other particle physicist because this isn&#x27;t something any of them has ever disagreed with me on they don&#x27;t expect to find anything of practical use with their current experiments this is why they keep telling you fancy stories about how their measurements are supposedly revealing something deep about our existence Etc it is possible that these findings would eventually become useful maybe in a 10,000 years or so we all have particle accelerators with LHC power in our pockets but it&#x27;s clearly not something that will happen anytime soon so that option C is that the new physics isn&#x27;t at high energies or at weak interactions it&#x27;s an emergent feature in large systems under certain circumstances particle physicists don&#x27;t think about this because it&#x27;s just not part of their territory but chemists can synthesize molecules that for all we know might not exist anywhere else in the universe they don&#x27;t occur naturally they exist on our planet because we&#x27;ve built complex technological infrastructure that allows us to create things that don&#x27;t occur naturally and this is where you should look for genuinely new physics at the level of composite systems that don&#x27;t occur naturally Arrangements of matter that might display new behavior that doesn&#x27;t follow from the theories we know and that we haven&#x27;t seen before simply because we never arranged matter this way this is why I keep going on about the measurement problem in quantum mechanics because that tells us that matter is in fact doing something that we can&#x27;t calculate we don&#x27;t know how a measurement happens in quantum mechanics this is where the new physics is not in some new scalar fields or hidden particle sectors it&#x27;s a multi particle States maybe the way forward is that I claim the US government is hiding the maths of quantum measurements there&#x27;s some secret cover up going on to discredit anyone who dares question the quantum Orthodoxy yeah I quite like that Hey Joe can I come on your podcast either way you look at it maths is undoubtedly very powerful if this video inspired you to look deeper into the maths of quantum physics or gravity I recommend that you try out brilliant brilliant offers courses on a large variety of topics in science Computer Science and Mathematics all their courses have interactive visualizations and come with follow-up question questions whether you want to know more about large language models or algebra want to learn coding in python or know how computer memory Works brilliant has you covered it&#x27;s a fast and easy way to learn and you can do it whenever and wherever you have the time and they&#x27;re adding new courses each month I even have my own course on brilliant that&#x27;s an introduction to Quantum Mechanics it&#x27;ll help you understand what a wave function is and what the differences between super positions and entanglement it also covers interference the uncertainty principle and B theorem and after that you can continue maybe with a course on Quantum Computing or differential equations sounds good I hope it does you can try brilliant yourself for free if you use smiling brilliant.org Saina that way you&#x27;ll get to try out everything brilliant has to offer for a full 30 days and you&#x27;ll get 20% off the annual premium subscription so go and give it a try I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it thanks for watching see you tomorrow</p>
