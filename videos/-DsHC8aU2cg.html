            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>standard commercial airplanes. We&#x27;re using the same commercial airplanes that we&#x27;ve been using since the 50s. It&#x27;s amazing that we haven&#x27;t been able to expound upon that and and and develop. It&#x27;s like this technology is just stagnated. I mean, physics, you know, I, you know, there&#x27;s a huge thing within, you know, within physics and string theory and all these things.</p>
<p>No one can figure out physics. We&#x27;re st we&#x27;re stuck. We have this large hydron collider and we haven&#x27;t been able to figure anything out. And uh technology in general uh doesn&#x27;t seem to be evolving in the way other technologies are evolving like AI for example like it&#x27;s making giant leaps every single week and month and then and then on the physical side of it it&#x27;s like nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s been a concern.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve seen certainly YouTube videos about other physicists talking about this. Um and and I suspect a lot of it has to do with the fact that we went through I mean la if you look at the last century you had two giant breakthroughs at about the same time. you had relativity in 1905 with general relativity following what seven years later or something five years later and so you&#x27;ve got that whole conceptual change and at the same time probably around 1925 you&#x27;ve got quantum mechanics coming in. So you&#x27;ve got these two huge um paradigm shifts in physics that appeared and quantum mechanics was such a big deal that it allowed you to calculate things that and allowed you to figure out things that nobody&#x27;s been able to figure out before. I mean you could figure out why this coffee cup is orange.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; I mean nobody was able to tell you why these molecules are reflecting orange light. But you can do that with quantum mechanics, right? So the so physics went through this mindset change where where to make a breakthrough to make an advancement all you had to do was to apply the mathematics of quantum mechanics to a problem. You didn&#x27;t have to understand quantum mechanics. You just had to apply it to a problem and do the calculations to find out what the results were.</p>
<p>So it became this and and Richard Fineman called this the shut up and calculate paradigm, right? &gt;&gt; You know, so stop worrying about how what quantum mechanics is. Just shut up and calculate. Do the calculations and, you know, figure something out. And that&#x27;s basically what happened with physics. And so a lot of research in physics stopped especially theoretical work stopped trying to find a new paradigm a new look look for inconsistencies and find a new paradigm to come up with a new breakthrough like on the order of quantum mechanics and you know basically assumed that won&#x27;t happen and just basically resorted to doing calculations.</p>
<p>let&#x27;s just do let&#x27;s throw all the math we can at the problem and see what comes out. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s what string theory is. Let&#x27;s just throw math at the problem. Let&#x27;s not understand quantum mechanics better. Let&#x27;s just instead of their particles, let&#x27;s make them strings and then do math.</p>
<p>Um so I think that&#x27;s been the mistake is that we stopped valuing we stopped valuing the the conceptual aspects of physics. Why why are the laws of physics the way the way that they are? And so and so some of the theoretical work that I&#x27;ve done is trying to go back to these conceptual ideas. Why why are the laws of quantum mechanics &gt;&gt; and why do you think that&#x27;s happened? Why do you think that we how did we get there? How did we get here? &gt;&gt; I think it was just the shut up and calculate um &gt;&gt; philosophy. You could do a lot by calculating. I mean you could figure out superc conductivity by just applying quantum mechanics and &gt;&gt; come up with superc conductivity which is a breakthrough.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s a big deal. You can get a Nobel Prize by applying quantum mechanics without trying to understand it or trying to go further. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I think that we stopped appreciating that real breakthroughs come from conceptual changes rather than um just applying math.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can&#x27;t just throw math at a problem and expect to make a conceptual change. And uh the people that you know that were working on this uh trying to understand anti-gravity, what do you do you know like uh what sort of sparked the flame for them to to research this stuff and if so how far they were able to get before they got to told to shut up shut it down? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know the Yeah, I don&#x27;t know the details actually. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s just so interesting this whole thing.</p>
<p>I because I know I know a gentleman who uh Jeremy Riss who has a uh he&#x27;s a kind of a self-taught I think he&#x27;s like a bachelor&#x27;s in physics but he has a he&#x27;s a lab or he has had a few labs in um Massachusetts that he&#x27;s been working at and uh he has a whole team of people that have been working on this stuff forever and um you know he&#x27;s constantly talking to people in the field and trying to understand stuff and then uh recently he had like I think the FBI came and like shut down his whole site his whole his whole lab. They&#x27;re trying to study this this stuff cuz they&#x27;re constantly like taking making videos of their experiments they&#x27;re doing and posting them on YouTube and doing live streams and stuff like this. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s doing anti-grav work. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he&#x27;s trying to. Yeah, he&#x27;s trying.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s I mean he understands this stuff better than uh I don&#x27;t know if he understands it better than anyone, but he&#x27;s explained it to me better than anyone I&#x27;ve ever talked to. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; And and he&#x27;s a historian on on all of the people who have studied it in the past and uh very very interesting guy to talk to. Well, that&#x27;s that is interesting. Well, &gt;&gt; yeah.</p>
<p>Um, so okay. So, when it comes to like military stuff, right, and and you seem to believe that this stuff could not possibly be just because of the fact that it&#x27;s so it&#x27;s been going on for so long and the same things are happening now, it doesn&#x27;t make sense. Um, but we would have to have something close to it, right? like if if we have with the amount of money that we&#x27;re putting into military stuff and and defense department stuff and you know there&#x27;s essentially trillions of dollars missing from the DoD&#x27;s receipts. Uh we we would have had we we we should have something close to this that that you would want to keep secret from the rest of the world. So, it seems like there&#x27;s probably a lot of different scenarios here that are happening at the same time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s probably I Yeah, I would I would imagine it&#x27;s possible. Um, it&#x27;s possible we have something close like this. If if you know, we you we do hear rumors of crash retrievals and I&#x27;ve heard these from I mean, we&#x27;ve heard some of these publicly, right? But, um, but I&#x27;ve heard private ones as well. And um and and yeah, it&#x27;s possible we did figure things out from crash retrievalss if that was what&#x27;s going on. Yeah, that&#x27;s possible.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Or even just or even just basic research on their own. I mean, yeah, that&#x27;s that it is possible that things were figured out, but &gt;&gt; if you hard to speculate about that, right? &gt;&gt; If you were, you know, Yeah. I mean, a lot of this stuff is speculation, but if if you were to try to come up with a theory on how these things maneuver and how they operate, just guess wild speculation, what what would you what would you go to? &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s a tough one. I think about that a lot.</p>
<p>And first, an acceleration of 10,000 gs, nothing&#x27;s going to survive that inside. So there it has to be it can&#x27;t be regular Newtonian motion like we imagine it. They&#x27;re not moving the way we think they&#x27;re moving. It&#x27;s not possible at those accelerations. So something else is happening.</p>
<p>So are they um so the first go-to is using general relativity. So it&#x27;s creating something like a gravitational field and things following a gravitational field, right? So that&#x27;s like warp drive concept. &gt;&gt; Um so &gt;&gt; this is like the thing Bob Lazar explains where the the reactor inside kind of like shoot it it&#x27;s making this pocket of space around it, &gt;&gt; right? where basically if it&#x27;s moving this way, it&#x27;s doing the same. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like bending the space. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re moving the space around it.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re just moving the space around &gt;&gt; essentially like doing that but that way &gt;&gt; but that way. Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s one that&#x27;s one solution that&#x27;s in that&#x27;s the most obvious one. Um the another idea would be that it&#x27;s using something like you know in quantum tunneling when you go from point A to point B without traveling in between you know maybe this thing is using some kind of macroscopic quantum tunneling where it&#x27;s just pop &gt;&gt; basically teleporting in some way. &gt;&gt; Um that&#x27;s another possibility.</p>
<p>Um could there be other things happening? Possibly. Yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really it&#x27;s hard to speculate without without hard data.</p>
