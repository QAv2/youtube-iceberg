            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>So that speech again, the potential speech of President Trump about alien disclosure, we covered this a little while ago. Laura Trump was on her podcast talking about how she thought something was coming, like a speech was coming regarding extraterrestrial life. um or she was asked about it again because since the days of the over the weekend when President Obama was asked about if aliens were real and he said they&#x27;re real but and then you know he see he has since retracted what he said or clarified rather what he said. Um and people are still going I don&#x27;t know was that a little bit of a I&#x27;m going to show you first. Well, Laura Trump was asked um once again about the speech about if Trump was saying anything, and this is her reply.</p>
<p>So, check this out. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s he&#x27;s about to make an announcement about UFOs because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president. &gt;&gt; Well, I I said this in my podcast, too. What&#x27;s funny is we&#x27;ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this cuz we&#x27;re like, &quot;Well, what do you know?&quot; Cuz Miranda, we all want to know about the UFOs, right? We all want to know what&#x27;s going on. And he played a little koi with us.</p>
<p>And so that of course led us to believe, Eric and I were like, &quot;Oh my gosh, if he won&#x27;t even like fully tell us, maybe there&#x27;s more to it.&quot; And then I have just heard kind of around that I think he&#x27;s actually said I think my father-in-law has actually said it that there is some speech that he has that I guess at at the right time and I don&#x27;t know when the right time is he&#x27;s going to break out and and talk about and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life so to speak. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. So, if you&#x27;ve been following my journey, I&#x27;ve been really hitting the gym and I was feeling the change and everything that was easy beforehand, it just wasn&#x27;t anymore. I think it started really hit me about 5 years ago.</p>
<p>I could feel it. Doesn&#x27;t matter if I was eating well or whatever. I felt like there was sometimes I was just kind of I don&#x27;t know, slugging along. One day you&#x27;re crushing it, next day you&#x27;re wondering why everything feels twice as hard. And I think some people just your testosterone it just it lowers as you get older.</p>
<p>The new year hit this year. I was like, &quot;Wait a minute. I got to feel energized again. I don&#x27;t want to feel worn down, but I want to really hit these things hard. And that was why I was excited to hear about Mars Men.</p>

<p>So, there was a lot there that wasn&#x27;t um factual or or kind of truthbending. Even even in the way, look, I I&#x27;ve covered this Obama thing now for like the last week. Uh he he definitely didn&#x27;t hint that he saw anything. That&#x27;s what the woman insinuated. He actually said the opposite.</p>
<p>He said that I I never saw anything. He did clarify that his thought process was that the universe is too small for us to be the only ones. So that portion of it was right, but I think she combined a lot of that together. Um the other side is Laura Trump says that well I think my father-in-law even said that he&#x27;s got some kind of speech. He&#x27;s he he&#x27;s never said anything that came from um from a director that that speech was coming.</p>
<p>He has never clarified nor said anything about at least not publicly about a speech that he might have. So I don&#x27;t know where she&#x27;s hearing it from. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just maybe maybe she watches channels like this and that&#x27;s why she&#x27;s decided that um that he&#x27;s making this speech. Um look, does it mean anything that they don&#x27;t know? I mean, she&#x27;s like, well, if he wouldn&#x27;t tell us, what does that mean? Does he tell you other classified things that you&#x27;re not supposed to know? So, it&#x27;s not surprising if he has it that he wouldn&#x27;t say anything to you. At least he shouldn&#x27;t be saying these things about anything.</p>
<p>So, not surprising where he&#x27;s playing koi about it. That&#x27;s what a lot of the former presidents did anytime they were on a talk show and they were asked about it, the big koi about it. So, is there more truth to the idea that this speech is is coming? Um, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if he has something that he wants to say, but whether or not he&#x27;ll actually get a chance to do it or say it um without being blocked by other people, I still find very doubtful. Now, I don&#x27;t know. You could say, and I&#x27;m sure someone will, and and maybe rightfully so, that if it does happen, because initially the rumor was that it&#x27;s supposed to happen in September, October, then to June or July to or or to sync up to the anniversary of Roswell.</p>
<p>A and now it&#x27;s now it&#x27;s May is what they say. So if it does happen in May, um that&#x27;s really only what three three months away. March, April, May. Yeah. So I know we&#x27;re in February.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just counting forward. Give me a break. March, April, May. Three months. Give me a break.</p>
<p>So 3 months the Epstein files are going nowhere. They&#x27;re literally there. No one&#x27;s no one in the government&#x27;s doing anything about it. But there it&#x27;s also not going away in regards to the public and reports and the news. So especially in 3 months time.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s going to be people who are saying, well, of course he&#x27;s doing this now. They want to get away from this the files and they want to just focus on something that&#x27;s bigger. What&#x27;s bigger than this? I still don&#x27;t necessarily think because the first thing that happens when he says it is people are going, &quot;Oh, this is a distraction. How do we know it&#x27;s true? Depend. What does he say when he if if this hypothetically if he comes out and gives a speech that there is alien life and there has been and all that.</p>
<p>What kind of proof are you showing when you&#x27;re giving that? Because yes, it&#x27;s the president of the United States making the speech. So, it has more weight to it than when somebody even when certain military says says things, right? Um, I happen to believe a lot of it when military says it, depending on the military person, but when the president says it, without pictures or video, it&#x27;s going to carry weight. But I still think there&#x27;s going to be that thing of, well, where&#x27;s the actual video proof? How do you know this? How do we know this? How can we say, how do we know this isn&#x27;t just a distraction tactic? How do we know that this is indeed something that is factual? um how do you prove it inside of that particular speech? Maybe people just take it right away and take word of, but like what is that overall speech if it is indeed prepared as some people are claiming here that it is that he&#x27;s got something ready to go? The world would change overnight with significant proof. it would change overnight in stock market in depending on what the announcement is and how long like let&#x27;s if it&#x27;s like turns out it&#x27;s a I believe you a lot of I shouldn&#x27;t say you believe but I believe a lot of you believe that these things probably been around longer than we have and if that is a conversation that part of the speech that changes the world overnight if they showed up here two months ago, that changes the world overnight. Um, the fact that if there is an announcement that we have a reverse engineering program, whether or not this I&#x27;m I&#x27;m completely just using the the major whatifs that changes the world overnight because more questions are going to be asked.</p>
<p>Now, when I had Megan Medic on the show, um I liked her answer when I said, &quot;Well, why wouldn&#x27;t other world leaders do this first if they knew the speech is coming?&quot; And she&#x27;s like, &quot;Well, why wouldn&#x27;t they just say, &quot;Okay, go ahead. Make your speech. We&#x27;re not ready to make our speech yet. Let us know what you got.&quot; And that&#x27;s great. we get some more information because we&#x27;ve been trying to do our intel and we&#x27;ve got some intel but we don&#x27;t have all the intel.</p>
<p>What do you what do you got? What are you telling the public? And that&#x27;s good for us to know. So, that made sense to me. Um, I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know the thing. I I still am going to say I feel like I&#x27;m going to do a video in around four to five months from now and say, &quot;Hey, remember when they said that Trump had a speech that he was going to do a disclosure speech about aliens? Where&#x27;s that? That never happened.&quot; Huh? In the same way that all hell broke loose, in the same way that you know um Steven Greer said some stuff, Coldart said some stuff about last year was supposed to be the the the big year that was things was going going to happen.</p>
<p>Um nothing really happened last year. You know, a couple little little little tiny footsteps, but nothing nothing big. Hell didn&#x27;t break loose and disclosure didn&#x27;t come. There was tons of people say 2026 that that 2026 was supposed to be a thing. I remember there was a few different Dr.</p>
<p>Simon said it too, right? And there&#x27;s um if that doesn&#x27;t happen, well, what happened there? It&#x27;s usually it&#x27;s usually one of it it hurts the process. It hurts the process because next year when there&#x27;s the big uh potential announcements, look, when I started hearing these things in 2023, you watch my videos back then and I&#x27;m like, &quot;Oh, this particular thing.&quot; The Soul Foundation said this and this is going to happen and it doesn&#x27;t happen. Oh, this is supposed to happen and this this thing&#x27;s going to get passed and then it doesn&#x27;t happen. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re not working on it and it&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re not trying, but there&#x27;s just so many roadblocks that it&#x27;s it something always happens. And the one that made me realize it, that knocked me off of my optimistic pedestal really fast was the interview that Grush had um on Joe Rogan not too long ago.</p>
<p>Um I think it was I don&#x27;t know the end of 2023, whenever it was, but it was after he had gotten all the press and everything. He had done the hearings and he said, &quot;We&#x27;re going to try to get this UAPDA bill passed, but the two mics are going to make this not happen from from Congress.&quot; And it&#x27;s exactly what happened. So, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a roadblock. It&#x27;s also I&#x27;m trying desperately to try to get uh Representative Berles on the show. I have so many different questions that I want to ask.</p>
<p>One of the questions I&#x27;m definitely going to ask if I get an opportunity to speak with him is the vice president has made it very clear he&#x27;s interested in this topic. Why hasn&#x27;t that door been knocked on? Because um Laskkey had said at one point that he gave addresses and places to go and that that people in Congress were denied the access to go see it. Why isn&#x27;t there just a sign off from like the vice president to if if the vice president is so interested, why not get him on board? And I don&#x27;t know the answer to the question. The answer is will we try to do that? But it just there&#x27;s the there&#x27;s only so much that he can do. I I I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>But I want to ask it. And then I&#x27;ll also ask him about this. What&#x27;s he hearing about this speech? Shouldn&#x27;t they know that? And I guarantee they don&#x27;t. But shouldn&#x27;t they know? Shouldn&#x27;t the UAP task force know if the commander-in-chief is about to make a speech? Shouldn&#x27;t he be speaking with them about it and how much information you would assume if if that&#x27;s part of your team that you would have as much information as possible and and maybe the answer is yes cuz you you look and um Tim Bchett had said many times over that he wants to make sure that Trump is is making the announcement and that he&#x27;s going to be looking for for disclosure and talking about disclosure. Did he break through? Is that Is that partially why this speech is happening? I I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s questions that I want to ask.</p>

The flavor, the burn, the kick, the habit without feeling wired at night.&quot; So, the other thing that you want to see, buddy of mine, who also works out with me, and he says, &quot;Listen, the the negative about nicotine is it disrupts hormone balance, potentially leading to lower testosterone.&quot; Well, nicotine, I don&#x27;t know if you know that, can actually shrink your ball bag.
