            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I had many extraordinary experiences of consciousness that follow an original experience of consciousness in which I saw myself as the world observing itself with the point of view however that was my point of view. So all of a sudden I&#x27;m the whole observing the whole which is me but knowing that I have a point of view. I can choose where to look and that experience changed me from this way to that way because all of a sudden instead of being separate from the world all of a sudden I experience not I thought that I am the world. No, no, no, no. I experience to be the world.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s the fundamental difference between conscious experience and reading a book. If you read a book, you have a thought, which is what is conveyed by the book. But that thought is not the experience that is described in the book. The description of an experience is not the experience. And consciousness is the only one that experiences.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s what is primary consciousness is fundamental more fundamental than matter. If you believe that the universe has a purpose and the purpose of the universe then is to know itself. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s conscious because conscious is what allows you to know yourself. And so consciousness cannot be explained in any simpler way than saying that consciousness is what allows you to know yourself, which is what the universe is about.</p>
