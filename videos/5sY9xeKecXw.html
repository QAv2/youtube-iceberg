            <p>zero point energy converter based on garrett modell&#x27;s work one of these steel coils has nano cavities in it the nano cavities have more than black quartz at the base of the cavity the other one is a regular steel coil because one of these things has special nano cavities are designed to interact with the zero point energy electrical energy is generated on one coil and not the other this difference creates electrical power that&#x27;s the voltage and that&#x27;s the amperage low amperage because there&#x27;s low surface area very low volume it took quite a bit of effort even just to get a few of those little quantum cavities as you can see it&#x27;s just two steel coils regular steel coils and water you</p>
