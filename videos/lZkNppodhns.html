again Jesus is unhealthy this is structures right hi hi we&#x27;re standing on the edge remain in your shoes sure is a new God inside foreign that was steel trees by objective subject that was pretty nasty I like that yeah I did too indeed yeah and the track after the track after was Dragon claw featuring Vanessa Nova by Medtech and Vanessa Nova thanks for sending that out my first car was a Nova yeah your first car was a Nova that had a lot of debris in it that I constantly thought was going to go but my first car was a Nova that created a lot of debris and air pollution and noise pollution and youth pollution really youth pollution yeah it&#x27;s a fantastic American-made automobile isn&#x27;t it that was great got all the pillars of America yeah filled with debris became debris and people were corrupted and destroying the youth exactly yeah had an unnecessarily large engine it was beautiful yeah it was baby blue yeah and that dashboard looked like it would kill you the dashboard yeah most dashboards now are shaped really smooth and like far away from the driver this dashboard was like something they would throw you into if you misbehaved and Sparta it was like a wedge yeah it looked like it was like sitting there waiting to kill you at all times um sounds like such a Charming ride the steering wheel took a nice chunk out of my lip when I crashed and then it was Ollie driving it which you can imagine wow must have been like uh it was very depth yeah it was very Death Proof except it wasn&#x27;t actually a Death Proof car and they were never enough no there were a lot of girls in them actually yes wonderful no there was no girls in it we got coming up next to just Maxwell and the radio didn&#x27;t really work so me and Maxwell would just sing at the top of our lungs huh in essence I think yeah Maxwell&#x27;s like a pretty lady um well we should really play uh you know what that that last track made me want to hear more Sebastian all right can we do that sure okay our good friends like a sucker they wanna hit you over the head like Colonel Mustard cause that friend that used to be a [ __ ] you what&#x27;s up made it home yeah bag that [ __ ] out

hysterical they&#x27;re kind of like if um It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia was a band yeah they reminded me kind of of Weezer and some other interesting fun things before they went all mainstream um what were you saying about it Sam they had like a nice 60s kind of thing yeah you know like 60s meets modern pop it was it was a nice Fusion yeah just like a pinch of punk in Americana yeah yeah a fun Punk it was like fun garage follow-up had that 60s it definitely sounded like something you would hear on uh I don&#x27;t know if you guys know little Steven&#x27;s underground garage nope there we go plugging radio show because we&#x27;re online we&#x27;ll be here forever or at least until Skynet takes over we&#x27;re always raiding like a Viper yeah a spider ready to attack I

surface is hectic has God always intended with a constant storm above it and the wind blowing Relentless lightning crack stabbing waves mutilate the oceans face a perfect storm makes for a perfect tone in the lonely place the Waves rides have been crashed with white caps and its crests while schools and [ __ ] sleep at their desks and cheat on tests because super blue which turns to black where Sun can&#x27;t see the [ __ ] survive his chaos Bruce for them a notice plea oblivious to the external which means Oblivion for certain the ocean treats its own life unlike a person people are peacocks but example in hand might show a Seven Seas philosophy to the seven sins in land we creatures labeled human beings see others at their skin but clearly an inside out view is more accurate than a skin look deeper to see life you couldn&#x27;t notice beforehand and learning the surfaces no court to judge the soul of any man inside out again foreign but in the safety of my loneliness I inhale the sweets and treats laugh if you get scared when the noise Chimes but a tweet but in the darkness of my room I hide under the sheets roads are ugly women that try hard to woo me to them but peering in my mirror I ask how good am I truly looking now I want to pity Obama March for the homeless but in my youth sharing my pennies and dimes was all the focus I say that instituted patients are undoubtedly crazy but what&#x27;s insane about realizing life&#x27;s not so good maybe say suicide&#x27;s a hell take it a selfish quit in the fight but I hope my breath that was for death I guess that&#x27;s all right quick to slap back an argument and call when it&#x27;s flawed but at 19 years old I can&#x27;t possibly know it all so now that I admit I have a problem I&#x27;ll try to shut my mouth until I look at people properly from the inside out where am I foreign foreign getting money broke down to a function a lot of thoughts but I only know one thing [ __ ] they come they go five o&#x27;clock shadow like a GI Joe wrapped on this track talk about game girls like a punk [ __ ] it too I love rappers Jersey thank you I woke up this morning grabbed a bourbon scotch and a beer and high gear the future&#x27;s uncertain the ant always near I&#x27;m Bad to the Bone staggerly don&#x27;t want [ __ ] no no black cats run from me and the devil&#x27;s like a son of me I once shot a man for his gin and Tin Pan Alley catch me riding down Highway 51 with Mustang Sally been smoking Lucky Strike since before I could ride a bike by the time I could read and write I had a footlong gravebeard in a pipe I&#x27;ll steal your wife you could have her back when I&#x27;m done with her she hopping on my Harley in a skirt with no underwear I got it from a man with a lot of junk ears and
