            <p>today&#x27;s video is brought to you by audible now one thing i found to be surprising after starting this channel is how many of you tell me that you listen to my videos more than actually watching them and i actually find this is a bit of a relief as i often find myself overthinking the visual aspect of my videos however on the other hand i often find myself consuming a majority of my content through listening as well and that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m happy that audible has decided to sponsor today&#x27;s video i&#x27;ve said it once and i&#x27;ll say it again audiobooks are by far one of the best ways to get intricate storytelling and fall down rabbit holes and while i&#x27;ve used it to find topics for my videos recently i&#x27;ve been on a bit of a true crime binge and i&#x27;d highly recommend a title by the name of chaos which details an incredibly deep dive into charles manson as well as other alleged ties to the cia and you can enjoy this title as well as many others with audible as they have one of the best selections of audiobooks and the audible plus catalog includes thousands of audiobooks exclusive audible originals as well as podcasts on a wide array of topics with all of that being said try audible absolutely free for 30 days by going to audible.com sociable or texting sociable to 500 500. once again that&#x27;s audible.com sociable or text sociable to 500-500 and thanks once again to audible for making this video possible hello again and welcome back to the channel now i must say if there is one piece of subject matter that i can never fully come to a concise conclusion on as to my own personal beliefs it&#x27;s the whole ufo thing and despite me covering on this channel how a wide variety of grifters get involved in it there appears to at least be some seed of truth to some of the claims of uap ufos and anti-gravity manipulative tech in particular when it comes to government-funded research and as a bit of a disclaimer because i know this subject matter draws out an absolute array of opinions and just know my goal here isn&#x27;t to change your beliefs but more so just tell you what i found and entertain you so let&#x27;s get into it as we are going to discuss the disappearance of one particular scientist by the name of dr ning lee now this story obviously begins with one particular physicist by the name of dr ningli who is working at the center for space plasma and aeronautic research and the university of alabama huntsville in the 1990s ningley&#x27;s main claim to fame here seemed to come from a variety of her peer-reviewed papers that she published during this time in which a theory of hers predicted a practical way to create an anti-gravity effect uh i see the theory already hold there you know they publish it through the review process then that&#x27;s very controversial i know a lot of people criticize it but fortunately nobody found any mistake in my papers so testimony no mistake but people don&#x27;t believe it i know until i got an experimental result and show people and before i try to explain any of her research i want to make clear that when i&#x27;m referring to anti-gravity i&#x27;m essentially referring to gravity manipulation as gravity is a fundamental force of nature and in regards to ningli&#x27;s research the core idea included in her papers seemed to stem from one core concept that being things called superconductors which are essentially a substance that can conduct electricity with no resistance meaning that no energy is lost from point a to point b now generally the state of superconductivity is achieved when a substance cools to a particular critical temperature and generally one of the cooler side effects no pun intended for achieving this critical temperature is the expulsion of the substance&#x27;s magnetic field and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re witnessing right now now this is obviously one example from a broad sweeping concept that could be applied to the future of superconductors and as you can imagine having incredibly efficient electricity would be highly useful for a number of reasons beyond just the gravitomagnetic effect but on that same note one of the main problems with superconductors is that you need incredibly cold temperatures to achieve this this has led to an interest in high temperature superconductors which is actually referring to substances that superconduct above negative 196 celsius and realistically for these things to probably change our day-to-day lives such as the ever so elusive hoverboard there&#x27;s definitely going to be a need for a room temperature superconductor which has yet to be discovered yet and while i will note last year the first room temperature superconductor was found the only problem with it is that it only existed under extreme levels of pressure making it really unusable for the average person but all that being said where dr ning lee fits into this is her creation and claim that a high temperature superconducting disk that she was developing and could essentially create a force field-like effect the first notable paper here was effects of gravito magnetic field on a pure superconductors and it was published in 1991. a year later she would publish another paper by the name of gravitational effects on the magnetic attenuation of superconductors and did a subsequent paper just a year later called gravitoelectric electric coupling of via superconductivity was also peer-reviewed and published now i&#x27;m not a physics channel but i&#x27;ll include links to these papers you can check out for yourself but to summarize ningley&#x27;s theory she essentially noted that rotating ions spinning in a perpendicular field to their spin axis would create an anti-gravity effect if a large number of ions could be aligned in something called a bose-einstein condensate which is essentially an exotic state of matter in which all of the atoms act as one where she theorized that this alignment may be possible by trapping superconductor ions in a lattice structure in a high-temperature superconducting disc which in turn led to the development of a 12-inch prototype that you saw in the picture earlier and to quote an article from october 1st 1999 which is done by a publication by the name of popular mechanics the first thing to understand about lee&#x27;s device is that it is neither an anti-gravity machine nor a gravitational shield says jonathan campbell a scientist at the nasa marshall space flight center who has worked with lee it does not modify gravity rather it produces a gravity-like field that may be either attractive or repulsive lee describes her device as a method of generating a never-before-seen force field that acts in a way that is similar to gravity since it may be either repulsive or attractive she calls it ac gravity it adds to or counteracts or redirects gravity explains larry smalley the former chairman of the university of alabama at huntsville uah physics department and it&#x27;s also worth noting for her device to work it would require one other component that being a rotating motor for the individual ions as the next section read although lee&#x27;s theory has passed through scientific quality control process called peer review and a high temperature superconducting disk has been constructed important technical unknowns remain this summer lee left uah she and several colleagues are striking out on their own to commercialize devices based on her theory and a proprietary high temperature superconducting disk fabrication technique lee&#x27;s next step is to raise the several million dollars needed to build the induction motor that individually spins the ions in the high temperature superconducting disk it will take at least two years to simulate the machine on a computer says smallie who plans to join elise as yet an unnamed company after he retires from uah and it&#x27;s worth noting in the final statement given by lee in this article she states investors want control over the technology she says this is too important it should belong to all the american people now with all that being said i&#x27;m not a physics channel and i can&#x27;t really comment on the paper herself or her experimental results that she claimed to observe in and around this time but what is worth noting are the mysterious events that surround her research thereafter [Music] but what is rather bizarre about that article we just read was the fact that it was in 1999 and just two years prior a final experiment that she did is showed that little to no effect was present at all in her theory stating this result put new limits on strength and range of the proposed coupling between superconductors and gravity but despite this fact some time after this final paper had been published she would still continue to leave her position at the college and would leave to start a company called ac gravity llc and the other professor that ningli was working alongside that man by the name of douglas tor would go on to found his own company by the name of phase space time llc i should say it&#x27;s rather bizarre that if you truly believe that this theory was a dead end then why would you then leave your job and start a company off that theory that supposedly didn&#x27;t work or if we take this particular abstract at face value why would you quit your job to study something that just had severe limits imposed on it that seems like a risky idea to base your entire career off of and i must say one of the common themes that i came across when researching this particular topic is the frequent theme of promising research disappearing from the public along with many of the researchers regarding the subject not typically wanting to talk to the press while ningli was an exception in this instance that can&#x27;t be said about everyone and to understand this 1997 paper i think it&#x27;s important to understand the controversial nature about this research as a whole and that&#x27;s why i want to bring up another researcher that was doing other experiments at this particular time by the name of eugene podclanov and the story with him goes that he was a ceramics engineer who was researching at the tampere university of technology in finland where in 1992 after conducting experiments on superconductors he published a paper that was peer-reviewed claiming that he observed a 0.3 gravity shielding effect from his experiment and this was essentially done by having a rotating superconducting disc cooled with liquid nitrogen at a particular amount of rotations per minute where objects above the disc seem to have a weight reducing effect and in 1996 he published a paper that initially passed peer review as well claiming this time that he observed a two percent gravity shielding effect and it was only after this paper was leaked to the sunday telegraph that the words scientists in finland are about to reveal details of the world&#x27;s first anti-gravity device made it to the front of the paper and as a result the head of the research department there where podconov worked claimed that he was working on his own and that the co-author of the paper had no idea that these experiments were going on at all apparently with his name on it and with that sensational headline bringing in at so many people that were asking so many questions as well as extreme scrutiny from the broader scientific community podcanov ended up withdrawing his second paper after it had already been accepted and it&#x27;s also worth noting that eugene potlanov ended up losing his job as a result of this as well at the university now i should state that podcanov&#x27;s work is essentially considered to be a hundred percent fringe physics as nobody has been able to recreate his results on more than one occasion the closest anybody seems to have gotten was the european space agency in 2006 who seemed to confirm a gravitational equivalent of a magnetic field when rotating a superconductor at 6500 rpm this was after previously failed experiments however in this case they claimed to have conducted over 250 experiments improved the facility over three years and discussed the validity of the results for eight months prior to making this announcement but nobody has been able to apparently recreate these results as well and despite this careful consideration before making this announcement they still backtracked and claimed that the results were just noise now this has led to quite a few conspiracy theories regarding whether some people have been able to recreate podcanov&#x27;s experiments but fear promoting radical ideas that contend with einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity which would suggest that anything like this is completely impossible however on the flip side of things anningley&#x27;s explanation of a superconductor seems to portray it as a large quantum object which if true would make it immune to this criticism as einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity seems to break down when it comes to quantum mechanics but that being said we know eventually that we will require some breakthrough to explain the divide between quantum mechanics and relativity and while einstein&#x27;s theory is by far the best at understanding gravity great claims require great evidence which makes this entire saga regarding ningli very interesting and that being said ningli&#x27;s paper still seems to describe albeit a small effect however i will note she was not using a rotating superconductor it was just a stationary one and after purchasing this particular journal on ningli&#x27;s 1997 paper i found it odd that at the end of the paper it states that they intend on doing more research into the rotating version of this experiment and that the rotating version of the experiment will be reported in subsequent work but instead after this controversy ningli would subsequently conduct her research outside the realm of academia and furthermore what is also incredibly interesting is that in the cases where podlanov&#x27;s research has yet to be verified all of the other experiments only seem to follow podclanov&#x27;s procedure as a partial replication now i&#x27;m no scientist but if you wanted to achieve a particular result in an experiment it&#x27;s probably a good idea to follow the exact same steps that another person took in this paper called gravity superconductor interactions historical background you can see the various criticisms for the verification attempts and in the case of nasa&#x27;s attempts they never even built the rotating mechanism for the disk and podcanov&#x27;s experiment required one capable of rotating at 5000 rpm and that&#x27;s why we see ningli performing a stationary test in 1997 and only after nasa fails to complete this task for a second time or their device was only able to rotate at 30 rpm just a year later ningli would be given a grant for about 500 000 from the us department of defense with this grant being allocated to her to further conduct experiments into her theoretical work however no findings from this particular grant has ever been aired out to the public and ning lee&#x27;s career after this point is largely a mystery [Music] now naturally you have to ask was ningli so successful that she floated off into the atmosphere because she appears to disappear from the limelight completely despite her one company still existing today and there are a few hints as to her whereabouts post 2001 however i will note anything going forward in this section leads to far more unconfirmed information and in regards to the research here in 2001 podcanov seemed to be doing very well for himself considering he was deemed an outcast from the broader scientific community as he went on to later publish a paper in 2001 just years later with another physicist by the name of giovanni morenas detailing the results of a quote impulse gravity generator and despite him seeming to be a suspected fraud that didn&#x27;t seem to stop people with mainstream academic backgrounds for funding his future projects and in 2002 jane&#x27;s defense weekly&#x27;s nick cook alleged that they had gotten their hands on another leaked document briefing regarding a presentation for an internal project from boeing phantomworks monitoring podcanov&#x27;s work according to nick cook and jane&#x27;s defense weekly an anti-gravity beam of 4 inches or 10 centimeters wide had been demonstrated in russia and was apparently successfully repelling objects more than a half a kilometer away with negligible power loss it was also alleged in the briefing that such technology could be engineered into a new weapon system capable of vaporizing objects and while boeing did confirm this was an actual presentation they denied to say that they funded it with any company money however they noted that they could not comment on black budget projects now later in may of 2003 is the last time i could find any further paper trail regarding ning li as she completely disappears after this point in time she apparently gave a talk on measuring ac gravity at a mitra sponsored conference on high frequency gravitational waves seeming to indicate that she was still studying ac gravity at this point in time now in case you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the mitra corporation they manage federally funded research and development and in the case of ningli giving a talk at this conference it&#x27;s also worth noting that she appeared to be giving a talk alongside another person from u.s army aviation and missile command from redstone arsenal but apparently sometime after this particular conference she would disappear with her last known correspondence being an email stating that she had observed an 11 kilowatt output effect of ac gravity is this amount a lot is this amount a little i have no idea and nobody else seems to know either now according to email correspondence from a man by the name of tim ventura who seems to be a journalist in this whole anti-gravity propulsion exotic technology sector he seems to have interviewed a lot of the people involved with this space one of which being podconov and in another email in 2004 podcanov seems to claim that she was working for the department of defense and that she could simply not discuss her work now assuming this is true what is rather ominous is another mention i found of her from another physicist by the name of jack sarfati who in just a seemingly casual conversation talking about podclanov and other things like that he brings up ning lee and i&#x27;ll play that for you right now is this this is this related to in any way these spinning super conductor the experiments the pod pop yeah yeah that that that subject that something came up yes it may be related to that couple other recent papers that just came out about spinning spinning superconducting discs yes yeah it&#x27;s related to that and that subject was discussed at length at uh at one of the meetings i attended but that&#x27;s a whole nasa was working in that weren&#x27;t they down at uh well they never really did but they didn&#x27;t have whatever became of that they didn&#x27;t have enough money and also one of the key the breakthrough the breakthrough propulsion physics yes yeah they didn&#x27;t have much money and it was mismatched but we had more money than they did and we you know and so obviously this may be done this could be done in the private sector yeah okay no no no one thing that did come up and this is very important from a national security political point of view one of the key scientists in this electrogravitic superconductivity sort of stuff is a chinese woman named ning li and she has disappeared allegedly gone back to china and our intelligence agencies do have very good wasn&#x27;t she working at nasa she was working nasa in redstone arsenal and yeah but she disappeared for several years the people at the pentagon who had were in touch with her cannot reach her anymore she is allegedly back in china and the chinese uh red chinese are putting a lot of money into these exotic projects okay so they&#x27;re taking so long seriously yeah oh yeah and that&#x27;s why our intelligence guys are very interested because it looks as though uh the chinese have been you know have owned a lot of america now because of the loans and all that you know with the dollar shrinking that the most likely people to develop the first uh real anti-gravity uh ufo sort of propulsion technology other red chinese and possibly the russians now in conclusion i think it&#x27;s always a good idea to remain skeptical as i stated before great claims require great evidence and nothing in regards to the physics here has been confirmed positively by a third party ning lee&#x27;s research while it seems mysterious it could very well be another failed attempt at researching another exotic project let me remind you that the cia spent 20 million dollars researching remote viewing and as to what i personally think happened in england i think the idea for fleeing the country seems plausible but the only thing that seems to counteract that is that her company is still active to this day and i suppose someone is still paying that yearly franchise tax on her delaware company furthermore it&#x27;s rather bizarre that this one physicist has intel on the pentagon and is casually discussing it here on youtube and while i&#x27;ll admit he seems to be very knowledgeable on the various programs that have happened in the past and is well networked it&#x27;s rather bizarre that this youtube video in 2008 seemingly randomly thrown on the internet is the final mention of her i reached out to sarfati about his statement here and he declined to comment and as far as i&#x27;m aware nobody else seems to have any idea as to what happened to her as well but given the fact that ning lee seemed to be involved in researching the whole high frequency gravitational wave theory what is rather bizarre is that there have been some other patents released recently from the us navy that have gotten some reporting and nobody is really sure what to make of them one of which is a piezoelectricity induced high temperature superconductor a high frequency gravitational wave generator and a craft using an inertial mass reduction device all of these patents come from a guy by the name of salvatore pius and these were vouched for by the secretary of the navy and the reason for pushing these patents through despite not seemingly having a working prototype was because of chinese advancements and another paper from the guy is called hybrid craft using inertial mouse device or he calls it a hybrid aerospace under sea craft which sounds very reminiscent of that one tic tac situation and once again in regards to mainstream academics many physicists refuse to talk on the record regarding these patents and the ones that do state that it makes absolutely no sense and while i&#x27;ve seen many people speculate that these patents are nothing but disinformation meant to cause other governments to waste time researching nonsense and from what i can tell one journalist from the drive managed to get their hands on a freedom of information act request regarding some of the testing that was going on with pius it was only after this point that the navy claimed that the pious effect was a dead end but as far as i&#x27;m aware this was only testing in regards to one particular patent the high energy electromagnetic field generator and according to correspondence with pius he remains adamant that his theories will be proven one day and with all that being said it is rather bizarre to see all this ufo talk come back into the limelight but i guess only time will tell and this definitely leaves more room for speculation i&#x27;d love to know what you guys think about all this this is barely sociable have a good night you</p>
