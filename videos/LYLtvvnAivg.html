            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this channel is for educational purposes uh usually trying to shed light on uh difficult and obscure theories that if they were well known would be revolutionary but uh the powers that be have suppressed them and um you don&#x27;t know anything about them so I&#x27;m trying to put them out there I stumbled into them some of them from just uh doing doing digging doing some digging and um one of them is Dewey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory and this is the 200 third video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system and we are looking at his 1979 book called Nothing But motion and that is the essence of Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory is that we live in a universe of nothing but motion it&#x27;s not a motion of it&#x27;s not an uh not a universe of matter not a universe of energy but a universe of motion and for Larson motion is the relationship between space and time so that makes space and time not the container of the universe but the contents of the universe the universe is made out of space time space motion is a fraction where space and time space or time is the numerator and time or space is the denominator all kinds of scientific phenomena and mechanical phenomena are strictly can be strictly expressed in exclusively time space terms But as time and space are reciprocals of each other they basically have identical qualities and one of those qualities is that they are coordinate there is coordinate space which we are familiar with three or more dimensions of space but there is also coordinate time um three or more dimensions of time and there is clock time which we&#x27;re familiar with the clock is always getting later and later and later and it&#x27;s progressing in no particular direction and there is also clock space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no particular direction or really in all directions and you can Envision this by taking a balloon putting a bunch of dots on it with a magic marker and blowing up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other uh it was also uh can be based on the Hubble telescope which noted that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other but again in no particular direction also space and time come only in discrete units there is no continuity of space and time they are they come in chunks and one chunk of space in one chunk of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is one over one equals one and that makes its speed of light the midpoint of the universe unlike Einstein which Einstein says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe that&#x27;s because Einstein only knew about one of the two main sectors of the universe uh which Larson causes the material sector and the cosmic sector in the material sector uh the unit everything is moving slower than the speed of light and therefore the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe but in the cosmic sector everything is moving faster than the speed of light and the speed of light is actually the minimum speed of that universe and in that Universe we have a yeah well in the material sector we have what we&#x27;re familiar with this is this material sectors where we live and where we make our observations and um in the material sector we have coordinate space three-dimensional space and clock time time is always progressing or flowing and getting later and later but in the cosmic sector uh we have the exact inverse of that which is basically inverting the roles of space and time so in the cosmic sector we have coordinate time three-dimensional time and we have clock space space is always progressing getting farther and farther apart so um not only does that enable us to extrapolate what&#x27;s going on in the material sector to discover what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector even though it&#x27;s beyond our kin of observation but we can do that generally for everything so we can basically double our understanding uh by understanding what exactly is going on in the cosmic sector and uh you know Larson has written books on this uh and this chapter here that we&#x27;re working on chapter 15 of this book called uh cosmic ray Decay is part of that uh but in general Larson describes the cosmic sector as being primarily about uh uh Consciousness language um and uh that you really kind of want to Envision that the material sector and the cosmic sector both exist in the same space but they are like out of phase um and so uh we have you know a brain that exists in the material sector but we have a mind that exists in the cosmic sector okay now um let&#x27;s try to get into Larson now he&#x27;s talking about cosmic rays and cosmic ray Decay cosmic rays are basically Cosmic atoms the inverse of material atoms for Larson material atoms were combinations of motions you start out with a a photon which is a simple harmonic motion a wave and that wave is a combination of two motions so you have a translational motion you have a vibrational motion you have a rotational motion and you have a rotational vibration and those motions can be multi-dimensional as well but they are the basic building blocks for you know building up an atom and so uh the co at the core of all the atoms is one or two photons of all matters one or two photons and the photons are are comprised of a combination of a translational motion and a vibrational Motion in the opposite uh in at 90 degrees of the translational motion so when you combine them you get a sine wave or a simple harmonic motion now many of Larson&#x27;s followers disagreed strongly with that including kvk nehru who wrote uh the article that is called up the photon is a by rotation so nehru believed that the photon came from two counter rotating motions and when you combine those two you get also a sine wave so that is something that kind of has to be sussed out over time to me I think that nehru&#x27;s theory is is better but I&#x27;m not sure about that we will be going over narrow state Theory as we go through this a little bit more but first we want to look at the original source which is Larson so we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna just humor uh the whole thing with his idea that the sine wave comes from a translational motion and a vibrational Motion in the opposite uh 90 degrees out of phase and then that&#x27;s at the core of the atom there&#x27;s most likely going to be two of those for an atom and then when those are rotated they become atoms so atoms are a combination of um two two-dimensional rotations and then an optional one-dimensional rotation um and then so Cosmic atoms are going to be the opposite of that basically the photon is going to be in space or time and then the rotation is going to be in time or space and so the reverse of that is what the cosmic atom is but the cosmic atom enters the material when the cosmic atom enters the material sector as a result of a powerful explosion generally usually of a star or Galaxy then it comes into the material sector where it is not stable because it doesn&#x27;t have the elements of stability for that region because of its inverted nature and so it immediately begins to Decay or or become Radioactive and the cosm so it it decays into uh different particles in a fast uh Decay sequence and then settles in as a really two massless neutrons and so that is what the end product of the cosmic ray Decay is now Larson is going to go through this process as we read along here in the first edition it was recognized that the incoming cosmic rays would consist primarily of cosmic hydrogen but at that time there were no observational indications of any cosmic ray particles in the hydrogen Mass range and the extension of the theoretical development to the questions of scalar Motion in two dimensions and the lifetimes of the cosmic atoms had not yet been undertaken the exact theoretical status of the incoming C hydrogen or Cosmic hydrogen atoms was therefore still uncertain inasmuch as the mesons then known were mainly Cosmic elements of the inert gas series um meaning the um noble gases the cosmic noble gases it was concluded that the original C hydrogen atoms must be stripped of their one-dimensional rotation and reduced to the two-dimensional or inert gas condition almost immediately on crossing the speed boundary in the meantime however the investigators have been able to extend their observations to earlier portions of the Decay path and they have recently discovered a short-lived particle with a mass that is reported as 3695 Mega electron volts identification of this 3695 PSI particle PSI particle as a cosmic deuteron with two material isotopic charges by Ronald W satz was The crucial theoretical advance that opened the door to a clarification of the status of cosmic hydrogen this now enables us to close the gap and Trace the progress of the cosmic Atom from its entry into the material sector in the form of cosmic hydrogen um that being Cosmic deuterium not hydrogen one but hydrogen isotope II all the way to its final transformation into material particles for reasons which will be explained in volume 2 The Cosmic atom has an effective translational motion into of the three scalar Dimensions at the neutral point where it enters the material half of the universe the terrestrial environment into which the observable Cosmic atoms enter is favorable for the acquisition of gravitational charges of the material type each of the two dimensions of motion therefore adds such a charge the two charges acquired by the Sea deuterium the cosmic deuterium atom add 1862.3 megavolts to the 1848.6 megavolt Mass Mega electron volt Mass equivalent to the cosmic Mass bringing the total mass of this the first of the theoretical cosmic ray particles to 37 10.9 Mega electron volts the mass of the newly discovered side particle is reported as 36.95 in view of the many uncertainties involved in the observations this can be regarded as consistent with a theoretical value okay now um yesterday Larson went through a discussion of how you calculate these Mega electron volts this this is really how mass is calculated over in the cosmic sector um so you might want to review yesterday&#x27;s video If you want to get a derivation of how Larson comes up with these numbers here uh basically meaning that he&#x27;s not just pulling them out of no place as mentioned earlier the particle lifetimes are correlated with the dimensions of the spatial motions that the particles acquire the translational motion and the gravitational charges while the theoretical situation has not yet been clarified we find empirically that the life of a particle with two dimensions of scalar Motion in space and no gravitational charge is about 10 to the minus 16 seconds approximately the natural unit of time each dimension of motion modifies the unit of time applicable to the particle Life by approximately 10 to the minus 8. while each gravitational charge modifies the unit by about 10 to the minus 2. on this basis the following approximately approximate lifetimes are applicable and so he&#x27;s saying three dimensions and zero charges the life expected lifetime is 10 to the minus 24 seconds if you have two dimensions and two charges then you&#x27;re talking 10 to the minus 20. if you have two dimensions and zero charges you&#x27;re talking 10 to the minus 16. if you only have one dimension and one charge you&#x27;re talking 10 to the minus 10 and if you have one dimension and zero charges then you&#x27;re talking 10 to the minus 8.</p>
<p>so there&#x27;s um basically two factors that are involved each Dimension uh you multiply by 10 to the minus eight and each gravitational charge which is what creates isotopes each gravitational charge is 10 to the minus 2. so if you have something like hydrogen like Ronald satz was saying that uh the hydrogen with two charges two gravitational charges because it was the um uh he said it was the deuteron Cosmic deuteron with two material isotopic charges uh I thought the deuteron was no like maybe deuteron is uh hydrogen well deuterium is hydro the second isotope of hydrogen so I&#x27;m not exactly sure uh where SATs is coming from maybe this will maybe we just continue on we&#x27;ll get some answers here uh the reported lifetime of the 3695 side particle is in the neighborhood of 10 to the minus 20 seconds which agrees because it&#x27;s got two uh dimensions that&#x27;s 10 to the minus 16 and then you have to multiply It Again by 10 to the minus 4 for the two for the two charges which agrees with the theoretical determination of the dimensions of motion on which the mass calculation is based the general Decay pattern defined in the preceding Pages indicates that Cosmic deuterium H2 should undergo an injection of positive rotational displacement converting it to Cosmic Cosmic helium 3. from the expression 3724.61 over M we obtain 1242 Mega electron volts as the rotational mass of c h e 3 Cosmic helium-3 to which we add the mass of two gravitational charges for a total of 3104 Mega electron volts The observed 36 95 particle decays to another side particle with a reported mass of 3105 very close to his prediction of 3104. and a life of about 10 to the minus 20 seconds this second particle can clearly be identified with the cosmic helium-3 atom thus The observed masses the lifetimes and the Decay pattern all confirm the basic identification of the C hydrogen particle bisats another decay of the same kind would produce C he4 the uh four Mass isotope of heli of cosmic helium and it is probable that some particles of this composition are occasionally formed indeed any Cosmic atom between C hydrogen and C Krypton may appear in the cosmic ray products now C Krypton is at the end of the line of the Decay once you get to see Krypton then which is three three zero in Larson&#x27;s notation um then uh it can invert and convert immediately to two massless neutrons so C Krypton is the last Cosmic atom involved here um so he&#x27;s saying any Cosmic atom between C hydrogen and C Krypton may appear in the cosmic ray products depending on basically statistics but the probabilities favor certain specific Cosmic elements and these are the products that constitute the normal DK sequence we are now examining the speeds of the cosmic rays and their Decay products decrease rapidly in the material environment and by the time the decay of cosmic helium-3 is due the additional energy loss in the Decay process is usually sufficient to drop the cosmic residue into the speed range below Unity the consequent elimination of the motion in the second scalar Dimension results in a double Decay which adds two atomic weight units to the cosmic atom the product is Cosmic lithium five okay um I guess we&#x27;re going to stop there uh for now uh now this is uh obviously very very difficult stuff um just let it wash over you and um put it in put it on the back burner and just uh recognize that this is within the scope of Larson&#x27;s Theory and he&#x27;s coming up with better uh Solutions than the mainstream scientists are but um it&#x27;s all pretty theoretical and pretty difficult to follow I&#x27;m actually pretty excited because I&#x27;m this is probably the seventh or eighth time I&#x27;ve read this book but uh this is the first time that I&#x27;ve even come close to understanding it this chapter so um you know maybe at least if I get a grasp of it I might be able to explain it better to you again Larson is it I think a good writer but he&#x27;s not a great teacher and the information is always there but it&#x27;s hard to extract it and the information is usually so difficult and requires a great deal of unlearning of the old principles and also Larson is trying to explain something in an entirely new language so he&#x27;s having to come up with terminology notations and all of these things that you know they can be uh difficult and cumbersome and ambiguous because you know he&#x27;s kind of trying it out let&#x27;s try this notation let&#x27;s try this word for that concept and they don&#x27;t always go smoothly so you have to cut Larson a little bit of slack because he is the originator of this Theory and so he had to he pretty much had to do all the heavy lifting and sometimes it didn&#x27;t go perfectly but the information is there and now that other people are beginning to learn about this Theory we can work it out we can work out his Concepts to fit in with uh Concepts that were at least um maybe not comfortable with but maybe at least we&#x27;re somewhat fluent in them um okay now uh thanks for tuning in and have a great day</p>
