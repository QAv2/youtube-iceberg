            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Ride the signal through the unknown. This is the Cryptic Current. &gt;&gt; Scientists once believed that a vacuum was a state of space completely devoid of matter. In this state, the orbital paths of all objects including electrons should be predictable. However, reality was not like that.</p>
<p>In 1947 experiment, American physicist Willis Lamb accidentally discovered something in a vacuum environment. The electron orbits of hydrogen atoms were disturbed. Initially, Lamb thought there must be a problem with the experiment. Therefore, [music] he adjusted the experiment. But no matter how he adjusted or eliminated variables, the electron orbits of [music] hydrogen atoms remained unpredictable.</p>
<p>At this point he realized [music] that in a vacuum environment there exists a type of virtual particle. They appear for [music] an extremely short time and then disappear. And because their appearance time is too [music] short they cannot be captured. But when they appear they affect the motion of [music] electrons causing a slight shift in energy levels. Later Willis Lamb received a Nobel Prize in physics in 1955 for this discovery.</p>
<p>And this is the [music] famous lamb shift. From that moment on, humans finally knew that a vacuum [music] is not an empty space with nothing at all. Physicist Harold Hardhof [music] even believed that the energy contained in a space measured by could evaporate all the [music] oceans on Earth. If one day humans could harness this energy source, human civilization would take a different turn. Legend has it that Tesla himself once achieved this.</p>
<p>More importantly, according to some accounts, after Tesla, there were many others who invented similar things. Ask just that the ocean&#x27;s haven. So, what is [music] this really about? Is the scenario that happened with Tesla repeating itself and what is the reason? Today we will discuss free [music] energy together SRV. Hello everyone, I am Miss Ruby. In the 21st century, humans live in a world that cannot do without electricity.</p>
<p>Most of us heavily rely on thermal power generation. Power plants generate electricity through fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas or petroleum that produce electricity. However, [music] these fossil fuels are finite and one day they will be depleted. Therefore, as early as the last century, humans began searching for alternative energy sources. In 1954, the Soviet Union built the first nuclear power plant in omnis.</p>
<p>The difference compared to conventional power generation is nuclear power plants can provide stable and economical electricity while not emitting CO2. However, it still has limitations. During the electricity generation, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste which harms the environment. Not only that, if an accident occurs in nuclear power generation, it is often very difficult to handle. For example, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Fuan.</p>
<p>So, is there a way to invent a cleaner energy [music] source? Hey, this story is true. According to the two [music] scientists description, under room temperature conditions, the electrolysis [music] of how you are, they introduce heavy hydrogen into a paladium electron causing dutyium [music] nuclei to undergo a nuclear reaction releasing energy. Since the entire process occurs at room temperature, it is called [music] cold nuclear fusion or cold fusion. Compared to current nuclear power production, cold fusion does not produce highly radioactive nuclear waste, the process does [music] not involve high temperatures and pressures making it safer. And because [music] the ocean contains a large amount of dutarium, the production cost is even lower.</p>
<p>In summary, if this fusion reaction is [music] feasible, it will be an almost limitless and clean energy source. Therefore, are the two announce cold fusion? It immediately [music] attracted global attention. However, not long after these two scientists were criticized worldwide. The reason was that aside from them, no one could successfully replicate this experiment. But Eugene Malu [music] did not think so.</p>
<p>Eugene Maluth was a very famous American scientist. He held a master&#x27;s degree in aerospace engineering from MIT and a PhD in engineering sciences from Harvard University. After [music] graduation, Mr. Maloof worked at MIT. By 1989, when he noticed [music] the experiment by Pawns and Flechman, he became a supporter of cold fusion.</p>
<p>He believed that although their experiment was controversial, the phenomenon of cold fusion truly exists and precisely because of his support for cold fusion, Mr. Alof was also heavily criticized. Therefore, he later resigned from MIT focusing on research and promoting cold fusion. Heaven rewards the diligent. After many years of research until 2044, Luth finally made a major breakthrough.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, he claimed that someone was trying to prevent him from publishing his research. And then not long after, disaster struck. Due to a rent dispute, Maloof was beaten to death by his landlord in front of his parents&#x27; house. The source field&#x27;s death is highly suspicious because he was scheduled to go to Congress next week to report his latest research to the senators. And at this critical moment, he suddenly passed away.</p>
<p>Tom Ogle was an ordinary American young man. But in his free time, he enjoyed repairing machinery. One day in 1972, Tom was fixing a lawnmower when he accidentally punctured a hole in the fuel tank. At that moment, he happened to take it too. Inserted one end into the carburetor [music] connection.</p>
<p>The other end is connected to the fuel tank. What surprised him was the long over could then run continuously for 96 [music] hours while the fuel hardly changed. To surprise researched further and eventually [music] he discovered that the general operating process of the lava edge is to use a cylinder to create a vacuum suck fuel into the air and the carburetor then mix them into an air fuel mixture suitable for the combustion process. This mixture enters the combustion. The spark plug ignites the vernet.</p>
<p>The energy generated from the combustion [music] proc makes the piston move. Thereby the engine operates, but an unintentional action by Tom at that time. The cold weather had increased fuel efficiency. And this [music] miraculous discovery inspired Tom. He began to think whether the key point lies in the carburetor, whether the carburetor [music] could be improved, even design another device to replace [music] the traditional carburetor.</p>
<p>And if a lawn mower could do it, could a car do the same? Indeed, through his efforts, Tom successfully created a remarkable device. Meanwhile, on April 30th, 1977, witnessed [music] by many media outlets, Tom drove a car from El Paso, Texas to Demi, New Mexico, using only two gallons of gasoline. We need to know that the distance between these two locations is E2. While with current cars, 2 gallons of gasoline can only travel about 50 to 70 m. In other words, from 47 years ago, s invention was even more fuel efficient than today.</p>
<p>Some media even claimed that Tom traveled 200 m approximately 322 km with just two gallons. This is truly unbelievable. The problem is before the car departed, many mechanical engineers didn&#x27;t believe Hong had come to the scene with good intentions to [music] help inspect the car. After inspection, they confirmed that there really wasn&#x27;t a single wrong gasoline in the tank before the car departed. and Wy Anderson was one of the engineers who inspected Tom&#x27;s car.</p>
<p>We found an abandoned car and brought it back. One of Jim packs of added cars tested my car and we were following Tom Ogle in this car. That will continue. We need one more person to maintain it. By that [music] time, the public&#x27;s demand for gasoline will decrease.</p>
<p>Oil prices are starting to fluctuate. So, after [music] understanding the intentions of these people, Tongi decided not to sell his fuel conversion because he considered money important. But he also hoped to [music] earn money while also having to bring benefits to everyone. Until an international financial [music] expert named CF Ramsay repeatedly promised to bring Tong&#x27;s invention to the international market, Tong agreed to sell the fuel conversion patent for [music] $25 million, equivalent to over $3,200 billion. At that time, the media reported on this incident very after all [music] something like this is rare.</p>
<p>The young man not only brought anus to humanity through his invention but also became a wealthy person. After receiving the money moved his life and children into a beautiful bought many cars and lived a luxurious life. But what he never expected was this luxurious life lasted only a little over a year. The following year, financial expert Randy Gear sold Pal&#x27;s invention to Advanced Fuel Systems Company, [music] then disappeared immediately after the sale. A few months later, these companies became parts of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>And then Tom was [music] also approached by the National Tax Agency. Next, negative news about Tom continuously [music] appeared, including scientists criticizing Tom&#x27;s invention as fraudulent. Police caught Tom Redheaded Friday under the influence of alcohol. Even the media reported that Tom was addicted to gambling and lost all his assets, causing his wife to divorce him. Later, on the morning of April 14th, 1980, Tom was shot in front of R.</p>
<p>Police never caught [music] the perpetrator, but he miraculously survived. At that time, Tom told police that someone wanted to kill him, but the police didn&#x27;t believe it. A few months later, Paul was found unconscious in her friends. Although emergency treatment was quickly provided, he still didn&#x27;t survive and the cause of death was drug and alcohol overdose. It&#x27;s worth noting that while alive, Tom once told his lawyer that he suspected his drink had been poisoned.</p>
<p>So, there were always rumors that Tom&#x27;s death was because he insisted on bringing his invention to market. If Ton&#x27;s invention were released, it would certainly have hacked oil sales. And oil companies would never allow that to happen. That&#x27;s right. Tom Wasen.</p>
<p>Back in the 1930s, Sharp Hook, a [music] Canadian inventor, claimed to have invented a highly efficient carburetor, allowing [music] one gallon of gasoline to run up to 200 miles. Even more impressive than TH&#x27;s two gallons for 200 miles. At that time, Hook [music] also applied for his own patent and was widely reported by the media. Subsequently, the stock prices of [music] oil companies continuously declined. Investors simultaneously sold off oils.</p>
<p>Among them, the [music] stock of Canadian Royal Oil Group and some other companies dropped by 6%. Hawk&#x27;s research room was also broken into. All of [music] his carburetors and design drawings were stolen. After a [music] period of chaos, Sharp Pot suddenly refused all interviews from the media. He even denied [music] ever claiming that his carburetor could car over 200 m per gallon of gasoline.</p>
<p>Is Po [music] being threatened by interest groups like Tom was? But if Po is truly being threatened, why doesn&#x27;t he seek help from the government or police? Conspiracy theorists related to this issue believe that the government doesn&#x27;t want [music] oil sales to be affected. More specifically, they believe that a country that controls energy sources wouldn&#x27;t want people to become independent from energy. After all, controlling energy also means controlling the world. All activities from eating, learning to transportation are related to energy. If people use less oil, government taxes will also decrease.</p>
<p>S perspective, [music] they dawn. Even less can they allow free energy to exist. Following Tom and Pope in the 1980s, another inventor named Stanley Meyer claimed to have achieved a major breakthrough in automotive fuel. He invented a device called a water fuel cell, allowing cars to operate using only water without oil. Then Meyer did the same as previous inventors.</p>
<p>He filed a patent application. Many reported on it and Meer successfully demonstrated a water power car to the public. According to Meyer, his water fuel cell through a special electrolysis process separates water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is burned as fuel, reacting with oxygen to produce energy, powering the car and emitting only water vapor. That&#x27;s right, the water fuel cell invented by no gases, only water vapor.</p>
<p>Imagine if this invention became reality, air pollution problems would significantly increase. we wouldn&#x27;t need to buy oil and the world would no longer have oil wars. Meer even proudly stated that the water used for the car didn&#x27;t need to be pure water. Even more astonishingly, Meer claimed with just 22 gallons of water, about 83.27 [music] m, a car can travel from the east coast to the west coast of the United States. This distance is approximately 3,951 [music] km.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s do a rough calculation. If 95 octane gasoline costs 44,000 Vietnamese dons per liter, this journey would cost about 6.5 billion [music] yet with average tap water price of 12,000 Vietnamese dons per cubic meter, 1,000 L. If Myers invention became reality, the nearly 4,000 km journey from Los Angeles to New York would cost less than 1,000 Vietnam. Truly astonishing, [music] isn&#x27;t it? No wonder many people believe oil companies wouldn&#x27;t allow free energy to emerge. We even [music] found a video of a host mocking Meer.</p>
<p>If your invention really works, why are you still alive? Without a doubt, Meyer&#x27;s invention [music] caused a sensation. But not long after, Meyer was questioned by the scientific [music] community. Scientists argued that his invention had problems because it violated the first and second [music] laws of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics is also known as the law of conservation of energy. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed only converted from one form to another.</p>
<p>In other words, the energy used to elect water must be equal to or greater than the energy obtained from burning hydrogen. However, Mr. Meyer believed that only a very small amount of energy was needed to electrolyze water to produce more energy to power a car. This clearly violates the law of conservation of energy. The second law states that in a closed system, the total entropy of a system will continuously increase and during energy conversion, there will be dissipation, usually lost as heat.</p>
<p>Yet, Meyer claimed his system could convert energy efficiently, but did not explain how. Despite scientists disagreement, under the supervision of many experts like that, Meyer continuously [music] poured water into the fuel tank and successfully ran the car. After continuous media coverage, Meyer attracted special attention. Not long after that news, on March 20th, 1998, Meyer along with his brother Sio Meyer and two investors from Belgium were here at a restaurant. It was a [music] happy day because the Belgian investors had agreed to fund Meyer&#x27;s further research.</p>
<p>At that time, the server brought a glass of cranberry juice to Meyer. After drinking [music] a few sips, Meyer suddenly ran out of the restaurant with a pained expression and collapsed at the door. His brother [music] Steven immediately followed and saw Meer vomiting continuously. He also told his brother that he had been poisoned. This statement [music] became Meyer&#x27;s last words.</p>
<p>Later, at the family&#x27;s request, Dr. Fabi performed an autopsy [music] but found no poison. In fact, the cause of Mr. Meyer&#x27;s death was determined to be a ruptured brain vein, not poisoning. Nevertheless, [music] many still believe his death was not so simple.</p>
<p>Notably, when researching Meyer, we discovered that during [music] his lifetime, he revealed that in 1951, the US government passed the Invention [music] Secrecy Act, allowing the US Patent Office and other government agencies to issue secrecy orders. prohibiting the public disclosure of inventions whenever they deem it a threat to US economic or national security. Even refusing to grant patents but allowing the sale [music] of patents to the US military. Remarkably, as long as the US government deemed it necessary, this secrecy [music] act could be extended indefinitely. In other words, restricted inventions might never be known to the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, when applying for a patent, they are cleverly free to intentionally altering some data so the US government could engrave this invention. Tre replicate the water fuel cell based on mayor. Perhaps someone would ask even knowing the US government would want his technology. Why did mayor risk applying for a patent? Regarding this issue, mayor&#x27;s answer was that a patent could attract investors and it was the only way for him to promote his technology to the public. The key point is while researching Mayor&#x27;s invention, we discovered the real power of the water fuel cell was not that water could replace gasoline, but that it generated energy.</p>
<p>In Mayor&#x27;s words, he could achieve this impossible feat. The key lies in this tooidal coil device. Mayor publicly claimed that this coil could optimize the distribution of the electric field, enhancing the electrolysis efficiency of the elements, [music] thus producing more energy with lower input. But similarly this still violates the first [music] law of thermodynamics. Meaning energy must be conserved.</p>
<p>Energy cannot be created from nothing. However, challenging this [music] theory wasn&#x27;t unique to Mayor. One of them was hailed as the closest to a god. In February 1892, at the Institution [music] of Electrical Engineers in London, Nicola Tesla spoke as follows. In the future, we won&#x27;t need power plants [music] anymore, but will develop machines to draw energy from anywhere.</p>
<p>This statement is profoundly meaningful, making one ponder. Could Tesla be implying that in the future humans could extract energy from the air? Astonishingly, someone later indeed invented such a device. In the 1930s, a man named Thomas Mo announced to the world that he had invented a special device. It could generate electricity without needing charge. Even in front of a crowd with no electricity available, Mo made a light bulb glow.</p>
<p>Of course, in the eyes [music] of scientists, this was impossible because it violates the first law of thermodynamics. Energy cannot spontaneously arise. But Mo told everyone that he did not create it from nothing. Mo believe that the entire universe is filled with extremely high frequency oscillations. Yes, oscillations.</p>
<p>Again, they carry the largest and immeasurable source of pure raw energy. His device captured this energy flow through an antenna and converted it into electricity. Therefore, it does not violate the first law of thermodynamics as the energy comes from the universe. Now, some speculate that many of my devices were actually feasible. So, the energy extracted from the universe is likely radiation energy or 0 point energy.</p>
<p>0 point energy is a concept in quantum physics, meaning that even when matter reaches its lowest energy state, even at absolute zero, energy still exists. Simply put, 0 point energy is like an inexhaustible energy reservoir. It is stored in every corner of the universe. Although Mor did not directly use the term zero point energy, his description of drawing energy from the void immediately brings it to mind. The key point was to prove he [music] was not cheating.</p>
<p>And that the device was not receiving power from a secret laboratory supply. Moray specifically [music] went far from town to a canyon completely devoid of electrical infrastructure. while reassembling [music] the device in front of scholars and engineers. Then once again he demonstrated that [music] the device could operate without traditional energy sources able to directly absorb positive energy to generate electricity. During this process [music] he must pull out the antenna at which point the light immediately turned off.</p>
<p>This proved that the energy was captured by the antenna. [music] Ironically despite Mo repeatedly demonstrating it, no one believed him. Those who doubted Mor could not find any evidence that he [music] was cheating. After several public experimental [music] demonstrations, Mor applied for a patent. With the United States Patent [music] and Trademark Office, but it was rejected because they did not believe his invention could work.</p>
<p>Strangely, after Mo applied for the patent, his life suddenly became chaotic. Many [music] strangers appeared at his doorstep and some even attacked him and his family. Eventually, War was forced to install bulletproof glass on his car and carry a gun. One day, his laboratory was broken into. Machinery was destroyed and all the disappeared.</p>
<p>Since the laboratory [music] breakin, Mores suddenly became a completely different person. He canled all [music] public demonstrations and no longer accepted media interviews. S0 point energy or radiation energy no matter how it if this energy truly exists as someone once discovered it then surely more than one person would have found it. Floyd Squid was an inventor physicist and electrical engineering expert who once worked at Edison&#x27;s General Electric but in 1980 he took his wife to Los Angeles to enjoy retired life. Since squish was very interested in electromagnetic fields, he harvested a in his home where he conducted electromagnetic experiments daily.</p>
<p>In 1985, he announced to the public that he had invented a vacuum tube amplifier abbreviated as VTA. The key point is a switch. When the VTA device is activated, it requires no input energy. The machine can run on its own to generate electricity. Thus, [music] self-running energy from the VTA is a very convenient and practical energy source.</p>
<p>Squidge proposed a hypothesis. He believed that through appropriate ionic field distribution, electrons could reach a nonlinear dynamic state. In this state, electrons [music] could interact uniquely with the zero point field and draw energy from it. Then Squidge [music] applied for a patent. I&#x27;m sure everyone can guess what I according to Squidge.</p>
<p>One day after he applied for the patent while shopping in [music] the supermarket, a stranger suddenly appeared and threw him some photos. One photo showed [music] him studying in front of the VTA device. The other was a picture of him and his wife having dinner together. This person [music] told Squid that he must stop his research immediately, even warning that if he didn&#x27;t stop, his life would be in danger. But despite that, Squid still didn&#x27;t give up his research.</p>
<p>In July 1995, Squid told his friend Morris that his research had made very important progress and arranged to meet so Morris to see his achievements. At that time, they set a specific time, [music] but later Squid said someone was very interested in the device. So, their meeting time was postponed slightly. However, Morris couldn&#x27;t have imagined that this [music] would be their last conversation. On July 5th, 1995, Switch suddenly passed away.</p>
<p>According to accounts from Mrs. Violet and Mrs. Switch, one day before his death, two strangers unexpectedly came to their home. These two people thought with Switch for a while and then left immediately. Afterwards, around 8:00 p.m., Squid suddenly collapsed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Violet called an ambulance, but when she prepared to go with it, she was refused. And about 20 minutes later, Isa received notification that Squid was critically ill and didn&#x27;t survive. Notably, the [music] device that Squid finally invented later also disappeared s death [music] wasn&#x27;t. Not only Squidge, but many inventors we mentioned today.</p>
<p>Their deaths, whether more or less, all have suspicious aspects. And while alive, they also said they had been threatened. Because of this, conspiracy theorists believe that These people actually invented free energy devices. They watched videos about Tesla on the channel, especially these two videos. You, it seems Tesla&#x27;s ending scenario somewhat repeats with the five genius inventors we&#x27;re talking about today.</p>
<p>And regarding why their inventions were all hindered, there are mainly three [music] most discussed reasons. First, the government wants to control energy to consolidate [music] tax revenue in the economy. Second, interest groups or shadow states don&#x27;t [music] allow people to escape dependence and exploitation. Third, also considered the deepest and most unpredictable reason that is human development hasn&#x27;t yet [music] reached that level. Human development stage hasn&#x27;t reached the point of how your free energy.</p>
