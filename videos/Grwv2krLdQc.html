            <p>But it&#x27;s interesting to me that they&#x27;re they&#x27;re frustrated about the confusion when they are indirectly and sometimes directly responsible for perpetuating the confusion by perpetuating the falsehood that Louzzando ran a separate program called ATIP. And I think they do it because they&#x27;re friends with Lou. I know that they know that this isn&#x27;t true, but that puts them in an awkward position of like, well, now they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve spent so much capital on this L story being true. I think that is making it very difficult for them to just they can&#x27;t come out and say, well, okay, everything we just told you the past couple years about this is actually wrong. You know, they know the truth of this story and they are perpetuating the confusion.</p>
<p>So to then come out and and call age of disclosure into question for not clarifying clarifying this confusion is a little bit I&#x27;ll just say they have the opportunity themselves to clarify this greatly by coming out with what they know to be Fruit.</p>
