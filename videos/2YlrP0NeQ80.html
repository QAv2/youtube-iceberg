            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[Music] The research of Dr. Beatatric Vurel shows that there is a network or was a network of UFOs of artificial objects before there was Sputnik, before we had any satellites that we know of orbiting the Earth and responding to nuclear events on Earth decades ago. in that research has now been peer-reviewed. Everybody is talking about it. So, let&#x27;s talk about it.</p>
<p>Get in here. This is Jack with Cosmic Road. I talk about UFOs in the paranormal. Please hit like. Please subscribe and let me know what you think in the comments below.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay. UAP File says, &quot;Right now, there is a concerted effort to muddy the waters surrounding the recent peer-reviewed paper by Dr. Beatatrice Rivierel and her team. The main argument being circulated is that we should all calm down because the findings don&#x27;t constitute absolute proof.</p>
<p>Yet, I haven&#x27;t seen anyone claim that this is definitive evidence of aliens. What it is, however, is highly significant and strong evidence of something extraordinary that will motivate science and academia to look deeper. That is the perceived danger. Yeah. That people are reacting against.</p>
<p>Uh Dr. Gary Nolan has just chimed in. That&#x27;s right. Gary Nolan has entered the chat uh re um replying to Mick West who said, &quot;The gold standard of science is not peerreview.&quot; Yeah, we&#x27;ve all been wanting peer-reviewed research on UFOs. Finally, we we get it.</p>
<p>Mick West says, &quot;Not good enough.&quot; Uh he says, &quot;The gold standard is independent replication.&quot; To which Gary Nolan says, &quot;lol.&quot; He still doesn&#x27;t get it. Well, he does. He just doesn&#x27;t care that he&#x27;s pushing disinformation. Whatever. Um, multiple plates showing the same kind of event is is replication.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s peerreview of unaltered photographic plates. If you want to replicate it, you can go get the plates and do the same study. I can publish a one-off paper on a single patient with symptoms as shown by MRI or physical exam along with symptoms. If it&#x27;s a unique case, I can publish is a case study. It is a case study.</p>
<p>Uh it&#x27;s a flare sent up to look for other similar medical ideologies that might lead to the discovery of a new syndrome and eventually understand the underlying cause. The work by Dr. Vio Roel is the same. Once again, not a Dr. West grossly misses the mark.</p>
<p>Back to your myar balloons and seagulls, Mick. You do much better there. I love that. Back to your balloons, MC West. Back to your balloons and your seagulls.</p>
<p>Oh, let&#x27;s see. Jesse Michael says, &quot;Reminder, there are still no first principles debunks on a credentialed peer-reviewed astronomer detecting a 100,000 plus literal UFOs. you know, she calls them light transients in her paper uh on plate on plates from the most prominent observatory in the 50s before satellites orbited the earth. Uh yeah, nobody has been able to, you know, really debunk this. Joe Mia says, &quot;Detecting 100,000 plus literal UFOs.</p>
<p>Uh we don&#x27;t know what these points of light are yet.&quot; you know, replying to that quote. And if they&#x27;re hardware/craft or probes, we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a 100,000 combined, the same group, hundreds or thousands showing up over and over again, or 100,000 different craft. Now, I think I&#x27;ve talked before about what some experiencers report as far as numbers go with UFOs, uh, you know, here on Earth and around Earth. And it&#x27;s not just thousands or even 100 thousand, you know, they report like in the millions. Uh, you know, but let&#x27;s just say, you know, 100 thousand, okay, why not, right? As a staggeringly huge number of objects that we can&#x27;t identify, controlled by intelligences we don&#x27;t understand here on Earth.</p>
<p>But, you know, it would take that amount uh to do the things that they do uh you know, at least as far as we can determine. You know, the Roper poll in the &#x27;9s conducted by But Hopkins, David Jacobs, uh and John Mack uh found that 2% of the populace were abductees. David Jacobs has since supplied numbers saying they actually had to round that down. round that down or or or carve that down a little bit, whittle that number down so as not to alarm people that the real number, the real percentage was closer to 5%. But let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a little higher than 2%.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s just say 3%. That&#x27;s 200 million people here on Earth today that are abductees are experiencers of that phenomenon. Um, and this is not just a one-off thing. These are typically people that are taken you know day by day, week by week, year by year, generation by generation. This is a vast vast operation by the phenomenon.</p>
<p>An overwhelmingly vast operation. So it would require these sorts of numbers. Now is that what they&#x27;re doing up there? I don&#x27;t know. They&#x27;re responding to nuclear events and activities which is really really interesting. And you know that&#x27;s been you know we&#x27;ve known that for a while.</p>
<p>Uh you know here they are. We&#x27;re doing nuclear tests and yeah sure enough they show up there&#x27;s there&#x27;s the boom. I think this is the uh pitified uh version of the video and which uh you know you can you can see the UFOs better. You can see those white objects, light transients, whatever we&#x27;re going to call them, uh, showing up in the skies, possibly the same sorts of things that would have been recorded on those plates, you know, made famous by Dr. Beatatric Vroel.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re still up there, guys, and still doing the same things. How long have they been up there? Have they been up there for 12,560 years? the the best date we have for the buggosphere. Have they been up there for millions of years? Did they create life on Earth and are still in the process of managing it? Did they create humanity? I don&#x27;t know. Uh but Dr. Gary Nolan was so impressed by Dr.</p>
<p>V Beatatric Vio&#x27;s work uh that he actually met with her. uh they sat down and they had a talk uh with the soul foundation and he had some intriguing comments here &gt;&gt; but I want to also point out something that&#x27;s been happening now for like the last two or three years whether it was the paper I published on the council bluffs material with Jacques and Larry Lemi &gt;&gt; or whether it was Kevin Nuth&#x27;s papers or whether it was papers in fact frankly from Robert Powell and and others and now you and Avi Lo globe uh that those papers are not being criticized by the usual chorus of critics and I think that&#x27;s first of all for two reasons because scientifically such as with your work it was done correctly you make careful uh note of all the methodologies that were used come up with alternative explanations self-critique yourself uh go to peer review etc. And so in in essence almost what it does in a good way is make the paper boring uh and so bor not in a negative sense but so boring that they can&#x27;t be critiqued. So boring they can&#x27;t be critiqued. No I love it.</p>
<p>What a compliment, right? Uh but Gary Nolan impressed by her research and how boring it is. this appears to be a real phenomenon that&#x27;s not not boring at all. Uh but you have to present it that way of course for it to be taken seriously. Um so yeah, I&#x27;ll link to this conversation and you can watch the full thing at your leisure. Uh but we&#x27;ve got to talk more about you know UFOs in nukes.</p>
<p>Uh but first let&#x27;s go to uh this uh quote from UAP1 who says a few years ago I saw an interview of Richard Dolan where he speculated that based on the number and density of UFO sightings worldwide that we could reasonably project out there out to there being thousands of UFOs observing or sitting idle above us at any one time. Yeah, I think that&#x27;s correct. Um, but yeah, getting back to UFOs and nukes, you know, many of you will have seen the videos of UFOs showing up over Fukushima during the disaster caused by the earthquake. And yeah, they were they were showing up. Now, they weren&#x27;t helping.</p>
<p>I mean, as far as we know, I mean, who knows? Maybe they were helping in some way we can&#x27;t detect. Um, but they were interested. You know, that activity drew them in. Were they monitoring our response? Were they rem monitoring the effects on the atmosphere and whether they needed you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not real but uh you know they uh were doing something. They were doing something.</p>
<p>Uh what were they doing? We don&#x27;t know. We probably need to find out. Now, Lu Alzando in his book uh Eminent talked about uh there being a project, a proposed project that was actually going to use nuclear material to lure UFOs in uh so they could be shot down or studied. Uh and that was called Interloper. Project Interloper was proposed to lure these craft in using nuclear material because they are that predictable.</p>
<p>though says ATIP also identified another pattern. In several instances, UAPs have allegedly appeared near American nuclear facilities or weapons systems. Both the Nimmits and the Roosevelt are nuclearpowered. &gt;&gt; We do know that there is a very significant interest that UAP have towards our nuclear technology. A daunting thought to be sure, but Alzando says ATIP also developed a hypothesis that the UAP&#x27;s &gt;&gt; Okay, I&#x27;m hearing some uh music in the background, so I probably can&#x27;t play that for too long, unfortunately.</p>
<p>But I will link this clip. Uh Lou Alzando is talking about nukes uh why UFOs may be interested in them, or at least that UFOs are indeed interested in them. uh and that yeah they were planning to use that to lure these craft in. Now what would they have done with those craft if they if that had been successful? Well, probably the same things they&#x27;re doing now behind closed doors and not telling us about it. If they had been successful, we might never have learned about Louisisando, ATIP, uh OAP or any of that and this age of UFO disclosure that we&#x27;re living in probably wouldn&#x27;t be taking place.</p>
<p>Same thing uh for you know James Licowski, Colin Keller if they had been able to actually get that UFO um from Loheed Martin, the um initiative that was killed by the CIA. Uh if that had actually worked, if Kona Blue had gone forward, uh that would have all been wrapped up and everything they&#x27;ve done would have been, you know, black. You know, they would have gotten their SAP. So, which is what they wanted and you know they didn&#x27;t get it. Uh, but if they had gotten what they wanted, we never would have heard about any of that and again we wouldn&#x27;t be living in this age of UFO disclosure where Congress people now are talking about UFOs.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re talking about the Bermuda Triangle and other dimensional beings trying to get laws associated with UFOs passed and actually having some success. Not as much as, you know, we would like, but actually having some success. Uh so you know I&#x27;m glad that they didn&#x27;t get get what they wanted in that case. Uh but yeah but that&#x27;s how predictable UFOs are in in that sense. So what are those UFOs doing up there? Are they regulating the earth? Are they conducting, you know, abductions? Are they doing both? Uh are there different factions doing different things? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>But let me know your thoughts in the comments below. I love it that we have, you know, peer-reviewed research on UFOs. Now that is insanely awesome. We are living in the age of UFO disclosure. The stigma is eroding at least if the papers are boring enough per Gary Nolan.</p>
<p>Uh per Gary Nolan. Uh we&#x27;ve got uh you know at least I think two peer-reviewed papers on the Nazca mummies now. We&#x27;ve got a you know UFO the bugosphere in civilian hands being studied uh and dated to you know the time of the fall of Atlantis for God&#x27;s sakes. Uh, it&#x27;s a crazy time, guys. It&#x27;s a crazy time.</p>
