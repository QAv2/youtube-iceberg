            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello again and welcome to my channel we do educational videos here and um try to look at theories of everything uh that are important have been important to me that I&#x27;ve kind of dug up and uh brushed off and hopefully try to present them in a coherent way uh sometimes a challenge and and uh you know we look at cosmologies and Paradigm shifters anything that I think could benefit the audience out there uh with their holistic worldview their transition to 5D Consciousness uh and so on and uh today is our 41th video on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson and uh Larson uh wrote up his two fundamental postulates in 1959 and uh they articulated his Universe of motion and then uh from there he derived his theoretical Universe about how the universe would look if his postulates were correct and then he compared his Universe to the uh measured universe of the Legacy scientists and he does that in the book we&#x27;re uh focusing on today um basic properties of matter uh in the field of chemistry and so he uh theoretically arrives at different uh equations for various basic properties of matter like the melting point and then he Compares his uh theoretical findings with the uh laboratory measured uh findings of the Legacy science and uh then you know Compares them and explains whatever discrepancies occur and so on now uh larsson&#x27;s uh two fundamental postulates are mainly uh mainly we focus on the first one and it states that the universe is composed of entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so basically the universe is not made out of matter not made out of energy but is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of one another generally and uh they do not exist separately but only together in motion and they uh although you can extract abstract one from the other but uh only by basically stopping the Universe um which is really in motion and uh motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator time or space as the denominator all of our scientific quantities are different forms of motion including matter and energy and um motion space and time all only come in only discrete units you have to have a full unit of space and a full unit of time and uh before you have either one of those quantities and uh if you have one unit of space and one unit of time you have the speed of light which Larson refers to as unit speed and uh that is the background motion of the universe so the universe is always in motion and even if you have a universe of nothing you still have motion and it&#x27;s a a special kind of motion that Larsson refers to as scaler motion that is a motion that has a magnitude but has no specific direction or really all directions and you can Envision this using a balloon with spots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the spots will be moving away from each other so um all the spots are moving uh but they&#x27;re U moving in every direction every spot is moving away from every other spot um and the only way that you can determine a direction is if you assign a reference point to uh to one basically saying that this this one is not is motionless so again you you only can really make these measurements by stopping the universe by you know which is against the very nature of the universe but in order to make a measurement you have to stop um so um now he he&#x27;s getting into in uh we&#x27;re looking at chapter one of this book basic properties of matter which is on solid cohesion we started this about 5 days ago so if you want to go to the start you can go back about five episodes but we&#x27;re here in the middle of chapter 1 he just arrived um uh through a derivation that uh somewhat opaque um but he derived a uh an expression an equation for um like a um sing Le Force um for um the now what does he call it uh the rotational Force um for one particle that it it exerts on another and that is log of uh log of T so he uses the natural log um because it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a um an integration that you have to use U because even though motion comes in discrete units it is a continuous motion uh that&#x27;s something that I&#x27;m having trouble with myself but uh moving on um we&#x27;re going to start here and hopefully we&#x27;ll be able to get a little bit of a chunk uh going here today so the force computed from equation 11 which is the log of T where um I&#x27;m trying to see where he um cuz he was using n and then he switched over to T and um excuse me um to evaluate the rotational Force we integrate the quantity 1 /t from Unity the physical data or Z level again that&#x27;s Unity um unit speed to T and then uh okay the force computed from equation 1 one is the inherent rotational force of the individual atom that is the one-dimensional force which it exerts against a single unit of force the force between two apparently interacting atoms is um log of T A Time log of TB and again this is a force between two apparently or as if interacting atoms as if he uses or apparently because say if you have the uh balloon example again and you contract the balloon and so all of the dots are moving toward each other it appears as if there&#x27;s a force field between each one of the spots that that uh they&#x27;re moving toward each other but um that is only when you assign a reference point um to one of them when you say that one of them is motionless then it appears as if as if each other dot is being moved toward that uh reference dot uh as a uh action at a distance and there&#x27;s a force field between them but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s really happening because what&#x27;s really happening is that all of the dots are moving toward all of the other dots and the dot that is motionless is actually moving and so it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s an as if Force the the numbers work out the same way as if they were attracting in a force field but they&#x27;re not but that you can still use the same um math because it that&#x27;s that&#x27;s how it appears so um so the force between the two apparently interacting atoms is log of Ta A Time log of TB for a two-dimensional magnitude uh two-dimensional magnetic rotation and again the atom is comprised of rotations in a un of motion there are four kinds of Mo motions and the atom is made out of two a three number set at Larson&#x27;s periodic table basically each atom is three numbers the first is the primary magnetic rotations those are two-dimensional rotations and um then um there is a secondary two-dimensional rot rotation and then there is a one-dimensional um rotation which is kind of uh like a spin and um so for a two-dimensional magnetic rotation this becomes log squar of ta * log s of TB as we found in chapter 12 volume 1 nothing but motion the equivalent of distance s in the time region is s squared and again so that is um the time region which is because of the discrete unit postulate and so the time uh if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you do not have space you only have time and so when you&#x27;re dealing with uh and one unit of space is 4.56 * 10us 8 m so if their interaction is occurring in less space than that then you don&#x27;t uh have space you only have time because the universe is made out of space and time only and so it&#x27;s got to be one or the other or both and so if you don&#x27;t have space because you don&#x27;t have a full unit you have only time lson refers to this as the time region and in the time region you have kind of uh the um directions invert gravitation becomes outward and the progression becomes Inward and um the units also change so the equivalent distance in the time region is s squared so if you have S in the outside region um the material sector what he calls the U time space region the in the time region that same distance is s s and the gravitational force in this region therefore varies inversely as the fourth power of the distance rather than the square because gravitation is usually operating under under an inverse Square equation but again the this is an as if Force so it doesn&#x27;t really exist but you can still use the math applying this factor to the expression for the force of the two-dimensional rotation together with the inter Regional ratio which is basically the uh ratio of things that are not lost in the translation when you&#x27;re looking across into a different sector of the universe like looking into the time region what you see is only part of what&#x27;s going on and very a very small part of what&#x27;s going on and so you have to use the inter Regional ratio which is uh for an uh an atom is 100 5 6.44 which Larson calculated in a a video that I U in a paper that he wrote in a video that I did um months and months ago so if you want to go back and you can look for the uh video called the interatomic region or the inter Regional ratio okay so you um you have the fourth power power of the distance and you apply this factor to the expression for the force of the two-dimensional rotation together with the inter Regional ratio the ratio of effective to Total force is what he how he phrases it the ratio of effective to Total Force derived in the same chapter uh chapter 12 volume 1 which is nothing but motion we obtain the effective Force of the magnetic rotation of the atom so what you have is uh that fraction 15644 one over that which in decimals is uh 0.006 392 and then you multiply that by uh the fourth power and then you take s and you multiply that by the fourth power and then you multiply that by log squ of T A and log s of TB so that is his equation for the uh for the force between two uh two-dimensional rotations uh two atoms the distance Factor does not apply to the force due to the progression of the natural reference system as this force is omnipresent and unlike the rotational force is not altered as the objects to which it is applied change they relative positions at the point of equilibrium therefore the rotational force is equal to the unit force of the the progression okay so the progression uh the progression of the natural reference system the uh motion outward at the speed of light in all directions except now it&#x27;s in the time region so it&#x27;s moving inward instead of outward and the number we&#x27;re looking for is the uh inter um the interatomic distance and uh that is the for that is the place where the progression and gravitation reach equilibrium and so what we&#x27;re looking for here in this gravitational force equation is we&#x27;re looking for the place where it equals the progression so where they those two quantities are equal uh would be the place where the equilibrium is established so here he says as this force uh force of the progression is omnipresent 1/ 1 equal 1 this is the progression of the natural reference system and it exists calls it the null point or the neutral point the origin The Ether the progression of the natural reference system it is always there and it&#x27;s always the same but gravitational force is variable he calls it the rotational Force here and it&#x27;s um so the progression is not altered as the objects to which it is applied change their relative positions at the point of equilibrium therefore the rotational force is equal to the unit force of the progression okay substituting Unity for uh F of M FM in equation 14 so we&#x27;re really saying that this Force equals 1 uh we obtain 0. 6392 Times log Square Ro t log 12 t uh a Time log 12 TB uh that&#x27;s I&#x27;m I&#x27;m kind of lost here but that&#x27;s really just the algebra that is uh is messing me up here um he substitutes S Sub z um so he&#x27;s he&#x27;s basically it was originally log squared now it&#x27;s log to the 1/2 because he&#x27;s dividing this by uh fourth power relation of the um gravitational force so that&#x27;s what we end up with S Sub 0 um equals 0.0 6392 * log2 ta time log to the 12 TB the interatomic distances for those Elements which have no electric rotation the inner gas series may be calculated directly from this equation okay so this equation is only good for the noble gas gases because the noble gases are the only elements that really have a zero as their third number in Larson&#x27;s classification now remember I said that uh each element in Larson&#x27;s Universe of motion is a three number set the first is the two-dimensional primary rotation the second is two-dimensional secondary rotation and the third is the one-dimensional rotation the one-dimensional rotation is optional and the one-dimensional rotation can be positive or negative but uh when the one-dimensional rotation is zero that basically is entailing that you&#x27;re on uh the column that uh is the noble gases the helium and the Neons and the argon and cryptons um Xenon and um radon okay so those are the those are the only elements that you can calculate with that equation now if you&#x27;re talking about an an element that has an effective uh kind of C component the the one-dimensional rotation then uh you need something more um or maybe something less but the interatomic distances for those Elements which have no electric rotation the inert gas series or noble gases may be calculated directly from this equation in the elements however um T sub a equals T subb in most cases and it will be convenient to uh Express the equation uh in the simpli ified form uh thank God he&#x27;s simplifying something right uh S Sub 0 equals uh 0.0 6392 * log of T okay that is because in most cases um the the first number and the second number are the same I would think that would only be for half of the elements but he says most uh T sub aals T subb um okay so that is the equation that you use for the iner gases okay the values thus calculated are in the neighborhood of 10 Theus 8 cm when you&#x27;re using an equation like that and he&#x27;s basing everything on um a unit of space one unit of space is 4.56 * 10- 8 m okay so um this is a fraction of that this is you know one 100th of that um if your uh if T is at you know a number in the single digits which it is for all these different elements um okay so and for convenience this quantity has been taken as a unit in which to express the interatomic and intermolecular distances when converted from natural units to the conventional unit the angstrom uh which is I believe 10- 9 M uh equation uh that equation becomes uh S Sub zal 2914 * log of T A so 2.94 angstroms is the um standard value here for when uh ta equals TB and um 2.94 angstroms times the log of t Okay in applying this equation we encounter another of the questions with respect to terminology that inevitably arise in a basically new treatment of any subject the significance of the quantity t as used in the foregoing discussion and in the equations is obvious from the context did you did you think it was obvious I I didn&#x27;t but uh you know maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m just a historian but okay so the significance of the quantity t as used in the foregoing discussion and in the equations is obvious from the context it is the magnitude of the effective rotation but the question is what shall we call it the basic quantity with which we are dealing I I have to also add that when whenever you hear Larsson using the term obvious it&#x27;s never obvious it&#x27;s he uses I think he uses that term term as a cover because he I I I&#x27;ve seen him use it a number of different times and places and I think he he kind of wants to shame you into thinking that you&#x27;re the you&#x27;re the dummy for not understanding where he&#x27;s getting this from I I think he uses this kind of as a subterfuge for okay that derivation that I just came up with is a little bit tenuous um I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a little bit hard to follow so I&#x27;m going to use the term obvious uh to make sure that you know people go back and and and look at it some more or something so what shall we call it the basic quantity with which we are dealing the rotational speed displacement does not enter into the equation in the equations directly the mathematical structure of these equations requires us to enter them with with uh values that include the initial unit which constitutes the natural zero data furthermore each double vibrational unit rotates independently and when the rotation extends to a second such unit the increment in the value of T is only 1 half per 1/ half unit per added unit of displacement under these circumstances where the relation of the term t to the displacement is variable it seems advisable to give this term a distinctive name and we will therefore call it the specific rotation okay so that&#x27;s what he calls it the specific rotation now I just uh I&#x27;m no less lost right now than I usually am when I read this chapter um I get it kind of in um total and I I understand the equation uh and I kind of understand how he drived it um not certainly not well enough to check its veracity or to verify it um but I I can see that there is some kind of logical process there so I&#x27;m just going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say well if I really understood what I was what I was doing I could derive the same equation um and I will hopefully see you applying the same type of equation in a later context um in a different field to show that this is uh consistency uh but I just think that you know he he&#x27;s kind of just hitting you with too much too fast here and I don&#x27;t blame him you know whenever I criticize Larson I I don&#x27;t blame him because I know he&#x27;s one person doing just a Herculean task he has to do uh the job of like a thousand different scientists at once here so it he he&#x27;s really got a thankless and impossible job to to do and he&#x27;s trying to do it the best he can and he&#x27;s doing it better than anybody else that I could really see so I&#x27;m not really you know criticizing him I&#x27;m just um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m just coming from my own perspective of okay I&#x27;m having difficulty with this um and yeah you you could have if you did this I wouldn&#x27;t have so much difficulty perhaps but I don&#x27;t know you know maybe I&#x27;m a hopeless cause but uh I think we&#x27;re going to stop right there but I just think that if he if he just you know turned this chapter into five chapters instead or something um you know and just walked you through it and you know from every angle okay this term means this this you know because he&#x27;s throwing in all kinds of new terms here now so what he&#x27;s saying here is um each double double vibrational unit rotates independently okay these are I believe well I don&#x27;t because a vibrational unit I don&#x27;t remember where the vibrational units are coming in and then he says when the rot ation extends to a second such unit okay the double vibrational unit I believe is the photon at the core of the atom um so we might have to go back and revisit this paragraph when we go back come back tomorrow so I&#x27;ll back up and uh and do that um and maybe cuz I think I&#x27;m at least understanding where he&#x27;s coming from now I mean that&#x27;s the only approach that I really have to do this Larson right now is just to read the stuff over and over and over again and hit myself over the head with it until I uh get a clue and usually then I can move on to the next paragraph or whatever but um here I got lost by the terminology and I I didn&#x27;t see that word vibration so okay we&#x27;ll go back and uh we&#x27;ll try to clarify that and move on don&#x27;t uh lose Faith we&#x27;re going to we&#x27;re going to get this thanks for tuning in today</p>
