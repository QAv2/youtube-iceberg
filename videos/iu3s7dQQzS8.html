            <p>it&#x27;s that time of month again time of week again Sunday 6 PM welcome to Steve&#x27;s place um before we get to our guest I&#x27;d like to uh remind people at this time we do have a call for papers and um and the conference is going to be August 7th to 11th for 2024 uh if you&#x27;re if if you or know someone who have a a presentation on Research or maybe even device that covers like Tesla technology extreme physics the list is there anyway um you should have get hold of us my phone number is 520 2520 374 that&#x27;s my personal number or they can write to me as St a test tech on info and send me an abstract about 250 words a couple paragraphs all you need uh tell me what you want want to speak on uh of course you know we&#x27;re looking for Hardware not hot air so U working devices always have priority okay and in anyway I also want to remind people know to become a member of the Tes Tech YouTube channel right now we have the extraordinary technology conferences up there the Exotic research conferences up there and uh and I&#x27;m working on the global Sciences of up to 1997 there a lot of good information up there some of it you won&#x27;t find elsewhere also want to bring it to your attention you should become a member of the channel because any controversial material uh will always uh be set up there as members only the reason being is YouTube is on a censorship kick and they&#x27;re censoring all types of material and you can&#x27;t keep track of it anymore it&#x27;s $9.99 a month to become a member for exclusive members ship gives access to everything uh the 3991 is just a donation but anyway U so you go for the exclusive membership 999 month to get Global access 247 I mean you could be sitting in a trench in the middle of the Ukraine watching this stuff I mean it&#x27;s just so incredible um like again um we put most of our mature out as a members only for one reason because uh as a member only uh they don&#x27;t seem to censor it as hard as if it&#x27;s uh for the subscriptions and so uh if I see something there that&#x27;s going to get me knocked off um you know because uh the sensors won&#x27;t pass I&#x27;ll put it up there as members only and uh and have you be able to see it that way otherwise they&#x27;ll just take it down and nobody gets to see it so anyway um uh just go to our website uh test the takeown info and you click on the yellow box you know that&#x27;s up there and uh and you can uh subscribe there it&#x27;s free to subscribe you want to join it&#x27;s 999 you know same location I also have a conference directory where I&#x27;m listing all the directories when you click on that conference it&#x27;ll bring up all the videos in that u in that conference same thing the speakers if you pick up a certain speaker it should bring up all the uh is for that speaker um they&#x27;re still working Pro uh progress I got to get caught up on it but even even so I&#x27;ll be adding on all the time because um I&#x27;m adding videos all the time I got a thousand videos up there already and getting ready to put a thousand more so at this time I want to bring a okay Bill Alika and bill has spoken at a number of our conferences and in fact he has quite a few videos up there and he&#x27;s um been demonstrating overunity for many years how many years would you say uh Bill oh gez um I really started the conference circuit I would say right around 2001 I want to say um I yeah I would say about that yeah two right around 2001 is when I think I started presenting this material and you&#x27;re a you have a bachelor right right yeah BSA degree and uh I&#x27;ll get into a little bit of that uh in in some more detail here in the lecture um but uh yeah um you know never once you know I want to mention to the listening audience out out there is that never once was Nicola Tesla&#x27;s name mentioned in any of my course studies you I went to an Ivy League school in Chicago uh Chicago Illinois uh Illinois Institute of Technology um I graduated from that school in 1979 and never once was Nicola Tesla&#x27;s name mentioned by any of the professors which I thought was rather interesting considering all the inventions that Nicola Tesla did over the years um it just never made it into any course studies so there you go well I know that like when I started know the Tesa Society um we our Target was uh for professors and that and a lot of them have come and thanked me for making it a okay for him to u to talk about test again but before you get started I just want to remind everyone to below the screen there um there should be a th to give us a thumbs up you know so that the uh sensors will see that were good and help us promote the test of stuff and that I&#x27;m just G to turn it over to you Bill okay okay Steve um let me see if we got uh anything working here okay are you controlling it from your end or maybe not you&#x27;re on control oh I have control okay because it say share screen oh I see yeah there we go okay everyone uh I&#x27;ll be speaking today about replicating Tom Bearden scaler wave technology and if any of you ever met Tom beard he&#x27;s quite a character and uh when when he speaks you know at a at a conference years ago um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just quite fascinating okay so uh let&#x27;s let&#x27;s get into this here okay my timeline okay back in 1977 um while attending IIT Chicago engineering school I was given a vision and and to me it was the most outstanding incredible thing I ever saw and I was constructing an anti-gravity disc and at the time I had no clue on how any of this operated and it wasn&#x27;t until many years later here you know things started to fall into place so in 1979 I graduated with a bswe degree and began my professional career you I was a hardware software engineer and I worked at many many um corporations okay and then in 1997 uh I found out about Tom Bearden through uh this researcher by the name of uh Richard Hogan spoke about Tom Bearden and Richard put together this conference in Seattle and I said well okay I&#x27;m going to go to this and it&#x27;s it was uh Tom be given a lecture on free energy and anti-gravity I says oh okay things are starting to fall into place here and so I attended the lecture and was just blown away by it and you know after listening to Tom Bearden speak you think uh within a week or two you can build one of these devices um it it took me 20 years to put all the pieces together here so in 2022 is when I began lecturing about Tom bearden&#x27;s technology what exactly he was doing with this scaler wave you know because he spoke that there were even different types of scaler waves as well and I&#x27;ll get into this in the lecture okay so the next slide Tom Bearden quotes Okay now if you ever heard Tom Bearden speak and at the end of this video I give a lot of links uh Tom bearden&#x27;s videos here and one of the things he mentioned is that all matter is made of Trapped electrom magnetic energy and I&#x27;ll get into that later on what Tom meant by that okay because that was actually in some of the um uh physics videos YouTube videos that are out there and you can watch these videos because I include the links to them so all matters made of tra electromagnetic energy okay and then the second thing that Tom mentioned is that we cannot see the dimension of time why because we consider time to be in the fourth dimension okay but we know time exists because a lot of physicists out there want to say well time doesn&#x27;t exist at all and blah blah this and that well that&#x27;s not true okay because we know time exists because of space IAL displacement so Tom always spoke about that as well okay so the next slide I did some analysis here and I looked at the electric force versus the gravitational force okay and you&#x27;ll notice that you know the electric force and the Magnetic forces they&#x27;re they&#x27;re considered to be vectors directional vector vectors okay but the gravitational force is a bit of an oddball because it&#x27;s spatial okay it&#x27;s it&#x27;s everywhere and it&#x27;s considered to be a scaler okay it&#x27;s like time I I often say that gravity is time time is gravity okay and so when you do the analysis here you find out that the difference between the electric and the gravitational force is enormous okay absolutely enormous and so uh when you crunch out these numbers you know it&#x27;s 10^ the 42nd power times you know the gravitational force is the electric force 10^ the 402 power but what&#x27;s very important about this is that it&#x27;s not zero okay and that&#x27;s what caught a lot of physicists you know maybe 100 150 years ago and I&#x27;ll get into that here okay the gravitational force is not well we know it&#x27;s not zero okay so is there a link between electromagnetism and gravity and anti-gravity okay and personally I would say absolutely yes and so we see that the electric and magnetic fields are transverse Fields they&#x27;re considered to be transverse um fields in this case so we see the electron influenced by an electric field moves in a straight line okay the magnetic field moves the electron in a circular fashion and both are considered uh transverse wave functions okay but now we see that uh the electron is when it&#x27;s under Gravity a gravitational influence here Gravity is considered to be longitudinal okay which is that it&#x27;s acting in all directions it&#x27;s a scalar field or scalar function okay and when that field is gravitic know it&#x27;s acting as a gravity field or gravity well time becomes slower time starts to slow down okay that&#x27;s that delta T increases the time but when we work with anti-gravity which is what we do in this technology gravity acts in the other direction okay the scaler field it&#x27;s a longitudinal field but the electron becomes lighter okay and in this case here the time starts to tick faster all right and we see that with some experiments you know they they did this a number of years ago what back in the 40s or 50s um where they flew in a plane uh a clock and they observed that this clock would tick faster okay well this phenomena also occurs um in orbit which is why they have to correct these GPS satellites to compensate for the difference in gravity okay and of course I I developed uh you know some field equations that make that calculation and I call it natural relativity and I even wrote a book on it uh that goes into some of this detail so anyway here uh we see that gravity and anti-gravity they&#x27;re scal what we call scalar fields in other words they&#x27;re acting on matter or acting on mass in all directions okay same thing with time time is a scaler temperature is a scalar function so let&#x27;s go on to the next slide here Einstein Einstein tried to unify the field he wanted to find a connection between electrom magnetism and gravity he couldn&#x27;t do it he spent the rest of his life trying to find out the connection between the two he couldn&#x27;t do it and it&#x27;s called his unified field theory was of course a complete failure so I so even Einstein couldn&#x27;t figure it out okay but guess what modern science we discovered this connection and yes we call it scalar waves okay and we can produce this in the lab this is this is something that you can do on your test bench scalar waves okay so what what does Tom mean by scalar waves well they&#x27;re best described as anti-gravitational waves that have the property of being both time reversed and longitudinal those are two important quantities here now the time reversal part of this is generally done with Optics but guess what we can do it at very low frequencies okay in our in our test apparatus here okay and many other researchers did this as well okay like Floyd sweet uh Nicola Tesla uh Stanley Meyers uh they all produce this time reversed phenomena and it&#x27;s a longitudinal phenomena as well so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what the scaler waves are okay so next slide how to produce scaler waves well this is the common technique that every that I want to say that everyone uses who&#x27;s developing this technology okay so what you do is that you set up your field your magnetic field in this case equal they must be equal and opposite and they must resonate okay it must be a resonant condition here for the scalar wave term to appear and you can actually see this on your soloscope okay well how can you see it on your cillos scope where there&#x27;s two different types of waves okay that your technology produces so let&#x27;s go to the next slide here two types of scalar waves are produced simultaneously and this phenomena occurs with um uh all all the researchers that have worked in this field uh observe the same phenomena and what it is is time reversed em transverse waves this is what you see on your telescope okay and then the other wave scaler wave that&#x27;s produced is a Time reverse gravity wave okay or in this case anti-gravitational wave all right I want to emphasize that time reversed gravity wave okay in other words the device you&#x27;re working on will become lighter and weight okay so next slide now what what you see here uh Tom spoke quite a bit about in his uh lectures and this is what happens when you take these two charges and you oscillate them in in opposing configuration here and when you oscillate them like this it produces something called a zero vector and that&#x27;s very important here because you need to understand what the zero Vector is all about now this character here by the name of Oliver heavyside a brilliant mathematician came along and took the original Maxwell equations the original Maxwell electromagnetic equations and he simplified them okay he he simplified these equations such that the zero Vector has nothing in it it&#x27;s empty okay but when you look at the original maxal equations here the quartering solution James Maxwell included the scalar component in his calculations okay and that&#x27;s very important here because when you drive this system with a sine wave when you oscillate these fields okay and and and using a sine wave you get something that comes out of this which is the S squared term okay and again that&#x27;s very important the S squared term and so this is what you see on the oscilloscope okay you see this sin squar term on your oscilloscope and so with the sin squar term you get the zero Vector but Tom Bearden he called the zero Vector a vacuum engine okay because it has special content and this special content is that it produces a scalar anti-gravitational longitudinal wave in other words the device is not only essentially cancelling out the magnetomotive forces in your circuit but it&#x27;s also getting lighter um a researcher by the name of Floyd site and I think some some people out there are still carrying some of his information Floyd site built one of these devices that oscillated and canceled out the Magneto motive forces and the device became well what Tom said 90% lighter in its weight okay and that&#x27;s very important because weight is the mass acceleration effect and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing a decrease of all right so very important here uh the original Max equations you want to work with that scalar enery entity and that&#x27;s what you actually see on your osilloscope Okay so so what happens here you take your magical device you put it on a prof&#x27;s desk professor&#x27;s desk at some University he&#x27;s not going to have a clue how it works why because he&#x27;s working with the Oliver heavyside Vector Solutions where the zero Vector is empty there&#x27;s nothing there okay so he&#x27;s not going to have a clue how this device Works unless you go back to the original quat turny Maxwell solution here where you have the scalar term okay and you operate this device in resonance and I&#x27;ll get into that a little later here as well so it&#x27;s so your device is not only producing this scalar wave on your scope but device is also uh the zero Vector here is producing an anti-gravitational longitudinal wave that is of course anti-g gravitic you know it&#x27;s going to get lighter okay next slide here Oliver heavy site as I mentioned before simplified Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic equations back in the 1880s he did this and Tom likes to speak about this as well because it&#x27;s the major flaw and modern mainstream science because Oliver took out the gravitational component that was there in the original Maxell equations the gravity is gone and you can look at okay that the slide that I had there that I had up there previously showing the difference between the electric and the gravitational force 10 to the 402 power well alare came along and said well that could that&#x27;s zero and he said it&#x27;s mystical and should be murdered from the theory so he took out the scaler component okay and Tom bearden&#x27;s uh famous for quoting Oliver heavy sight threw the baby out with the bathwater in his formulations okay and then what I say is that this is the main reason why we don&#x27;t have star Tre Tre today okay simple as that simple as that we don&#x27;t have Star Trek why is that there&#x27;s no gravitational component that&#x27;s built in to the electromagnetics all right but since now we&#x27;re correcting the theory is that we put the scaler component back in and how do we know it&#x27;s there because we see it on our oscilloscope we see the sin squar term it&#x27;s there okay so the next slide how did determine resonance because I mentioned that the system has to operate in a resonant configuration okay so the output of your opposing coil configuration here and I use what I call the split flux Transformer I have my own patent on this and it&#x27;s connected up to a capacitor and then a resistive load so the whole system operates in resonance and when it does so you&#x27;ll observe a current minimum on your input your input current has a minimum input at resonance and this minimum input current can approach zero such that when you do the calculations on on the power for this device it can go way over Unity okay 100% doesn&#x27;t mean anything at this point you know everything is like governed uh well our power supply runs at 98% efficiency and that&#x27;s the best we&#x27;re ever going to do not true not true with these devices because when you set up these opposing Magneto motive forces in your circuit and you operate that in Residence you find out that your efficiency can go way over 100% and Floyd swe I think went over um something like 10 million per in his device 10 million per. that&#x27;s phenomenal okay and that&#x27;s all because of his minimum input current approaching zero okay so that&#x27;s a very important part of this next slide all right PCM resonators and this is what uh Tom ended up calling this because you have your output posing output coils uh driving a capacitor okay so part of your load here is a capacitor and he called it a pumped phase conjugate mirror okay is what happens here I ended up filing a patent back in 2020 um on this particular configuration here um and then Tom beardon lectured on this subject back in the 1990s okay so next slide PCM resonators it outputs a Time reversed transverse EM wave the output become more efficient and efficiencies can&#x27;t exceed 100% you&#x27;re no longer limited by the 100% barrier okay that&#x27;s like going beyond the speed of sound right you have to break the rules here to do it so here we exceed 100% efficiency because the signal is time reversed okay we&#x27;re working with a phase conjugate mirror setting up in a resonant situation here configuration the output device outputs an anti-gravitational wave as well okay the scalar waves okay decreases its own Mass acceleration effect the weight can become negative or less than zero okay next Slide the split flux Transformer okay this is what I have a patent on you can look up this patent okay I filed it back in 2015 we finally got it granted under the Trump Administration here uh I believe it was back in 2020 or so I&#x27;m the inventor of this Transformer and it consists of a primary coil Arrangement and then two secondary coils are set up in opposition one another okay and to get it to resonate that you hook it up to a capacitor and a resistive load okay so next slide PCM resonators here now Tom spoke about this but I&#x27;m going into far more detail what Tom was speaking about okay because Tom spoke about a four-way mixing process that occurs in this device so what you have top and bottom Wave 1 and wave two uh that&#x27;s your input sine waves okay so if we go back let&#x27;s go back a couple of slides here so for wave 1 and wave two right here is that we see the opposing forces on the secondary output okay and that&#x27;s driven by these two coils L2 and L3 and that&#x27;s set sets up your PCM okay so if we go back to this slide here um now this detail here also shows wave three which is really the the result of wave 1 and wave two and that produces your s squared term okay and wave four is your output wave form and wave four output you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s magnified okay it&#x27;s a magnified output and it&#x27;s s squared and that&#x27;s what a s squared wave looks that&#x27;s what a scaler wave on your scope would look like okay next slide here so when we look at the output the input and output of a PCM we see the small W3 waveform on the input and a large W4 uh waveform on the output and so there&#x27;s some gain here it produces a gain function you know it&#x27;s a Time reversed EM wave that you see and what&#x27;s curious about this well why does it increase the efficiency of your output because it&#x27;s time reversed okay obviously right it&#x27;s a Time reversed wave and it increases the efficiency of your output and that efficiency can become quite large okay um I would say uh that uh Floyd sweet for example had something like a 10 million per increase in his wave function okay and that&#x27;s because the input is so low okay the history of opposing Magneto motor forces well we have to include Nicola Tesla here with his magnifying generator so what did Nicola do well you&#x27;ll see his M coils here set up in opposing configuration will create this phenomena he has two output capacitors and that&#x27;s driving a Transformer output okay so it&#x27;s a scaler wave generator is what he&#x27;s doing here so he&#x27;s me and he called it a magnifying generator which is what we&#x27;re seeing here it decreases the input power and then increases the output power okay so he calls it his magnifying generator you can look up this patent it&#x27;s out there uh he did this back in 1896 so we have to include Nicola as the probably a Pioneer with the scaler wave okay you know and his tower that he built out there in h Colorado and this is the electrical diagram of what Nicola Tesla was doing okay um you&#x27;ll see the generator up there at the top driving two coils labeled M and that of course is driving his uh capacitor Network here um and in turn here driving his output Transformer okay so this is what I think Nicola Tesla was doing with his scaler wave system so next slide now here&#x27;s a very curious inventor by the name of Stanley Meyer and we know from um at Tesla Tech here uh this Max Miller gave a lecture I don&#x27;t know about maybe five years five or six years ago replicating all of Stanley Meyer&#x27;s work and he observed the same phenomena that Stanley observed and his technology and of course you&#x27;ll see the opposing coil configuration here okay which is labeled hold 71 and 61 the output and we&#x27;ll get to that in a minute uh on some of the details here but the objective for Stanley Meyers and his water car is to burn water not gasoline and guess what that would really clean up the environment wouldn&#x27;t it burning water instead of gasoline no hydrocarbons just water okay and there&#x27;s is patent you can look this up for more details here so next slide okay this is what Stanley Meers was doing with this Transformer very important here because he&#x27;s setting up his opposing Magneto motive forces on his output which drives what&#x27;s called a water capacitor okay it drives a water capacitor on his output and what is a water capacitor well it&#x27;s just a couple of plates and using water as a dialectric material okay and so what he&#x27;s doing is creating what&#x27;s called Brown&#x27;s gas and I want to emphasize that Brown&#x27;s gas because you&#x27;ll find that with u Brown and he&#x27;s credited with naming Brown&#x27;s gas and and what we&#x27;re doing here we&#x27;re not separating hydrogen from oxygen we&#x27;re not doing that here okay because you put that in separate tanks and then you burn that as fuel as Rocket Fuel okay we&#x27;re not doing that what we&#x27;re doing instead is creating what&#x27;s called a hydroxy gas and includes both hydrogen and oxygen and in these bubbles okay and so Stanley took these Bubbles and fed it into his carburation system and that&#x27;s what he used as fuel you can actually burn this hydrogen oxygen solution this hydroxy gas as fuel and we&#x27;ll get into that here next slide so what is water fuel what is this stuff that Stanley was producing as well as uh U Brown um this HHO Gas Browns gas um it&#x27;s hydroxy gas oxyhydrogen gas it goes by several names and it&#x27;s highly flammable okay the other curious thing about it is that the gas Burns cold it doesn&#x27;t burn super hot and it burns at a temperature of 266 de F or 130° Cen but it can vaporize tungsten all right which can melt at over 10,000 degrees fahit okay so the flame is actually an electric flame okay very curious thing and so the objective here is of course burn water not gasoline and of course there&#x27;s a book out on it more King wrote a book uh the key to new energy and I know it&#x27;s available on Steve swick&#x27;s website okay and it goes into a lot of detail on his Browns gas so I would call it fuel of the future you can replace gasoline with it okay so rather than burning gasoline you burn this uh this water this hydroxy gas and that&#x27;s a project I want to work on as well so next slide and there&#x27;s this apparatus here you can buy this off the Internet it&#x27;s an HHO Browns gas water torch okay you can buy this I I believe it&#x27;s made in China well of course everything is that&#x27;s the way everything is set up here it&#x27;s all made in China um so you can buy this water torch and burn water okay because it makes the gas now in this case here you have to use a catalyst okay you see that power supplying the back that&#x27;s generating a DC Supply which is um uh turning this water it&#x27;s a water solution okay that they use I believe they mix it in with um um poach uh gets mixed as a solution here and so you have to pass a high current it&#x27;s like 30 amps or so see with our Tech what we want to do is minimize that power as much as possible okay so we want to use scalar power this is what Stanley did okay and U we want to use scalar power input to make this gas and you don&#x27;t need to use a catalyst you can use straight distilled water as your fuel source okay so next slide now here&#x27;s something very interesting I ran across um oh I would say uh maybe a year or two ago this video you see the link at the top you can watch this video and it&#x27;s called relativistic Quantum field Theory and when I saw this I I was just shocked I was just shocked because you see particles with mass on the left side of the equation and what what do you see you see the sign squared term that frequency minimum you make that a sign your sine wave input and you square it well what is that lo and behold that&#x27;s our scalar wave so it&#x27;s the scalar wave that is producing um gravity okay it&#x27;s particles with mass so there it is what Tom beron said matter is made of Trapped electromagnetic energy there it is right there in the field equations on the right you see what what is that equation for a photon some something that&#x27;s massless where you set it equal to zero there&#x27;s a photon has no Mass very well known in physics but on the left you know you take your particles right right electrons protons neutrons you know they all have mass right well they&#x27;re made of what scalar waves there it is there&#x27;s your s squar term so let&#x27;s move on next slide okay the scaler wave test bench this is what a any scalar wave scientist must have a SC Galer wave test bench okay so there&#x27;s your power supply on the right I recommend these GW instc uh Power Supplies they&#x27;re very good you can vary the ac voltage on them uh through a whole range whole range of voltages and they&#x27;re V and they&#x27;re available in various outputs uh you can get this from newwork electronics and it&#x27;s the perfect power supply for driving your uh scaler wave device so in this case I&#x27;m using my split flux Transformer capacitor Arrangement driving a load resistor and there up there on the screen you see some very interesting software and so what I do is I hook up all the meters to this to this test bench so I&#x27;m looking at all the voltages coming in coming out looking at all the currents coming in coming out and looking at the phase relationships okay between uh all these wave functions that&#x27;s being generated here and I highly recommend this scope it&#x27;s an old scope okay um I think Newark is still carrying them they&#x27;re available I think through newor uh it&#x27;s the tectronics uh 2024b and what&#x27;s so uh important about this particular scope is that it&#x27;s isolated Channel you need to use a scope that has isolated channels okay because you don&#x27;t want a common ground going on here it just short out everything so use isolated um uh scope and I I I take all my measurements here and I wrote software that reads the scope okay that reads all these uh voltages and currents so my software interrogates the scope and gets the readings and displays everything there okay so you&#x27;re looking at all your phase relationships and power this and that coming in and out and the one thing that I noticed next slide here and I call the transform efficiency calculator it&#x27;s what the software is and it&#x27;s available on my website okay you can download it on my website and and it works with this scope and these are the waveforms I have an old version of mathcad that does the job perfectly here uh look at the input waveform here that&#x27;s your sine wave input uh the output is of course is scalar waveform which appears at resonance okay that&#x27;s your s squared term now of course you can&#x27;t see this directly and the reason why is that the scope will add these two waveforms together and give you the third waveform on the bottom this is what you see on your scope Trace is the waveform on the bottom it&#x27;s a summation of your input and scalar waveform okay so if you have some technology there that can subtract out the input waveform the scalar waveform is what you see okay that your sin squar term all right so um this is what you see uh if you have a scope and of course I have my 2024b tectronic scope this is what you see on the output you see the uh trace on the bottom there the yellow Trace that your input waveform uh and you see this sign plus the sin squared term okay okay now when you do your AC circuit analysis this is what you want to do okay you have your input on the left generating your sine wave and then on the output you have your resistive load okay and you&#x27;re looking at these various phase relationships here and so the device under test what generally called the dot device under test um that&#x27;s your Transformer capacitor Arrangement okay and so uh with these various resistive loads uh when you go and calculate power which is what my software does uh calculates power looks at the the phase relationships here and computes the cop which is the ratio of input and out output power okay so efficiency equals the cop time 100% that&#x27;s generally less than 100% with conventional power supplies okay so next slide here and lo behold when I test my Transformer I get an efficiency of almost 90% which is very interesting because this typical efficiency on Transformers are generally between 70 and 80% efficient so most of your um electric energy is of course converted into heat and this is why you&#x27;re below 100% okay so in this case here the efficiency has gone up and this is how you know you&#x27;re working with the time reversed wave because that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s going to do increase the efficiency of your uh test apparatus here okay so when you build these opposing Magneto motive Force transformers this is what&#x27;s going to happen your efficiency is going to go up because you&#x27;re generating this time reverse scaler wave okay the device is going to become lighter now of course you can put this on a a very delicate beam balance okay to see if your device is losing weight and as long as this scalar wave term here is time reversed it&#x27;s of course going to Output a Time reversed gravity wave or an anti-gravitational wave as well okay so next slide okay um Transformer efficiency calculator this is what it this is what it&#x27;s doing these are all the various calculators ations uh that&#x27;s being done here and of course um you know you&#x27;re looking at voltages and currents looking at phasing uh between the two um there&#x27;s a lot of cosign operations going on here advanced mathematics so um you&#x27;re also looking at Power looking at Power calculations Computing the efficiency of the system and that&#x27;s hard actually hard to do here because you have to work with that sign squared term okay that kind of I would say throws kind of throws a little monkey into the wrench here okay and into this calculation but nevertheless it manages and and you can see the efficiency going up and that&#x27;s the important thing okay is that the efficiency of your device goes up and that&#x27;s how you know you&#x27;re producing time reverse phenomena and producing an anti-gravitational wave okay next slide um these are various slides that I captured uh in my software and um I just download them to the clipboard and then print them out on a printer okay so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s one of the key features of my software that it captures uh the input and output all right so well what&#x27;s Tom doing here well Tom I think Tom held back on a lot of his material and what did he h held back from well he wanted a big DARPA contract okay the man wanted a big DARPA contract and it never happened but he wanted to um give the military all his SE Secrets all is scaler wave interferometry defense applications okay and what&#x27;s so interesting about the scaler wave interferometry and Tom spoke about this in his lectures you know and light detailed but nevertheless he spoke about it as a defense application where he uses two groundbased scaler wave emitters okay and the region where these beams cross okay with the beams where they cross generates a region of space that is highly electromagnetic okay and it can destroy Electronics in that Target Zone where the beans cross and so here&#x27;s the scaler wave interferometry what is Tom speaking about here well you can see the scaler waves okay and how they construct and deconstruct where they cross you can either create a virtual ground or you can create a huge electromagnetic potential and that&#x27;ll fry your electronics okay guaranteed so next slide and then here&#x27;s the scaler wave interferometry again you have two scaler wave emitters one generates the virtual ground the other one generates the high potential um the region of course you point it at your uh enemy here that&#x27;s coming into range and uh fry their Electronics yeah that&#x27;s what it does next slide all right well I came across this researcher here by the name of Boyd Bushman and and I come to understand he does have some patents out there and so boy described this fascinating experiment that anyone can do okay uh with magnets and he described this in a video uh that Tom uh that um David Sera made uh from here to androma I believe it&#x27;s it&#x27;s called and he has a segment here with Boyd Bushman describing this experiment and a drop test he did at Lockheed you know he&#x27;s a lock he was a Lo he passed away several years ago but he left behind this um this description of a an experiment he did that what it did is changed the mass acceleration effect okay and what did he do well he sets up opposing magnetic fields well isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re doing in our scaler wave system of course it is we&#x27;re setting up an opposing magnetic field in our technology here well Boyd did the same thing except he used neodymium magnets and he forced these magnets together and he describes it as bolting them together kind of wrapping it up making it look like a rock with electrical tape and he has his other test Rock and he drops it down An Elevator Shaft at uh Lockheed where he worked and so what he observed is that the opposing magnetic fields generated this anti-gravity field wasn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re talking about here with the scaler field this anti-gravity uh mechanism that&#x27;s involved there he observed a decrease in the mass acceleration effect in other words The Rock fell slower than than your test rock well we know that that that doesn&#x27;t happen with any kind of material I mean didn&#x27;t they show that on the moon okay one of the astronauts had a feather and a hammer and then he dropped the two on the moon&#x27;s surface and they both fell at the same rate okay but in this case we don&#x27;t see see that we don&#x27;t see that effect so magnets while producing a magnetic field bends SpaceTime and in this case generates an anti-gravitational field using magnets in the opposing configuration so what did Boyd do what what exactly did he do here let&#x27;s go to the next slide well this is the experiment that I replicated okay cuz cuz I&#x27;m I replicated his drop test okay I did this in Sedona at the life at Sedona Life Center my helper up there at the top and on my queue he would drop uh the magnet and the Rocks okay the magnets in the opposing configuration and I videotaped it and I did make a video of this and you can actually see about a foot maybe a foot and a half difference between the rock okay and the opposing magnetic field okay and then thinking about this I said well okay what let&#x27;s use some magnets in the attractive configuration and what does that do well guess what it would increase the mass acceleration effect okay in other words the attractive config configuration would fall faster than nck okay and we&#x27;ll get into this a little later in this lecture here on what that means okay so so so these magnets and attractive configuration would fall faster but the magnets in the opposing configuration would fall slower okay and so I successfully replicated boy Bushman anyone can do this okay anyone can do this test and I show exactly how to do it here there&#x27;s my test jig okay this the drop test it shows shows the test jig here on the right magnets on the left here and there&#x27;s two magnets here and they&#x27;re set up in their posing configuration okay and I just um epoxy them together using JP weld works great okay so there&#x27;s the test jig and I&#x27;m making my magnet assembly in opposing configuration there&#x27;s the test jig and the magnet assembly there is at the bottom shows it in a North North configuration here epoxy together and there&#x27;s the assembly the two magnets epoxy together and there&#x27;s a ordinary rock well they have lots of these in Arizona you can go to any yard and pick up a rock that&#x27;s your test subject there so there&#x27;s your test subject in the center there uh ordinary Rock wrapped up in electrical tape I put a White Band on it so it shows up in video on the right shows your opposing magnets on the left magnets in the attractive configuration okay and there&#x27;s the test that I ran I did videotape this I observed that the magnets in opposing configuration fell slower the attractive configuration they fell faster than the rock control rock so what is all this mean what you know what is the point of all this well this fellow came along what about 20 years ago and published a paper El cubber wrote a paper on warp drive technology well guess what we can build a warp drive using magnets okay and the opposing configuration and the attractive configuration because they Bend space time as well theyit a scalar field the opposing configuration anti-g gravitic okay the field on the left is gravitic they both emit longitudinal Fields okay so you can build a warp drive with this and so I came up with this diagram here the ABA that&#x27;s the Alec Bushman Elber warp drive engine propulsion technology okay shows how it warps space on the right there top right you see the the engine okay the direction of motion on the bottom right you see hey doesn&#x27;t that look like Star Trek well lo and behold you know when you um I was fortunate enough to um uh meet someone who uh knew someone all right in the LA area back in the 1960s he was a channel for extraterrestrials and they spoke about this kind of Technology oh yeah this is how the writers came up with Star Trek Back in the 19 60s by going to a week it wasn&#x27;t a weekly it was I believe it was a monthly meeting it was called Mind m n d by jacqu dubier he was a channel for extraterrestrials and he spoke to these writers that attended the meeting how to do Star Trek fascinating huh well this is how you do it you see the double nay Sals on the on the right bottom right of the craft okay and they spin and counter configuration here they counter rotate that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s the P Factor effect that you have with airplanes okay why they counter rotate as well the propeller effect or the P Factor effect here so that&#x27;s what you have these spinning magnetic fields that bend SpaceTime okay generating a warp field okay and this is how you do it using magnets or magnet technology and you spin these when you spin these magnets it amplifies the field the Field Effect they call that the Barnet effect okay so next slide I&#x27;m not anti-gravity but our technology is I thought this was a a cute little thing that I have here there&#x27;s my card this is how you reach me and lecture references I suggest everyone check up these references there was a movie on time reversal called tenant came out um I think a few years ago played in theaters and it involves time reverse technology okay and then here&#x27;s bearden&#x27;s psychotronics lecture I suggest uh you see that um evolving ideas U involving Tom bearden&#x27;s research great interviews here another psychotronics lecture here&#x27;s one on scaler physics I recommend this video here it&#x27;s the future of electromagnetics is scaler physics okay and of course um my interview a previous interview here with Steve elwick uh here&#x27;s the Boyd Bushman drop test experiment okay so you can go to YouTube and watch that and that concludes my presentation so this is uh how to reach me here and uh that&#x27;s the show Steve Well if everyone wants to give a hand just um hit that thumbs up there it does right and uh all right so I go into a lot of detail here next year I want to at your conference I do want to uh go into more detail here okay well I&#x27;ll be looking forward to uh seeing you at the conference um I want take that as a moment to remind people to get their call for papers in I need the ascts by November 30th so I can try to uh get this U program done earlier you know and really try to boost our attendance you know these conferences are very important I don&#x27;t think people realize how important they are especially now especially now but our conferences uh helps develop a sense of community the problem that we have in this field um is that there&#x27;s no sense of community uh I mean they have these uh a zoom conferences and everything but you really don&#x27;t have a sense of community unless you&#x27;re actually there physically and can meet people you know I was watching some uh some uh music videos today and U and I I used to be in the military you know and and boy it just brought back a lot of memories you know like when I was in the mil military we were all there and we had a sense of community you know when I go to these conferences uh I have a sense of community with those who I see at these conferences over and over and over again you know you know it&#x27;s like a family reunion you know you get to meet people there and break bread with them and you just don&#x27;t get that through zoom and and you don&#x27;t get to PE talk to people off the records you know uh in private everything has to be on camera these days you know there&#x27;s no sense of privacy and it makes it really hard to share you know um so I want to encourage everyone to come to our conference next year uh it&#x27;s going to be um again it&#x27;s going to be August U 7th to 11th you know in Albuquerque most likely at the Crown Plaza um one of the reasons I use the Crown Plaza is because we get such great Hotel rates there I mean uh you&#x27;re in the 80s you know $80 a night roughly and that includes breakfast and you don&#x27;t get that anywhere else you know I mean you go I&#x27;m looking at possibly going to this conference in Flag Staff maybe this week you know D&#x27;s conference uh the conference site wants $160 a night you know and there&#x27;s no way uh I I could do that you [Music] know and a lot of people just can&#x27;t know it&#x27;s just too much you know so um we we keep everyone&#x27;s cost and we also have something to eat every night you know where we can sit down and uh talk to people uh and uh and learn learn stuff that you&#x27;re not going to learn anywhere else you&#x27;re not g to see it on the video because it&#x27;s a dinner and everything so yeah and you get to meet people and become friends so anyway um here&#x27;s um a question here let me get off of here okay you discussed a weaponization of scway I have to ask you about the opposite can you discuss the marvelous health benefits oh okay yeah we developed a pad okay when you set up these opposing Fields these magnets we created a pad that uh has has has an array of four of these um opposing magnets okay and you put the pad on your back here and it takes away the pain of driving long distances it&#x27;s great it&#x27;s fantastic and so uh we started making up some of these pads uh for people okay so the health benefits are rather interesting uh with the scaler wave it accelerates plant growth that&#x27;s one of the things that we did we did testing uh with one of these magnets um we placed it at a base of a plant and the plant just grew I mean healthy it was a healthy plant so um I would say there&#x27;s incredible health benefits uh with with the scaler wave and another researcher that comes to your conference as well um is with the uh um I forget his name um uh but he presents at your conference but he has those gas generators okay can breathe in yeah Weissman George Weissman okay has those gas you can breathe in that gas okay and uh there&#x27;s some health benefits from that as well and and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s been a speaker a lot too and uh if you go to our program from last year beond next year uh there&#x27;ll be like a link to his website for the hydrogen app okay can you talk about the reverse flyback votage regarding any of Baron&#x27;s work or others um as far as I know this doesn&#x27;t use a flyback configuration okay a flyback Transformer you just use you just set up your ordinary Transformers but they have to be the output coils have to be to generate an opposing magnetomotive Force okay in your magnetic material and when when they do that and then they resonate okay with an output capacitor is where you see that scalar wave function manifest okay and that&#x27;s where your input current starts to really drop and so you see these huge efficiencies in your device okay because the uh input current is dropping and this is what uh Floyd sweet saw on his device you know he had something like 10 million perc so he can go well over 100% the 100% barrier is no longer a barrier okay with this kind of technology so you want to set up opposing Magneto motive forces on your output of your device okay to create the scalar function and it&#x27;s time reversed as well okay and produces the anti-gravitational effect so I hope that kind of answers that question there because I know some researchers have used flyback Transformer configurations in the past um but they&#x27;re using it uh one device used um a flyback configuration that drove a fluorescent tube okay and the fluorescence has an interesting property the um uses a mercury vapor inside of inside of these fluoresent tubes and that mercury vapor has some interesting properties associated with it that is um a negative resistance there&#x27;s a negative resistance associated with that so um uh there&#x27;s some technology uh that I saw a number of years ago that uh that used to flyback in that kind of configuration but here we&#x27;re just using regular Transformers but the Transformers are set up in a supposing configuration okay and then here&#x27;s a comment about beard briefly discuss if our ultimate health benefits in one of his books I believe that books was back in 1986 and was um a biological warfare uhuh and also here&#x27;s another question for you are these devices mostly pulse DC uh they can be okay it has to be pulse something or other or an AC wave because that&#x27;s how Transformers work okay they have to oscillate they have to have a changing field okay to produce uh an output so it can be p DC like in Stanley Meyers technology um I think we&#x27;re using square waves um or it could be um a sine wave but yes um uh you can use pulse DC okay here&#x27;s another one re mention to send energy to an area you must have a higher potential to the Target area to draw energy out of a Target you must have a potential or how do you determine the potential oh uh it&#x27;s due to the phasing of the scaler waves okay you changed the phasing okay so if the phases um in opposing uh configuration here you get a cancellation of the field and you can generate what&#x27;s called a virtual ground okay but if they&#x27;re shifted 180 degrees then the waves will add okay and that&#x27;s what I show in the in the video here uh in in the uh in the conference is how you adjust the phasing to add or subtract okay okay well with that I&#x27;m GNA kind of bring everything to a close here um and uh I&#x27;ll be looking forward to seeing you there in um Albuquerque and I hope I of our um people who&#x27;s watching this will will come and uh and don&#x27;t keep us to yourself the other people know about us you know we don&#x27;t want to be the best kept secret in science you have a great night and I&#x27;ll see you next week okay thanks Steve thank you</p>
