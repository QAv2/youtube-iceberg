            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel and we triy to look at um some great theories of everything that can help you in your life to uh navigate every situation and possibly replace your old Paradigm um and um be able to see things holistically so today is our 360th video on dwey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory Mr Larsson was born in 1898 and um served in World War I and uh went to college out in Oregon he was born in North Dakota and stayed out in Oregon became a mining engineer and around 1930 he had uh a few epiphanies about um different uh some chemistry problems that he was working on trying to kind of make a contribution to the field and uh end up uh getting more than he bargained for he was just looking for some minor Innovations and he ended up with this huge revolutionary um idea that would um turn everything upside down and uh he answered the call and he pursued um you know his findings and eventually uh way uh in the future about 1959 he published his two fundamental postulates and these are the two postulates that he used to drive a theoretical universe but so if my postulates are correct this is how the universe would work and then he eventually in his books more or less compared his fund his theoretical Universe with the uh universe that the Legacy scientists had discovered uh through their observations and measurements and um usually had a pretty close match uh to the uh most modern findings um but especially in terms of the Newtonian mechanics and um then um not so much in terms of the einsteinian relativistic stuff um and so Larsson ended up writing a book that was called Beyond Newton he saw his um advances kind of proceeding from Newton and um not from Einstein and uh we will look into that a little bit here today because we&#x27;re looking at a paper that was written by one of Larson&#x27;s followers Dr Bruce pet called the Loren factor and this is one of the mathematical solutions that Einstein used to figure out the um kind of the shrinkage of time that occurs at very uh High velocities um but first uh we&#x27;ll go back to Larson&#x27;s fundamental postulates his first postulate is uh by far more important um and it is that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion not matter not energy not even Force but motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so um and then the second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian now uh Larson did get some push back for his second postulate from Dr pet especially uh in terms of using ukian geometry instead of Pet&#x27;s U he favored uh using projective geometry of which ukian geometry is just a subset so it&#x27;s not an outright you know disagree it&#x27;s just kind of expanding the um the scope of the geometry yes ukian geometry is correct but uh it&#x27;s not only ukian geometry there are other um subsets other aspects of projective geometry that also need to be included uh it particularly it&#x27;s like a geometrical Cascade from projective geometry to aine Geometry to metric geometry then to ukian Geometry as the most um specific kind uh paret also rejected the concept of commutative mathematics and of primary magnitudes so he got rid of that that part in the uh second postulate but the first postulate is where um you know the um more important aspects are the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time basically motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator such as speed speed is you know the the bicycle is moving at 15 miles hour 15 miles of space in 1 hour of time space over time is speed and you can see that there is a reciprocal relationship going on there if you try to double the speed you could say instead of saying 15 miles an hour you can then you can say the bicycle is moving 30 mil hour or you can say the bicycle is moving 15 miles per half hour you can either multiply the space or you can divide the time that is the Hallmark of a reciprocal another thing about a reciprocal is that both uh entities have the same qualities whatever qualities adhere to one also adhere to the other like three and 1/3 3 over one and 1 over three they both have the same numbers but they are inverted and they both multiply to make one you multiply them together and you get one so those are some things about reciprocals that uh help out when um trying to uh kind of unpack larsson&#x27;s Theory so he says that the uh universe is composed entirely of motion in three dimensions this is what he calls coordinate space and coordinate time coordinate space we&#x27;re accustomed to that idea XYZ coordinates in space or volume and um you know we&#x27;re accustomed to thinking of things being in 3D uh but in time not so much but since these qualities um you know apply when you&#x27;re talking about space by definition they also apply when you&#x27;re talking about time that&#x27;s what Larson calls coordinate time and then um we have this concept of a progression Larson refers to that as clock time and clock space the thing that we can notice the most about time uh from our vantage point is that time is continually progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later and later and um but in no specific Direction so to then we would um we would uh be able to uh posit that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no specific direction and you would use something like a a balloon with dots on it to model this if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other um but in no specific Direction the farther away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other and this this was actually observed by the Hubble telescope uh determining that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other so this is a motion that somehow um exists um in the universe but it has never been uh actually recognized in its importance until Larson came along it&#x27;s what you call scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but has no specific dire Direction and um Larson took the scalar motion and he placed it at the center of his fundamental Theory his fundamental postulates um now I&#x27;m not sure why he didn&#x27;t use the actual term scalar Motion in his first postulate the universe is composed entirely of one component scalar motion existing in three dimensions um in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time now the um but that for Larson is clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart then we have the discrete units part space and time come only and and motion um come only in discrete units you have to have a full unit of space in order to have space and you have to have a full unit of time in order to have time now when you&#x27;re saying have space or have time you&#x27;re kind of you&#x27;re abstracting um you&#x27;re you&#x27;re seeing one separate from the other but that&#x27;s not really true space and time do not exist independently they only exist together in motion they only exist you have to have uh really both and so motion is either time over space or space over time and it can be in multiple Dimensions depending on the scientific units you&#x27;re talking about which is a great check for Larson system you know uh checking the units based on their space-time coordinates speed as space over time energy time over space um acceleration space over time to the second power force time over space to the second power matter turns out to be time to the 3 power over space to the thir power and you can plug these into your all your classical equations make sure that the units come out correctly um this is a much more um usable system than the MKS system which uses mass and then um time and then space U Mass is what confuses the whole system but if you only have two components um you can make much greater Headway anyway space and time uh have only discrete units if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light Larson refers to the speed of light as unit speed 1/ 1 equal 1 and this unit speed is really the one that uh reciprocals multiply out to um so uh this one is really the center or the zero point the null point the state of rest the origin The Ether of the universe of motion the universe of motion the makes sense that the first thing uh the primary thing um is motion outward at the speed of light in all directions that is what LaRon refers to as the progression of the natural reference system and this is omnipresent it&#x27;s always there um and it is viewed by us as complete nothingness or featureless uniformity and in order to H have actual phenomena you have to have displacement from that speed of light uh boundary the speed of light is a boundary between two different sectors of the universe which Larson refers to as the material sector that sector that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light and the cosmic sector that sector that is moving faster than the speed of light and again to show the reciprocal aspect if you cross over from the material sector to the cosmic sector you have to invert your space-time relationships so in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and you have clock time progressing time always getting later and later and later if you cross that speed of light boundary then you and you move into the cosmic section then you discover that you have coordinate time three dimensions of time and you have clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart this is something that we&#x27;re not accustomed to um you know uh viewing the universe that way but it is uh consistent reciprocally okay now uh let&#x27;s try to get to this paper here uh RS 2108 from Bruce pet it&#x27;s called the Loren Factor H this is a paper that he wrote back in 2015 the Loren factor is the name of the factor by which time length and relativistic mass change for an object while that object is moving and is often written uh with a gamma this number is determined by the object speed in the following way and uh you get uh the square root y or gamma equals the square root of uh the quantity 1 minus uh velocity squared over the speed of light squared um that whole quantity is is in the square root the square root of the quantity 1 minus v^2 velocity squar over the speed of light squar where V is the speed of the object um and C is the speed of light expressed in the same units as your speed the quantity V over C is often labeled with beta and so the above equation can be uh Rewritten as uh the Square t of um one the quantity 1- beta SAR let&#x27;s examine the Lorent equa equation to see what it is actually describing in the reciprocal system the speed of light C is Unity 1.0 in natural units of space and time one unit of space per one unit of time conventional science uses man-made units socalled that are derived by some kind of consensus for example the meter meaning measure was defined as 1 10 millionth of the distance between the North Pole and the equator for the most part conventional units are arbitrary however the reciprocal systems natural units are a consequence of the structure of nature inherent in everything starting with the velocity component the factor V over C is simply normalization to Unity much like converting a range of values to percentages since the value of C is 1.0 in the reciprocal system the Velocity in natural units is already normalized and this can just be reduced to V making the concept of beta unnecessary as beta represents the same consequence for arbitrary units we now have a normalized system of 1us uh 1 - v^ 2 now I think it&#x27;s the square root of that square root of 1us V ^2 knowing that Unity is the speed of light this part of the equation is actually saying that c minus uh v^2 in natural units because Cal 1 um C * n = 1 and N can have any value so this part of the equation is actually um uh I I think there&#x27;s a word missing there sorry but when the [Music] square root function is considered it becomes apparent that Nal 2 and this Loren factor is nothing more than the disguised equation of a right triangle that has been adjusted to express the speed of light as a unit hypotenuse so the long end of a right triangle is the one and then the two sides of the triangle are um you know x^2 + y^2 if you&#x27;re using the Pythagorean theorem so um so he&#x27;s saying here um gamma 2 = c^ 2us V ^ 2 and um then um the speed of light squared equals gamma 2ar + V ^2 c^2 equal gamma 2 + V ^2 because c = 1 uh time reading it anyway alas science also tends to overlook one of the more interesting properties of the square root that the function returns two solutions a positive one and a negative one because when you multiply two negative numbers you also get a positive number so if you&#x27;re looking to get uh for example the uh square root of one you can have one or you can have negative 1 or the square root of four you can have two or you can have -2 the negative one is ignored though the absolute value is never included in the lorence equation because it would indicate that time length and relativistic mass would also be negative but if you consider both Solutions simultaneously then a bigger problem arises they cancel each other out and you end up with the classic division by zero problem that allows you to do things like proving that 2 equals 1 so don&#x27;t mention it and hope nobody notices one should also know note that the equation for a right triangle is also the equation of a circle where R is the radius because r = c equal 1 this is a unit circle with the velocity on the X AIS um so that would be like the cosine and the Lorent Factor being the cor uh corresponding value on the Y AIS uh or this that would be the cosine by plotting um gamma no by plotting v um as the x axis and then or the X and 1 over gamma as the Y in its entirety the reciprocal relationship becomes clearer what immediately stands out is that a velocity can drop all the way to minus one the speed of light running backwards that may sound a bit strange but once identified in conventional terms it is very very familiar concept now just remember when you have uh you go back to your expanding uh balloon with dots on it model um when you&#x27;re blowing up the [Music] balloon uh the model is basically that uh blowing up the you&#x27;re blowing up the balloon at the speed of light all of the um all of the dots are moving away from each other um and that is what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system and um but you can have the negative of that of what you would call the reciprocal of that which is if you sucked in the balloon if you suck in the balloon all of the dots are moving moving toward each other and that is the phenomenon that we call gravity gravity is when all of the dots it&#x27;s a scalar motion of the dots moving toward each other uh we make the mistake of thinking of gravity as being somewhat of a of a field where one dot is moving toward another dot um but that conception of gravity relies Upon Us assigning a reference point to one of the dots if we decide that one of the dots is motionless uh arbitrarily then we can start assigning uh directions to the Motions of the other dots uh in in relation to that non-moving dot so uh that&#x27;s where we get these erroneous concepts of gravitational fields um but but uh gravity gravity in larsson&#x27;s uh concept is a scalar motion and it&#x27;s not a motion of any uh body moving to any other body it&#x27;s a movement of all bodies toward all other Bodies Okay so um he has a figure here the reciprocal system the speed of light unit speed is the fulcrum between Motion in space and motion in time um or the boundary between Motion in space and motion in time as such it is the upper limit of both of these motions so I guess that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s using uh fulum because uh he&#x27;s using the term Motion in space and motion in time well the motion in space is speed but the motion in time is energy and so um Motion in space increases up until it gets to one the speed of light and then we generally think of then the motion is going when it goes beyond the speed of light it&#x27;s greater than the speed of light the speed is greater than the speed of light but but Motion in time is measured in energy and so motion um energy is starts at zero and it maxes out at one at the speed of light so because it&#x27;s reciprocal of speed time over space as opposed to space over time so that one that speed of light is actually the maximum speed in either sector because uh speed goes from 0 to one and energy goes from 0 to one so as such it is the upper limit of both of these motions essentially being the maximum speed of the universe which is referred to as the progression of the natural reference system so if you look at it that way then Einstein is more or less he correct saying that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe but that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re like equating speed with energy um but energy is actually inverse speed okay I think we&#x27;re going to leave it right there for today and we will resume this paper tomorrow um when we start up uh let&#x27;s see um yeah this paper will take a few days to get through uh well maybe two more days um it&#x27;s interesting approach I haven&#x27;t quite gotten my head around using a unit circle and using a um right triangle to map out the Lorent uh contraction but um I&#x27;m going to sleep on it and uh see if I can um kind of sus it out in my head and uh understand it that&#x27;s what I encourage you to do as well to just um Let It wash over you don&#x27;t reject anything out of hand just because it&#x27;s an unfamiliar concept or something you haven&#x27;t thought about before something that disagrees with what you already know what you already quote know and um you know that&#x27;s the way that you learn the reciprocal system is by not um suspending disbelief and um recognizing that you&#x27;re dealing with an entirely new paradigm and that it&#x27;s very easy to reject it with the circular reasoning of your old Paradigm but if you are really being uh honest with the truth uh just take it in and say well I don&#x27;t really have the the uh capabilities of of evaluating this quite yet I need to see more I need to have a bigger picture a big a clearer picture before I can actually reject this okay thanks for tuning in today have a great night</p>
