            <p>my fellow Americans our nation is in crisis we have an extreme debt problem our nation&#x27;s population is booming and climate change is threatening our planet&#x27;s way of life we luckily we here at Novak Energy Research division are committed to finding you a solution my name is Jackie umlet and I believe I run liquid mercury through a gyroscope at several RPM rotations per minute the mechanism will begin to float it will also begin to Glow but that&#x27;s not really important and not why we&#x27;re speaking here the energy to create it could could be harnessed and used for various utilities by implementing this technology our society has Limitless possibilities by eliminating fuel cost since Mercury is just constantly running through a closed circuit never burning any fuel this would allow more efficient cars factories and space travel for the world NASA has been experimenting with this phenomen since the early 2000s in fact in 1962 a man by the name of Richard P hington campaigned for the use this technology in the X15 rocket however he was turned down because of Cold War complications he was finally utilized in January of 2011 and upon its completion the X15 became the fastest rocket in the world with this technology I believe that we can change the world and I confident that this is the will be the gateway to the future we here at Novak energy energy research division thank you for your time and God bless America</p>
