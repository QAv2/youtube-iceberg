            <p>An old scam has just leveled up and you might be its next target. San Diego County Superior Court just issued a warning regarding scams that have been recently popping up that use fake documents that appear to be the real thing. Victims report feeling pressured to pay hundreds if not thousands of dollars to buy them time so that they can clear their name with law enforcement. And if they don&#x27;t pay or if they question the caller&#x27;s motives, they are typically threatened with arrest. Court officials say these fake documents are not just limited to warrants.</p>
<p>They may also be used in scams related to court fines, judgments, and failure to appear to jury duty. Some of these fakes are so good they even include forg signatures from a judge. So, here&#x27;s what you should know. Superior Court will never call or text you to demand payment. It will never accept Venmo, Zel, PayPal, or any other electronic payment platform.</p>
<p>and it will definitely not require you to meet anybody to make a payment, not even in front of a police station. So, if you should ever get hit with this scam, the best thing you could do is to just hang up. But if you still have that uneasy feeling because of what they told you, you should then contact Superior Court directly. Or better yet, you could check in with their online court index. Remember, every legitimate document has a case number assigned to it.</p>
<p>That way you&#x27;ll be able to confirm for yourself that the whole thing was made</p>
