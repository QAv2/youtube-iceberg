            <p>The final case study occurred in the 1960s with Hungarian-B born inventor Joseph Pap, who claimed he had built an engine that defied everything we know about physics. His machine didn&#x27;t burn fuel. It didn&#x27;t use combustion in the traditional sense. Instead, it ran on noble gases like helium, neon, and xenon. These inert gases were sealed inside a closed system and when activated by an electric spark, they expanded with massive force, creating energy without pollution, without refueling, and without moving parts wearing down.</p>
<p>Pap said it was the engine of the future, zero emissions, infinite potential. And he had working prototypes to prove it. But when he demonstrated the engine in front of a panel of scientists, including Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Fineman, things went wrong. During the test, the engine exploded. One man was killed and several others were injured.</p>
<p>Fineman, a skeptic from the start, accused Pap of fraud. Pap blamed sabotage. A bitter legal battle followed and the mainstream scientific community dismissed him entirely. But after his death, his lab was stripped. His working engines vanished.</p>
<p>His patents remain on file, but no one has ever been able to build a functioning replica. Not because it&#x27;s been proven fake, but because the full process was never publicly disclosed.</p>
