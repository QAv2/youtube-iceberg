            <p>Victor shreer came up with some very radical ideas over 100 years ago he believed that water flows in a spiraling puls pattern with the right temperature variation and geometry a fluid can be sped up or slowed down he believed that this principle could lead to a free energy device which would reduce friction and increase flow velocity of water with the right resonance the water would spin a rotor and in theory it would be able to self sustain and run on its own thus providing power his second even more extreme device would intake can rotate to air this would create a vacuum in front of the disc thus providing propulsion and overcoming gravity unfortunately only vague drawings and descriptions are available and to this date no replicated devices have provided free energy or shown any lifting effects did shbg truly understand something that was unconventional well let me know in the comments</p>
