            <p>scalar and Vector quantities are two kinds of quantities that we see in physics quantities like distance mass and word are classified as scalar quantities velocity weight electric and magnetic fields are categorized as vector quantity one common property of the scalars is that they have only magnitude for Vector quantities they have both magnitude as well as Direction these are not the only defining attributes of these quantities because there are exceptions I&#x27;m here to discuss one of the exceptions the current current has both magnitude as well as Direction current always flows from high potential to low potential along the Y we still categorize it under scalar quantities the reason for that it&#x27;s not just enough for a vector to have only Direction and magnitude it should also follow the vector law of H if I have a vector quantity 3 meters in the right and 4 meters in the upward Direction the net Vector is given by 5 meter as opposed to 7 meter which is three plus four if you have current traveling in two different directions as three amperes and four amperes addition of these two current quantities will always be 7 and it will never change depending on what direction they are flowing which is a property of scalar quantity in conclusion vectors are those quantities that have magnitude Direction and also follows the vector law of</p>
