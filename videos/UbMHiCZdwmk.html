            <p>all right hello everyone I hope everybody&#x27;s having a good day I&#x27;m Thomas and I uh welcome to my channel I do educational videos and um I believe this is the 44th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory theory developed by Dewey B Larson uh back starting around 1930. and up until the day he died in 1990 and um this is the I believe the uh 20 second video that we&#x27;ve done on his final book that is called beyond space and time um we also did a number of videos 15 or so on um his uh Speech that&#x27;s called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so you may want to go back and look at those as well and we did some autobiographical and biographical stuff too um now uh Larson&#x27;s the gist of Larson&#x27;s Theory uh comes from his first postulate First Fundamental postulate that it took him about 20 or 25 years of researching and inductive uh research uh into you know measurement uh measuring all kinds of things having to do with the atom especially the inter-atomic distance to arrive at his first postulate which is that the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so he&#x27;s really saying that space and time are the same except that they are reciprocals and the relationship of space and time is motion the universe is composed entirely of motion motion is the relationship between time and space and uh you know the universe is uh not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy both matter and energy are kinds of motion as well as everything else and motion and uh space and time both uh have three dimensions or I would say three or four dimensions and they both progress um and that uh every kind of scientific phenomena that you can think of is a kind of motion and can be um expressed specifically exclusively in terms of space and time they are all relationships between space and time space over time time over space space to the second power over time time to the second power over space time over space to the second power space over time to the second power all of these are different um units of scientific units so for example space over time to the second power is acceleration time over space to the second power is force time to the third power over space to the third power is matter time over space is energy space over time obviously is speed and it goes on and on like that and that is a great check for his system because you can apply you can put in all of these historical scientific equations into this space and time thing and see if the units work out does it work out uh do the math and uh or the algebra and uh does it work out um now there&#x27;s been a few situations where they haven&#x27;t worked out because Larson assigned the wrong units to things this happened particularly with elect electrical capacitance uh uh and uh but one of the people who&#x27;ve kind of come along since Larson died unfortunately he died as well now a couple years ago three years ago um is Dr Bruce Perrette and he came along and and kind of corrected the relations that had to do with uh capacitance um and that is basically what Larson says Larson says my theory uh the reciprocal system of theory the uh you know Universe of motion is correct whether I applied uh you know the universe of motion to the scientific world and come came up with relevant uh and accurate conclusions is another matter I may have made some mistakes uh in applying the theory the theory itself is correct if that doesn&#x27;t mean that everything that I&#x27;ve done is correct because you still have to be able to apply the theory and really kind of like identify uh you know because you you start with the postulates and you you develop them deductively one at a time if this then that and then if that then this and so on and that is what he talks about in his deductive development outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system that we did those videos on um but when something pops out of the system you know the if this then that well what is that that it doesn&#x27;t come with a label on it it just comes with a theoretical existence and you have to look at the actual scientific um you know history uh the history of science what uh and what does that match up with or does that match up with anything that the scientists have already come up with you know so for example you can be saying okay if this then that if this and that and you come up with that and it&#x27;s like what what is this thing this is a rotating unit of space what is that and it turns out that that is an electron uh so you have to be able to identify um you don&#x27;t have to be able to but just in order to kind of make it coherent with the uh scientific community and with you know the conversation you have to be able to determine have other people come up with this already and given it a name uh and so uh that can lead you into having making some errors but Larson said if I did make any errors they will correct themselves because somebody else will come along and they will see the discrepancy or maybe I will come along and see the discrepancy now Larson is just one person and I feel that he was very much victimized uh for this Theory and uh people who&#x27;ve who&#x27;ve you know evaluated him as including some people that I&#x27;ve talked to about Larson&#x27;s Theory they expect him to be like on the par of uh an entire scientific establishment of hundreds of thousands of scientists over the years who&#x27;ve come up with all these things and they&#x27;re comparing Larson&#x27;s results one guy compared to a whole Army of scientists you you know he&#x27;s just one guy he can&#x27;t do everything uh he tried he did a lot he wrote a lot of books a lot of Articles he made huge progress with this Theory but it&#x27;s going to take it&#x27;s gonna take another Century to flesh it out uh that and that is if all kinds of people start working on it as as of now there aren&#x27;t very there are very few people who know anything about this Theory so that&#x27;s why I I believe I thoroughly believe in my heart that this Theory will be the foundation of scientific uh exploration uh certainly by the beginning of the next Century if not earlier we&#x27;re going to eventually figure out that the reciprocal system um provides answers for everything and so that is the purpose of Larson&#x27;s final book uh beyond space and time where he actually takes uh the reciprocal system and takes it beyond the realm of the Sciences Beyond astronomy and physics and chemistry and takes it into the realm of metaphysics of philosophy religion and and um you know history and um psychology and some biology now we&#x27;ve been looking at chapter 11 which is um called Revelation chapter 10 Revelation and uh we were going through how Larson was saying that um that uh the Book of Genesis uh Genesis chapter 1 where it&#x27;s talking about the creation is not he says uh is not about creation it&#x27;s about the formation of the solar system and uh the creation of humans and um Evolution I think you might even say and he&#x27;s comparing the actual text of Genesis with the um under the scientific understanding but also the uh the text what the text of Genesis would say if it if you took out all of the uh anthropomorphism you know of of um turning God into a human being so that we could relate late to God that way you know and uh so we&#x27;re just gonna go through the the very uh we&#x27;ve done most of this but uh chapter 11 or verse 11 in Genesis 1. and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind and uh to strip off the um anthropomorphism or the personality and then plant life appeared on the land areas and the scientific explanation is about a billion years ago life appeared on Earth about three or four hundred million years ago plant land plants appeared then we skip up to verse 20. and God said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that Half-Life and foul that may fly above the Earth in the open firmament of Heaven and to take out the anthropomorphism and then animal life appeared first in the sea and and in the air and the scientific version is fish also appeared during this same period and then we go to uh verse 24 and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind um and then it just says and then on land uh the scientific version land animals and insects appeared uh 250 to 300 million years ago mammals and birds appeared 150 to 200 million years ago uh verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness the uh de-anthropomorphized version finally man made his appearance and the scientific version just recently on this time time scale man appeared okay um the most and here&#x27;s we&#x27;re back to the text the most remarkable feature of this story is of course its portrayal of these events as an evolutionary sequence beginning with A formless and featureless aggregate of matter the author carries his account step by step through a logical and sequential process terminating with the appearance of man and aside from placing fish and foul at the same point in The evolutionary order a very understandable mistake he has listed the developments in the proper succession the idea that the Advent of man on Earth came about as the last act in an orderly and sequential process of evolution is quite familiar to us but the author of this account in Genesis was thousands of years in advance of his time in bringing forth a concept of this kind okay now uh this is a major issue that I always have with Larson is that especially in terms of evolution is that he kind of just assumes that the scientific Community got that right and that the scientific Community got a lot of other things right even as he is kind of overturning so much of science uh he he he&#x27;s still a creature he&#x27;s still a scientist he&#x27;s still a creature of all this and um you know I think that he he thinks that where the reciprocal system and he said this and I&#x27;ve said it too the that the reciprocal system leaves like even when you develop the reciprocal system it leaves the vast majority of science intact that it agrees with the sign with science uh for what he says 90 of science goes right into the reciprocal system uh on on intact you know uncorrected it&#x27;s only in the realm of the very small the very large the very fast and the very slow where the reciprocal system makes Corrections similar to the way that Einstein&#x27;s theory uh Einstein&#x27;s theories uh changed Newton it didn&#x27;t change Newton&#x27;s theories like in the macro you know in the kind of the world that we&#x27;re familiar with but then when you get into the relativistic world Einstein came up with different equations a different understandings that um Newton could have never gotten to [Music] um but uh Larson just kind of assumes that this evolutionary theory is correct where he right here where he&#x27;s saying you know um oh a very under understandable mistake that they could place fish and foul at the same uh at the same point um you know but besides that he has listed the developments in the proper succession um you know he could have just put a comment there and said according to the theory of evolution but he just says in the proper succession as if it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a a foregone conclusion that this evolutionary theory is correct okay um so he&#x27;s he&#x27;s kind of questioning the Genesis Theory uh which I think that is needed but he&#x27;s not questioning the evolutionary theory as well which I think he should be doing I mean he should be questioning all of it especially when he&#x27;s got a powerful system that he can he can actually you know legitimately question these things and come up with answers and solutions okay getting back to the text as pointed out earlier such physical Revelations are of little practical effect other than as striking demonstrations of the reality of the Revelation process but by the time we have enlarged our knowledge of the physical world enough to understand the revelatory message the increase in physical knowledge is itself able to supply the same information this is in terms of physical knowledge now however when we take up a consideration of the next item on our list metaphysical existence the situation is much much different as religious Revelation and similar types of contact with sector three sector three being his word for God more or less and being kind of the boundary between the uh physical and uh the the cosmic the material and the cosmic universes that it the speed of light is really the boundary between them which is a departure from Einstein but that so that this is sector one is the physical Universe sector two is the is the um Cosmic universe and then sector three uh sector one is like the material Universe the sector three is this overarching um existence that um other people probably would refer to as God the situation much different as religious Revelation and similar types of contact with sector three are the principal sources of information about the metaphysical region direct physical observations tell us nothing about sector three existence we can make a few deductions by extrapolating our knowledge of the characteristics of the level two structures or life at the upper end of the biological evolution together with our empirical knowledge of the kind of changes that take place at the discontinuities in the order of increasing complexity Beyond this information about the metaphysical region comes only from Revelation the religious term or from Intuition or Insight which are non-religious names for the same thing we can be sure that most of the information claimed to be received from these sources is either incomplete or erroneous and the question as to how to test the validity of the revelations and insights thus becomes a crucial issue um and he earlier in the chapter he gave a number of different criteria therefore analyzing this such as is there authoritarian bias does the does the um Revelation give you give you more Authority and uh is it wishful thinking is the Revelation what you want and anthropomorphism does the Revelation tend to make God God or the metaphysical existences more like humans those are all things that that go against the validity of the theory on the other hand he talks about admissions against interest uh which is a legal term if if it actually goes against what you want um then it it&#x27;s more likely it gives it more validity because it it goes against your interests and so you have to overcome that just to get to that revelation okay now uh we&#x27;re gonna skip a little bit and hopefully we can try to uh um let&#x27;s see here read this last paragraph I probably can&#x27;t get this done here um unfortunately for our understanding of metaphysical existence however the amount of agreement in this area is much more limited with respect to moral issues each religion has its own version of Ultimate Reality and its own ideas as to where its Revelations originated and uh you know um basically he&#x27;s saying such a study is beyond the scope of the present work but it certainly should be carried out now that this present investigation has demonstrated the reality of the Revelation process and provided the tools or some of them for evaluation um there&#x27;s no longer any serious technical obstacle to bringing the revealed information up to a status which will approximate if not equal the status of scientific knowledge okay we&#x27;ll check you later have a good day</p>
