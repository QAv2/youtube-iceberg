            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas I do educational material educational videos here on this channel and today is the 95th edition of uh our review of the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory discovered and uh propounded by Dewey B Larson in the 20th century uh from his uh first inklings back around 1930 all the way until his death in 1990. and uh during that time took him about 20 25 years to kind of work out his theory in his head uh through induction uh until he came up with his uh two fundamental postulates and then after that point he was writing books and articles for the next 30 35 years um and we are actually right now looking at his final book that actually came out posthumously in 1995 called beyond space and time now the uh the Crux of his theory is uh articulated in his first fundamental postulate um and uh the uh the basic gist of it is that uh the universe is not made out of uh not made out of matter and it&#x27;s not made out of energy but the universe is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between time and space uh space and time are identical to each other except that they are reciprocals of each other um boy I&#x27;m having some issues with my computer here okay um I wanted to read to you the postulate which was only like one sentence or two sentences but um I&#x27;ll just have to summarize it here again like I normally do uh space and time are reciprocals of each other that&#x27;s hence the reciprocal system of theory uh same the way that the four thirds and three-fourths are reciprocals of each other they are related in a fraction uh in the same way that uh time over space is space over time that uh they&#x27;re the same they have the same qualities except there&#x27;s an inversion between them what one is uh the denominator of one is the numerator of the other and vice versa um but they have the same qualities therefore so space being multi-dimensional time is also multi-dimensional time being a phenomena that progresses or flows or is always getting later and later so therefore space is also a phenomenon that is progressing or flowing meaning that it&#x27;s always getting further and further apart farther away and uh that is seen in the recession of the distant galaxies that was seen by the Hubble telescope way back uh in even before Larson started this whole journey and also time and space are both quantized meaning that there is a they only come in discrete units they&#x27;re they&#x27;re very small microscopic uh and instantaneous basically uh for the measurements of the single units of space and time but there is no half unit or three tenths of a unit or anything like that um and one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light in Larson&#x27;s system the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe unlike Einstein&#x27;s Universe where the speed of light is the maximum the speed of light is the midpoint or the null point or the origin and then there is half of the universe that&#x27;s actually moving faster than the speed of light half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light he calls those sector 2 and sector 1 respectively also he calls them the cosmic sector and the material sector so the material sector is what we&#x27;re familiar with and that&#x27;s the realm of uh normal material atoms and molecules and they build up by aggregation bonding until they get to their most complex level DNA and at that point DNA becomes eligible to be controlled by a cosmic entity an entity from sector two when they the um sector 1 and sector 2 entity come together Larson refers to that as the life unit uh and the life unit then starts from a single-celled organism an amoeba or something like that and a virus uh and works its way up to um its most complex level which is the intelligent human being and the intelligent human being then becomes eligible to be controlled overall by what Larson calls a sector 3 entity and sector three is really this origin or this uh metaphysical region Beyond physical beyond space and time are independent of space and time and as I mentioned the book that we&#x27;re going through is called beyond space and time so it has to do with this metaphysical region sector three other people might have called that God or the gods or the religious or the numinous or the spiritual and um Larson calls it sector three and so sector three communicates with the intelligent human through various means such as ESP uh intuition religious Revelation um scientific insight and uh others and uh sector 3 communicates with us uh and it is always right it&#x27;s always correct our ability to decode those messages to translate those messages is limited and so sometimes we get it wrong but the communication itself is correct uh sector three is bent on ethical Behavior it teaches us how to be good whereas sector two is directed toward survival it teaches us how to live how to survive sometimes those things work together sometimes they don&#x27;t in times when they don&#x27;t uh that is where the human being steps in and has to decide through their Free Will which they&#x27;re going to choose are they going to choose survival or are they going to choose um good behavior ethical Behavior and um so we are uh toward the end of this book beyond space and time this is I believe the 73rd video that we&#x27;ve done on this and we are in chapter 24 uh or no the end of chapter 23 that is called religion re-examined and he&#x27;s going over a conversation where he&#x27;s talking about uh science and religion and you know the the basic thrust behind the this work is to really uh turn religion into a science uh to make uh religion a science and by through understanding how sector three communicates with us and so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s going over right here and we&#x27;re gonna take over uh toward the end of the chapter uh so here comes Larson the full benefit of such reproshma between science and religion will not be realized however unless there is some softening of the rigid attitudes that have prevailed on both sides it will be necessary for the scientists to refrain from opposing religious or other non-scientific ideas simply because they do not fit neatly into the scientific framework as it happens to stand at the moment an attitude that has been taken all too often with respect to matters that are outside the field that is that science is currently cultivating the ESP phenomena for instance fortunately there is a growing awareness among scientists that the existing limits of scientific knowledge are not the boundaries of knowledge in general the following recent statements on the subject illustrate the new scientific position a philosophy uh here&#x27;s a quote from marginal a philosophy which sees the answers to all questions clearly implied in what is now called science is presumptuous and contrary to the spirit of science indeed I would say you know scientists have a lot of overconfidence in their thinking that what they&#x27;ve discovered so far is all there is to discover I believe that the uh the uh head of the U.S patent office once wrote in 1899 that everything that needs to be discovered already has been discovered um and so he probably would have uh gasped yeah had he lived through the 20th century anyway uh getting back to Larson now now he&#x27;s quoting Verner Heisenberg the existence uh the existing scientific Concepts cover always only a very limited part of reality and the other part that has not been understood is infinite uh and this goes to one of my uh Jazz musicians uh Heroes um he always told his uh he was band leader sunrat and he always told his musicians to um you know to play uh play for don&#x27;t play what you do know play what you don&#x27;t know because what you don&#x27;t know is infinite um you know and the more you know the more you don&#x27;t know and you know that you don&#x27;t know it okay uh back to Larson the more realistic Viewpoint that is reflected in these statements by marginal and Heisenberg is an encouraging indication that enlightened scientific opinion is moving in this direction what is needed is an open-minded and sympathetic appraisal of each of the assertions of the various religions not in the light of existing scientific knowledge alone but in the light of this knowledge plus careful reasoning with respect to what may lie beyond that which science has thus far established this is sincere scientists certainly cannot be expected to accept assertions that are in conflict with well-established facts and if a religious organization insists on acceptance of such doctrines as a condition of membership he will have to forego that privilege however where the conflict is not with established fact but with interpretations or extrapolations of those facts with inferences drawn from them or with unconfirmed theories or hypotheses he should bear in mind that a careful scientific investigation has now demonstrated that religion has its own processes of ascertaining the truth and while the nature of these processes is such that a great deal of error is inevitably mixed with the truth it is neither logical nor scientific to assume that all non-scientific conclusions are erroneous where a religious assertion is neither demonstrably true nor demonstrably false the proper course is to analyze the situation and arrive at a decision as to whether there is sufficient justification for accepting that assertion tentatively pending further clarification on the other side of the picture the most serious religious obstacle to harmonious relations with science and scientists is the tendency on the part of the religious organizations to regard their Doctrine as fixed and not subject to change something that was handed down to the founder of the religion in complete form and must persist in that form for all time adherence to this Dogma in practice is of course impossible the world moves on and even religion must move with it or be left behind but the ecclesiastical authorities continue to proclaim the timelessness of their doctrines in public while behind the scenes they are doing what everyone else must do they are continually discussing debating and making changes that which was a sin yesterday is perfectly proper today while that which was an important religious Duty yesterday persecution of the Heretics for example is today regarded as contrary to religious ideals perhaps the under unyielding attitude of the religious leaders may have some Merit where they are dealing with an uneducated and superstitious people but it alienates those who are able to think for themselves quoting denoi uh the intransigence of religious Authority tends to Prejudice an independent mind in favor of positive materialistic rationalism back to Larson it is possible that the religious authorities have no real choice in the matter as it may well be that the great majority of the adherents of the major religions are still not emotionally prepared to accept the modifications of religious doctrine that are necessary to keep religion abreast of the Ed of the advance of human knowledge it may be necessary for the present to continue talking in terms of posthumous reward and punishment for instance simply because this is the only good hold that the religious organizations have on some segments of their membership but if it this is true there should at least be some branches of some religions which can meet the scientists desire for logical and rational religious viewpoint one of the essential requirements in this respect is a recognition of the fact that religion like science is a growing body of knowledge even if the Revelation received by the founder of one of the major religions was correct in every detail there are many reasons why the body of Doctrine based on that Revelation is not as it now stands adequate to serve as a continuing basis of religious thought and practice in the first place we do not know just what the Revelation actually contained since little or nothing comes to us firsthand in many cases the holy books of the religious organizations purport to give the founders words but we have only someone else&#x27;s testimony that these were his words and since a long interval usually elapsed between the spoken word and the written record it is inevitable that many statements were incorrectly reported thus or then even if we assume that we have the correct wording of a particular statement there is always a question as to just what these words mean as pointed out earlier each culture has its own manner of expression and a literal interpretation of the words of a people far removed from us in time and in environment can be utterly misleading nor is this exclusively a phenomenon of the past anyone who attempts to interpret the idiomatic or colloquial language of the present day literally according to the wording would go just as far astray as those who insist on a similar literal interpretation of the allegory and imagery habitual with the population of earlier eras the person who puts his foot in his mouth is not a contortionist one of the important tasks of the religious community is to discover and correct the errors that have distorted the meaning of some features of the original Revelations Beyond this it should be recognized that however accurate the original Revelation may have been its scope was limited by the general level of knowledge at the time it was received only a relatively modest level of understanding needs to be reached in order to grasp the simple basic rules of ethical living and it is not unlikely that the widespread attainment of such a level what&#x27;s the factor that resulted in the appearance of most of the great religions of the world within a period of time that was extremely short not only in comparison to the millions of years or more of human existence but also compared to the very much shorter period of recorded history these simple truths are not adequate however to meet the more complex situations of the present day and the attempts of the ecclesiastics to deny this fact are the root cause of much of the decline in religious influence that is now taking place at an accelerating rate the revelations on which the modern religions are based are remarkable products but they are never infallible nor adequate they provide Good Foundations on which to build but the growing complexities of human existence call for purging the organized religions of the elements that thoughtful persons cannot accept and for an advanced in religious understanding comparable to that which is now underway in other fields particularly in science the findings of this work will not only provide guidelines for the purging operation but will furnish solid factual support for the sound portions of religious doctrine that remain intact a support that should reinforce the faith in the basic assertions of religion that has been wavering in recent years the positive verification of the reality of metaphysical existence in the preceding pages and the clarification of the important role that this non-physical existence plays in human life now constitutes a solid base from which it will be possible to make significant advances in religious knowledge advances that will fulfill the prediction made by JB rein in this statement uh now Ryan is the guy that runs the uh Ryan Institute uh in uh at Duke University for psychics uh psychic experimentation and his quote is if some kind of a world of independent Spirit agency can be discovered as there is reason to think that may be possible think maybe possible it&#x27;s established establishment would manifestly bring to religious life an incomparably greater meaning and potency the discovery would do for religion something like what the germ Theory did for medicine maybe not a good example but uh to continue it would open the range of religious exploration to Horizons beyond all present conceptions it has always been so when new areas are discovered and that is the end of chapter 23. chapter 24 starts uh it&#x27;s called East and West and we will get into that starting tomorrow I just wanted to say that I agree with a lot of what Larson is saying there um you know I was red pilled way back in the early 90s and my uh my dad went to Seminary school and that turned him into a complete atheist so I grew up uh pretty much without religion in my life and I&#x27;m sympathetic to the spiritual and the religious but when I pick up the Bible and I start reading it you know I&#x27;m like I&#x27;m red pilled do you expect me to believe this you know where did this come from what is the what is the origin it&#x27;s just sitting right in front of me and Christians are saying oh it&#x27;s the word of God that&#x27;s not that&#x27;s not what it is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a book that&#x27;s in front of me uh I mean better uh clarification okay uh have a great day we&#x27;ll talk to you tomorrow</p>
