            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel uh I do educational material on this channel mostly things that uh you would classify as theories of everything all-encompassing theories that attempt to explain how things work uh in this universe and um we are embarking on episode number 230 on the reciprocal system of theory and the reciprocal system of theory is a system of theory or a theory of everything that was first derived by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century and he started his work way back around 1930 and continued it for uh 60 years until he died in 1990. since then some of his uh Associates and his followers have um kept at it and attempted to work out some of the bugs and have done a great job as well so we&#x27;re going to be looking at one of those people today Dr Bruce Perrette who is writing also under the pen name of Daniel Phoenix 3. and we&#x27;re looking at one of his articles uh that is called geochronology which is his the first installment of his anthropology series um and um the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that this universe is a universe of motion it&#x27;s not so much a universe of matter or Universe of energy but is the universe of motion matter and energy are merely two different varieties of motion along with acceleration and speed and pressure and electric charge and electric current and magnetic flux and viscosity and fluidity and um density and there are many many others uh they are all motions and motion is the relationship between space and time all motions are fractions uh that have either time or space as the numerator and either space or time as the denominator uh but it is a little more complicated because space and time both come in multi-dimensions so you can have time to the third power or you can have space to the third power or space to the second power uh and so on so there&#x27;s more permutations than just simply space over time or time over space space over time is speed the car is moving 15 miles per hour 15 miles of space in one hour of time over space is energy it took me 30 minutes to move that thing two feet that is energy time over space but then there are also things like acceleration I dropped the I dropped the ball out the window and it fell at 9.8 meters per second squared that is space over time squared acceleration the kind of inverse of that would be Force force is time over space to the second power and then we have relations like matter matter is time to the third power over space to the third power so this serves as a great way to check your work and it also serves as a great System of Units because you&#x27;re you only have two of them there&#x27;s only time and space there are no other units that enter into the picture whatsoever um so this is a powerful Tool uh among a number of powerful tools within the reciprocal system uh Larson wrote uh in about the late 1950s he put together his fundamental postulates and there&#x27;s mainly there were two of them but really the first one is the most important and uh the basic idea is that you know the universe is made out of motion motions relationship between space and time space and time have three things that they have in common as reciprocals of each other they are both coordinate coordinate space and coordinate time meaning that they have three or more Dimensions XYZ coordinates they both have their scalar aspects which Larson calls clock time and clock space meaning that they have emotion but uh it has no particular direction and you visualize that using a balloon and a magic marker that puts dots on the balloon you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other uh you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other that is an outward scalar motion and an inward scalar motion respectively and um that is what Larson calls the clock the clock time it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later but again in no particular direction and clock space things are always getting farther and farther and farther apart it&#x27;s an outward scalar motion the flow of space or the progression of space and then time and space Also only come in discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time those minimum units are very very small so we can&#x27;t quite resolve them we can&#x27;t you know they look continuous to us um just like a cartoon that is uh you know showing us uh a hundred frames per second or whatever we can&#x27;t we can&#x27;t resolve the difference between one frame and the next but they do exist and um if we go within one unit of space then there is no space there is only time Larson calls that the time region and if we go within one unit of time there is no time there is only space and Larson calls that the space region so the space region is within uh what Larson oh and the the last part of that is that one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is one Larson calls that unit speed and one is the midpoint in the reciprocal system uh everything above one is what Larson calls the cosmic sector faster than the speed of light motion and whatever is below one is what Larson calls the material sector slower than the speed of light motion and this is the this is the region the material sector that the these scientists are aware of and that&#x27;s why Einstein said that nothing moves faster than the speed of light um so we know much about the material sector and very little about the cosmic sector but another powerful tool in the reciprocal systems bag is that um the reciprocal postulate will show that what goes on in the cosmic sector is the exact same as what&#x27;s going on in the material sector except that the roles of space and time are reversed in the material sector you have coordinate space and clock time we are familiar with those three dimensions of space and a progressing time always getting later and later and later in the cosmic sector we have the reverse of those roles in space and time we have coordinate three dimensions of time and clock space is always getting farther and farther apart so that is um just one way where you can show how the um the roles of space and time are reversed when you cross that unit speed boundary so there basically are three unit boundaries here in this reciprocal system construct there is the unit speed boundary between the material and Cosmic sectors there&#x27;s the unit space boundary between the co the material sector and the time region and then there is the unit time boundary which is between the cosmic sector and the space region okay now we&#x27;re gonna uh go into um into Daniel&#x27;s paper here uh we&#x27;re at a section I believe this is the sixth episode that we&#x27;ve done on this so if you want to go from the beginning go back about five episodes but here we&#x27;re going to start with a section that&#x27;s called sister Worlds the inner planets or the yin planet Yin is in Yin planets are compressive resulting in hard rocky surfaces that crack over time as their chorus cool and expand this is observed as tectonic plates separating continents on earth and uh Hills and Fracture zones on the other hard planets and moons these fracture zones and areas of upheaval are indications that there is a white dwarf fragment at the core of the structure that is gravitating in time and due to the reciprocal relation expanding in space however without an oriented magnetic field the early planets would be subject to exposure of all sorts of ionizing radiation and Mass ejecta from the sun which tends to inhibit not stop the development of life early forms of life on these worlds will either be resistant to radiation or make use of it as a kind of food source similar to plants eating light through photosynthesis once a situation develops where a magnetic field becomes oriented the resulting strong magnetic field deflects these damaging effects from the Sun and an explosion of Life occurs on the planet as what occurred on Earth during the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era this situation occurs when the planet obtains a moon initially the inner planets were in a gravitational lock with the Sun like our present day Moon the same face was always pointed at the sun providing a light side and a dark side even now Mercury and Venus barely rotate on their axes Mercury&#x27;s day is longer than its year Mercury&#x27;s day is uh really precisely or very very close to precisely twice as long as its year this results in a dichotomy of heat and cold with the face toward the sun getting exceptionally hot the dark shadow side due to little or to no atmosphere will be almost as cold as the surrounding void of space the thermocline where hot meets cold tends to be an area of stress and Shear cracking the young planet around its girth in great and yawning voids consider this Norse creation myth the first realm to exist was moose spell a place of light and heat whose Flames are so hot that those who are not native to that land cannot endure it Beyond moose Bell lay the great and yawning void named ganunga Gap and Beyond gnunga Gap lay the dark cold realm of niflame consider it to be a description of the early inner planets with the burning hot side facing the red giant Sun a temperate region around the edges where the sun is low in the sky and the Eternal Black cold uh and darkness of the side facing away from the Sun again the Yang boundary Yin structure with the Norse equivalence being moosebell fire gunungap the great Gap and the niflam ice the sister worlds of Mercury Venus Earth and Mars originally looked very similar dried out balls of rock and volcanoes cracking their surfaces as the cores expand with an inverse density gradient putting the heaviest elements near the surface not much good for the formation of Life at least not yet the ancient records describe things we could not possibly know about but the gods did know uh Gods with the small G but the gods did know relating to us through mythology and apocrypha okay this section is called brother Worlds the outer planets the outer planets being the larger more energetic fragments will initially be dark bodies emitting X-ray and gamma radiation part of their transition from solar to planetary status as they cool they will produce significant amounts of visible light like miniature Suns starting with the most energetic the outermost planet of Neptune and moving in quantized steps inward in essence they behave like their larger cousin the Nova as the cooling process will produce light elements that gravitate towards their centers including hydrogen and oxygen the explode an explosive combination and eventually they do go off with a bang scattering dust Rock and planetary chunks into nearby space typically along the equatorial plane which produce a series of icy moons and Rings much like the Supernova that created the planets and asteroid belts again it is the same process just a different scale after their blaze of Anova subsides they will have large atmospheres of Light Elements with a ring system and a number of moons scattered about if the explosion is energetic enough some of these moons May reach escape velocity and go wandering to the outer solar system anti-gravity motion and to take up unstable orbits further out the sequence of events in the ancient Sky because of quantized transition and remembering that all the planets share the same core in 3D time will be that when one planet drops in energy the next lights up a kind of stair-step effects okay I&#x27;m just trying to check these uh footnotes to make sure there&#x27;s nothing too important in here okay as a result there will be a dominance of brilliant star-like planets in the sky at first no visible planets but point source X-ray and gamma ray sources are detectable where the planets will form they are already there just not emitting or reflecting light Neptune flares the other planets are still dark x-ray bodies are still dark x-ray bodies at this time the planetary orbits of both inner and outer planets are much closer to the unit speed boundary the asteroid belt and are just now beginning to spread away from it Neptune dies down to a planet with a ring system the lower speeds move the planet into a more distant orbit Uranus flares up and becomes dominant in the night sky with Jupiter and Saturn still being dark bodies then Uranus dies down from the same conditions and Saturn becomes active leaving only Jupiter a dark body then Saturn dies down and Jupiter flares up becoming the dominant object in the sky Jupiter dies down to planetary status by this time the planets have lost most of their anti-gravity motion their orbital velocities have reduced and they are in orbits much further apart from each other but also will have moved closer to the Sun the sun has been condensing all along and getting smaller and brighter heading toward the main sequence dwarf this is the current structure of the solar system it has changed significantly since its formation note that the sequence of bright star-like objects in the sky a natural consequence of reciprocal system astronomy matches the mythological ages or Suns as the Aztecs say or the domination of certain Titans Poseidon being Neptune Uranus as Uranus Cronus as Saturn and Zeus as Jupiter in the Greek the changing dominance of these very obvious planetary lights in the sky plays a significant role in mythology as the planetary orbits also change when the ruler of the sky so to speak changes for example when Jupiter became dominant over Saturn in the sky the orbit of Saturn moved further out and the ring system could no longer be seen Zeus or Jupiter overthrew his father Cronus or Saturn whom who overthrew his father Uranus or Uranus there is a mythological pattern that mimics the consequences of reciprocal system astronomy the inner planets have not changed much other than to slow down and move closer to the Sun as the core sizes are too small to sustain the DraStic exhibitions of the outer planets the occasional core flare will crack their surfaces and cause sudden expansion magnetic ionization levels were initially very high because the core is a stellar fragment and decreases as the planetary core ages rather than a solar transition up to a higher magnetic ionization the planets do a planetary transition down to a lower magnetic ionization this infers that much of the material on the early planets was Radioactive and as the planets age their minerals become less Radioactive now uh the concept of magnetic ionization is uh is uh that every planet every Star has an ionization level uh which is quantized and it basically means that if your ionization level is zero then all of the elements are stable on your body on your planet or your your Sun so uh in Larson&#x27;s system there are 117 different elements all of them are stable at ionization level one are zero but if you move to ionization number one uh which is where Earth is then only the elements below uranium element number 92 are stable all the rest of them are uh those other 25 of them are radioactive then if you move to a planet with ionization level two uh then it&#x27;s gold element number 79 is the uh the the largest stable element all of the other elements of 38 of them are unstable at that environment and as you move further down Larson has an equation for this but as you move all the way down all the way to um you know ionization level 14 or 15 you get down all the way below Element 50 down to about element 40 40 something a neovium and that is the heaviest stable element at that level so that&#x27;s kind of what uh what peret is talking about here um okay now we will stop there and uh I think he actually explains this here um but uh we will uh start with that tomorrow and um thanks for tuning in hope to see you tomorrow and have a great day</p>
