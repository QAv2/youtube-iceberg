            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this is a channel built for educational purposes and uh we look at mostly like theories of everything uh people that I&#x27;ve done research on in the past who you probably haven&#x27;t heard of um outside of this Channel and uh but I think that they&#x27;ve made uh great contributions um but uh they&#x27;re uh languishing in obscurity most likely they&#x27;re also deceased by now and uh so I&#x27;m just trying to uh put their put their uh work back out there and um today is the 327th video that we&#x27;ve done on dwey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory and the reciprocal system of theory was um first articulated uh by Mr Larson back in the late 1950s and he wrote a number of books in the&#x27; 607s and 80s finally he died in 1990 um he started out with his first uh his two fundamental postulates which kind of uh articulated kind of the uh uh most uh concise version of the theory and then expanded upon that over the next years um and he created an entire theoretical Universe about how the universe operates if his postulates are correct and kind of compared his theoretical Universe with the um observed and measured and proposed Universe from the uh Legacy science and uh in general probably about 90% of the reciprocal system of theory agrees with Legacy science uh in most Fields but when we get into the so-called relativistic Fields uh the the Realms of the very small the very large and the very fast um the uh Legacy science kind of breaks down um this is the Newtonian worldview kind of breaks down when you&#x27;re getting into the U onto the extreme margins of um phenomena and just in the same way uh for Einstein Einstein&#x27;s relativity theory was really uh the say you know the same kind of uh approach where yeah well Newton is right up to a certain point but then when we&#x27;re talking about these really extreme phenomena then uh it breaks down and so the Einstein and um relativity was uh designed to shore up those areas and larsson&#x27;s theory is kind of the same he he&#x27;s uh trying to shore up um the areas where new neutronian mechanics doesn&#x27;t work really work out but I think uh Larson went a little bit further because he was able to not only correct things in terms of like mathematics but he also like really um helped to um shed light on the concepts that were underlying and so many of the concepts that the Newtonian Universe had U as well as going all the way back to the ancient Greeks um are uh Larson found to be somewhat untenable and so he he went uh a further deeper into the uh Legacy science to uh dredge out a lot of the fundamental mistakes that they were making probably um one of the main ones is just the idea of the container now for Larson the basic idea is that the universe is uh made completely and entirely out of motion whereas the ancient Greeks really felt that the Universe was made out of matter made out of atoms um and the einsteinian were you know came up with eal mc² so well it looks like matter but it&#x27;s really energy so Larson is saying it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not either matter or energy and in fact the mere fact that you can convert matter to energy via eal mc^ 2 demonstrates that neither one of those things can be the most fundamental thing there has to be something underlying both of them and that is motion and for Larson motion was the relationship between space and time and uh this gets to like that setting concept uh that was talking about the Greeks and up to Newton and then you you know through Einstein they felt that space and time were really like the container of the universe the action of of uh life and of phenomena of the universe occurred on this stage of space and time um space and time was really like the the stage or the setting uh on upon which all of these things happened but in larsson&#x27;s system space and time are not the container of the universe or the stage they are actually the contents of the universe the universe is made out of space and time and so that is a profound uh profound shift now um we could go uh further into larsson&#x27;s Theory uh just in terms of the uh in terms of the fundamental postulates motion is the relationship between space and time um space and time are reciprocals of one another hence the reciprocal system of theory um they do not have any independent existence they only exist together in motion motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator space and time are identical to to one another except that they are reciprocals meaning that they have the same qualities one of those qualities is their coordinate nature they both come in three dimensions or I would say three or four dimensions if you look at a cube a cube can be broken down in three dimensions or it can be broken down into four dimensions depending on whether you want to use cubic coordinates or tetrahedral coordinates and um you you um and so space and time both have their coordinate aspects they also both have what Larson calls their clock aspects clock time and clock space this is a progression um like time time is always getting later and later and later and later that is the progression of time at but time is not getting later in any particular direction uh you can&#x27;t it it&#x27;s just a constant flow um this is what Larsson calls a scalar motion and this is what he uses to build his universe is a scalar motion which is a motion that hasn&#x27;t really been recognized as being important Larson talks about that in this article that we&#x27;re going to be looking at here just a in a minute and um now so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s talking about with clock time now clock space is the same uh instead of saying that time is always getting later and later and later you say that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and you can Envision this using a balloon with dots on it you um blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other um but not in a specific Direction so scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction um that is the outward or the flow of space or the progression of space so space and time both have those two qualities coordinat and clock and then they also both are quantized meaning that they come in only discrete units and uh you have to have a full unit of space before you have any space you have to have a full unit of time before you have any time if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have uh the speed of light which is what Larson refers to as unit speed 1 over 1 equals 1 for lson the speed of light is the is a boundary in the universe it&#x27;s really like a midpoint or a reference point or An Origin an ether um a state of rest in a universe of motion universe made out of of motion the state of rest is actually in motion at the speed of light outward in all directions and um half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light which uh is completely you know out of bounds for the Legacy science where Einstein is saying that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe it&#x27;s because Einstein wasn&#x27;t aw of this second part of the universe where this uh let Larson refers to as the cosmic sector where um everything is moving faster than the speed of light um okay um now we are looking at a paper that lson put together um that is called the nature of motion and uh we started this paper yesterday um uh the uh in the first part of the paper he he got into discussing a little bit about scalar motion and the how scalar motion was something that really hasn&#x27;t been uh it&#x27;s been noticed because you know um in particular that uh all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and uh that is a scaler MO there uh unless you are prepared to say that the our galaxy is at the center of the universe and that all of the other galaxies are moving away from us um unless you&#x27;re wanting to say that then you would say that we are also participating in this scalar motion that we are moving away from all of the other galaxies analogous to uh this uh expand exping balloon uh whether you&#x27;re talking about the surface or even in the interior of the expanding balloon that all of the all of the galaxies are moving away from each other the farther apart they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other and uh scalar motion it&#x27;s uh you don&#x27;t need any type of Direction it&#x27;s expressible as just a magnitude the spa the expansion of space and that gravitation is the opposite it is basically if you suck in the balloon all of the dots are moving toward each other um and it only appears as if there&#x27;s action at a distance it only appears that there&#x27;s an attraction between one and another um there&#x27;s actually it&#x27;s just actually that the space itself is Contracting and um then also so that is evidence uh factual evidence that scalar motion exists but the scientists have not really delved into that and determined that this is actually a different kind of motion uh than vectorial motion which is the normal motion that we&#x27;re accustomed to that&#x27;s motion with a direction an arrow that okay you know motion North by Northwest or whatever um so that&#x27;s what uh he talked about there in the first uh installment here of uh this paper that&#x27;s called the nature of motion now um we want to get into the second part uh and the other thing has to do with reference system uh so if I&#x27;ll just read this last paragraph and then we&#x27;ll get into the new material here scalar motion does not conform to these relations in the example cited the Motions take place coincidentally in all inward or outward directions contrary to Newton&#x27;s first law and result in changes of positioning in all of these directions such motion has no property other than a magnitude it is simply an increase or decrease in the separation between identifiable points or objects thus it has no inherent relation to the reference system in order to represent scalar Motion in a reference system of the conventional type meaning like a stationary reference system um a coupling of the reference system independent of the motion must be supplied uh so basically you&#x27;re saying if you&#x27;ve got all these expanding G these galaxies expanding such as on a balloon surface um you would make the reference point by pointing at one of those galaxies and saying this one is stationary you know so all the other ones are moving uh from this one so you&#x27;re you&#x27;re basically uh arbitrarily appointing one of those um Myriad of galaxies as the one that is stationary okay so a coupling to the reference system independent of the motion must be supplied the direction of the motion as seen in the reference system is a property of the coupling not a property of the motion so it it&#x27;s a property of you appointing arbitrarily something as being motionless when actually it is in motion compared to all all the others no different than all the others okay obviously a conventional spatial coordinate reference system which cannot represent Contin uh coincident Motion in more than one uh direction is incapable of representing multi-directional scalar Motion in its true character it represents only one component of the total motion and gives us a distorted picture of that component if we designate our galaxy as a the direction of motion of Galaxy X as we see it is ax and its position in time T is XT a location on an extension of the line line ax but observers in Galaxy B if there are any see it as moving in the very different direction BX and see its position at time t as X2 a location on an extension of the line BX those in Galaxy g see the direction as GX and the location in time as X3 and so on no one of these directions or positions has any more significance than another we cannot Define a specific point that represents the position of Galaxy X in the reference system the best that we can do is to define a location in the reference system that represents the position of that distant Galaxy relative to the location of our Milky Way galaxy when we observe the moving system of galaxies from one of these specific locations we are taking that location as a reference point in effect we are coupling the moving point to the reference system identifying it with a fixed point in that system the moving Galaxy from which the observation is being made is then represented as motionless while each of the other galaxies in the scalar system which are actually moving in all directions is representing as moving only in the direction radially radially outward from the point of observation the speeds of the individual galaxies are similarly misrepresented since the rate of increase in the in the separation between any two galaxies is not altered by the coupling to the reference system the immobilization of the reference Galaxy by the coupling has the effect of transferring its motion to each of the other galaxies in the system this finding that the position of an object with a scalar motion similar to that of the distant galaxies can be spe specifically defined in a spatial reference system only relative to some particular point and cannot be defined relative to the reference system as a whole in the manner in which vectorial motion is defined um will no doubt be distasteful to many perhaps most scientists particularly since it opens the door to the possibility that there may still be other limitations on the capabilities of the conventional reference system our everyday activities take place in a fixed three-dimensional space and it seems to be a lack of EX I&#x27;m sorry it seems to be a fact of experience that every physical object occupies a specific location in that space But time and again in the History of Science an assumption that once seemed almost axiomatic has had to be abandoned when additional information became available the revision of existing ideas about motion that is now required is merely another instance of the same kind the existence of scalar motion is undeniable once attention has been called to it the properties of this type of motion and the limitations on the ability of the conventional reference systems to represent the positions and motions of the objects that are involved are therefore empirically established features of physical activity with which all physical theories must come to terms several other aspects of scalar motion are relevant to the present discussion in the galactic situation the location of the Observer is the reference point but the reference location for other scalar motion may be and usually is determined by other factors in gravitation the location of any mass that is stationary in the reference system becomes the reference point for the scalar system of motions of which the motion of that mass is a member the reference point in the case of the expanding balloon is determined by the placement of the balloon it is placed if it is placed on the floor of a room the point on the balloon surface that is in contact with the floor is the reference point two basic features of scalar motion are illustrated by the balloon placement first the reference point of a scalar motion is independent of the motion itself and may be altered by external factors the balloon can be moved uh the balloon can be moved second the reference point and the system of motions related to it may be in motion vectorially for instance the balloon may be resting on the floor of a moving vehicle as SE as can be seen from this illustration the two types of motion are independent no theories or assumptions are involved in the description of the relations between scalar motion and the conventional reference systems given in the foregoing paragraphs the details of the representation of this type of motion in the reference system are simply a matter of geometry thus the conclusions that have been reached are factual not theoretical or speculative the results that we obtain by applying these findings to specific physical situations are therefore likewise factual we may begin this application by noting that the findings with respect to the representation of scalar Motion in the conventional reference systems show that gravitation is an inward scalar motion not only where the gravitating objects are free to [Music] move so that the motion is observable but in all cases recognition of the generality of this identification has here to for been blocked by the observation that gravitational effects often originate in objects that are not in motion as motion is currently defined this obstacle is now removed by the finding that all gravitating objects are moving to uh inward in all directions and that the apparent lack of motion in some cases is due to the inability of the reference system to represent scalar motion as it us as it actually exists um okay I think we&#x27;re going to stop right there um so that is the the key point so gravitation uh or or also electricity [Music] magnetism uh they&#x27;re seen as being action at a distance and that there must be some kind of connecting force between the uh the object and the object that is gravitating toward but lson is saying that no the object is gravitating in all directions but we are observing it in this one Direction because this is our reference system because we have arbitrarily appointed this as the reference system so there is no action at a distance it&#x27;s just that the whole system is moving Inward and we happen to be observing it moving from one point to another point but uh if we appointed a different reference point uh it would also be moving toward that point um in the analog in the analogy of the Contracting balloon you know it appears as if two objects are moving toward each other but you know if you bring in a third object it both of those other two objects are moving toward that one they&#x27;re all moving toward each other it is the contraction of space itself uh analogous to the surface of the balloon uh that is occurring not any type of specific uh directional vectorial gravitational attraction so we have our whole concept wrong um when dealing with something like gravitation like that so that&#x27;s kind of what I was talking about at the beginning where I&#x27;m saying that not only is Larson um correcting the Newtonian mechanics in terms of the very fast and the very small and the Very uh uh the very large but he&#x27;s also correcting some of the underlying Concepts that we have that are also incorrect such as this setting concept that the universe is occurring within this setting of space and time no Larson says the universe is Con composed or constituted the contents of the universe are space and time and motion is the relation between space and time and matter and energy are merely two different kinds of motion and they are made out of space and time um so you know in order to accept the reciprocal system you have to be able to assume that um you can have motion without something moving and in fact that something that you get that eventually is moving is motion itself that something is motion and the motion but but you don&#x27;t need the something even to have motion motion exists before that motion precedes all the other um phenomena so and it is actually the state of rest of the universe is in motion so Larson is not only correcting the math and the you know the application of the Newtonian mechanics but he&#x27;s correcting the concepts that go back much further all the way to the Greeks and so on okay we&#x27;re going to leave it off here and start up this paper again tomorrow I think it&#x27;ll probably take two or three more days to get through this paper and uh we will uh do that tomorrow thanks for tuning in today and have a nice day</p>
