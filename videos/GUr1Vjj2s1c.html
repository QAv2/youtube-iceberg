            <p>The term is a redefinition of UFO, which is unidentified flying object. But what happens if the object&#x27;s not flying? What happens if it&#x27;s underwater? You know, you would call that maybe a USO, unidentified submerged object. But what happens if it&#x27;s in space? It&#x27;s not flying in space. There&#x27;s no flying in space. It&#x27;s space.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no air to fly through. And and this is in the best scientific tradition is create a term that generifies what it is that you&#x27;re talking about with a definition that can cover as many of the things without saying anything about what you think it is. We know it&#x27;s identifi unidentified. It&#x27;s anomalous meaning it&#x27;s doing something we don&#x27;t know what it is what what and how it&#x27;s doing it and it&#x27;s an object. end of story, you know, or in this case a phenomena because maybe it&#x27;s not an object.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a ball of plasma. Is a ball of plasma an object? I I don&#x27;t know. Talk to a physicist. But, you know, we think of objects as being solid. That&#x27;s sort of been the that has been the redefinition of of UFOs to UAP.</p>
