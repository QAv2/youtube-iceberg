            <p>What&#x27;s up, batterers? Merry Christmas, y&#x27;all. [music] Today, we&#x27;re talking about this. &gt;&gt; What they described to me is a very sophisticated process by which we may be able to interact with the entities. So, you&#x27;re saying you&#x27;ve been made aware [music] that there is a government project, maybe it was 20 years ago, that was able to establish direct communication with a nonhuman intelligence [music] and that you believe this information to be true and that and that and and that this is a reality. This is what you understand [music] to be true.</p>
<p>Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; We have established a stable communication channel. Understood. We come in peace.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Please hit that like button betters. That&#x27;s the gift of Christmas you can give me. And if you haven&#x27;t already, hit that subscribe button. All right. So, what&#x27;s today&#x27;s video about? Well, you kind of heard it in the intro there.</p>
<p>Jack Valet just dropped a bombshell that no one&#x27;s ever heard of. about 20 years ago or more. Apparently, we had a system to communicate with nonhuman entities. Uh what? Let&#x27;s jump in. But first, if you remember about a couple weeks ago, Eric Berles said this on the Weaponized podcast as well.</p>
<p>Um, I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve spoken to people who um who the intelligence community has a level of credible belief that they are that they have the ability to talk to like mentally talk to um some some kind of entities. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s a that was a conversation in my office that I&#x27;ll never forget. I&#x27;m not saying that I believe everybody that I talk to, but what I what I do believe is the people that come forward and the people that I do talk to, they believe what they&#x27;ve experienced. And first of all, if you can hear any outside noise, I do apologize. It&#x27;s Christmas.</p>
<p>People are out celebrating, so there may be some ambient noise coming through the windows here, but uh hopefully the noise cancellation takes care of that. Anyway, yeah, Eric Berles said that on Weaponized not too long ago. But then he also states, you know, I don&#x27;t know if I believe them, but they believe what they believe. Totally get it. But now, let&#x27;s jump into the clip you&#x27;re all waiting for.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There there are cases that I know uh where there were this happened in government facilities, but nobody&#x27;s talking about that. So I suspect that that&#x27;s true based on the people I&#x27;ve met but uh they were not the people who are running the program so I cannot be completely sure but what they described to me is a very sophisticated process by which we may be able to interact with the entities. Those are not the entities that are described um at Trinity in in uh in you know in uh in in my book um uh with Pa Harris uh they are not the entities that were uh caught in Brazil um that that are you know in that documentary. um they are they may be the controllers they may be the higher level entity they if if what I&#x27;m told is true the communication with them is very sophisticated and it&#x27;s complex so there may be a group that I would respect that has access to that and this was from years ago by the way. I mean that report of of that that particular interaction was more than 20 years in a in a lab somewhere in control conditions.</p>
<p>If that&#x27;s true then uh there is a process ongoing where we may be able to acquire information at a very sophisticated level and that would be you know that could be a reason for stalling quote disclosure until there can be a a rational way that we&#x27;re not confronted with something so uh overpowering that it would destroy our culture and our society. I mean, we have enough to deal with with AI these days, which is, you know, a foreign entity potentially. Um, &gt;&gt; all right. So, I don&#x27;t really know what to make of it, right? It&#x27;s, you know, let&#x27;s just start with number one. Like Jack is saying, you know, what I was told, which seems to be, you know, one of the key phrases in the UFO community.</p>
<p>Well, what I was told was, right, I should get a a merch that says that, well, I was told, right? Again, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s one of those things that big if true, right? I mean, it&#x27;s fun. It&#x27;s to speculate about and to think about, right? Um, so I don&#x27;t know, right? And what does that system look like? And how are they communicating? And who gave them a right to should there be laws for that? Like if you&#x27;re going to communicate with another intelligent, like should we worry about that, right? Cuz that could affect literally the entire planet. So should there be some sort of protocols in place that we all kind of get to decide on before people just jump in and start doing this stuff? I don&#x27;t know. I mean, people can pray to God without talking to anybody, right? You don&#x27;t need permission to do that. So, maybe there isn&#x27;t anything.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. It just seems quite unusual. I don&#x27;t know. And oh, what did they talk about? Right? How many times did they do it? What happened? Are we still doing it? Right? Has [music] the system gotten better? Is this a threebody problem sort of scenario where you know again I don&#x27;t know just it&#x27;s very interesting to think about for sure because what [music] does humanity&#x27;s first contact look like not someone&#x27;s personal contact if they&#x27;ve had a personal experience that&#x27;s one thing but humanity&#x27;s first contact right some sort of official communication which it sounds like this is what this was and if he said it&#x27;s a program right um that&#x27;s even more interesting because was the program designed for this initially or was this just like just happened to be this, right? Set out for one goal and but we ended up with this, right? Um I don&#x27;t know. But Jeremy&#x27;s about to do a follow-up question and it kind of seems like Jeremy already knew this.</p>
<p>Um because he&#x27;s kind of the way he&#x27;s phrasing it back to him, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like he already knew about this or maybe they discussed this stuff before they do the interview, which is totally possible. Um so take a look. So, you&#x27;re saying you&#x27;ve been made aware that there is a government project, maybe it was 20 years ago, that was able to establish direct communication with a nonhuman intelligence and that you believe this information to be true and that and that and and that this is a reality. This is what you understand to be true. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Um, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Uh, it it&#x27;s factual. What I cannot tell is whether that the entity that was presented was a simulation of a real entity or whether it was the real entity. Okay.</p>
<p>uh it the the the people I spoke to couldn&#x27;t probe it uh to see if it was made of flesh or in metal or or or something else. Okay. But the it was presented to them in a secure facility that I&#x27;ve never heard of anywhere else where there was structured interaction with it on a continuing basis by specialists from different areas. the the person I spoke to was an extreme, you know, specialist in in a particular discipline uh and uh not not a casual observer. And so that could be kind of one of the reasons we have to be careful or there&#x27;s a slow roll out of disclosure because you&#x27;re saying we might already have communication with some non [snorts] forms of communication or ways to engineer communication at a sophisticated level.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s also very interesting to think about the entities, right? Um and like how many different types there are. I saying they talk to the control the higher ups. This is basically communication with the higher up entities. And maybe some of these other ones are on a different level, which to be fair, some sort of a hierarchy amongst aliens is not that unusual. I&#x27;m so sorry if you can hear my dog drinking water right now.</p>
<p>He is like making so much noise right now. He doesn&#x27;t care that I&#x27;m recording a video. Okay. Yeah, just just FYI. Uh yeah, thanks [music] Mac.</p>
<p>Um but you know regardless it&#x27;s like you know that there be a hierarchy is quite normal right to be honest with you. Um but it also how do we know they&#x27;re the higherups right? Like how do we know they&#x27;re the control was that&#x27;s what they told them. Like again there&#x27;s there&#x27;s things get said in the UFO community but there&#x27;s so many other all it does is bring a thousand more questions that never get answered. They just want to say this, you know, the sensational thing. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what Jock&#x27;s doing at all.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just saying that happens a lot, right? We&#x27;re just this sensational thing that like, yeah, we&#x27;re talking to aliens, man. But like, they don&#x27;t expect any follow-up questions. Well, I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know this. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like, well, what what am I supposed to do with that? We&#x27;re talking to aliens. Well, like, okay, now what do I I just go shopping? I mean, I don&#x27;t What do I do with that? What system? What program? Right. Again, is this program still in existence? And how about that little snippet that Jacques threw out of like AI? That could be a foreign that could be an entity, right? Non-human entity. &gt;&gt; I mean, we have enough to deal with with AI these days, which is, you know, a foreign entity potentially. &gt;&gt; I mean, we&#x27;re creating AI, so I guess we&#x27;re creating a non-human intelligence.</p>
<p>is that again that&#x27;s been kind of a thing and rumor as well that that&#x27;s being used for non-human intelligence. When they say non-human intelligence they mean AI right now there is also a theory that like if we create some sort of super intelligence that that&#x27;s when aliens would start communicating with us but clearly that isn&#x27;t the case if we&#x27;re already communicating with them. And over 20 years ago, as Jacques put it, so you know what I mean, we were still on Nokia phones, [music] you know, this is pre flip phone, right? Um or right around that time. So, I don&#x27;t know. I just it sounds great, but what does it mean? And what are the implications of that? Right? It&#x27;s like, oh yeah, let&#x27;s talk to aliens.</p>
<p>Okay, but what are we doing? Right? Just like when I did my psionics u you know documentary. It&#x27;s like what what am I inviting in? What am I like? Yeah, let&#x27;s do it. Let&#x27;s summon UFOs. Okay, but is this really a non-human? What if this is real? What what am I doing? I have no idea what I&#x27;m prepared for here, right? It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s [music] it&#x27;s scary but also exciting. And I guess that just sums up this entire, you know, topic to be honest with you.</p>
<p>But look, put links down below. Go check out this fabulous interview with Jacqu Valet on Weaponize with George Knap and Jeremy Corbell. They talk about a lot of other things, so I highly recommend checking it out. I&#x27;ll put [music] links down below. And um merry Christmas to everyone uh to you and your families.</p>
<p>Happy holidays. I really do appreciate all the support and all the love and I send [music] it right back to y&#x27;all. So, thank y&#x27;all so much. And um you know, as a special little surprise, [music] I&#x27;ve got a nice little Christmas song to end the video with. So, we&#x27;ll see you guys on the next one.</p>
<p>Happy holidays. Everyday is [music] a gift, y&#x27;all. For real. Peace. &gt;&gt; Snow on the cold side.</p>
<p>[music] Plastic reindeer on the lawn. That [music] untangling wire stars. TV blaring choir songs. [music] Then the sky goes sharp and green. over [music] grandma&#x27;s min.</p>
<p>[singing] Something [music] cirled slow and clean like it&#x27;s looking for a place [music] to live. It&#x27;s a Christmas encounter. Candy [music] canes and saucers in the sky. Little [music] silver hills over houses blinking red green they drift on by midnight [music] midnight [music] Christmas lights. I think they came to see the snow.</p>
<p>Mom drops her mixing spoon. [music] Frosting drips in frozen lines. Grandpa M seen it once back in 59. [music] Stocking shake along the wall. Ornaments begin to sway.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Someone knocks without a door. Footprints [music] blooming in the driveway. They [music] don&#x27;t want our presents. [singing] They don&#x27;t want our trees. They hover at the [music] window.</p>
<p>Fogging up the wreath. We hold hands at the table. Past the mashed potato slow. [music] Peace on earth. Peace on earth.</p>
<p>They not like they already know. [music] Midnight mass and midnight vision trapped in northern light and static. [music] Christmas lights are 51. I think they came to see the snow. I think they came to [music] see the snow.</p>
<p>Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music]</p>
