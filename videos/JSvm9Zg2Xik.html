            <p>I like conscious beings. I even have a few conscious friends, I believe. But what is consciousness? Shouldn&#x27;t we have a way to find out whether artificial intelligence becomes conscious? Today, I want to talk about a group of researchers that looked at how humans can make decisions so quickly and now believe they&#x27;ve identified an essential ingredient to consciousness. The human brain is both a wonder of nature and let&#x27;s be honest, somewhat of a letdown. On the one hand, we&#x27;re capable of handling huge amounts of information, making decisions in the blink of an eye, and doing all this powered by dark chocolate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we&#x27;re pathetic with simple calculations like taking the square root of pi. Think about catching a ball mid-flight. Your brain figures out where the ball is going, predicts where it&#x27;ll land, and tells your muscles to move, all in a fraction of a second. Yet, the neurons that power this process are super slow. It takes 10 to 20 milliseconds for a signal to travel from one neuron to another.</p>
<p>Today&#x27;s computers, for comparison, perform hundreds of billions, if not trillions of operations per second. So, how does the brain do it? The new study reveals that the brain&#x27;s secret lies in its ability to teeter on the edge of chaos. And not only this, they say that the mathematics of quantum physics is a surprisingly good description for consciousness. The edge of chaos is the range in which a system switches from orderly behavior to a chaotic one. This transition regime is somewhat less poetically called the critical range and it&#x27;s where interesting things happen.</p>
<p>The critical range is where emergent features develop and where complexity arises. Take immigration policies. If immigration is generally forbidden, we have perfect order but a very rigid system with little complexity. If everyone could immigrate wherever they wanted, we&#x27;d have complete chaos. But in between the two where some immigration is possible but not all, we get cultural and educational relations.</p>
<p>We get complexity. This is the world that we live in. We seek a balance between order and chaos. This is what criticality means. And here is the important bit.</p>
<p>A critical system has long range correlations like those links between nations. To be honest, what I just said is pure conjecture. We don&#x27;t have the mathematics to describe how complexity actually arises. But this criticality is an idea borrowed from physics where we do have a rigorous definition for it. One of the most amazing examples is a Bosey Einstein condensation in which the long range correlations create a quantum state for the entire condensate.</p>
<p>But we&#x27;ve also seen critical behavior for example in stock markets as they descend from an orderly to a chaotic regime. To come back to the brain, it&#x27;s also a complex system. So if the idea of the edge of chaos is correct, then the human brain must also linger in the critical range between order and chaos. it can probably switch from the one to the other and use the long range correlations that come with the transition. In the new paper now, the authors say that this criticality is why the human brain can make surprisingly fast and accurate decisions even though the individual computational operations are so slow.</p>
<p>The long range connections of critical systems let different parts of the brain talk to each other. It&#x27;s not just fast, but part of the reason why the human brain can function with so little power. Your average supercomput needs at least megawatt of power, whereas the human brain runs on typically 20 watts. That&#x27;s about what it takes to power a dim bulb. wilder still.</p>
<p>They say they use the mathematics of quantum mechanics to develop a model for what&#x27;s going on in the human brain and that allowed them to quantify how critical the state of a brain is. They then used functional MRI brain scans from over 1,000 people and found that using this measure for criticality, they could tell apart people who were awake from those who were sleeping. It seems that criticality indeed tells us something about consciousness. What does it mean that they use the equations of quantum mechanics? I don&#x27;t know. They use these equations because, well, they work.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t know why. But I&#x27;m pretty sure that it doesn&#x27;t mean that the human brain is a quantum computer. I think that AI researchers haven&#x27;t fully appreciated the relevance of criticality for the emergence of complexity because of that&#x27;s right. It means that to get to consciousness, you need a system that can descend into chaos or as Frier put it, you must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star. To me, science is more than a profession.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a way to understand the world and how to solve problems. This is why I&#x27;m happy to work together with Brilliant, whose mission is to help you learn science in the easiest and most engaging way possible. All courses on Brilliant have interactive visualizations and come with follow-up questions. What you see here is from their data science courses which they just released. They all use realworld examples like what it means to go viral on X.</p>
<p>Brilliant covers a large variety of topics in science, computer science, and maths from general scientific thinking to dedicated courses on algebra or large language models. Just what I&#x27;m interested in, and they&#x27;re adding new courses each month. I even have my own course on Brilliant. That&#x27;s an introduction to quantum mechanics. It&#x27;ll help you understand what a wave function is and what the difference is between superpositions and entanglement.</p>
<p>It also covers interference, the uncertainty principle and Bell&#x27;s theorem. And after that, you can continue maybe with a course on quantum computing or differential equations. Sounds good. I hope it does. You can try Brilliant yourself for free if you use my link brilliant.org/sabina or scan the QR code.</p>
<p>That way, you&#x27;ll get to try out everything Brilliant has to offer for a full 30 days, and you&#x27;ll get 20% off the annual premium subscription. So, go and give it a try. I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it. Thanks for watching. See you tomorrow.</p>
