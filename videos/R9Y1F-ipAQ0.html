            <p>all right hello everyone I&#x27;m I am Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos on many different topics and we are in the middle of the unit we&#x27;re discussing the reciprocal system of theory of uh Dewey B Larson this was a theory of everything that Larson uh developed back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 but uh made great progress uh put out some books on physics and astrophysics and chemistry astronomy uh economics we are looking at his final book that is on metaphysics it&#x27;s called beyond space and time the basic gist of license theory is that uh he arrives at a universe that is uh not made out of matter and it is not made out of energy but it is made out of motion and he defines motion as the relationship between time and space time and space uh both have three uh I would say three or four dimensions and they are reciprocals of each other so they are really the same but they are in relation on a fraction uh or a ratio um in motion so uh everything is motion and uh you know and everything is expressible in units of time or space and there is also a discrete unit postulate meaning that there is a quantized minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space and uh he basically took about 20 or 25 years to develop that uh those uh that general idea in uh two postulates and then he took those postulates and he deduced a theoretical Universe from that and um then took the time to compare his theoretical Universe with the actual universe that the scientists had already you know um discovered or arrived at and you know you claim that his system basically 90 percent of his system went uh or ninety percent of the actual universe of the scientists went into his system unobstructed and it was only really on the margins the 10 percent that uh he found disagreement with and uh attempted to make uh to correct and those 10 percent had to do with the Realms of the very small the very large the very fast and the very slow and so things like quasars white dwarf stars uh uh also uh some aspects of Electrical uh the electron uh and uh you know things in the realm of the microscopic um he made uh he has different takes on kind of all of those things uh as a result of his theory but then he uh worked on his theory for uh 30 or more years after that writing many many books and many many articles uh drawing is very small following you know of a hundred or less people I would say and maybe more you know I wouldn&#x27;t say a thousand though but um but eventually he died his um his theories were carried forward uh to an extent by Dr Bruce Perrette and others uh up until peret&#x27;s death in 2020 and uh the theory I believe uh is in is being threatened to kind of Fall by the wayside and people kind of forgetting about it um and uh there&#x27;s that&#x27;s due to a number of different factors but uh that&#x27;s why one of the reasons why I teach it here is because I think it&#x27;s very very important uh especially in the you know so-called democratizing of science um we have uh with the reciprocal system if we can understand it we have the ability within ourselves to arrive at the principles of Science by ourselves we do not have to rely on some dude in a white lab coat uh we don&#x27;t have to rely on somebody in an ivory Tower telling us how these things are um the reciprocal system of theory enables us to derive our own Universe from these principles all we have to do is really become fluent in how these principles what they are and how they work and Larson gave us a great uh you know he didn&#x27;t go all the way he&#x27;s just one guy but he he laid out the groundwork and he showed how it could be done and all we have to do is kind of follow in his footsteps a little way and then like we&#x27;re standing on the shoulders of giants and we&#x27;re we&#x27;d be able to really understand this stuff ourselves and not have to rely on scientists for uh what we think is you know the truth and uh you know the healthy way to do it or the um you know the the most efficient way to do it or anything like that and so that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s important now his final book uh he would say would be um of Greater importance because it has to do with the metaphysical Realms the Realms of of psychology and uh philosophy and um religion and these things are more all-encompassing than the field of science uh I think that&#x27;s kind of what his opinion was that&#x27;s what he felt about is even about his books on economics which we&#x27;ll look at later too so we&#x27;re this is I believe the 17th episode that I&#x27;ve done on the um on his book uh beyond space and time I also did like 15 videos on his uh deductive development of the reciprocal system okay that gives you kind of his step-by-step approach uh that&#x27;s just an article it&#x27;s a long article but or it was a talk that he gave that lays out step by step how he derives it so you can kind of like go check his work on that but here we&#x27;re dealing with his metaphysical and we&#x27;re on the chapter that&#x27;s called communication general and this has to do with um uh communication from sector three so now he has uh so if you look at Einstein Einstein says that the speed maximum speed of the universe is the speed of light Larson has his uh Universe of motion so for Larson the speed of light is actually not the maximum speed it is the midpoint or it&#x27;s the neutral point of the universe and there&#x27;s half of the speed half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light half is moving faster than the speed of light the part that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light is the part that we kind of reside in this is the realm of chemical the uh inanimate matter okay and the part that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light is um we don&#x27;t really have uh you know direct access to it other than by extrapolation from knowing what&#x27;s going on here in the physical we can know what&#x27;s going on here by extrapolation all you have to do is reverse the roles of space and time okay and so this uh sector 2 this is sector 1 sector two is really what he calls control the life uh it&#x27;s where life enters where once this sector one unit gets to its maximum complexity which is DNA then it can be controlled and taken over by this sector 2 unit and they work together as life and then once life develops to its most complex which he says is like the the human intelligent human being then it actually can be taken control over by the sector three component and the sector 3 is the beyond space and time so this is I would say it has to do with the actual speed of light the boundary between these two sectors where all the relationships of time and space uh they uh evaporate because they it turns into one uh the speed of light is one unit of space per one unit of time and so everything just kind of dissolves and all of The Duality dissolves and uh you just have this realm of the speed of light and he that&#x27;s sector three in Larson&#x27;s terms that&#x27;s God and so God is the uh the thing that takes control over the intelligent human being and turns it into an ethical human being or you make made say a spiritual or um a um you know a saint or something but it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a battle between sector two and sector three for controller dominance of that organism and so it&#x27;s a gradual process and he says that very very few people have made it to the point where sector three is in total dominance of sector two uh you know sector two is pursuing survival whereas sector 3 is pursuing ethics and so at certain times the ethics and the survival they work together but at certain other times they are at odds with each other so here we&#x27;re talking about the kind of the initial communication between sector three and the Org the the life unit and um he calls that at the start of ESP but then eventually he turns that into a more generalized term in uh Insight or intuition and uh here he&#x27;s uh so this is again in chapter nine if you happen to uh have this um all of his books are online basically um relatively easy to find this one is the hardest one to find but you can find it on there okay the uh unless the individual himself has physical access to the idea or to the basic information from which he can derive it by physical processes he can get it only from non-physical sources but non-physical means and this is the Intuition or the Insight from sector three the term intuition is commonly used in a broad sense to include the entire range from the major flashes of insight down to trivial items of everyday experience and um again he goes into kind of uh some research uh other of other people but he says our finding is that intuition is indeed a non-physical process but it is nevertheless a strictly natural process not a miraculous one it is direct communication between sector three and the control units through sector three channels quite obviously much of the information obtained through flashes of insight or other forms of intuition is erroneous either in whole or in part and in the opinion of most philosophers this unreliability of the information invalidates the entire concept um but then he says unless the receiver is adequately prepared to handle the information which he receives it will not be intelligible either to him or to anyone else to whom he attempts to communicate it no matter how accurate the information may have been at the source or how Faithfully it was transmitted and you know the idea there is that the information that you&#x27;re receiving from sector three is correct our ability to translate that information into ways that we understand it and ways that other people understand it is that&#x27;s where the errors come from and so that is what has to be verified we have to verify our intuitions before they um before they are valid um and then he gives the example of Aristotle and he says Aristotle could have never received the Insight that would have enabled him to formulate a theory of electromagnetic induction way back in 350 BC because uh the he wasn&#x27;t prepared for that there there wasn&#x27;t like um us you know step-by-step process going toward uh electromagnetic induction so he says a long series of mental leaps by many different individuals over more than 2 000 years was necessary before the proper conceptual background could even be established to permit the discovery of the phenomena you know and he says Faraday made that leap in 1831 but it still took a long time to uh explain the discovery so the quality of the reception depends on the general level of knowledge as well as on the receptive capability of the particular individual concerned not because this General level has any particular significance in itself but because it determines the level of knowledge which the individual can attain by studying by study of the existing body of information okay and then he you know goes through some of the other philosophers out there and what their opinions about intuition and its validity um since only a relatively small number of individuals are qualified to receive full and complete Insight in any relatively Advanced field of knowledge and then only in a limited segment of that field the incomplete and erroneous intuitions greatly outnumber the genuine now you know that later he kind of talks about maybe delineates between intuition and insight scientific Insight intuition is more of a general thing and it&#x27;s Universal um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a day-to-day mundane kind of thing it&#x27;s open to everybody whereas scientific Insight requires a great deal of preparation before you&#x27;re ready to accept the the intuitions or the insights that you get so um you know intuition is much much more likely to be accurate than Insight because intuition is really more about you know Common Sense things things that we&#x27;re all kind of prepared to address as opposed to Scientific Insight which requires um you know a good deal of preparation before we&#x27;re ready now that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean scientific preparation it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that you have to like have a PhD or something like that in science in order to have it but it just means that you have to put in some time to to study um and get yourself to the point where you can understand the communication that you&#x27;re going to get in view of the questionable nature of so much of the information obtained by in Intuition or Insight it may legitimately be asked what justification there is for giving any weight to the products of these processes the answer can be found in what has been said about the capabilities of mechanisms okay um he&#x27;s talking about mechanisms here but the mechanisms those that have to do with physicality and so um here he says uh the physical mechanism of which the human mind is apart is subject to the same limitations as any other mechanism it cannot produce anything that is genuinely new the innovations that are required must come from a non-physical source through some form of intuition so in order to get anything new uh you know there which brings in the idea of creativity in order to get really anything new you&#x27;re getting that from your intuition from the sector 3 communication otherwise it would be if it comes from your organism your mechanism it&#x27;s already kind of been rehashed and I guess there is nothing new Under the Sun but if you&#x27;re talking about intuition from a sector 3 source that is where you&#x27;re getting the new stuff and then here he goes into the ethics the inability of philosophers to find any empirical that is physical basis for ethics is actually a significant addition to the many items of evidence confirming the validity of the inductive conclusion that we reached here um the conclusion as to the reality of non-physical existence independent of space and time ethical principles cannot be derived from physical experience they uh since they cannot be derived from physical experience they then some authors then deduce that there is no meaning in ethics um but he says um neither scientific Insight nor intuition gives us positive and certain answers to all our questions in some cases there is virtual certainty and others we obtain answers that only have some degree or probability of probability of being correct but in those these instances whatever uncertainty may exist can be eliminated by a process of verification okay so we have to be able to verify our intuitions in order to give that may give them validity to have them on the same level as kind of deductive um deductive conclusions uh this is all kind of in the realm of the inductive um now um I think we&#x27;re basically out of time here but um hopefully we&#x27;re getting to the end of this chapter and um maybe we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll start up again on this chapter uh but the next chapter is on Revelation so we will begin to start that chapter tomorrow and otherwise hope you all have a great day and we&#x27;ll see you next time</p>
