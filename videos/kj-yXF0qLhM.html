            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald abuse is founder and chair of the International Society of unified science and president trans power corporation commercial and custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company I work as a theoretical physicist and as a systems and mechanical engineer today I have two topics monster galaxies possibly exploding and the Wikipedia article on Dubey Norseman was taken down I submitted another one but that was also not up there very long so we&#x27;ll get to that in a moment let&#x27;s go look at this first one as usual with most of my screencast I&#x27;d like to go to Science Daily for the latest research news says here unstoppable monster in the early universe al ma obtains most detailed view of distance starburst galaxies says using the Elma that&#x27;s the Atacama Large millimeter/submillimeter Array the team revealed that the molecular clouds in galaxies are highly unstable which leads to runaway star formation monster galaxies are thought to be the ancestors of the huge electrical galaxies in today&#x27;s universe therefore these findings paved the way to understand the formation evolution of such galaxies now let&#x27;s come down here so they say it&#x27;s basically a star-forming galaxies but unstable clowns all right it&#x27;s really not much else in here let&#x27;s go back and I say here according the reciprocal system this monster galaxies probably nearing the end of its life but maybe not but that&#x27;s what I take from this means it&#x27;s beginning to explaining a radio galaxy in the quasar the two clouds on either side of the center maybe preliminary explosions of the matter in the center reaching the upper limit of age the conventional theorists have no clue now that&#x27;s one possibility I&#x27;m thinking about it&#x27;s possible that this particular galaxy has been absorbing a lot of globular clusters were at least incipient lobular clusters because stars cannot form in between other stars normally in a galaxy so the way that the starburst galaxies operate they&#x27;re actually simply ingesting globular clusters where the real star formations go okay let&#x27;s go to this like a PDA situation me we had an article up on Wikipedia for many years I don&#x27;t was taken down so I submitted another one and this is what I submitted of course this was also taken down Dewey Bernard Larsen November 1 1898 mccannon North Dakota that&#x27;s a birthdate in place May 25th 1990 Portland was an American engineer and the author of numerous books in the realm of physics astrophysics metaphysics and economic science scientists engineer books the universe of motion nothing but motion in structure the visible universe of the case against the nuclear atom beyond Newton new light on space and time quasars and pulsars nothing but motion basic basic properties of matter the universe of motion beyond space and time there is no employment that permanent prosperity education Marcin graduated from Oregon State University in class 90 22 long with his classmate lifelong acquaintance - pong with a major in engineering science as a chief engineer for a utility company in Portland Larson was heavily involved research activity Ford&#x27;s chemical products in the meantime influenced by the Australian born philosopher Samuel Alexander and others he pursued theoretical physics research on his own sukhiya means to calculate the inter-atomic distances of solid-state elements from first principles theoretical in the physical sciences Larson developed what he termed the reciprocal system of theory based on two fundamental postulates on the nature of space and time they mean to derive the existence of matter radiation electricity magnetism gravitation said it directly from the mentioned postulates in his books on economics Larson developed what he deemed to be a general theory we can always based on the scientific method that&#x27;s why I call it economy physics the main phases of the road to full employment unemployment it&#x27;s independent on the size of the labor force but he turned by the value of labour being at least equal to its total cost and the road to permanent prosperity the author formulation number of fundamental principles which I explained it in my paper theory of economics Larson Connor physics check that out reception Parsons work is strongly supported by a minority of scientists and engineers but it has not yet received general acceptance by the scientific community let&#x27;s find out the purpose of the International Society unified science is to get general acceptance of my god that makes his work was champion and further dog my dog turkey became neighbor the Department of Engineering at Harlow may be technological machine Hyderabad India along with dr. Vijay Kumar the department physics at the same institution as well as by individual researchers such as myself dr. Anand of usethis who founds founded and shares in a national site unified science okay so my extensions of Larson&#x27;s works that&#x27;s his first book on the theory was n mysterious universe published in 1971 recent software packages in theory are also by SATs the reciprocal system micro cosmos database 2014 there was the first computational theoretical database for the properties of matter and this difficult system macro cosmos database for astronomy and astrophysics in 2017 SATs published a new software ebook existence and interactions and computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything this consists of two files a PDF file containing 711 pages and a PPT file containing son an 11 slides thousands of equations and numerous graphs are included in this work and in 2018 that&#x27;s coming out with another software package since I&#x27;m making easy to apply Larson&#x27;s economic theory optimal economist and implementation of our surname Cano physics all of satis works are available at amazon.com and Transpower court calm sass is theoretical physics and theoretically economics website is of course for services and document ok so that does it for today we study the reciprocal system improve it for yourself the simplest possible treatment of the theory is my work in mysterious universe only 80 pages all the concepts all the diagrams are very little math but if you do want on the math to get my magnum opus existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the two theories everything suddenly eleven pages in the PDF as I said and CERN eleven slides in the PowerPoint file thousands of equations diagrams tables figures everything you need it&#x27;ll take you months to go through that and then if you&#x27;re to remove that you can get the two database modules reciprocal system micro cosmos database end system macro cosmos database reciprocal system micro cosmos database contains the calculation for all the properties of matter and includes photons sub atoms atoms compounds alloys and both material and cosmic particles the reciprocal system macro cosmos database includes the properties and calculations for the universe as a whole galaxy clusters and groups star clusters stars planets moons minor bodies like asteroids and comets nebulae and us clouds and there is an excellent Gotham docking package for both microcosm city based on the macrocosmos database so enjoy your graphs very comprehensive on mechanics general relativity conventional physics has absolutely nothing like this at all so again please say the reciprocal system for yourself and thanks for your attention</p>
