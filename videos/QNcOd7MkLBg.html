            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Just like many other crazed players grinding levels to climb the server rankings, this young man also scrambled to join the Qian Continent. But as fate would have it, during one login attempt, the young man was electrocuted and transmigrated straight into the Qian Continent, becoming Sibin, an important character in this world. It was just a pity, that Sibin was an evil boss whose head everyone and their mother desperately wanted, because he was cruel, tyrannical, brutally despotic, massacred the common people, and was also debauched beyond measure, even humiliating Saintess Vu Y, whom everyone revered, causing her to eventually take her own life out of extreme humiliation. The protagonist himself, before transmigrating here, was the vanguard leading the army to fight the boss. After defeating Sibin, he even landed a sword strike on his manhood, as revenge for the girls he had harmed.</p>
<p>Yet, times changed too quickly; the dragon-slaying youth got electrocuted and became that very evil dragon. His life began once again, from when he was still crying in his father&#x27;s arms. He seemed very proud to have this son and gave him the name Sibin of the Golden Lion family. After getting his new identity, Sibin was always haunted by the old plot. He swore that he would live a decent life, become a good lord, and love his people so that those players wouldn&#x27;t come looking to settle scores.</p>
<p>After transmigrating, Sibin also activated a system. But this was the Strongest Villain System. Sibin vehemently refused; he didn&#x27;t want to be a villain at all. But the system reminded him that he was a boss destined to die. Even though he had transmigrated into this body, Sibin couldn&#x27;t change the main plot on his own.</p>
<p>In other words, he couldn&#x27;t change the original owner&#x27;s personality from a tyrannical lord into a good person. The only way to help Sibin escape his fated death was through the system&#x27;s help, by continuously increasing his power, pushing the wheel of fate, and avoiding being hanged by the players. Sibin was speechless. He had transmigrated into a game, only to end up as someone destined to die. Could his life get any unluckier? If that was the case, his only option was to bind with the system.</p>
<p>After all, he still wanted to live. The system was quickly and successfully bound to Sibin. Afterward, he was informed that he needed to complete a series of villainous scenario quests, such as humiliating the saintess, slaughtering players, collecting subhuman female slaves, and so on. After completing the quests, he would receive rewards and the right to draw for functional rewards. Sibin thought about the scenario of humiliating the saintess, and then collecting those female slaves, and his cheeks flushed red.</p>
<p>It really wouldn&#x27;t let him do anything remotely human, and even forced him down the path of a villain. He verbally expressed disdain, but just thinking about it made Sibin so excited he started drooling. However, wasn&#x27;t it in the plot, that Lord Sibin was executed by the players after doing those immoral things? He didn&#x27;t want to be like the original owner of this body. He also didn&#x27;t want to kick the bucket. But the system reminded him that if he refused the quests, he wouldn&#x27;t get any rewards.</p>
<p>At the same time, that damned system also presented Sibin with three future outcomes. First, being physically castrated by players. Second, being forced to turn into a loli. Third, death. The more Sibin listened, the worse his expression became; there wasn&#x27;t a single bright path.</p>
<p>This damn system was clearly messing with him. Sibin felt his life was at a dead end. Struggling would lead to death, and doing nothing would also lead to death. He might as well live one day at a time and see if he could find a way to escape from this adversity. Outside, the butler was frantically knocking on Sibin&#x27;s door.</p>
<p>Now that he mentioned it, today he had a horseback parade through the streets to present himself to the people as the new lord of this territory. Sibin dutifully performed his role, but he felt no joy in his heart. Sibin felt like he was now a monkey in a zoo. The people were constantly pointing, while he had absolutely no ability to resist his fate. Sibin wore that dejected face as he made a round through the square, then returned to his palace to officially present himself to the people.</p>
<p>At this point, it wasn&#x27;t yet time for him to become the cruel tyrant reviled by thousands. So the people who came to see the new successor lord all chanted in unison the four words, &quot;Long live the lord.&quot; After the long and tedious ceremony, Sibin was finally released back to his room. He was so tired it felt as if his limbs no longer belonged to him. But he hadn&#x27;t rested for long before the series of villain quests was sent over. This meant Sibin wouldn&#x27;t be at peace for much longer.</p>
<p>And the content of these quests was also very ridiculous. First was to snatch a lollipop from a child. Next was to trample a citizen&#x27;s vegetable garden. Finally, to hang up an innocent commoner and beat them. Sibin felt these quests didn&#x27;t resemble those of a tyrannical lord, but more like those of a hooligan.</p>
<p>But the system said that because these were newbie quests, they were this easy; it wouldn&#x27;t be so easy later on, and he should understand and cherish it. After completing each quest, Sibin would get a chance to draw a prize. After completing all three quests, the probability of receiving a special reward would be unlocked. Although he still appeared indifferent on the surface, Sibin was actually craving those rewards. Well, since life was pushing him in this direction, he was forced to become a villainous bastard.</p>
<p>And so, without even taking a rest, he rushed out of his room. The dedicated butler was currently polishing a treasured sword. Sibin enthusiastically waved at him. &quot;Come, let&#x27;s go patrol the territory with your lord.&quot; Sibin rode a valiant red horse, eagerly galloping out of the castle, a very dangerous smile constantly on his face. Based on his many years of experience serving the young master, the butler immediately felt that something was not right.</p>
<p>Sibin&#x27;s first target was a chubby kid. This child had also come to watch his coronation ceremony earlier. Both of them still remembered each other&#x27;s faces. Sibin approached him with a business-like smile. &quot;Since you know I&#x27;m the lord, doesn&#x27;t that mean everyone has to listen to me, right?&quot; The kid nodded, saying yes.</p>
<p>You couldn&#x27;t blame him for being so easily swayed. Children are innocent; they say whatever they think. Immediately after, Sibin switched to a sweet, coaxing tone. &quot;In that case, little friend, can you give me the candy in your hand?&quot; This child was only a few years old and had no idea what the consequences of defying the lord would be. The candy in his hand was like his treasure.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if there were 10 lords here, he wouldn&#x27;t agree. Sibin had expected this reaction. So he changed his tune, putting on a face like the boogeyman while growling out each word. &quot;Give. It.</p>
<p>To. Me.&quot; The kid was terrified and immediately started wailing. The thing Sibin hated most was dealing with kids throwing a tantrum, with tears and snot everywhere like this, even though he was the one who made him cry in the first place. Sibin then promised the kid that if he gave him the candy, he would immediately give him two in return. Before the other party could even agree, a simulation screen appeared before Sibin.</p>
<p>&quot;Bing! Host, don&#x27;t think the system is a fool.&quot; Of course. So he couldn&#x27;t bend the rules to both complete the quest and maintain his image as a kind and benevolent lord in the eyes of his people. However, the quest still needed to be completed. Therefore, Sibin resorted to forceful measures, decisively snatching the lollipop away. The kid fell to the ground, flailing about ceaselessly before the astonished eyes of the butler and the soldiers.</p>
<p>Sibin&#x27;s mood wasn&#x27;t great either. He felt that this quest of snatching candy from a child was even more humiliating than teasing the subhuman girls. The next quest was to trample the people&#x27;s crops. Sibin chose the most fertile plot of land, where the crops were at their lushest. The owner of the field was even basking in the joy of an impending bumper harvest.</p>
<p>And yet, Sibin led a group of cavalrymen to dismount and they all competed to trample on it. The man who seemed to be the captain of this cavalry unit was utterly bewildered and turned to ask the butler, &quot;What on earth is wrong with the Lord?&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t ask me, I don&#x27;t know either.&quot; Only when the farmer&#x27;s crops were completely destroyed did Sibin contentedly withdraw his men. Seeing the farmer&#x27;s pained expression as his crops were destroyed, Sibin couldn&#x27;t bear it either. He planned to secretly compensate him later after returning to claim his reward. The first two quests were complete, but the final one gave Sibin the biggest headache.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t know how to handle it smoothly. How could he just hang up an innocent citizen for no reason and beat them? &quot;Top-quality subhuman female slaves, reasonable prices here, first come, first served.&quot; While he was lost in thought, a voice struck Sibin&#x27;s ears. As fate would have it, just when he was at a dead end, he came across a man hawking subhuman female slaves on the main street. It seemed a godsent opportunity had truly arrived. The moment he saw him, Sibin flashed a cunning smile, thinking to himself that it was lucky this unfortunate fellow had delivered himself to his doorstep.</p>
<p>And so, he was hung up and beaten, just as the script required. The reason given was that the new lord had issued a new decree: humans and the subhuman race must live together in peace, and from now on, Lam Dong City would not allow anyone to illegally trade subhumans. Thus, Sibin not only completed the quest but also moved those subhuman female slaves to tears. They all felt he was so compassionate and benevolent; having someone like him as their lord was a blessing for 18 generations of the subhuman race. Even the other citizens who gathered to watch felt that Sibin was wonderful, everyone who passed by had to stop and applaud.</p>
<p>After completing all three quests, Sibin hastily returned to the palace, and took off his cumbersome cloak. He demanded the system let him spin for his reward immediately. A spinning wheel appeared in front of Sibin. And this time, he received a set of perfect armor with the long, convoluted name &quot;Shattered Dragon Heavy Armor Plate.&quot; Moreover, because he requested the reward only after completing all three quests, Sibin also received three extra chances for a reward critical hit. As a result, his perfect armor successfully got a critical hit and was upgraded to the &quot;Hero Triumphant Saint Knight Hero Plate Mail.&quot; Although he didn&#x27;t know what it did yet.</p>
<p>But Sibin only needed to hear the words &quot;critical hit&quot; and &quot;hero&quot; to know this was a rare treasure. He immediately equipped it, then wanted to find someone to test the capabilities of this new equipment. Sibin went to the training ground and ran into the butler, Crimon, who was practicing his swordsmanship there. He seemed surprised to see the young master, who was usually as lazy as a demon, voluntarily show up here today. Not only that, but Sibin also proactively suggested having a match with Crimon, reasoning that he had just acquired a decent set of armor.</p>
<p>It was then that the butler noticed his master&#x27;s armor, which was shimmering with a golden light. This was the first time in his life Crimon had seen such a magnificent suit of armor. This armor of yours can&#x27;t be described with just the words &quot;not bad,&quot; it&#x27;s truly too wonderful. Afterward, the two quickly stood on opposite sides of the training ground. Crimon would personally help the young master test the armor this new armor.</p>
<p>After greeting his opponent, he immediately rushed towards Sibin. Don&#x27;t underestimate Crimon just because he&#x27;s old. Although he was a butler, he was in fact also a great knight. Seeing Crimon&#x27;s speed with his own eyes, Sibin also felt immense pressure. He took a step back to assume a defensive stance, then raised his sword.</p>
<p>The moment the two swords clashed, Sibin was a bit unsteady on his feet, but Crimon was knocked back. He had to use his feet as brakes, and it took quite a bit of effort for him to stop. It seemed Sibin&#x27;s strength had improved a lot; he was no longer the useless young master Crimon once knew. On the opposite side, Sibin was extremely excited to see that his strength had indeed improved. The two continued to fight, with Crimon mostly on the attack, while he only dodged and evaded the blows.</p>
<p>But that was not simple at all, as his attacks were both fast and sharp. The two fought from the afternoon until evening. Both were exhausted, but Crimon still had to praise him profusely. The young master&#x27;s new armor, combined with your own strength, its defensive effectiveness is truly first-rate. &quot;It&#x27;s because you went easy on me,&quot; Sibin replied modestly, but in reality, he was so pleased he was getting a big head.</p>
<p>He even carried that feeling of elation into his dreams that night. Sibin dreamed that he had unparalleled strength, single-handedly defeating an entire army of knights, and was even showered with praise by beautiful subhuman girls as well. In that dream, Sibin also dreamed that he was lying in a gaming pod for a virtual reality game and saw himself in the world of Qian Continent. This scene was far too terrifying, so he woke up with a start. Suddenly, that moment gave Sibin a bad premonition.</p>
<p>He felt as if he was being watched by someone. Just as his emotions were starting to settle, a simulation window suddenly appeared before him, scaring Sibin out of his wits. On it was a short notification: The players are preparing to come to Divine Light Town. &quot;Wait, Divine Light Town? That name left a rather strong impression on Sibin. He suddenly recalled a war between the Goddess of the Wild, Malon, and the God of War and Flame, the Flame Dragon Bana.</p>
<p>Malon was a goddess with lower-tier power, while Bana was a god possessing mid-tier power. Therefore, this war was unbalanced from the very start. In the end, Malon was crushed in Bana&#x27;s palm, and her divinity was shattered. Bana was also certain that the subhuman race she protected would eventually be annihilated. That was the first step that led to the subhuman race falling into slavery.</p>
<p>Sibin also remembered that a strange man had given the game&#x27;s protagonist a blue crystal. He said that this item had the power to summon heroic spirits, and that the young man had to take it to save the subhuman people and end the endless oppression against them. These fragmented memories were all from the early stages of the game. It was just a pity that back then, Sibin never dreamed he would transmigrate into Qian Continent, so he had skipped quite a lot of the introductions. But based on those pieced-together recollections, Sibin could roughly guess that after the Goddess of the Wild&#x27;s divinity shattered, she used her final strength to condense it into that mysterious crystal.</p>
<p>Afterward, that item was given to the game&#x27;s protagonist by a mysterious character. This mysterious crystal was equivalent to the game&#x27;s login client. And the heroic spirits the protagonist summoned through the crystal were the players. At first, when he was still a player, Sibin didn&#x27;t feel there was anything wrong with this plot point. But now that he had transmigrated into the game and thought it over carefully, he felt that this world was fundamentally not just a game.</p>
<p>It was very real, and there was a high probability that these plot points were in fact the truth. And he was someone who had been summoned from Earth by a deity. That villain system was also sent along by the one who had summoned him. But as for that person&#x27;s purpose, Sibin didn&#x27;t know. He just felt that despite having no talent whatsoever, he could still become a pawn of a deity.</p>
<p>It sounded a bit self-deprecating, but this was truly the highest, supreme glory. Seeing Sibin muttering in the back, Crimon, who was driving the carriage in front, finally couldn&#x27;t hold back his curiosity and asked: &quot;Young Master Sibin, this old servant has a question. Why did you wake up so early today? And even take a carriage to Divine Light Town on the border of Eagle Crest Territory?&quot; &quot;Of course, it&#x27;s to save my life,&quot; Sibin thought to himself. But he couldn&#x27;t say these words out loud, so he started making things up. &quot;I want to observe my territory a bit.</p>
<p>Mainly, I want to pay a surprise visit to the people. So let&#x27;s start from Divine Light Town, the most remote border town.&quot; Seeing the young master being so mature, Crimon was so happy he couldn&#x27;t stop smiling. He felt that after becoming a lord, Sibin was becoming more and more understanding and reasonable. In that case, the people in the territory would surely feel happy as well. But he also didn&#x27;t forget to remind Sibin not to be too shocked after arriving at Divine Light Town.</p>
<p>Because the scenery here was extremely dilapidated. Until the flying carriage pulled by that giant eagle landed, Sibin still couldn&#x27;t believe that what was in front of him was Divine Light Town. The name sounded grand, but the place was so dilapidated. &quot;What kind of job did the previous lord do? Even if the land is barren and far from the royal capital, he shouldn&#x27;t have turned a part of the territory into such a dump, right?&quot; Sibin roared in anger. Seeing the young master so indignant, Crimon couldn&#x27;t help but speak up to enlighten him a bit.</p>
<p>&quot;The previous lord was Count Calante of the Iron Wall family. He was a fanatic of the god Flame Dragon Bana. So during his tenure, Calante was always off fighting battles and fighting battles, completely uninterested in managing his territory.&quot; In his memories, Sibin remembered Calante as a fat uncle who was always laughing heartily. He didn&#x27;t expect that such a gentle-looking man would be of the warmongering type. &quot;Um, actually, the previous area of our Eagle Crest Territory wasn&#x27;t so large that we needed to use flying beasts to travel like we do now.&quot; Crimon said.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you saying I should thank him for giving me an expanded version of Eagle Crest Territory?&quot; Sibin retorted. But before Crimon could say another word, Sibin heard a commotion nearby. He followed the noisy sound and found a group of kids frantically beating up a little half-human, half-squirrel subhuman girl. As they beat her, they relentlessly cursed the little girl, calling her a lowly mongrel and telling her she should just hurry up and die. At that moment, Sibin wasn&#x27;t the only one witnessing this unsightly scene.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the protagonist of Qian Continent and a subhuman girl were also passing through the alley at that time. That girl was extremely anxious seeing one of her own kind being tormented like that. But the male protagonist didn&#x27;t let her intervene, because he was afraid her identity would be exposed. He wanted to wait until the heroic spirits had condensed to save all the subhumans in Divine Light Town. &quot;Do you want to save this one subhuman or all the subhumans in the town?&quot; Although this guy wasn&#x27;t wrong, the girl still couldn&#x27;t bear the sight of her kin being tormented right before her eyes.</p>
<p>While she was still hesitating on how to resolve this situation, Sibin had already stepped forward before them. &quot;What are you doing? Stop it!&quot; His loud shout forced those vicious kids to stop. The male protagonist pulled the subhuman girl into a corner to observe. As for Sibin, he had absolutely no intention of forgiving these kids. Therefore, he immediately applied the rule of the right hand.</p>
<p>After spanking their butts until they were red as flowers, Sibin finally stopped. As he picked up the little subhuman girl and left, he unintentionally walked past the protagonist. The system immediately issued a warning that Sibin had discovered an important player nearby. The temporary system was also successfully upgraded and had many new functions. Sibin checked it out.</p>
<p>The most impressive new function was information data visualization. In other words, he could now see other people&#x27;s information. It was just that the targets he could inspect were only those whose level was equal to or lower than his own. Sibin could also use it to check his own information. He currently held the status of a Count, and was also the lord of Eagle Crest Territory.</p>
<p>His strength was equivalent to a level 43 Earth Knight. Sibin also possessed a bunch of skills. His reputation in the Colon Empire was quite high, at 999 points. And after the incident of hanging that slave trader up to be beaten, he was also gradually gaining a reputation with the subhuman forces. Sibin was very satisfied to know he was a famous person.</p>
<p>But when he looked at Crimon, he suffered a serious blow. Because this old man not only had a higher level than him, but his reputation in the Colon Empire was as high as 13,721 points. Sibin felt as if he had suffered a blow that pierced his heart. Why did his bodyguard have a higher reputation than him? Putting that matter aside, Sibin continued to check the other functions. The second one was called Harvest Chains of Fate.</p>
<p>Specifically, each time Sibin escaped a fatal outcome, he would obtain one Chain of Fate. Although Sibin didn&#x27;t know what this thing was specifically, it sounded strange. But the most important issue right now wasn&#x27;t this thing called the Chains of Fate, but the mission at hand. He had to bring back the subhuman Saintess Zuy Y and humiliate her. Sibin felt cold sweat break out all over his head.</p>
<p>Saintess Rui was one of the biggest reasons the players rose up to hang Lord Sibin. When he was one of those players, he even volunteered to castrate him. Just thinking back on it now was enough to make him shiver. Perhaps understanding Sibin&#x27;s confusion, the system later explained to him what the so-called Chains of Fate were. This item was used to seal the fate line of the child of fate, Ye Hao, who was the protagonist and the summoner of the other players.</p>
<p>Ye Hao&#x27;s fate line has five branches, meaning Sibin must escape death five times and collect five Chains of Fate to completely seal and eliminate Ye Hao. But before that, he is not allowed to attack him under any subjective thought. As the child of fate, Ye Hao will receive the protection of the rules in this world. If Sibin hastily launches an attack, his identity might be exposed. Then, Ye Hao will directly target him, leading to the collapse of the world.</p>
<p>Apart from Ye Hao, Sibin can freely attack other players to ensure his own survival rate. Sibin was quite satisfied and found these rules reasonable. Aside from not being able to act against Ye Hao, he still had quite a lot of authority. And as the villain protagonist, how could he crush the righteous protagonist who was still in his budding stage? This was not in line with the rules at all. The first stage of the main storyline has been unlocked.</p>
<p>Now, Sibin can view it on the system at any time. And if Sibin remembered correctly, the masked girl with Ye Hao earlier was Saintess Rui. With his and the heroic spirits&#x27; help, the Saintess began to gradually take in and rescue the subhumans wandering everywhere on the border. But on one occasion, while the heroic spirits were rescuing a subhuman from a slave owner, they accidentally alerted the guards in Divine Light Town. They wanted to capture Saintess Rui and offer her to the lord.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why a conflict with Ye Hao occurred. It&#x27;s just that these heroic spirits were also fierce and unafraid of death, so they just surrounded and attacked. In the end, victory belonged to Ye Hao&#x27;s side. He and Rui seized control of Divine Light Town, establishing a firm foothold on the border of Eagle Crest Territory. Sibin, of course, would not let this happen as it did in his past life.</p>
<p>Ye Hao was directly causing trouble right before his eyes. Although he couldn&#x27;t do anything to the protagonist, the system didn&#x27;t say he couldn&#x27;t touch the players either. It seemed many in this faction were about to get their asses kicked by Sibin. So, he and Crimon went to the mansion of the mayor of Divine Light Town. At first, Sibin was stopped by a man named Goodby.</p>
<p>He was the captain of this town&#x27;s guard, an intermediate swordsman, level 13. In Divine Light Town, he was also considered a talented person, respected by the people. At first, Goodby was baring his fangs, but when he saw the golden lion emblem on Sibin&#x27;s chest, he became cowardly. This emblem could only be worn by people of the empire or a lord. He hurriedly knelt.</p>
<p>This esteemed lord, I am the captain of the Divine Light Town guard, Goodby. May I ask what your orders are? Sibin silently assessed him, he was indeed a little impressed as this was a talented character in the game. He had two skills: Sweeping Cyclone and Valiant Assault. Moreover, these two skills could be used in a combination, with terrifying power. But according to the script in his past life, this captain was ultimately defeated by the players.</p>
<p>Only then was the boss of the Divine Light Town map, Mayor Mejin, revealed. To prevent that from happening, Sibin had to be one step ahead of the plot. He asked Goodby to call Mayor Mejin out to see him. Faced with that request, he seemed flustered. The mayor, he is busy, perhaps you could wait a moment, I will call him over.</p>
<p>Sibin didn&#x27;t have time to wait. Ye Hao&#x27;s appearance here proved that the players were also about to be summoned. So he walked directly into the mansion. What Goodby called &#x27;busy&#x27; was actually Mejin being busy fooling around, with a scantily clad, long-legged beauty in each arm. Seeing Sibin kick the door open and barge in, he didn&#x27;t know his place and yelled loudly.</p>
<p>Who is it, don&#x27;t you want to live anymore? Can&#x27;t you see that this mayor is busy? But as soon as he saw the other person&#x27;s face, Mejin was so scared his soul nearly left his body. He hurriedly pushed away the two scantily clad beauties in his arms and knelt before Sibin. Esteemed Young Master Sibin, oh no, Esteemed Lord. This old servant prayed day and night to the god of luck, and you have finally graced us with your presence. Why didn&#x27;t you give a heads-up so this old servant could personally welcome you? Sibin himself was utterly disdainful of the old man&#x27;s so-called &#x27;busyness&#x27;.</p>
<p>If he had given notice, he wouldn&#x27;t have seen this scene. However, Sibin couldn&#x27;t be bothered to care about that matter. Because what concerned him more now was Mejin&#x27;s mediocre ability, not at all worthy of being the boss of this map. The guy only had the strength of a level 11 knight, with two skills: Mount and Charge, and Mounted Spear Assault. However, these two skills could only be used on horseback, otherwise, Mejin was truly useless.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was the type of person hated by both humans and subhumans. Yet, upon seeing Sibin, Mejin still had the gall to boast that Divine Light Town had been very peaceful recently. Sibin scoffed. Mejin&#x27;s sycophantic attitude had already made him very displeased. Now, the word &#x27;peaceful&#x27; coming from the guy&#x27;s mouth was even more grating to his ears.</p>
<p>Sibin pointed at the man&#x27;s face, breathing fire. Peaceful my ass, subhumans have already infiltrated your room, and you don&#x27;t know a damn thing. If that&#x27;s the case, don&#x27;t sit in this mayor&#x27;s seat anymore. I&#x27;ll be the mayor, you be the captain of the guard here for me. When you&#x27;ve understood things clearly, only then will I reinstate you.</p>
<p>A moment later, Goodby saw Sibin storming out of the mansion. Mejin was crying behind him, repeatedly saying he couldn&#x27;t do it. But no matter how much he cried, he couldn&#x27;t make Sibin change his mind. Sibin forced Mejin to immediately stand guard here and properly perform the duties of the guard captain. Even the old man&#x27;s horse was confiscated by Sibin.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Goodby&#x27;s soul flew to the clouds. Now, it wasn&#x27;t just Mejin hugging his leg and crying, but Goodby joined in the fun as well. &quot;My lord, this really won&#x27;t do. If he becomes the guard captain, what will I do?&quot; Annoyed by the two men hugging his left and right legs, Sibin yelled. &quot;You&#x27;ll be my personal guard, double the allowance.&quot; Upon hearing the words &#x27;double the allowance,&#x27; Goodby immediately stopped crying, flashed a bright smile, and agreed.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s true that material possessions determine consciousness. After giving his orders, Sibin rode out on his horse, taking the injured subhuman girl with him. Before leaving, he didn&#x27;t forget to order Goodby to prepare a clean room and a large, comfortable bed for him. Mejin watched Sibin&#x27;s departing back, an unwilling expression clear on his face. He even thought he was being pressured like this because he hadn&#x27;t presented a gift in time when Sibin took office.</p>
<p>So this brat likes subhumans, and he still pretends to be noble and righteous with me, Mejin thought to himself. Afterwards, he ordered his subordinates to find some beautiful subhuman slaves and bring them to the mayor&#x27;s mansion, with the ambition of soon reclaiming the mayor&#x27;s seat for himself. After taking the subhuman girl to be treated, Sibin brought her back to the mayor&#x27;s residence. He carried the girl straight into the room that Goodby had prepared. The child was still unconscious.</p>
<p>Seeing the two twitching squirrel ears and tail, Sibin almost couldn&#x27;t resist reaching out to stroke them. Just then, the child woke up. Sibin thought to himself, &quot;Oh no,&quot; this time I&#x27;ll be misunderstood for harassing her. But unexpectedly, the first thing the little girl said was: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, my lord, I didn&#x27;t mean to dirty your bedsheets. I don&#x27;t know how I ended up here either, I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; Seeing the girl&#x27;s pitiful, trembling appearance, Sibin was about to speak to comfort her.</p>
<p>But right after, the child was so scared she knelt and begged him not to take her life. Sibin was extremely flustered. Was his appearance really that scary, to frighten a child to this extent? I rescued you, why would I take your life? Try to remember carefully. At that time, you were being bullied by a group of brats until you fainted. It was I who beat them to a pulp and brought you here.</p>
<p>At this, the little girl calmed down a bit. &quot;Lory remembers now. But Lory didn&#x27;t faint from being hit, I fainted from hunger.&quot; As soon as she finished speaking, her stomach rumbled loudly, making her blush with embarrassment. In this situation, Sibin couldn&#x27;t be so inhumane as to continue starving the girl named Lory. So he ordered his subordinates to prepare a table full of food.</p>
<p>Lory was so hungry her vision blurred, she greedily stuffed bread into her mouth while constantly thanking him. Seeing the child eat with such an appetite, Sibin also felt happy. But right after, that damn system appeared again and brought a not-so-happy notification. It turned out that this overly humane act was not at all in line with the usual behavior of a villain. The system demanded that Sibin stop immediately, or he would be punished.</p>
<p>But after a few times, Sibin had realized that this system wasn&#x27;t too rigid and its rules could be bent. Therefore, he retorted that he had saved this subhuman child to raise her as his pawn. At a critical moment, the girl would become the one to backstab the players and the protagonist, Ye Hao. The system was spun around by him like a top, to the point of being speechless. After analyzing Sibin&#x27;s behavior for a while, it determined that the plan he just mentioned was feasible.</p>
<p>Therefore, it quickly updated his villainous behavior protocol. In the future, Sibin would no longer be warned for similar situations. Sibin was extremely pleased, silently cursing that shabby system for being so stupid. Luckily, he had already understood its fatal weakness; as long as he rationalized the motive for his actions, he wouldn&#x27;t be punished. After that, the system began to update the daily villain missions.</p>
<p>Today, like the day before, there were three missions. First, Sibin had to leave a psychological scar on 10 or more players. Next, he had to force Lory to give him a shoulder massage and warm his bed. Finally, Sibin had to humiliate the protagonist, Ye Hao, to receive a reward. Looking at these missions, Sibin was so shocked he slammed the table and stood up.</p>
<p>Lory was currently stuffing a chicken leg into her mouth. The little girl thought Sibin was angry because she was eating too much, so she timidly offered the chicken leg to him, though she was still quite reluctant. &quot;Esteemed Lord, you eat.&quot; I&#x27;m not asking for your food, kid. Also, don&#x27;t call me Esteemed Lord anymore. I am the Count of Eagle Crest Territory, my name is Sibin of the Golden Lion Clan.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Sibin suddenly had a wicked idea. Lory had just said she wanted to repay him. Then this was the most suitable time, as Sibin happened to be in need of a maid. So he invited the girl to take that position, with the promise of three full meals a day and two days off a week. Meanwhile, at the largest subhuman slave farm in town, the farm owner was frantically beating the pitiful subhuman girls.</p>
<p>Just then, a few guards on horseback arrived, saying that the mayor wanted some beautiful slaves. Seeing this, the farm owner obsequiously tried to curry favor, saying that he had just captured a few slaves, all of them glistening and smooth, who would surely please the mayor. With that said, he turned back, intending to whip the poor girls again. But this time, before the whip could even fall, it was stopped by a strong arm. it turned out the players had already appeared in Divine Light Town.</p>
<p>A person named Lin Fan led a few other players and bravely charged straight into the slave trading camp. &quot;Stop, don&#x27;t you know that human trafficking is against the law?&quot; &quot;Subhumans are people?&quot; &quot;You brat, are you here to cause trouble?&quot; The farm owner struggled free and retorted. Lin Fan was momentarily speechless; he had forgotten that this world was fake, and its legal system was nothing like the real world&#x27;s, so he decided to handle it differently. Lin Fan tossed a bag of money into the farm owner&#x27;s hands, then declared he would buy all of these slaves. Inside were brand-new gold coins.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the farm owner&#x27;s expression changed completely. &quot;Esteemed guest, these slaves have already been reserved by Lord Mayor Sibin. If you want subhuman slaves, please wait a moment.&quot; Lin Fan was half-believing, half-doubting, because before coming here, he had heard the dungeon boss was Mejin. Why had it changed to Sibin now? Could this be a game bug? However, while Lin Fan was still confused, the players following him could no longer hold back. They all drew their swords and threatened the farm owner to release the subhuman slaves immediately.</p>
<p>The moment the farm owner saw the blades, he was scared out of his wits and hastily fled. And right at this moment, Mejin appeared. Although he had been stripped of his mayoral status by Sibin, he was still the boss of this dungeon. And even though Sibin looked down on this guy for being as weak as a snail, to new level-two and level-three players like Lin Fan, the level-11 Mejin still posed a huge threat. Not to mention the skills and equipment of the two sides were also too different.</p>
<p>In that situation, they could only hope for Ye Hao&#x27;s help. And this guy, true to his role as a righteous protagonist, always appeared just in time. As soon as Ye Hao arrived, he quickly activated the skill Sacred Shield Fortress. With his support, the other players immediately became much more confident, charging straight towards Mejin together. Everyone wanted to take down the boss to get equipment.</p>
<p>Thus, the old man&#x27;s health bar dropped rapidly, and in the end, he was defeated by a Radiant Cross Slash from Ye Hao. The group of players stared at each other blankly. Ye Hao was the main character of the story, but in the end, he was still just an NPC. What kind of game design was this, where an NPC ended up kill-stealing the boss from the players? Lin Fan also found it hard to understand. They had fought so hard, and the boss only had a sliver of health left.</p>
<p>In the end, the main character rushed in to kill-steal the last hit, and he even looked so magnificent doing it. After defeating Mejin, Ye Hao looked very relaxed. He then turned back to the group of players to announce something. It was that they had helped a lot in taking down this boss. Therefore, the weapons, armor, and all the wealth Mejin had accumulated belonged to them.</p>
<p>Only then did Lin Fan&#x27;s group stop grumbling. It was fine to let the main character shine. As long as they still got rewards in the end, it was all good. So, the whole group trooped over to the mansion of Mejin. But as soon as they arrived, they came across Sibin standing imposingly, waiting for them.</p>
<p>The moment he saw the players arrive, Sibin put on a tough act, using his coldest voice to intimidate them. &quot;You harmed my guards, killed my servant, and now you want to steal my money. To cause such a ruckus in my territory, you&#x27;re really quite arrogant, aren&#x27;t you?&quot; The players looked at each other blankly; they didn&#x27;t know who Sibin was or why he was here. Because at this early stage of the game, Sibin shouldn&#x27;t be able to appear in this place. Lin Fan immediately used an appraisal skill to check the opponent.</p>
<p>The result was that apart from the name Sibin Golden Lion, level 44, and his identity as the Lord of Eagle Crest Territory, they saw nothing else. Just a level-11 Mejin required Ye Hao&#x27;s help for them to defeat. Now a level-44 Sibin had shown up, who could possibly beat him? More importantly, why was the Lord of Eagle Crest Territory here? Shouldn&#x27;t you be sitting comfortably in your lord&#x27;s castle ? The group of players began to curse out the game developers. Making players in the newbie village face a final boss, level-two players fighting a level-44 boss. This was truly making a game with their knees.</p>
<p>However, even though Sibin was a nightmare-level boss, these players still harbored the ambition of taking him down. Because just think about it, how much good equipment and rewards would drop after defeating him. Of course, they didn&#x27;t have the ability to do that. So they turned to look at Ye Hao behind them with expectant expressions. Ye Hao himself couldn&#x27;t do anything to Sibin right now either.</p>
<p>However, he was the one who had summoned this group of players here. With the status of a mother hen, of course Ye Hao had to be responsible for this flock of chicks. Therefore, he stepped forward to face Sibin. &quot;Venerable Lord of Eagle Crest Territory, I am Ye Hao. I know that you may not know me now.&quot; &quot;But I can guarantee that in the future, you will definitely have a deep impression of this name.</p>
<p>And you will also remember what a great mission I carry.&quot; It was unknown where Ye Hao got the courage to draw his sword and point it at his opponent while speaking. Sibin glanced at his profile, utterly contemptuous. Because Ye Hao was only at level 11 right now. If it weren&#x27;t for the system&#x27;s restraints, he could have jumped straight to the grand finale and sent him to meet his maker. Since Ye Hao dared to show off his meager skills before an expert like this, Sibin didn&#x27;t mind drawing his own weapon.</p>
<p>At that moment, a magnificent, blazing fire in the shape of a lion appeared behind him. &quot;I, the Lord of Eagle Crest Territory, Sibin Golden Lion.&quot; &quot;Intruders, you will pay a heavy price for not knowing your own limits.&quot; With that said, Sibin slashed a line through the air decisively. That fiery lion charged furiously towards the crowd. Ye Hao braced himself to defend. But the power of a level-44 boss was an eye-opener for him.</p>
<p>The protective shield was about to break. Ye Hao was struggling immensely, but at least he was still alive. But Lin Fan&#x27;s group couldn&#x27;t withstand this single blow from Sibin and were all killed, sent back to the respawn point. Sibin&#x27;s attack created a crater with a 10-meter radius and a depth of 1 meter. This area seemed enough to create a psychological scar on the new players.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t wonder why they had died. After all, their highest health bar was only 250. But a single, non-critical sword strike from Sibin had already dealt 3,126,782 damage. Getting wiped out was understandable. They only wondered why in a game with a proper storyline, an NPC could still go on a killing spree like this.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Ye Hao, was also panicking at this moment. He had originally planned to just successfully suppress Mayor Mejin and take over Divine Light Town. He never expected the Lord of Eagle Crest Territory to show up along the way, and with one sword strike, wipe out all the heroic spirits he had just summoned. &quot;Lord of Eagle Crest Territory, is it?&quot; Ye Hao&#x27;s face was grimy, but he still faced Sibin resolutely. &quot;You&#x27;re the one who ordered your subordinates to enslave subhumans and capture people for your amusement, right?&quot; &quot;Hey, watch your mouth.&quot; Sibin was clearly unhappy about being suddenly accused like this.</p>
<p>&quot;When did I enslave subhumans? When did I capture subhumans for my amusement?&quot; But Ye Hao was in no mood to listen to those words; he was seen bracing himself and then yelling out. &quot;Prepare to receive the judgment of justice!&quot; The sword in Ye Hao&#x27;s hand emitted a blue light. Sibin didn&#x27;t know what method he had used. But Ye Hao&#x27;s level had temporarily skyrocketed to level 45, becoming an Earth Knight, one level stronger than Sibin. At the same time, he also unlocked five new skills and two new pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>Sibin also raised his sword to defend, silently praising his opponent for being quite impressive, to have his level increase like that. Ye Hao was indeed worthy of being the protagonist chosen by fate; after this power burst, he was even a level higher than him. If it were the kidney-deficient Lord Sibin from his previous life, he would probably be kneeling and begging for mercy by now. &quot;That Sibin of the Golden Lion clan, I will show you what true power is. You are still far from it.&quot; Ye Hao charged forward, carrying a blazing rage and a terrifying power.</p>
<p>On the other side, Sibin was also ready to counter that power. But at the moment he was about to counter-attack, the system issued a new warning. It had detected that Sibin was about to perform a dangerous action and that he must immediately abandon the act of attacking the Child of Fate. So even though their strengths were comparable, Sibin was still helpless to let his opponent knock him flying dozens of meters away. The pain was one thing, but the humiliation was ten times worse for Sibin, because at this moment, the group of players had once again gathered around to gossip.</p>
<p>They were all praising Ye Hao for being super strong. &quot;Ye Hao looks so handsome holding a sword,&quot; while &quot;Sibin is just trash.&quot; Sibin didn&#x27;t know what to say either. These players truly had no filter; they dared to say anything. If they knew this wasn&#x27;t just a simple game world but a real world, he wondered if they would still be able to laugh then. On the other side, Ye Hao charged forward once again.</p>
<p>But Sibin was no longer just standing there and taking it. The system wouldn&#x27;t let him attack Ye Hao. In that case, letting Grimon handle it would be fine. Ye Hao was intercepted and began to panic. Grimon was four levels stronger than him.</p>
<p>And the players who were just cheering for him a moment ago were now all silent. &quot;Is this the knight&#x27;s code you worship? What a disgrace.&quot; Ye Hao gritted his teeth and cursed at Sibin. Because in a duel between two knights, a third person had suddenly appeared. But wasn&#x27;t Sibin a villainous boss? He could still endure a few curses. Besides, Sibin was first a lord, then a count, and only lastly a knight.</p>
<p>Who in this world has ever heard of a lord or a count having to fight alone? Moreover, Ye Hao wasn&#x27;t even worthy of being his opponent . And so, the old guard Grimon, despite his age, still had to personally enter the fray because of his young master&#x27;s troublemaking. Ye Hao was utterly bewildered by the attack of Grimon. Both his speed and power were far superior. In the end, he was sent flying by a punch from his opponent .</p>
<p>Sibin then leisurely walked over and stepped right on Ye Hao&#x27;s chest with a triumphant smile. &quot;You can&#x27;t kill me,&quot; Ye Hao said stubbornly. &quot;Who said I was going to kill you?&quot; Sibin still wore a mocking smile. Then, he grabbed Ye Hao by the collar, pulled his opponent up, and slapped him. The group of players were instantly petrified.</p>
<p>It had to be said, Ye Hao was the one who summoned them, the very belief they followed, yet now he was being humiliated by Sibin to this extent. &quot;You&#x27;re Ye Hao, right? You want me to remember your name, don&#x27;t you?&quot; &quot;You want to show me what real power is, huh?&quot; With every sentence, Sibin slapped Ye Hao with all his might. Until Ye Hao was exhausted and flattened on the ground, unable to get back up, he then used his hand. A victor&#x27;s smile appeared on Sibin&#x27;s face. He dusted off his hands and said, &quot;This lord is in a good mood today, so I&#x27;ll spare your worthless life.</p>
<p>You want revenge, don&#x27;t you? I&#x27;ll be waiting.&quot; After speaking, he and Grimon casually departed. The surrounding players could only automatically part to the sides, clearing a path for them. Ye Hao, at this moment, had been beaten until his face was swollen and he no longer looked human. Sibin strode alongside Grimon, incessantly mocking Ye Hao&#x27;s strength, which turned out to be just this much. He had originally thought the child of destiny would be some kind of invincible being.</p>
<p>He never expected him to be just a grassroots upstart. Having inflicted psychological trauma on Lin Fan&#x27;s group and beaten Ye Hao so badly he couldn&#x27;t get up, his missions were considered complete. The crowd of players stared after Sibin&#x27;s departing figure for a long time before looking at each other in a daze. &quot;Hmm, the lord didn&#x27;t take those subhuman slaves with him. It seems he&#x27;s not as bad as the rumors say.&quot; After preventing Ye Hao and his companions from taking over Divine Light Town, Sibin could finally return with peace of mind.</p>
<p>This time, accompanying him and Grimon was also the little subhuman girl, Lory. It was her first time riding in a griffin-drawn carriage, so she was a bit bewildered. Sibin thought Lory was reluctant to leave her hometown, but her answer made him ponder for a few seconds. &quot;It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m reluctant, Lord.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s just that since my brother passed away, this is the first time Lory has traveled so far alone, so I&#x27;m a little nervous.&quot; Sibin sighed inwardly. What a pitiful child, orphaned at such a young age, having lost both her parents and her brother.</p>
<p>He then patted Lory&#x27;s head to comfort her, saying that although he couldn&#x27;t change the conflict and strife between subhumans and humans right now, as long as he was here, no one in the entire Eagle Crest Territory would dare to bully her. In that moment, Lory&#x27;s small heart skipped a beat. It was the first time she realized that the Lord was actually a gentle person. They were riding in a flying lion-beast carriage, so they quickly returned to the lord&#x27;s palace. Lory excitedly looked all around.</p>
<p>She had previously thought Mayor Mejin&#x27;s mansion was already magnificent. Only after arriving here did she realize the lord&#x27;s palace was far more so. She couldn&#x27;t believe she would be living in such a luxurious place. &quot;Lord, does Lory really just need to be your handmaiden?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s right. Your job will roughly be to take care of my daily life.&quot; Seeing Lory&#x27;s tense expression, Sibin had to comfort her again.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry so much. I&#x27;m not like other nobles; I don&#x27;t have many rigid rules.&quot; As for the specific duties of a handmaiden, Sibin planned to have Chris teach Lory in a few days. She was an experienced palace handmaiden, and more importantly, she was very enthusiastic. Speak of the devil, and the devil appears. Chris rushed over from out of nowhere, then, ignoring all etiquette, pulled Sibin into a tight hug against her chest, nearly suffocating him.</p>
<p>&quot;Chris, weren&#x27;t you supposed to arrive in a few days?&quot; Sibin yelled, while trying to struggle out of that B-cup chest. &quot;I heard the little young master had become the new lord. I thought you would definitely need me. I was afraid you&#x27;d ask for milk like when you were little, so I spurred my horse on and rushed here without stopping.&quot; This Chris was not only a handmaiden in the past but also served as Sibin&#x27;s wet nurse. Hearing her mention his childhood nursing, he didn&#x27;t know where to hide his face from embarrassment.</p>
<p>Chris was truly as enthusiastic as before. To ease the awkward atmosphere and stop Chris from mentioning his childhood nursing, Sibin changed the subject and introduced Lory to her. &quot;From today on, she will be my personal handmaiden. Please take her to get familiar with the environment and the duties of a handmaiden.&quot; Chris looked at the tiny subhuman girl, asking with some concern, &quot;A personal handmaiden?&quot; Seemingly noticing the doubt in her eyes, Sibin quietly told Chris about the circumstances under which he met the girl. That he had accidentally saved her in Divine Light Town when she was almost beaten to death.</p>
<p>Therefore, Sibin also hoped Chris wouldn&#x27;t be too harsh with Lory. His intentions were very simple, but when Chris heard it, it was no longer so simple. She said meaningfully, &quot;It seems the little young master from back then has truly grown up. This is indeed a beautiful little subhuman girl.&quot; &quot;I will definitely teach her properly.&quot; For some reason, Sibin felt that there was something wrong with that sentence. But he let it go; it was good enough that Chris was willing to teach Lory.</p>
<p>While Sibin had returned to his palace and settled in, back in Divine Light Town, Ye Hao still couldn&#x27;t swallow his recent anger. especially since all the players were gossiping about how he was beaten by Sibin until his face was swollen. Before, the players had greatly revered Ye Hao, considering him the best and the strongest. But after seeing him beaten to the point where he couldn&#x27;t even get up, they began to think that the protagonist of the Kan Continent must be the Lord of Eagle Crest Territory, Sibin of the Golden Lion clan. Ye Hao was so angry he slammed his fists on the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn it! In my past life, I was a genius from an ancient martial arts family, and in this life, I&#x27;m a world-saving hero who overthrows a tyrannical lord.&quot; &quot;I am the real protagonist.&quot; The more Ye Hao thought about it, the more resentful he became. He was born with the skill to foresee his own future. The events that followed were exactly as Ye Hao had seen in his premonitions. Therefore, he was very confident that he could overthrow the tyranny, and become the hero of the subhuman race in this territory. But just when everything was going smoothly, Sibin&#x27;s sudden appearance threw it all off course.</p>
<p>Not only that, he also turned Ye Hao into a laughingstock in the eyes of the players. Ye Hao was so angry he started to cry, gritting his teeth as he growled Sibin&#x27;s name. &quot;Lord of Eagle Crest Territory, I, Ye Hao, will one day tear you into a hundred pieces!&quot; Sibin was having a meal in his palace in Twin East Town at that moment. Suddenly, he felt a vicious, bone-chilling cold envelop his entire body. After the shiver passed, Sibin was able to pick up his plate and continue eating.</p>
<p>Just then, a knight entered. Previously, Sibin had ordered his subordinates to find him some priests with some skill. But upon returning, they brought bad news. All the priests at the church had refused to come and perform healing arts. Furthermore, their bishop had the audacity to say that Lord Sibin Golden Lion was a madman, for wanting the shepherds of the gods to heal a subhuman who was even lowlier than a commoner.</p>
<p>Sibin&#x27;s hand, which was cutting his food, stopped. This clearly displeased him greatly. He had only just taken office, and his subjects were already disobeying his orders; it seemed they didn&#x27;t take a lord like Sibin seriously at all. For a mere priest to dare to look down on him like this, Sibin certainly couldn&#x27;t let this continue. He ordered the knight to find Grimon for him, to have him lead a cavalry unit to surround the church, and he himself would also personally go.</p>
<p>Sibin&#x27;s anger was flaring up, but it was immediately extinguished when Lory appeared. The little girl had now changed into a maid&#x27;s outfit, her cuteness multiplied tenfold; she was so cute it should be illegal. Seeing the lord&#x27;s dazed look, Lory seemed very worried. &quot;Lord, do I look very strange?&quot; &quot;It was Sister Chris who told me to wear this.&quot; &quot;Not at all, not at all, it suits you very well.&quot; Sibin hurriedly patted her head to comfort her. Afterwards, he handed Lory over to Chris&#x27;s care, as he had to go out to handle important business.</p>
<p>Chris promised that when he returned tonight, she would present him with a well-behaved and sensible handmaiden. Only then did Sibin leave the main hall with peace of mind. Before leaving, he didn&#x27;t forget to give Lory a valuable-looking potion and told her to remember to drink it later. Lory looked at the sparkling red potion in her hand, not yet realizing what it was, when Chris leaned in and whispered in her ear: &quot;Little Lory, it seems Young Master Sibin likes you very much.&quot; Lory didn&#x27;t understand what &quot;like&quot; meant in this context. But Chris&#x27;s words were enough to make her start in alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;How could that be? Sister Chris, please don&#x27;t tease Lory,&quot; she replied shyly. &quot;Aiya, I&#x27;m not tricking you.&quot; The reason Chris said this was because the item in Lory&#x27;s hand was a vial of Water of Life. It was taken from the Spring of Life in the Elven Royal Court, an extremely rare item that one couldn&#x27;t necessarily buy even with money. Most importantly, it was the only thing with healing effects on the Kan Continent, and its true function was to extend one&#x27;s lifespan and eliminate internal injuries. The more Lory listened to Chris, the more astonished she became, unconsciously tightening her grip on the vial in her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Aiya, my 13th husband initially used this to propose to me, which is why I agreed,&quot; Chris recounted enthusiastically. But this astonished Lory even more than the potion. &quot;A sister who looks so young has already had 13 husbands?&quot; While the two girls were back at the palace, Sibin had already led his troops to surround the church. The bishop here was a fanatic who served the God of War. As soon as he saw Sibin appear, his face darkened with anger.</p>
<p>&quot;Lord, do you intend to murder a shepherd of the gods right under His eyes?&quot; This man was named Marton, a level 38 Archmage. He was proficient in high-level fire magic, possessed the skills Sacrifice, Summon Divine Attendant, and the most important skill Sibin needed now: Holy Healing. He was the only bishop in this Eagle Crest Territory, so he was quite famous, but his hands were stained with the blood of subhumans, making him extremely hated by their race. So this was the reason Marton refused the lord&#x27;s invitation for healing. Sibin had seen through this old man&#x27;s facade.</p>
<p>Outwardly, he always preached morality, but he was just a warmonger who had also killed countless innocent subhumans. The more Sibin looked at Marton, the more of an eyesore he found him, so he spoke provocatively. &quot;No matter how you look at it, the light of the gods will never shine upon you, Bishop Marton.&quot; As soon as Sibin finished speaking, a surge of power shot past him. Although it didn&#x27;t injure him, the Golden Lion crest on his chest cracked and fell to the ground. This was a clear insult to Sibin&#x27;s status and his clan.</p>
<p>Sibin didn&#x27;t think Marton was capable of that, and he quickly discovered the real culprit. It was a hidden man cowering behind Marton. His name was Cutter, a Holy Temple Knight, with the strength of an Earth Knight on par with Sibin, both at level 44. Holy Temple Knights like this guy are the secret power of the Church. Although their numbers are few and their movements are mysterious, their power is indeed immense, something Sibin had heard of before.</p>
<p>It seems that the strength of an Earth Knight like this Cutter is the lowest among the Holy Temple Knights. No wonder the priests in the church dared to openly defy the lord&#x27;s orders; it turns out it was because they had a Holy Temple Knight backing them. If these people aren&#x27;t dealt with soon, I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;ll be walking all over me. Sibin understood this clearly, so he quickly drew his sword. Bishop Marton, as a priest, you openly defy the lord&#x27;s command and even insult me, the lord of Eagle Crest, calling me a madman.</p>
<p>According to the laws of the Colonier Empire, I have the right to execute you right now. Do you have any last words? Sibin&#x27;s tone was extremely serious, but not only was Marton unafraid, he even scoffed at him. Because he felt that the lord of Eagle Crest asking the most loyal servant of the god Banda to treat a lowly subhuman was the greatest insult in the world. Even if His Majesty the King were present, he might not agree. Sibin knew this stubborn man wouldn&#x27;t be frightened by his threats, but he had no intention of making empty threats either.</p>
<p>If that&#x27;s what you say, then your church no longer needs to exist. Sibin&#x27;s blade was now blazing with the Golden Lion flame, and he was ready for a good fight. Sibin assigned Grimon to deal with the Holy Temple Knight, Cutter, while he would handle Bishop Marton. All the remaining cavalrymen also received their orders. They were tasked with wiping out the entire church today, leaving no one alive.</p>
<p>The moment Sibin attacked Marton, Cutter also rushed forward. But this poorly hidden foe had long been in Grimon&#x27;s sights. His opponent is me, while Marton was struck by the lord&#x27;s sword. Although he was level 38, he couldn&#x27;t withstand a single blow from him. Sibin openly scorned his opponent for turning out to be just a straw bag.</p>
<p>Marton was knocked backward, severely injured. Sibin felt that with his next move, he could send him to the afterlife without even using a skill. Although Marton was in a weaker position, his mouth was still running at full capacity, ceaselessly cursing Sibin. &quot;Lord of Eagle Crest, you dare to bully the loyal servants of my god like this. Our god will not forgive you.” “You&#x27;re always talking about your god.</p>
<p>Why don&#x27;t you call your god to save you now?” Sibin said, annoyed. As for Marton, even with Sibin&#x27;s sword at his throat, he remained defiant. In the end, he himself grabbed the blade, plunged it straight into his own chest, and muttered ceaselessly before taking his last breath. “My merciful god, your humble servant, Marton, willingly forsakes his weak soul, to become a stepping stone for Your supreme power.” The words Marton spoke seemed to be not just empty talk, but a curse. Even someone in control like Sibin could feel a significant pressure.</p>
<p>As soon as Marton finished speaking, his body instantly vanished, transforming into a blazing red flame. Sibin was trapped by the flame, feeling an inescapable sense of oppression. He realized that it was the flame of the god Banda, the god of war and the Flame Dragon, who had descended. This event was completely beyond Sibin&#x27;s expectations. He didn&#x27;t think that a minor priest like Marton could summon a real god.</p>
<p>The situation was not good, as his body was now almost completely immobilized. The flame still surrounded Sibin, making it extremely difficult for him to breathe, and he finally coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood. Sibin hurriedly called for Grimon, but he was currently busy fighting Cutter. And strangely, a level 49 Great Earth Knight like him seemed to be getting overwhelmed by an opponent who was only level 44. Cutter even sneered at Grimon, calling him someone who didn&#x27;t know his own limits.</p>
<p>After a beautiful slash, Grimon was sent flying by his opponent. Sibin hadn&#x27;t even saved himself yet, so he couldn&#x27;t go help him. He just felt that this was absurd. With Grimon&#x27;s strength, how could he be at a disadvantage against that Holy Temple Knight? As for Sibin, he was still being engulfed by the Flame Dragon&#x27;s fire. With each passing minute, his life became more fragile.</p>
<p>Blood poured from his mouth and nose, and Sibin&#x27;s mind went blank. Is there really no way to escape this deadly fate in this cursed church? Sibin could no longer stand steady; he had to use his sword to prop himself up just to barely sit upright. But at the moment of his body&#x27;s greatest pain, Sibin suddenly felt a refreshing energy pouring into his body. Not only did his will feel at ease, but the burning sensation also disappeared. Even his wounds were slowly closing.</p>
<p>At this moment, a smile appeared on Sibin&#x27;s lips, triumphant. “We&#x27;ll see who is truly protected by a god.” He glanced over at Grimon, who was still struggling with that hidden Holy Temple Knight. Grimon attacked with all his might, but not once could he bring his sword down with full force. Cutter didn&#x27;t have to endure his attacks, so of course his body wasn&#x27;t harmed, and he looked very smug. because he was getting the upper hand against a renowned Great Earth Knight of the empire.</p>
<p>“Can&#x27;t hit me, can you? Then just give up and die.” Cutter&#x27;s laughter echoed far and wide. As soon as he finished laughing and speaking, he unleashed a sword strike filled with overwhelming killing intent. If Grimon were hit by this move, he might not have survived. But fortune smiled upon him. This move from Cutter was neutralized by Sibin.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t even need to look to recognize the owner of that dazzling golden sword light, so he began to sigh and grumble. “Looks like that useless Marton is dead. That guy is more of a hindrance than a help. It&#x27;s a shame the Pope entrusted such an important matter to him.” Sibin saved Grimon in the nick of time, feeling a great sense of relief. He seemed to be blaming himself for not being able to defeat Cutter, but Sibin didn&#x27;t blame Grimon for it.</p>
<p>Because he realized that this Holy Temple Knight was one of the modified ones, whose strength couldn&#x27;t be measured by normal standards. He basically didn&#x27;t know the meaning of pain, merely a pitiful life-taking weapon created by the Church, not even considered a person anymore. Having his secret exposed by Sibin, Cutter wasn&#x27;t flustered but actually found it interesting. He chuckled. “Interesting, very interesting.</p>
<p>Kid, you sure know a lot about the Church&#x27;s important secrets.” At this moment, the two eyes always hidden under Cutter&#x27;s cloak were revealed. A pair of blood-red eyes. “Unfortunately, the more you know, the sooner you die.” As soon as he finished speaking, Cutter&#x27;s body began to transform. And that transformation made both Sibin and Grimon gasp in astonishment. He was clearly in human form, yet in the blink of an eye, he had turned into a giant wolf.</p>
<p>Cutter was indeed not a normal human; he was a werewolf. It seems the Banda Church&#x27;s modification of the Holy Temple Knights is even more perverse than Sibin had imagined. But based on his appraisal skill, Sibin could feel somewhat relieved. Because this insane enhancement of Cutter&#x27;s was only temporary. He quickly shared this secret with Grimon.</p>
<p>“Grimon, his enhancement is only temporary. If we can hold him off, we can win.” As he spoke, Sibin gripped his sword tightly, ready to go all out against that half-man, half-wolf bastard. Cutter unleashed a fatal blow, trying to force Sibin into a deadly spot, but he quickly dodged the attack and used his internal energy to leap off the ground. In mid-air, Sibin quickly cast a spell that made his whole body emit a golden light. Sibin bravely charged forward, bringing his sword straight down on the werewolf, forcing him to kneel on one leg to defend.</p>
<p>His face was full of confidence because this was a very powerful move called Dragon Star Aegis. Before he was even done dealing with Sibin, Cutter quickly noticed Grimon charging from behind for a sneak attack. In front, Sibin&#x27;s sword blocked his movement; behind, Grimon was charging. He was caught in a dilemma, causing him to exclaim “Damn insects!” and he thought he couldn&#x27;t wait any longer, as the longer he used the enhancement, the more life force it consumed. Cutter became furious, unleashing his full power, his eyes turning a terrifying blood-red.</p>
<p>Cutter swung his arm, throwing Sibin far away and said through gritted teeth, “Go to hell!” Grimon was painfully kicked dozens of meters away by him. He was kicked into a wall, the impact so strong that the wall cracked and rubble fell everywhere. Cutter stood up straight, held his hands out in front, and looked back at Sibin with disdain for the previous setback. As a werewolf, he had a large body. He grabbed Sibin by the neck and lifted him into the air, causing him to struggle with no choice but to grab his hairy arm.</p>
<p>Cutter growled, “I originally wanted to hand you over to His Holiness the Pope.” He changed his mind, his hand tightening around his neck. Cutter opened his mouth, his fangs sharp, as he wanted to devour Sibin. Before he knew what was happening, Cutter took a punch to the face from Sibin, who confidently asked if he could really eat him. Only then did Cutter realize his enhancement power had disappeared. He was stomped to the ground by Sibin&#x27;s foot, the ground.</p>
<p>He smiled, his face looking terrifying at that moment. “What I used wasn&#x27;t Dragon Star Aegis, but a Time Flow Barrier. You broke the barrier yourself, so you can&#x27;t blame me.” Cutter seemed to go mad, forcing himself to stand up and shouting that his previous action was despicable. Sibin paid him no mind, quickly taking the sword in his hand and decisively severing Cutter&#x27;s head. He clenched his fists and said decisively, “For devout followers of your god like you, only beheading you can make you honest.” After speaking, Sibin lowered his sword, rested his head on it, and let out a satisfied sigh, relieved that it was finally over.</p>
<p>But then he panicked, his eyes widening as he realized Grimon was still buried in the rubble. Some soldiers pulled the butler&#x27;s arms out of the debris. Sibin stood beside them, waving his hands. “Who was it again? Ah, Goodby.” “Go get a priest to cast a healing spell on Grimon.” But Goodby scratched his head and replied, “Young Master, there are no more priests in Twin East Town.” He pointed behind him, at some headless corpses, and said, “You said not to leave anyone alive, so we killed all the priests.” Hearing this, Sibin was speechless and could only utter, “You&#x27;re really something else.” Sibin covered his face with his hands in helplessness. Alright then, go to my study and get a vial of Water of Life for Grimon.</p>
<p>He pointed and ordered the remaining soldiers, The rest of you, on my command, search the ruins of the church. Bring back anything of value to me. The two soldiers obeyed his command in unison, answering, Yes, sir. Sibin stood by the ruins to manage the work, while the soldiers struggled to dig through the rubble to bring out what was considered valuable, as per his orders. Suddenly, a thought echoed in his mind, Twin East Town is still short on people, huh.</p>
<p>Sibin frowned, thinking, In the future, I&#x27;ll definitely have to go to other territories and snatch a few priests. They&#x27;re usually not needed for anything, but when they are, they can just do their thing for me. Before he could finish that thought, a soldier rushed over, My Lord, we&#x27;ve discovered a basement. Instead of being surprised, Sibin appeared as calm as if it were nothing significant. A basement? What&#x27;s so surprising about that? Is it unreasonable for a church to have a basement? The soldier, fearful and hesitant, tried to dissuade him, This...</p>
<p>The situation down there is complicated, my Lord, I think you should go see for yourself. Beneath the church floor, there was indeed a basement. The soldier, holding an oil lamp, led Sibin down, My Lord, this way. The two of them curiously pushed open a door that had long been sealed. A scent wafted out, forcing him to cover his nose.</p>
<p>Sibin was horrified, his eyes wide with disbelief at what he was seeing. Before him were rows of female corpses, already starting to smell, their clothes torn, and tattered, some without a single scrap of cloth to cover them. The oil lamp fell to the ground and broke in two. Haunted by the corpses and unable to bear the overwhelming stench of death, the soldier immediately started to vomit. Sibin&#x27;s eyes noticed an envelope on a table.</p>
<p>The letter was on the blood-spattered table. Picking up the letter, he read its contents. Esteemed Pope, praise be to Banda, Martin greets you. The blood for this Holy Blood Ritual has been prepared. It will be sent to the royal capital before June.</p>
<p>There are still quite a few blood bags in Eagle Crest Territory, but they are hidden very deep, and it&#x27;s impossible to capture them in a short time. I implore your assistance. Also, if possible, I request that you reassign Cutter, because he is not an easy person to work with. He is conservative, stubborn, boorish, and foolish, with a personality as foul as a latrine stone. After reading, Sibin was furious.</p>
<p>One hand clenched into a fist, the other holding the letter, he slammed it hard on the table, grinding his teeth. These people from the Holy Church are truly insane. He thought to himself, Judging by this letter, the origin of the Holy Temple Knights seems to be this mysterious Holy Blood Ritual. At the same time, the blood of young subhumans is an essential medium for the ritual. It feels like a pair of hands are manipulating everything from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Why did the previous lord so blatantly round up young subhuman girls? Was it really just for his perverted hobbies? Was promulgating the Subhuman Slavery Convention his idea alone, or was there another hand pushing from behind? Did the Colon Empire attack the Subhuman Duchy really just because of the sudden outbreak of a holy war? But the more he thought, the more confusing it became. Sibin shook his head. Forget it, I won&#x27;t think about it anymore. Let it be. I haven&#x27;t even figured out the players&#x27; issues and my own, I don&#x27;t have the energy to care about the Colon Empire and the Subhuman Duchy.</p>
<p>In Twin East Town, the flame in the lamp burned brightly. Sibin sat alone in the lamplight, engrossed in looking at the few gold coins on the table. He picked up a gold coin and showed contempt. Marton, you were a whole bishop. Yet you only had two or three gold coins on you.</p>
<p>Is that proper? Isn&#x27;t this an embarrassment to the Church of Banda? Soon after, drowsiness washed over him, making him tired. He yawned long and wide. I don&#x27;t care anymore, I&#x27;ll get some sleep and deal with it later. Just as he was about to get into bed after a long day full of events, he discovered someone was lying in his bed. Sibin, annoyed, aggressively pulled the blanket off the bed and shouted, Get out here! Unexpectedly, the person under the blanket was Loli, who was still sleeping soundly, which surprised him.</p>
<p>Loli, why are you here? The little girl was sleeping so soundly she was drooling on the bed. She turned her head and saw it was Sibin. My Lord, you&#x27;re back? Loli looked truly adorable. She sat up, rubbed her eyes, and explained that the reason she was in bed was because she came to help Sibin warm it. On the bed with its warm mattress, Loli curled up on her knees, looking both innocent and also seductive.</p>
<p>Sibin was as happy as a blooming flower, wondering what on earth Chris had taught Loli. Sibin sat down on the bed. Although he was delighted, he still forced himself to say, Then give me a shoulder rub. I&#x27;m really tired today. Loli obediently and gently replied, Yes, Master.</p>
<p>While sinking into the comfortable feeling, Sibin discovered something on Loli. He curiously pulled it out. What is this? It caused a bunch of small things to fall all over the floor, and the little girl couldn&#x27;t help but panic, Master, don&#x27;t! Loli hurriedly explained that she had picked all these things up. Sibin sighed in admiration. Loli is truly a little squirrel, always hiding things.</p>
<p>But her expression looks like she&#x27;s afraid I&#x27;ll take her treasures away, huh? While pondering, his eyes lit up as if he had just remembered something. Ah, that&#x27;s right, isn&#x27;t there still that thing? The little girl Loli didn&#x27;t understand what her master was talking about. Sibin stood up, turned around, and helped Loli up. Whatever you have, just put it here. Don&#x27;t hide it in your tail anymore.</p>
<p>Loli happily and readily hugged him. Thank you, Master. The beautiful little girl, with a seductive look in her eyes, expressed her desire to serve her master for the night since it was late. Sibin was flustered when he heard her say that, thinking again that Chris had corrupted Loli by teaching her these things. He tried to use his reason to ask Loli how old she was this year.</p>
<p>Master, by human calculation, Loli is 18 years old. By subhuman calculation, I&#x27;m 16. Sibin was as happy as a child receiving a gift, his eyes shining brightly when he heard Loli say that subhumans come of age at 14. He muttered to himself, thinking that coming of age meant it was legal. Suddenly, a &#x27;ding&#x27; sound rang out.</p>
<p>It was the system&#x27;s notification sound. Detected a spike in the host&#x27;s male hormones and heart rate. Judging that the host is about to engage in reproductive behavior. Based on the female creatures the host has been in recent contact with, the reproductive partner is determined to be the handmaiden Loli. Warning: Loli&#x27;s constitution is extremely weak.</p>
<p>If reproductive behavior is forced, it will cause irreparable damage. For the specific reason, the host is advised to check. The host is advised to improve Loli&#x27;s physique before continuing with reproductive behavior. Hearing this, he was completely disappointed and let his arms fall from Loli&#x27;s body. Sibin threw himself onto the bed, causing Loli to worry.</p>
<p>The bed warming isn&#x27;t done yet. The little girl still tried to explain, Miss Chris said I have to hug you, and... and I have to... Faced with such tempting words, he couldn&#x27;t be more desperate. All guilt, morality, conscience, and reason stopped Sibin from any further action, and now all he could do was cover his face with his hands and cry.</p>
<p>You must have misunderstood. Warming the bed like this is fine. After a long night, light shone through the window, brightening the room. After a sleepless night, his eyes had dark circles. Sibin tiredly complained to the system that he wanted to claim his reward.</p>
<p>The system displayed a notification: Host has completed all daily tasks. Announcing the reward. This made him sit up straight, eagerly awaiting the reward and curious about what it would be. Congratulations to the host for receiving a Minotaur Warrior. The reward will be delivered in a reasonable manner.</p>
<p>The host is advised to prepare an open space. This reward did not trigger a critical hit. Please continue to work hard. But hearing this, he could only sigh. No critical hit.</p>
<p>Then, he suddenly became unusually excited and happy. Although there&#x27;s no critical hit, this is a Minotaur, an elite unit of the Beastman Empire. A natural heavy infantryman, with a status equivalent to the Crusaders of the Colon Empire. Their overall strength is around that of a Great Knight. While wondering what &#x27;delivered in a reasonable manner&#x27; meant, the system emitted a blue light, which made Sibin curious.</p>
<p>A warrior appeared before him. The light dazzled him, and in his mind, he had already guessed what it was. Before his eyes was the Minotaur Warrior the system had just mentioned. He was tall and large, with a fierce gaze, holding a large axe in his hand. All of this was mostly within Sibin&#x27;s expectations.</p>
<p>That Minotaur&#x27;s name was Karg, a Minotaur Warrior of the Bloodhoof clan with skills including Primal Charge, War Stomp, and Sundering Cleave. He spoke, expressing his loyalty, The Bloodhoof clan will serve you, my Lord. These Minotaurs came from another world, not the native Minotaurs of the Cana continent. A knock sounded at the door. It was Loli, carrying a pastry and a glass of water for Sibin&#x27;s breakfast.</p>
<p>Before Sibin could understand, he quickly shouted, Loli, wait a moment, don&#x27;t open the door! Just as she stepped in, Loli&#x27;s eyes were met with the massive body of the Minotaur. Hello, strange little human. He scared the little girl so much she was frightened out of her wits. Karg yelled at Ben that he was an idiot for scaring her away. Karg consoled and sincerely apologized to Sibin, who had his face in his hands.</p>
<p>My Lord, I&#x27;ve caused you trouble. Ben is actually a very gentle person, he meant no harm. Sibin thought it was just excessive shock. The people in the castle don&#x27;t know you guys, so it&#x27;s unavoidable they&#x27;d be scared seeing you for the first time. They&#x27;ll get used to it later.</p>
<p>Loli was still passed out from being so terrified by the people she had seen. Sibin sent someone to lead you guys to familiarize yourselves with the territory first, get to know the people in the castle, and then I will arrange work for you. The group of Minotaurs cheered, shouting and showing their determination when they heard Sibin say, Don&#x27;t worry, my territory is on the empire&#x27;s border. There will be wars to fight in the future, you won&#x27;t be stuck guarding the castle every day. He got angry at the noise because they were shouting too loudly.</p>
<p>Loli woke with a start, her eyes still full of fear. Seeing this, he asked Loli, Oh, Loli, you&#x27;re awake? Loli, dazed, reported to her master that there were monsters in the castle. The monsters are very big and terrifying, Loli only comes up to their knees. Loli hugged Sibin in fear, urging, We have to run, Master! If we run into the monsters on the way, just let Loli feed them, then Master must take the chance to run for it. Quickly.</p>
<p>Sibin hugged the little girl tightly and joked, I don&#x27;t know if there are monsters in the castle, but right now I&#x27;m the monster who&#x27;s going to eat you up. Lory rested her head on his chest, feeling somewhat at ease. In the middle of the romantic moment, Goodbye burst in to announce that an urgent letter had arrived for you, ruining the good moment between the two. Seeing the two of them being intimate, Goodbye also froze, feeling like he had ruined a good thing. Lory, being both beautiful and considerate, said, Master, please go ahead with your work, Lory will leave first, I still have to go to Miss Chris for my studies.</p>
<p>Lory shyly ran out the door. Goodbye explained that he didn&#x27;t see anything, didn&#x27;t see anything at all, and that he had left the letter on the floor, my Lord. The letter lay sprawled on the floor while Sibin angrily yelled, Get back here. Sibin pointed at Goodbye with a look in his eyes, That&#x27;s right, the soldiers have had heavy duties recently, you will wash the soldiers&#x27; underwear and socks for a whole month. He reluctantly rubbed his head and nodded, Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p>Sibin reached out and picked up the letter from the table, reading it carefully. Dear Lord of Eagle Crest, my Black River Territory is under attack by beastmen, I hope to receive aid from the Lord of Eagle Crest neighboring territory. After reading, Sibin&#x27;s mind was filled with thoughts. He imagined the scene of Telambo kneeling at his feet begging and couldn&#x27;t be happier, feeling smug. Black River Territory is being attacked by beastmen, so this is a letter requesting aid.</p>
<p>Black River Territory is located below Eagle Crest Territory, right next to Divine Light Town. It also serves as a shield against the beastmen. The principle of &#x27;when the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact&#x27; is something I understand very well. I must definitely help, but I also have to take this opportunity to settle some scores. While he was busy thinking, the system notification popped up, Daily Villain Mission has been updated.</p>
<p>Villain Mission One is to steal the socks of any handmaiden in the castle. Villain Mission Two, plunder supplies worth 10,000 gold coins or more from a neighboring territory. Villain Mission Three, tease the Subhuman Saintess. Sibin frowned in annoyance and resentment, Great, this damn system knows I&#x27;m about to go put Telambo in a tough spot, and also meet the players, right? It&#x27;s even directly making me go tease the Subhuman Saintess. Lory was bathing in the tub, comfortably enjoying a relaxing moment.</p>
<p>Sibin stood outside, dressed in black with his face covered, leaving only his eyes visible, complaining that the damn system was dumping all its perverted tasks on him. A dignified lord having to steal socks. There are a total of two handmaidens here, I can&#x27;t steal from Chris, so I can only steal from Lory. As Lory stepped out of the bathtub, she immediately saw Sibin standing right there. The little girl screamed, Pervert! Lory, terrified, squeezed her eyes shut and cried out, Help! Suddenly, a bath towel was thrown straight into her face.</p>
<p>Hearing the cry for help, Goodbye rushed over with a few soldiers, Someone&#x27;s crying for help, hurry up. Sibin, hiding in the corner by the wardrobe, complained that it was Goodbye again. He doesn&#x27;t come early, he doesn&#x27;t come late, why does it have to be such a coincidence. He slammed the door open and said loudly, What&#x27;s going on here, where&#x27;s the pervert. But the scene before him was not what he had imagined.</p>
<p>Sibin was caressing Lory in his arms and comforting her, Don&#x27;t be afraid, I&#x27;ve already chased the pervert away. Goodbye listened to him scold for a while, Goodbye, security in Twin East Castle must be strengthened. To think you let a pervert break in here. If this lord hadn&#x27;t driven him away in time, the consequences would be unimaginable. Taking that opportunity, Sibin took further revenge, It seems that making you wash underwear and socks for a month was a bit too light.</p>
<p>Now I&#x27;m increasing it to three months, you don&#x27;t have any objections, do you? Goodbye could only accept and reply, No objections. He breathed a sigh of relief for not being discovered, otherwise his lifetime of integrity would have been ruined. Hearing this, Lory smiled and whispered in his ear, Actually, Master doesn&#x27;t need to be so sneaky. If you like them, Lory can just give them to you, Master. Sibin broke out in a cold sweat, Wait, she hasn&#x27;t discovered something, has she? Lory, let me explain.</p>
<p>At this moment in Black River Territory, the leader of Black River Territory, Telambo, was holding Sibin&#x27;s reply letter. He was angrily shouting at his subordinates about the things Sibin demanded in exchange for helping fight the beastman tribe. But what made the old leader of Black River so furious that he cursed Sibin as a bastard was that he dared to say, if he couldn&#x27;t provide the things Sibin demanded, he could write an IOU. After saying this, the leader of Black River Territory tore Sibin&#x27;s reply letter to shreds. Telambo was furious and said that if Black River Territory falls, the next place to face disaster would be Eagle Crest Territory, doesn&#x27;t Sibin know that? As soon as he finished speaking, the leader of Black River Territory kicked a close subordinate, sending him tumbling to the ground.</p>
<p>In his hand now was a sword with a dazzling light. As he approached the subordinate, he uttered threats because Dac had dared to secretly cut taxes behind his back. If he couldn&#x27;t come up with a solution today, he would have his head rolling in the fields. Dac, with a trembling voice, leaned close to the ear of the Black River Territory leader, to propose his dirty scheme, which greatly pleased the old man. On the other side, Sibin had already ridden out with his entire army to quell the beastman tribe&#x27;s rebellion.</p>
<p>with a brilliant aura spreading across the map. After traveling for a while, Grimon the butler felt that something was wrong. According to the original objective, they were supposed to go reinforce Black River Territory. But the direction they were heading was towards Divine Light Town. Sibin explained that the beastmen are fierce and skilled in combat; if they went now, they would just get beaten up.</p>
<p>So now we&#x27;re going to Divine Light Town to &#x27;borrow arrows with straw boats&#x27;. Sibin&#x27;s answer made Butler Grimon wonder silently. He thought that Young Master Sibin was having one of his fits again and talking nonsense. nonsense. At Divine Light Town, another player named Lin Fan was gambling happily with other guards on the city wall.</p>
<p>They talked about the easy life since capturing Divine Light Town. All they had to do was sit around and wait for the time to come, then go see the Saintess to collect their reward without any effort. While they were all immersed in the joy of idleness, Sibin appeared behind them. In a teasing tone, he said, Gambling on the city wall, neglecting your duties, aren&#x27;t you? The blond-haired soldier replied, You can&#x27;t do missions for a lifetime. You can&#x27;t level up, and you don&#x27;t get good equipment.</p>
<p>So we just hide on the city wall and gamble the days away. Sibin said, What if the Lord of Eagle Crest comes here again, what would you do? The blond-haired man replied again with a mocking tone, If that Lord of Eagle Crest comes here, I&#x27;ll take him down. As soon as he finished the sentence, Sibin slammed the sword in his hand down right next to where the blond-haired man was sitting, kicking up dust all around his feet, then lightly sat down, placing one hand on the sword. He placed his other hand on the blond-haired soldier&#x27;s shoulder. Sibin gave a slight smile and said: Go on, try and take me down.</p>
<p>This sentence made Lin Fan and the others gasp in horror. The blond-haired man&#x27;s face turned purple, and he was speechless. After composing themselves, Lin Fan and his group announced to all the soldiers and citizens in the city, The Lord of Eagle Crest is here for business again. The entire army in the city stood stunned, as if they still hadn&#x27;t realized what was happening. Inside the city&#x27;s temple, the Saintess, along with the child of destiny, Ye Hao, were shocked and surprised by Sibin&#x27;s reappearance.</p>
<p>Beads of sweat rolled down both their faces. The Saintess clasped her hands together, her face sorrowful as she lamented to the gods: Oh gods, must my people face war again? As for Ye Hao, in contrast to the sorrowful Saintess, he angrily swung his sword. A flash of light was seen, and a tree was cut in two. With an angry expression, he said: I haven&#x27;t even come looking for you, and you&#x27;ve come looking for me, Lord of Eagle Crest. Today, I will show you the consequences of daring to mess with me, Ye Hao.</p>
<p>An army in solemn helmets and armor, with cold expressions, stood waiting for orders after Ye Hao&#x27;s arrogant declaration. Up on the city wall, Sibin remained nonchalant as if nothing had happened. His hand holding the sword pointed straight at Lin Fan&#x27;s group. Following behind him was his Bull Demon King army. In a simple room inside the city, outside the window was a crowd of people watching the drama unfold.</p>
<p>The room was filled with a somber atmosphere, a frightening silence. To break the atmosphere, Sibin crossed his legs, stated the purpose of his visit today, and made a proposal in a pleasant and cheerful tone. In contrast to Sibin&#x27;s calm and cheerful demeanor, Saintess Rui, as if she had springs on her bottom, shot up from her chair and slammed her hand on the table. Her face showed clear anger at Lord Sibin&#x27;s proposal. At this point, Sibin saw that negotiation was impossible and decided to lay his cards on the table with Rui.</p>
<p>Sibin stood up and moved close to Rui, suppressing her recent angry momentum. With a stern gaze, he said: This is me ordering you and your army to comply, not coming to ask for your opinion. Rui and her companions can negotiate terms with me, but you have no right to refuse. Otherwise, I will raze Divine Light Town to the ground and throw you and your subhuman tribe out into the fields. Sibin continued, as if reminding Rui that Divine Light Town is currently a part of Sibin&#x27;s Eagle Crest Territory, not the subhuman tribe&#x27;s.</p>
<p>Rui, with the faint light of a saintess, her face somewhat resentful, retorted to Sibin&#x27;s assertive reminder: This place was also once the country of the subhumans. So I am only asking for a home for my people to live in. Why is such a small request of mine so difficult for Sibin to grant? Sibin said in a mocking tone: Rui, you are so naive and adorable. The subhuman nation was destroyed long ago. All the land now belongs to me, and I have no obligation to give Divine Light Town to you and your bunch of subhumans.</p>
<p>Sibin then raised his hand to lift Rui&#x27;s chin and teased: If Rui agrees to follow me and join my harem, Sibin will consider not using your subhuman tribe as cannon fodder in the upcoming battle, and Sibin might even give you the entire Divine Light Town. At this moment, the system appeared and announced that Sibin&#x27;s mission to tease the Subhuman Saintess was complete, interrupting Sibin&#x27;s teasing. Ye Hao rushed forward with a &#x27;I&#x27;ve had enough of you&#x27; look on his face, thinking he would teach Sibin a lesson to show off in front of the Saintess and the crowd of onlookers outside the window. In response to Ye Hao&#x27;s posturing, Sibin just glanced at him with sharp eyes, and casually swung his hand. How could he possibly block it? It sent Ye Hao tumbling to the ground before he could even react.</p>
<p>The slap left a bright red handprint on Ye Hao&#x27;s face. Ye Hao fell unconscious, drool splattering all over the floor. Sibin once again taunted: Ye Hao, it&#x27;s only been a few days, and you&#x27;re already missing Sibin&#x27;s slap. This was accompanied by a reminder to everyone in the room not to forget that he still had an entire army of large, imposing bull-men waiting outside for his command. Sibin didn&#x27;t want to argue with Rui and her subhuman tribe anymore, deciding to repeat himself one last time: either her subhuman tribe acts as cannon fodder for Sibin, and he will agree to Rui&#x27;s conditions, entrusting Divine Light Town to her, or they could wait for his Bull Demon King army to level the entire Divine Light Town, giving her and all the subhumans 10 minutes to think.</p>
<p>As he spoke, Sibin turned and walked towards the door, casually throwing something he had just used to wipe his hands onto the ground. The drop was so powerful it created a trail of white smoke as it fell. At this point, the group of subhumans in the room waited until Sibin&#x27;s figure was out of sight before approaching to see what he had just thrown. Ah, it turned out to be a white sock. They all felt that Sibin was a real pervert for using a sock that had already been worn to wipe his hands.</p>
<p>Feeling extremely embarrassed for mistakenly using a sock instead of a handkerchief to wipe his hands, but not wanting to lose face, nor let the brilliant aura he had created so far fade, Sibin still calmly walked outside under the gaze of the subhuman tribe. He reassured himself inwardly: Stay calm, as long as you&#x27;re not embarrassed, others will be. &quot; While he was feeling so, so, so very embarrassed, another player suddenly appeared and blocked Sibin&#x27;s path. This player&#x27;s name was Avatar, a level-one apprentice mage. Avatar said they agreed to the condition Sibin had proposed, but in return, Sibin also had to agree to their condition: to return Divine Light Town and swear to the gods that he would not take it back.</p>
<p>Sibin smirked and asked: Avatar, is this the will of the subhuman subjects or the will of the Saintess? Avatar pointed at Sibin, who was standing in front of him, placed a hand on his hip, and said loudly: Their will is also the will of the Saintess. Sibin then let out a sigh of relief and said: Alright, although I don&#x27;t follow any faith, I will swear on my honor as a knight. If the subhuman tribe is willing to fight for me with all their heart and soul, I will return Divine Light Town to them after the battle is over. After speaking, Sibin made a fist and lightly thumped it against his chest, the thump making an audible sound to represent the promise made on his own honor. On the other side, Avatar suddenly remembered the rumors about Sibin and threw words at him like a splash of cold water, having heard that the Lord of Eagle Crest was not someone who cared about a knight&#x27;s honor as Sibin had been pretending to all this time.</p>
<p>In situations like this, all Sibin needed was a confident smile, a hand on his chest, and the radiating light of a villainous star. He continued to defend himself: First, I was a knight, then a lord, and finally, I became an earl, so Sibin will use his own life to protect the honor of a knight. From inside the room, Rui spoke up and ran out. The people in the room now watched her every movement with surprised eyes, under the sunlight that caressed her skin. Her hair under the headscarf accentuated her saintly beauty.</p>
<p>Rui placed one hand on her chest as if to express that what she was about to say came from her whole heart. She knew that everyone in the subhuman tribe was doing this for their territory, but not everyone needed to agree to sacrifice their lives like this. As she spoke, Rui extended her other hand as if demonstrating the heart of a leader: I am a Saintess, I will certainly not stand by and watch all the subhumans walk into danger. From inside the house, an objection also came from Ye Hao, although the five-finger mark from Sibin&#x27;s earlier slap was still visible on his face. &quot;Although everyone can be revived after death, their power will be severely reduced.</p>
<p>At that point, how can the subhuman tribe fight against the boss? &quot; Ye Hao walked into the middle of the subhuman tribe, saying as he went: They were all summoned by him, so Ye Hao will not allow the subhuman tribe to join the team of Sibin. &quot; Sibin leaned in and whispered to Rui: &quot;You don&#x27;t manage this place too badly, it&#x27;s just that you have too many trash teammates around you.&quot; This made Ye Hao&#x27;s blood boil with anger, but he suddenly saw Sibin extend his hand and smile sinisterly. Ye Hao immediately used his hand to cover the cheek that had just been &quot;caressed&quot; by Sibin, which still bore the red five-finger mark. At this moment, all players in the area received a notification from the system: Mission to follow the Lord of Eagle Crest, Sibin, and quickly reinforce Black River Territory. All the players were surprised because they had been in the game for a long time and had never seen a boss who could also assign them missions.</p>
<p>Thus, Sibin&#x27;s goal of finding reinforcements to fight the beastmen was accomplished. Sibin, mounted on his horse with sword in hand, advanced with his army towards Black River Town. At Black River City, the Lord of Black River, along with his close attendant and all the subjects in the city, came out to welcome Sibin and his reinforcement army. Sibin had just dismounted, his feet not yet fully on the ground, when the Black River leader came before him, welcoming Sibin and his army to Black River. Thanking him for Sibin&#x27;s timely reinforcement.</p>
<p>Sibin just tossed the horse&#x27;s reins to the Black River leader, gave a cold &quot;hmm,&quot; and walked straight inside. Leaving him alone, and even the horse beside him threw him a look of disgust, leaving him standing there stunned, still not knowing what was happening. Inside the palace, Sibin was sitting with his hands clasped in front of his chest and told the Lord of Black River, Telambo, that he didn&#x27;t have much time to waste words with Telambo, so he should now report all information related to the beastmen tribe to Sibin. The Lord of Black River, Telambo, clasped his hands in front of his chest in a gesture of obedience and said to the guard: Quickly bring the relevant item for Sibin. The soldier was gone for a while, then brought a map, spread it out in front of Sibin, and said to him: This is the map of Black River Territory.</p>
<p>And three days ago, an army of the beastmen tribe came to invade and destroyed almost this entire place. Looking at the map, the guard said: Near Black River Territory, there is a village called Kater where more than 6,000 beastmen tribe soldiers are currently stationed. And the human race has about 50 people. This army is extremely mobile; Black River has sent troops to attack many times but always failed. The guard pointed to a corner of the map and listed names like Wild Dog, Luser, and Ironstone as the names of villages near Black River that had not yet been occupied.</p>
<p>Sibin rested his chin on his hand with a thoughtful expression, as if devising some plan for the upcoming battle related to Ironstone Village. Scene change to Ironstone Village. In the distance, a mountain range is hazy in the mist. Below is a sparkling turquoise river, reflecting the sunlight, flowing from the canyons at its source down to the lower reaches. It divides a lush green prairie into two separate banks, with two different tribes living on them.</p>
<p>A soldier from the beastman army rushed frantically into a tent, announcing that the human tribe&#x27;s army had attacked their camp. The beastman tribe leader, Blood Fang, was sitting and holding a very large leg of meat. After hearing the news from his subordinate, his expression was surprised. How could the human tribe know where his beastman tribe was located? On the other side of the river, Sibin, along with butler Grimon and Telambo of Black River, were standing and looking towards the beastman camp. Telambo suddenly spoke up and asked Sibin why he knew the beastman army was hiding in Ironstone Village.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Sibin lowered his binoculars, turned to Telambo, and called him an idiot. Then he told butler Grimon to tell Telambo his thoughts. Butler Grimon, in his elegant suit, raised one finger and said that Ironstone Village is near Black Stone Town, with the advantage of waterways that can transport more supplies than the other two villages, and it is also a convenient route for an attack if one follows this river. Facing Sibin now was a beast tribe cavalryman from the other side of the battle line, riding a white wolf and relaying the words of leader Blood Fang, who would give Sibin and his army a chance to live if Sibin agreed to surrender immediately. On this side, due to the difference between humans and beasts, Sibin had a blank face because he didn&#x27;t understand what the other side was yelling at all.</p>
<p>At this moment, Telambo&#x27;s green-haired confidant, Dac, took the opportunity to flex about himself, having graduated with honors from the butler academy, and asked for permission to interpret. In the middle of his sentence, Sibin cut him off, raising a hand and mercilessly refusing. After speaking, Sibin drew an arrow and pulled his bow taut. The brightly glowing arrow was charged for a long time. Sibin suddenly released the arrow before the astonished eyes of the beastman cavalryman.</p>
<p>The arrow flew straight into the middle of the beastman cavalryman&#x27;s forehead, knocking him off his mount. falling backward. Seeing his kinsman fall dead at his feet, the beastman leader angrily raised his weapon, and charged with his comrades to prepare for battle with the command &quot;Strawberry syrup and glory to the beastman legion, kill all humans.&quot; Now on the vast green prairie, under the harsh sun, both armies of Sibin and the beastmen were preparing for a fierce clash to break out. The beastman tribe charged forward with a mix of roars and growls, and the deafening sound of horns, displaying their bloodlust. On this side, Sibin calmly observed every step of the beastman tribe&#x27;s advance.</p>
<p>One hundred paces, then eighty paces. In contrast to Sibin&#x27;s calm and composed demeanor, Telambo was sweating bullets, frightened, and gritted his teeth, saying, &quot;The beastman tribe is attacking, what should we do? Realizing the time was near, Sibin finally gave the order for the entire army to prepare to engage. Archers, prepare to fire. Following that, the magic corps of the mutant tribe, attack freely with your magic. As soon as Sibin&#x27;s command ended, red streaks like meteors could be seen in the sky, hurtling towards the beastman tribe and the goblin army.</p>
<p>They could only stare blankly at the sky, their faces dazed as if they still didn&#x27;t know what was happening, until every arrow, every wave of magic, landed in the middle of their formation, and the beastman tribe finally realized they were being attacked. One by one, they fell with terrified screams. Sibin&#x27;s army charged forward bravely. One goblin was struck by a player with an axe in the torso, while another was pierced through the chest by a sword, screaming in pain. From behind the axe-wielding player, a tall, six-packed beastman appeared, with eyes as red as syrup, long and ferocious fangs, using the great bamboo-splitting technique.</p>
<p>Sibin, along with Grimon and Telambo, stood behind the battle lines, observing the fierce battle unfolding. Noticing the situation was not favorable, Sibin looked towards Telambo and invited him to lead his knight legion to charge forward with Sibin&#x27;s army to drive out the beastmen. Sibin added that if Telambo dared to pull any tricks in this battle, his fate would be worse than that of the beastman tribe. This made Telambo sweat bullets, his hands clenching and unclenching nonstop as he repeatedly exclaimed, &quot;No, no.&quot; Sibin shouted, &quot;Fortress of Glory!&quot; A golden light enveloped Sibin. The entire army was now bathed in Sibin&#x27;s aura, their defense and attack power greatly increased.</p>
<p>Sibin, now looking like a true lord, said, &quot;Knights, follow me and charge into the enemy&#x27;s tents. Swordsmen, follow behind and launch sneak attacks. Everyone be careful and watch out for encirclement by the beastman tribe&#x27;s soldiers. The entire army, in unison, raised their flags and weapons, shouting as one. The roar echoed across the sky.</p>
<p>The shout seemed to make their morale soar even higher. Sibin, sword in hand, charged forward. A streak of light shaped like a lightning bolt was seen trailing behind Sibin, piercing through the goblins&#x27; bodies and splitting them in two. Behind Sibin, the chieftain of the beastman tribe appeared. He rode a lion, slowly approaching Sibin.</p>
<p>A deadly aura emanated from the beastman chieftain, dyeing the scene red. The system displayed the beastman chieftain&#x27;s information. Name is Biden, commonly known as Blood Fang, a tribal chieftain Level 42. Sibin and Blood Fang charged at each other. At this moment, only the sound of weapons clashing remained.</p>
<p>Sparks flew with each impact. Just when it seemed the battle would be intense, in less than three moves, Blood Fang was sent flying by Sibin&#x27;s sword. His weapon was also knocked into the air. Although defeated at Sibin&#x27;s feet, Blood Fang still spoke aggressively, &quot;Although Sibin is very strong, Sibin&#x27;s army is gradually being depleted. The beastman team&#x27;s reinforcements are still numerous.&quot; After speaking, Blood Fang took out a small white horn.</p>
<p>Realizing Blood Fang intended to call for more allies. Sibin wanted to stop Blood Fang, but it was too late. Blood Fang held the horn and blew a long note, and a red circle appeared. From the void, a giant beast with red eyes and long, ferocious fangs slowly emerged. An unlucky knight was caught by it and could only cry out miserably.</p>
<p>Cries of &quot;Help, help&quot; rang out, &quot;Help, save me!&quot; But everyone around could only stand there, stunned and gaping in fear, &quot;By the gods above!&quot; They wondered, &quot;Aren&#x27;t they supposed to be in the Northern Lands?&quot; Just like that, the unfortunate fellow became its prey, torn to shreds. Its name is Bimon, status is young or common Bimon, skills include Devour, Attack, Annihilate, Trample, Berserk, no equipment. Monster reputation reached 43,621. The young empire in the Northern Lands had these behemoths etched into their memory, &quot;Ever seen Satan&#x27;s minions? That&#x27;s them.&quot; Meanwhile, Sibin was fighting wearily. &quot;Heavens, there are seven of them.&quot; The faces of the knights darkened as they hurriedly spoke, &quot;My Lord, you must retreat quickly.&quot; He calculated in his mind, &quot;I don&#x27;t have much battle aura left.</p>
<p>Knights without battle aura are significantly weakened. I can&#x27;t stay here any longer, I must break the encirclement.&quot; Therefore, he loudly commanded everyone, &quot;All knights, hear my order! With me as the center, break out of the encirclement!&quot; After speaking, he moved as fast as lightning, cutting down three beastmen at once, then turned to this side to eliminate the remaining beastmen, sending blood flying everywhere. Holding his sword, his whole body emitted an increasingly brilliant light of power, &quot;Don&#x27;t linger here any longer.&quot; A worried knight looked at him, &quot;But, my Lord, what about you?&quot; But facing a critical situation, he no longer cared about himself and only wanted to focus on annihilating these demonic beasts. &quot;You all retreat first. I&#x27;ll stay here to buy you time,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;Cmon, they should be arriving soon.&quot; The army of espers was trying to use all their strength for this battle.</p>
<p>A person with a bow and arrow on the other side shouted, &quot;Damn it. Lord Eagle Crest, don&#x27;t you die, your life must be saved for us to get a gold drop.&quot; A girl asked while throwing a punch. &quot;Where are those bull-headed people?&quot; The young man standing nearby replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, maybe they were blocked by other beastman troops, haven&#x27;t seen them at all.&quot; Loud noises rang out, a bull-headed man with an axe brutally chopped a beastman in half. And so they charged forward aggressively, &quot;Strength and Loyalty.&quot; The giant Bimon was about to raise its claws to annihilate the bull-headed man in front of it. But unexpectedly, the bull-headed man was so strong that he held its claws tightly to stop it.</p>
<p>Bladduff Clan. The bull-headed man&#x27;s eyes were terrifyingly crimson as he growled, &quot;Let us deal with these overgrown forest dwellers.&quot; Everyone fighting was confused when they suddenly heard something crash heavily to the ground, &quot;Ugh, what&#x27;s happening?&quot; It turned out the bull-headed man had quickly dealt with the Bimon, causing it to fall to the ground unconscious. &quot;Come on, you big oaf. Get up,&quot; its appearance made everyone extremely excited, &quot;It&#x27;s the bull-headed people, the bull-headed people have come to kill!&quot; Biden witnessed this and became more anxious, &quot;Where did those bull-headed people come from? Why have I never seen them in the beastman tribe? Hunchback Wolf, go investigate for me immediately.&quot; However, after calling repeatedly with no response, he turned his head in confusion, &quot;Hunchback Wolf,&quot; Suddenly, a voice cut him off, &quot;Don&#x27;t call anymore.&quot; That person was none other than Cmon. He held a sword to his neck and announced, &quot;He&#x27;s already dead, it&#x27;s all over.&quot; The news stunned him, &quot;What?&quot; The battle was finally over, everyone cheered with delight, &quot;We won, we won! Thankfully, we have the brave and skilled Lord Sibin, Black River City will forever open its gates to welcome you.&quot; Suddenly, Telambo hurriedly approached, calling, &quot;Your Excellency, the Count.&quot; He was happily riding his horse on the way and saw him and smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Lord Telambo.&quot; Before he could speak, Sibin laughed and teased, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter? In a hurry to settle the debt?&quot; His face was covered in sweat, startled. &quot;Your Excellency, the Count, this great victory is thanks to you. It&#x27;s just that this Black River Territory of mine is truly small, I can&#x27;t gather 10,000 gold coins and 500 sets of equipment.&quot; Sibin helplessly and silently held the paper, listening to him ramble on. &quot;But I have already written an IOU. This time, I will pay 5,000 gold coins, 20 sets of standard armor, and provisions in advance.</p>
<p>The rest will be paid in full within a year. You see, in... in addition, this humble one has another unreasonable request. Could you hand over the beastman chieftain for me to handle? He has caused too much bloodshed in Black River Territory. I must summon the fief&#x27;s people for a public trial.&quot; After waiting for him to finish, Sibin just sighed and replied curtly, &quot;As you wish.&quot; Next, he asked, &quot;We have already arranged the victory banquet.</p>
<p>Are you really not attending?&quot; But Sibin just waved his hand, turned, and left. &quot;No need. Now, bring out the 5,000 gold coins, equipment, and provisions. I&#x27;m in a hurry.&quot; Hearing this, a mysterious smile appeared on his face as he replied, &quot;Yes, I will immediately have the knights bring the items out for you.&quot; Inside the prison, Chieftain Blood Fang, who was captured and locked up after the battle, suddenly heard someone call, &quot;Hey, you thing, get up.&quot; As his eyes glanced to the side, he was startled by something. &quot;Do you recognize what this is?&quot; Seeing Telambo holding a book with strange, ominous red symbols, he recognized it immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Earthquake Technique scroll that only a beastman chieftain can activate.&quot; He smiled and explained, &quot;This was my father&#x27;s spoil of war from killing a beastman chieftain. If Dac hadn&#x27;t reminded me, I wouldn&#x27;t have even known this thing existed, let alone that it could be useful today.&quot; He looked at him and asked a rather strange question, &quot;Are you so sure I would definitely lose the battle like that?&quot; Upon hearing this, Telambo became extremely arrogant and looked at him with contempt. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t sure you would be defeated, but if I didn&#x27;t have this scroll, and you were defeated, I would have to give that bastard 10,000 gold coins.&quot; At this point, he didn&#x27;t hesitate to reveal his intentions, &quot;If you had won, both he and I would have died. But I have this scroll. You also failed.</p>
<p>Now, I live, and he dies.&quot; His words made him jump to his feet, &quot;You truly are a decisive lord.&quot; Seeing him say this, Telambo thought he had agreed to side with him and was overjoyed, &quot;So, you agree to help me use this scroll. If you agree to cooperate with me, I can spare your life.&quot; But Biden said, &quot;No need. I am very willing to lend you my strength. To help you use the Earthquake Technique to kill that lord and his army. When it&#x27;s done, I only hope you can bury me on the battlefield.</p>
<p>That is where I belong.&quot; He had just said, &quot;Deal. If that&#x27;s the case, follow me.&quot; But suddenly, his finger pointed at the scroll, cutting him off. &quot;No need for such trouble. To activate the Earthquake Technique, all that&#x27;s needed is fresh blood and a passage of my beastman language is enough.&quot; Looking at the glowing scroll, he couldn&#x27;t help but feel smug. When he stepped outside, he stood above and laughed loudly, making the knights below jump in surprise.</p>
<p>His face revealed a cruel expression as he held the now-activated, glowing red scroll high for all to see. &quot;Respected Count Eagle Crest, good evening. Now, I must tell you some bad news. Star of the nation, second son of the Golden Lion family, you are about to die, killed by this activated Earthquake Technique.&quot; Saying this, Telambo pointed at Sibin standing below and threatened, &quot;I just need to read one sentence in the beastman language, and boom, boom, boom, you will all be buried under the earth and sand. It&#x27;s all your fault.</p>
<p>Because of your bottomless greed, Count Eagle Crest, Sibin Golden Lion. Do you have any last words now? Respected Your Excellency, Count Eagle Crest, Sibin Golden Lion.&quot; Despite being insulted by him, Sibin didn&#x27;t get angry or scared; on the contrary, he gave a thumbs-up and burst out laughing. &quot;My last words? What last words could I have? A good-for-nothing piece of trash like you who doesn&#x27;t know his place wants to kill me.&quot; Those words stunned him, &quot;What?&quot; His eyes were bloodshot like a demon&#x27;s, veins popping on his forehead from excessive anger. &quot;Very good. I originally wanted to see your pathetic begging for mercy, but since you won&#x27;t shed a tear until you see the coffin, then die for me.&quot; While he wasn&#x27;t paying attention, on Sibin&#x27;s side, he made a slashing motion across his neck with his hand.</p>
<p>At the same time, a wound instantly appeared on his body, and blood sprayed out gruesomely. His bloodshot pupils contracted, his face tensing as pain washed over him. Suddenly, a knight stepped forward and snatched the scroll, &quot;Sorry, Baron Telambo, you talk too much. I was really getting impatient. If I didn&#x27;t want to preserve this usable Earthquake Technique scroll, I would have skewered you yesterday.&quot; His whole body trembled as he gritted his teeth in disbelief, &quot;Why, why is it you?&quot; Telambo&#x27;s voice trembled as he said, &quot;I...</p>
<p>trusted you... so much.&quot; Not wanting to hear any more of his annoying words, the knight directly skewered him with his sword, causing blood to gush out. &quot;I understand how you feel. After all, you are just a minor baron, so you would never expect, that your most trusted guard would be a man from the Golden Lion family, right?&quot; His whole body fell face-down on the ground as he squeezed out a few words with his last breath, &quot;Golden... Scheme...</p>
<p>Kingdom.&quot; After finishing the job, the knight also turned and left. &quot;Baron Telambo, you&#x27;re overthinking things, If you hadn&#x27;t started this life-and-death struggle with Young Master Sibin today, I probably would have never killed you in this lifetime. The weather today is truly beautiful, with a clear blue sky and occasional sunbeams shining down. After completing his mission, he quickly ran to Black River Territory and called out, Young Master Sibin, long time no see. Sitting on a chair, he heard the call and said cheerfully, &quot;Allen, I knew it was you.&quot; When he took off the hat on his head, a mischievous face was revealed as he winked, &quot;I saved your life this time, you know.&quot; Looking at the person opposite him made him a little curious.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure enough, your voice is exactly the same as before. Not a bit different. I recognized it when you were describing the map, but why did you come to Black River Territory?&quot; He answered honestly, &quot;I came here on the orders of His Grace, the Duke.&quot; So he began to recount, &quot;I was originally an inside man, to be activated when necessary, but now my identity as an inside man is discarded.&quot; This made him rest his chin on his hand, his face wrinkling slightly, &quot;An inside man? What does Father want to do?&quot; Suddenly, his expression turned grim, &quot;Young Master Sibin, the King is old. There are some things he can no longer avoid putting on the agenda.&quot; His attitude made him think in astonishment, &quot;Although I don&#x27;t know the specific situation, I just hope my nominal father, Duke Manhattan, doesn&#x27;t kick the bucket.&quot; After all, he treats me quite well. So he suddenly spoke up, &quot;Allen, listen to this.&quot; Hearing this, he became a little curious.</p>
<p>After a moment, Allen&#x27;s surprised voice echoed so loudly that it scared a bird outside into flying away. &quot;You&#x27;re saying the blood of the subhuman maiden is used to nurture the holy relics of the Temple Knights? How can that be?&quot; His over-the-top reaction made Sibin facepalm, speechless, &quot;Can&#x27;t you lower your voice a bit, Mr. Spy?&quot; Not knowing what was on his mind, he hurriedly jumped to his feet in haste, &quot;In that case, I won&#x27;t linger here any longer.&quot; His voice, full of determination, was like a promise to him, &quot;This time, when I return to the royal capital, I&#x27;ll take the head of Biden, Blood Fang, and present it to the King on your behalf. I reckon the King will grant you Black River Territory as a reward this time.&quot; Having no other choice, he could only agree with what he said, &quot;Got it, you can go.&quot; Sibin and Cmon stood proudly before Telambo&#x27;s gold vault, hearing sounds coming from within. The brilliant, sparkling light that radiated out made him gawk in surprise.</p>
<p>His eyes, shining like headlights, greedily stared at the gold piled up like a mountain inside. &quot;So much money in this gold vault. And that Telambo guy pretended to be poor with me. Cmon, take it all.&quot; He immediately accepted the order, &quot;Yes, Young Master.&quot; The wheels quickly started moving outside. The procession of knights, each on horseback pulling a cart of gold coins behind them, departed.</p>
<p>Looking at that gold made everyone drool with envy. &quot;I feel like we&#x27;re the most pathetic gamers in history. I don&#x27;t even have as much money as an NPC.&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t say anymore, it hurts.&quot; &quot;Hey guys, if I secretly grab a handful, Lord Eagle Crest probably won&#x27;t know, right?&quot; The system displayed a notification panel: Ding! Detected that the host has completed the daily villain mission. Do you wish to draw the reward now? His face satisfied, he thought to himself, &quot;System, draw the reward. Next time, no need to confirm with me, just open it directly.&quot; The prize wheel quickly appeared and then stopped on a slot.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the host for receiving the curio, Breath of the Wild. This reward has triggered a lucky critical hit. Congratulations to the host for receiving the Origin of the Wild. The reward has been automatically integrated into the host&#x27;s body. Please experience it for yourself.</p>
<p>Watching the blue energy slowly coil into a circle in front of him made him wonder, &quot;System, what on earth is the Origin of the Wild?&quot; The system heard this and explained, &quot;The world-unique curio, Origin of the Wild, is the source of the Breath of the Wild, encompassing all types of the Breath of the Wild.&quot; After reading that information, he was speechless. &quot;That&#x27;s really saying something by saying nothing. So what are these &#x27;all types of the Breath of the Wild&#x27; and &#x27;primitive wild feeling&#x27; anyway?&quot; The system continued to display, &quot;The curio, Breath of the Wild, is a rule of natural power. Pure natural beings can, based on their differing talents, awaken the power within their blood line. Seeing this, his face lit up as he began to strike a pose, &quot;So can I comprehend the power from within it? I feel like I&#x27;m very pure.&quot; But the system said, &quot;You cannot.&quot; The answer made Sibin cross his arms, fuming with anger, &quot;So what&#x27;s the use of this toy for me? Don&#x27;t I just become a human-shaped Wi-Fi hotspot broadcasting the Breath of the Wild?&quot; However, he was still curious, &quot;System, what is a pure natural being?&quot; The system displayed an answer, &quot;It&#x27;s not easy to describe.</p>
<p>To give an example, it&#x27;s the horse the host is currently riding.&quot; Looking at the creature with its sparkling, cute eyes made him find it amusing, &quot;My horse, is there something wrong with you? It&#x27;s true I like beast ears, but a horse won&#x27;t do, let alone a male horse.&quot; He stroked his chin, his face pensive as he speculated, &quot;It seems this is caused by the Origin of the Wild, according to what the system said. I&#x27;m equivalent to becoming an evolutionary opportunity for natural beings, which is why my horse showed that kind of expression. And since the other horses around have no reaction, it seems the perception range is limited, as the system mentioned. Whether one can awaken their bloodline power from the Breath of the Wild depends on their talent. At the town mayor&#x27;s mansion in Divine Light Town, inside a room, the two sides were sitting opposite each other.</p>
<p>Rui&#x27;s face was slightly flushed as she spoke, &quot;Lord Eagle Crest, if you have no objections, let&#x27;s start drawing up the transfer contract for Divine Light Town now.&quot; He reached out his hand to take the contract. However, something made his expression fall with a hint of horror. From within the contract, a tall woman with long white hair, her whole body glowing, appeared behind him. The blessing of the God of Order. The appearance of that person left Sibin speechless.</p>
<p>&quot;Well now, this parchment scroll actually has the blessing of the God of Order. Where did these players get this from? My Eagle Crest Territory even has a temple dedicated to that old hag, the God of Order?&quot; Suddenly, she started panting strangely. Her whole body flushed red, she gritted her teeth, her breathing becoming rapid as she thought, &quot;On Lord Eagle Crest&#x27;s body, there&#x27;s such a comfortable aura. Because of this, she fidgeted, pushing herself up from the table, &quot;No, I can&#x27;t hold it in anymore.&quot; Suddenly, she lunged towards him, causing his jaw to drop in astonishment. &quot;I want to lick him, I want to rub against him.&quot; This made a young man rush over to pull her hand, calling, &quot;Saintess!&quot; But fortunately, that was just her imagination.</p>
<p>The truth was, she had been sitting there dazed as if she&#x27;d lost her soul, making the young man have to continuously wave his hand to get her attention, &quot;Saintess! Your Highness, the Saintess!&quot; Only then did Rui snap back to her senses, &quot;Ah.&quot; Her expression flustered, she asked, &quot;Is, is something wrong?&quot; Seeing her like this made the young man also become confused. The restlessness inside her made her feel uncomfortable. Combined with her earlier fantasy, it made her act even stranger. &quot;No, me... why am I having such shameful thoughts?&quot; Although he was thinking, &quot;This NPC is really getting harder and harder to handle,&quot; on the outside, he still maintained a bright smile and presented the paper.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s like this. Lord Eagle Crest has already drafted the contract. Please take a look, and if there are no objections, we&#x27;ll sign.&quot; She was startled when she saw the paper. Rui carefully read every condition inside. Hereby, all authority of the mayor of Divine Light Town, Mejin, shall be transferred to the subhuman Saintess, Rui.</p>
<p>This includes the right to rule and, from now on, the subhuman Saintess, Rui, will become the mayor of Divine Light Town, for an indefinite period. However, he was still suspicious and turned to ask Sibin, &quot;Lord Eagle Crest, as a Count, you wouldn&#x27;t play any word games in the contract, would you?&quot; He replied with a casual smile, &quot;I am a man who puts honesty first.&quot; Next, he looked at the two of them and said, &quot;Besides, I am also very clear about the contract. The ownership of Divine Light Town from the former mayor, Mejin, is transferred to Rui. It&#x27;s all laid out clearly. Whether you sign or not is up to you.&quot; However, something still made her hesitate a little, as it felt a bit strange.</p>
<p>Finally, she decided to pick up the pen and sign. &quot;But this parchment scroll is protected by the Goddess of Order. Any violation will be met with divine punishment, so there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&quot; As soon as she finished signing, the Goddess of Order appeared again. He rested his chin on his hand, smiling cheerfully with narrowed eyes, The contract is now in effect. Congratulations, subhuman Saintess.</p>
<p>From now on, you are the mayor of Divine Light Town.&quot; Hearing this, the two people sitting opposite were overjoyed. However, his expression turned cunning. &quot;Well then, now is about the right time to talk a little about the tax issue of Divine Light Town, a vassal town of Eagle Crest Territory, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; His words left her stunned in disbelief, &quot;What the hell? She was so surprised she shot up, slammed her hands on the table, and stammered, &quot;Ta-ta-taxes.&quot; In contrast to her attitude, he calmly explained, &quot;That&#x27;s right, taxes. You are the mayor of Divine Light Town, and Divine Light Town belongs to Eagle Crest Territory. It is perfectly reasonable for me to collect taxes from your Divine Light Town.</p>
<p>Even the Goddess of Order cannot punish me.&quot; This made her protest unhappily, &quot;But the ownership of Divine Light Town is clearly mine now.&quot; But those words were ineffective against him. &quot;I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not yours. In my name as the Lord of Eagle Crest, you have indeed obtained the authority over Divine Light Town that was once in Mejin&#x27;s hands. I am the guarantor and witness of this process.&quot; His words were incredibly tyrannical. &quot;But the authority you obtained was Mejin&#x27;s, not mine.&quot; Rui&#x27;s eyes filled with aggrieved tears.</p>
<p>&quot;How could this be?&quot; Everyone standing behind them became angry. &quot;Damn it, we&#x27;ve been tricked!&quot; &quot;So, we still have to pay taxes and tribute to Lord Eagle Crest.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ve been tricked, tricked by an NPC.&quot; &quot;Is this a game or the real world? This is so surreal.&quot; &quot;I came here to play the game, not to be played by the game.&quot; Suddenly, someone&#x27;s footsteps stomped heavily on the ground. &quot;Lord Eagle Crest.&quot; Ye Hao stepped forward to confront him clearly, &quot;A true gentleman is upright and proper. This action of yours has no benevolence or morality whatsoever. It lacks the decorum and style of a lord; you are nothing but a despicable and shameless villain.&quot; To Sibin, those insults were like a passing wind, the more he heard, the more his ears itched.</p>
<p>&quot;Whose puppy is this, barking wildly in front of me like that?&quot; That mocking attitude made him even more annoyed. &quot;You, Lord Eagle Crest, don&#x27;t be so arrogant! Do you dare to duel me one-on-one without any outside help? If you lose, you must completely hand over Divine Light Town to Rui, with no interference whatsoever. It will be completely independent.&quot; He agreed immediately without hesitation, &quot;Fine. Then you also can&#x27;t use that skill of yours that explosively increases your power.&quot; His face darkened as he sneered, &quot;I see you don&#x27;t dare, do you?&quot; His voice grew louder as he continued to scold him, &quot;Unexpectedly, the great Lord of Eagle Crest is nothing but a coward hiding behind others.&quot; However, at that same moment, the system appeared again, attracting his attention. a new mission was given to you, daily mission update, villain mission one, single-handedly beat up Ye Hao.</p>
<p>villain mission two, make the Subhuman Saintess cry. villain mission three, forcibly kiss the Subhuman Saintess, after completing this mission, besides receiving the daily reward, a new function of the system will also be activated. host, please continue to advance to become the strongest villain soon. this time after reading the mission, his face flushed red, looking very excited, what? looking at the innocent girl staring at him from across, he wondered to himself, nice, does this damn system have a grudge against the Saintess? such a perverted mission, I hope the system gives me more of these in the future, don&#x27;t pity me just because I&#x27;m a handsome lord. suddenly, Ye Hao&#x27;s hand slammed hard on the table, startling her with confusion, are you even listening to me? it seems his passion was to tease him, let&#x27;s just say I was, the answer made him furious, you, but he spoke up, cutting him off, alright.</p>
<p>I agree to a duel with you. he thought to himself, since the system has already given the mission, then I can&#x27;t refuse Ye Hao&#x27;s request for a duel. of course, Sibin wouldn&#x27;t accept so easily and asked back, but, what if I win? it can&#x27;t be that if I lose, I have to fulfill your request, but if I win, I get nothing, right? he had no choice but to give in to his wishes, what do you want, as long as it&#x27;s not too outrageous, I can agree to it. however, his added words were mysterious and confused him, your agreement alone is useless. a cunning smile appeared on Sibin&#x27;s face.</p>
<p>then he pointed at her and said clearly, if I win, I want her. Ye Hao and Rui exclaimed in alarm, no way. Sibin knew they wouldn&#x27;t agree easily, so he switched to another option, if I win, you have to let me and the Subhuman Saintess be alone for five minutes. this plan made Ye Hao even more displeased, Rui is the Subhuman Saintess, how can she be with someone like Sibin. not wanting the situation to get more complicated, Rui tugged on Ye Hao&#x27;s arm and said submissively for Ye Hao to confidently agree with Sibin, she believed he would win the bet.</p>
<p>faced with Rui&#x27;s expectations, Ye Hao finally agreed to this match, and promised he was determined not to lose. at the dueling ground, the wind howled in gusts, Ye Hao faced Sibin, just waiting for the sharp clang of two swords clashing, an unforgiving battle would begin. Ye Hao made the first move. stomping his foot, he powerfully leaped forward and decisively. the blade flashed as a sharp clang rang out.</p>
<p>Sibin reacted as fast as lightning, his steady sword creating a perfect counter-attack. at the same time, Sibin spun around and threw a kick, mocking Ye Hao, is that all the strength you have, did you not eat breakfast this morning? the attack had no effect on Sibin, Ye Hao was pushed far back, gripping his blade tightly to maintain his balance. but unexpectedly, Ye Hao was prepared for the next move, he suddenly shot forward. in less than a second, the tip of Ye Hao&#x27;s blade was right in front of Sibin&#x27;s nose. Ye Hao, in a calculated moment, his hand brushed past the dagger hidden on his person.</p>
<p>laced with poison, that reaper&#x27;s scythe was now next to Sibin&#x27;s ear. Sibin, not expecting this move, said, poisoning a dagger, to think Ye Hao would come up with that. Ye Hao cunningly replied, all&#x27;s fair in war, surely Sibin understands this principle? not letting Ye Hao lecture him further, Sibin was determined to regain the upper hand. Sibin plunged his sword tip into the ground, his voice booming, rise for me. the moment he flicked his sword tip into the air, the ground shook along with it.</p>
<p>Sibin&#x27;s counter-attack didn&#x27;t trouble Ye Hao, he stepped back to dodge the blow, is this all you&#x27;ve got, it wasn&#x27;t for nothing that he had been rapidly leveling up and training hard in swordsmanship lately. Ye Hao swung his sword, his energy surged, executing the Cross-Light Slash technique, enhanced version. all his internal energy gathered on the blade, the energy shot out in a sparkling cross shape. noticing the change in aura, Sibin gritted his teeth, his hand tightening on his sword hilt to defend. despicable, airborne poison, Sibin&#x27;s body was now completely drained of strength.</p>
<p>his attendant Krimon could only watch from the stands, nervous and worried seeing Sibin standing completely still because this was a killing move, if it hit, he would die without a doubt. Krimon, with his deep loyalty, couldn&#x27;t just stand by and watch, he drew his sword intending to rush into the arena. a guard stopped Krimon. as a knight, you should know this is a duel. no one is allowed near the dueling ground.</p>
<p>Sibin exhaled, standing firm amidst Ye Hao&#x27;s terrifying power. in a flash, Sibin pulled himself together, remembering his own status, he was the star of the empire, his pride surged, he was the legendary disciple of the Sword Saint. memories of his training days, the lessons from the Sword Saint flooded back, from when he couldn&#x27;t even lift a sword. in his mind, his master&#x27;s teachings echoed, let go of distracting thoughts, gather all the strength in your body. the words from his memory echoed, open your eyes and try again.</p>
<p>Sibin took a deep breath, his eyes slowly opening. Sibin raised his sword high, like a brilliant flash of lightning, the light from the blade illuminated every corner of the arena. Sibin shouted loudly as he brought it down in a perfect arc, his internal energy promising to be no less than the wave of energy from Ye Hao in front of him. Rui clasped her hands to her chest, tears welling in her eyes, please, Goddess of the Wild, protect brother Ye Hao. Sibin&#x27;s sword strike was reaching its end, the prayer still echoing in Rui&#x27;s mind, brother Ye Hao must be safe and sound.</p>
<p>as the last of the energy was released from the blade, droplets of dark red blood also sprayed from Sibin&#x27;s mouth. his attendant Krimon couldn&#x27;t hide his worry for his young master while the arena guard immediately looked over at Ye Hao on the opposite side. just as the guard feared, Ye Hao collapsed at the feet of the Sword Saint&#x27;s successor, the light in his eyes fading, the sword energy is too strong. from the moment he realized he couldn&#x27;t dodge Sibin&#x27;s counter-attack until now, Ye Hao had been so scared his legs couldn&#x27;t move. everything became blurry before his eyes, Ye Hao knew this weak resistance was futile.</p>
<p>in agony, Ye Hao gritted his teeth, his heart filled with resentment and helplessness, he dropped his sword and knelt on the ground, forced to accept the fact that he had lost. from the stands, a mix of mockery and shock, holy crap, the main character actually knelt. did he really lose? Rui, with tears streaming down her cheeks and panting in panic, ran over calling out brother Ye Hao&#x27;s name, are you okay? Sibin raised his hand to block Rui who was trying to rush to Ye Hao&#x27;s side, he reminded her of the situation, you guys lost, shouldn&#x27;t you fulfill your promise? Rui froze at Sibin&#x27;s words, but even Sibin didn&#x27;t expect she had one last trick, a girl&#x27;s special privilege. Sibin jumped back a step, waving his hands and saying she couldn&#x27;t do that. Rui burst into tears, sobbing.</p>
<p>the enraged Subhuman people said that bastard Sibin is not allowed to bully our Saintess sister. before Sibin could even move, he was swarmed by them, if you want to harm Her Highness the Saintess, you&#x27;ll have to step over our dead bodies. Sibin had never expected this situation, however, if they wanted it, he would oblige. Sibin reached for the sword on his back, thinking to himself, they dare to pull this trick on me? Rui finally calmed down, she stood up to protect her people, her voice stern, don&#x27;t kill them. she knelt at Sibin&#x27;s feet, choking back sobs, I&#x27;ll agree to your terms.</p>
<p>Sibin sighed and sheathed his sword behind his back, his expression nonchalant. he helped Rui up, his tone seemingly gentler, I just want to talk privately with your Saintess for 5 minutes, it&#x27;s not a life-or-death separation, do you all need to be this dramatic? he led Rui into the palace, closing the door and leaving a sentence behind, if you don&#x27;t trust me, you can stand guard outside. Sibin stopped in the wide corridor, suddenly pinning Rui against the wall. ignoring the fear before him, Sibin grabbed Rui&#x27;s wrist, pressing her hand tightly against the cold stone wall, in a passive position Rui cried out, what do you want to do, didn&#x27;t you say you just wanted to talk? Sibin&#x27;s treacherous expression was clear, oh, did I say that? he leaned close to Rui&#x27;s face and whispered, why don&#x27;t I remember? Rui was pinned against the wall, her heart pounding, her hands gripping the cold wall behind her. Sibin lowered his head, his breath gentle as he placed a kiss on Rui&#x27;s lips.</p>
<p>Rui shook her head repeatedly as if that would help her deny the kiss that just happened. Sibin was just wondering why the system hadn&#x27;t announced the mission&#x27;s completion yet. Sibin leaned close to Rui&#x27;s ear and whispered, I suggest you cooperate. Your Highness the Saintess, you don&#x27;t want the Subhumans outside to die because of you, do you? her weak spot hit, Rui could only bite her lip and endure it. tears just rolled down her cheeks, she choked out, don&#x27;t harm them.</p>
<p>her recent action had successfully helped Sibin complete the daily mission. completed, Sibin was surprised. so all it took was using the Subhumans as a shield to make her cry, if he had known earlier, he would have done it long ago. Rui tried to stay calm, but couldn&#x27;t stop her cat tail from suddenly appearing from behind her, wagging. this feels so good, my body is so itchy, she thought.</p>
<p>Sibin, having achieved his goal, had no reason to linger, the 5 minutes are almost up, I&#x27;m leaving now. hey, Rui felt her body burning up, don&#x27;t go. suddenly she lunged at Sibin, wrapping her arms around him, this is the scent. she tried hard to kiss his cheek, I won&#x27;t let you go. Sibin used his hand to push her kiss away.</p>
<p>Rui, still as if under a spell, said enchantingly, I want more. Sibin sassily held up a price sign: one kiss for 10 coins. he shouted, that&#x27;s enough, if you kiss me again I&#x27;ll charge you. at this, Rui came to her senses, her eyes widened as she looked at the scene she had just caused and remembered nothing. she turned beet red, pervert.</p>
<p>Sibin replied aggrievedly, hey, between the two of us, who&#x27;s more like a pervert? embarrassed, Rui shrank back, wrapping her tail and turning away. Rui tried to shrink back, using her tail to cover her face, not daring to meet Sibin&#x27;s gaze. but when she turned, Sibin was already gone, leaving her alone in the vast sanctuary. Sibin, outside the city, riding his horse contentedly, didn&#x27;t forget to remind. system, the mission is complete, I want my reward.</p>
<p>ding, the system is drawing the reward for the host, congratulations to the host for receiving the Cat Morgan Dragon&#x27;s Blood Potion, it is regrettable that this reward did not have a critical hit. host, please advance and complete more villain missions to soon become the strongest villain. Sibin took the vial of Dragon&#x27;s Blood from the system, curious, what is this toy used for? ding, the system explained, the Cat Morgan Dragon&#x27;s Blood Potion is a body enhancement potion concocted by the legendary apothecary Cat Morgan, the main ingredient is the blood of a red dragon. Sibin was excited. Using dragon&#x27;s blood to make a potion sounded very cool, and apothecary wasn&#x27;t even a profession on the Can Continent.</p>
<p>Sibin thought again, the things the system gives are not bad at all. System, I misunderstood you. He suddenly realized, so you are the real deal. Sibin opened the cap of the dragon&#x27;s blood vial and inquired, so if I drink this dragon&#x27;s blood potion, will I turn into a red dragon? Ding, the system announced, you will not, this is only a body enhancement potion, not a transformation potion. The system continued to remind, Host, please use the dragon&#x27;s blood immediately, the potion&#x27;s medicinal properties will evaporate after leaving the system&#x27;s space.</p>
<p>Sibin didn&#x27;t hesitate, tilting his head back and downing the vial of dragon&#x27;s blood in one gulp. Instantly, his eyes became cold and decisive. In that moment, Sibin could feel the power of the red dragon&#x27;s lineage flowing through his veins. The blood vessels under his skin bulged with red streaks like lava, and the muscles on his body became firm and taut. Every movement of Sibin&#x27;s was now incredibly fluid.</p>
<p>He even had a fleeting thought, feeling like he wanted to run around naked. The system announced, this reward has been distributed, a new system function has been unlocked. Sibin hadn&#x27;t even had time to fully absorb the dragon&#x27;s blood when he received the notification. He blurted out, a new function? The door burst open, and Ye Hao rushed in with a worried expression. Rui, he called out loudly.</p>
<p>Brother Ye Hao. Rui&#x27;s voice was tearful. Are you okay? Ye Hao asked, Did that bastard do anything to you? Ye Hao didn&#x27;t notice Rui&#x27;s expression at that moment, a mess of tangled emotions in her heart. Rui shouted, Get out. Before Ye Hao could grasp the situation, he was pushed out of the palace by her.</p>
<p>The crowd outside was also surprised; just a moment ago, she was clearly so worried about him. Whispering, even the main character got kicked out. I heard that last time after Lord Eagle Crest left, the Saintess stayed by herself. They guessed Sibin must have done something to her. Then they spoke with scorn and contempt, If someone hadn&#x27;t lost the duel, things wouldn&#x27;t have come to this.</p>
<p>These last words made Ye Hao even angrier. Truly, who knows when this main character will ever defy the heavens. Those taunts just now had struck his last shred of pride. You bunch of frogs in a well, what the hell do you know, he thought. The obsession with his wounded honor, all of it pushed Ye Hao to the brink of darkness.</p>
<p>He strode away. I didn&#x27;t want this either. Ye Hao held the dark box he had just taken out. I didn&#x27;t want this either, it&#x27;s all your fault, Lord Eagle Crest. From the darkness, a strange carving emerged, bulging with an ancient horror, a fiend that did not belong to any order of this world.</p>
<p>The following is the introduction of the new system function for the host. After activating the new function, the host&#x27;s villainous acts will receive a certain amount of villain points. The system asked him, do you want to accept the judged villain points? Sibin was puzzled. The system explained, villain points can be used to exchange for items in the villain store. The villain store is updated once a week.</p>
<p>This week&#x27;s villain store has been updated, please check it, host. Sibin opened the villain store to take a look, Sky Knight Breakthrough Potion, limited quantity. Pulling so many tricks, and even changing tactics to lure him into doing bad things. It seems this system wants him to walk the villain&#x27;s path until he&#x27;s pitch black, so sinful that even the Yellow River can&#x27;t wash him clean. Sibin said sarcastically, And it&#x27;s even sold in limited quantities, you&#x27;re too stingy, System.</p>
<p>Yet, Sibin&#x27;s first thought was of Krimon. Exchanging for this potion would not only help Krimon break through to become a Sky Knight, but it could very well also increase his lifespan. Sibin calculated for a moment, and besides these, there were also mounts, siege weapons, weapon blueprints, and so on, all sorts of good things that could be used to enhance the army&#x27;s strength. Sibin and his army traveled for three long days and finally arrived at Eagle Crest. Sibin cheered happily, As expected, it&#x27;s most comfortable in my own territory.</p>
<p>In front of the city gate, two familiar figures were already waiting. Sibin vaguely recognized the two people. Chris and Lory were holding hands in front of the Eagle Crest palace. Seeing Sibin had returned, Lory couldn&#x27;t hide her emotions, Mas- Master. Sibin asked, What are you two doing standing guard at the gate? Chris said gently, Ever since Young Master Sibin left the city, little Lory has been sitting here waiting after finishing her studies.</p>
<p>Chris warmly recounted, Lory would wait until the fortress bell rang at night before she was willing to go back, she wouldn&#x27;t listen no matter how we tried to persuade her. Sibin affectionately pinched Lory&#x27;s cheek, Is that so? I didn&#x27;t expect that while I was out fighting, my little maid at home would miss me. Chris said thoughtfully, Let&#x27;s save the heart-to-heart for later, the Young Master must be tired. Dinner and the bath are ready, let&#x27;s go back first. Sibin felt relieved.</p>
<p>The feeling of returning home made him sigh in contentment, Finally, I can relax. Waiting only for that, Lory rushed into Sibin&#x27;s arms, Master. Lory, Sibin was startled to see the little girl&#x27;s face covered in tears, I missed you so much, Master. Sibin coaxed her, How about I go take a bath to get clean first, and then you can hug me, okay? I&#x27;m all sweaty right now. Lory didn&#x27;t care about that, But Master smells so good, it makes one feel warm, I just want to keep hugging you.</p>
<p>Sibin didn&#x27;t understand how Lory could find him fragrant in this situation. Lory nuzzled her head into Sibin&#x27;s chest, sighing endlessly, The scent is like the wind blowing over the fields when my mother held me outdoors to count the stars as a child. Hearing that, Sibin suddenly recalled, &quot;Smells so good, makes one feel warm,&quot; but those expressions were all related to the artifact, the Breath of the Wild. It is the law of natural power; pure natural beings can, based on their difference in talent and perception, awaken the power in their bloodline from the breath of the wild. This made Sibin suspect a truth: could it be that Lory can perceive the Breath of the Wild? Sibin asked the little girl, Lory, have you ever heard of subhumans awakening their bloodline? Lory recalled, when she was little, she heard her father say that dozens of years ago, the subhumans were also an extremely powerful race.</p>
<p>Although the subhuman race has no way to cultivate battle qi, nor do they have any innate magical talent, they can awaken the hidden power in their bloodline through natural perception. Lory hesitated before continuing, It&#x27;s just that the conditions to awaken this kind of power are extremely harsh. It not only requires talent but also one&#x27;s own enlightenment to resonate with the power in the bloodline. Some people were lucky enough to awaken the power of water currents under a waterfall, while others fought monsters day after day and comprehended the power of wild beasts. The subhuman race doesn&#x27;t know what is hidden in their bloodline, they can only try one by one, but only a few succeed.</p>
<p>Sibin realized, in that case, as long as their talent is sufficient, any subhuman could find the Breath of the Wild that resonates with their own bloodline on him. So when Lory said she felt warm, she must have resonated with some kind of Breath of the Wild on him. In other words, this was where Lory possessed the ability to awaken the power in her bloodline. Sibin asked excitedly, Lory, do you remember where your clansmen went to perceive nature? Lory replied with a clear and innocent gaze, I do remember, in the past, when Lory saw natural scenery, I would also go to perceive it a little, but I always failed in the end. Sibin cherished the little girl&#x27;s hand, No, no, he explained, Perhaps it&#x27;s not because you don&#x27;t have the talent, but because you haven&#x27;t found the feeling of resonance with your bloodline.</p>
<p>Sibin suggested, Why don&#x27;t you try to perceive the breath that makes you feel so fragrant and warm right now, maybe there will be a surprise. Sibin&#x27;s sudden mention of the Breath of the Wild caught Lory off guard. Then let Lory try, she timidly agreed. Lory moved closer, and Sibin knelt down and wrapped his arms around the little girl. Lory closed her eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>The scent of the great plains, full of life force, the smell of fresh green grass, and wild winds surrounded her. Sibin&#x27;s breath had awakened a feeling in Lory that was both primal and powerful. Sibin observed, could it be that he had succeeded? This is the hidden ability in Lory&#x27;s bloodline. Sensing it a bit, it seems to be a recovery-type ability. So, am I about to have my own personal healer? The world around Lory seemed to fade, she felt herself sinking down.</p>
<p>Master, Lory is so sleepy, I suddenly feel... very tired. Sibin carried the little girl back to her bedroom. Have a good sleep. It seems that using the innate skill of perceiving the Breath of the Wild is also very mentally draining.</p>
<p>Watching Lory sleep soundly, Sibin thought to himself, at this stage, he was more like a nanny. Lory was fast asleep, her hand still clutching the hem of Sibin&#x27;s pants, refusing to let go. Sibin tried to pry her hand off, but the more he tried, the tighter Lory gripped, as if afraid of losing the sense of security she felt. Sibin looked at Lory, sighed helplessly. There was no other way, he had to take off his pants so as not to wake Lory.</p>
<p>Just as his pants slipped down, the door burst open. Goodbye rushed in to report, My Lord. His eyes immediately froze when he saw the scene before him. Lory was sleeping soundly on the bed, her hand still tightly gripping the pants Sibin had just taken off, while Sibin stood there, his lower body clad only in underwear. Sibin sat opposite Goodbye and cleared his throat, Alright, you may speak.</p>
<p>Captain Goodbye couldn&#x27;t guess what Sibin wanted to talk about, and replied confidently, For a great man like you, My Lord, it&#x27;s perfectly fine to have one or two perverted hobbies. Sibin, who had wanted to quickly resolve the awkward situation, was driven mad by him, Did I tell you to say that? I&#x27;m asking you why you suddenly burst into my room! Goodbye hurriedly tried to fix the situation, It&#x27;s, it&#x27;s that a farmer discovered an iron ore deposit. Sibin&#x27;s eyes immediately lit up with excitement, Iron ore, really? Where is the iron ore deposit located, how far is it from Donglin City? When it came to the location of the iron ore, Captain Goodbye didn&#x27;t know how to report it. Seeing him hesitate, Sibin asked impatiently, So is there or isn&#x27;t there? There is, My Lord, Goodbye spread a map on the table, Please take a look, My Lord. Goodbye pointed to the location of the iron ore, That iron ore deposit is not far from us, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not within Eagle Crest Territory, but on the border between Eagle Crest Territory and Budun Territory.</p>
<p>And, and it&#x27;s a little closer to Budun Territory. Goodbye said this in a hesitant tone, I heard they also know about this iron ore deposit. Sibin, however, was not worried at all, I thought it was something serious, this little matter is too simple. He directly used a feather quill to draw a line, re-dividing the territory. Sibin bluntly declared, This iron ore deposit is ours now.</p>
<p>Take this map to Viscount Budun. If he doesn&#x27;t agree, we will declare war. Hearing about war, Captain Goodbye was fired up with fighting spirit, Are we preparing for war already? This time I must bravely go to the battle field to kill the enemy. Sibin said calmly, What&#x27;s the rush? We just got back from Black River Territory, let everyone rest for two days. We&#x27;ll see what move the Budun clan makes, then we&#x27;ll talk.</p>
<p>Alright, if there&#x27;s nothing else, you may withdraw. Not only was he not allowed to discuss battle plans, Sibin also gave Goodbye the task he hated the most. Oh right, washing underwear and socks, increase it to one year. Sibin soaked in the hot tub, the comfortable feeling he had been looking for after days away from Eagle Crest. It had been three days since he used the dragon&#x27;s blood, and his body had become much stronger.</p>
<p>Now, ordinary weapons without Dou Qi could not injure him. Sibin observed his achievements and status on the system, rubbing his chin smugly, extremely proud of himself. With two more passive skills, intermediate magic immunity and dragon vein power, he had finally become a Sky Knight. He noticed a strange name on the system board, Biladen. Where did this Blood Fang come from? He examined it carefully, realizing Biladen and Blood Fang must be related.</p>
<p>close, if not father and son, then brothers. It seemed he had to start strengthening the border patrols now. Sibin got out of the bathroom, his body still smelling of steam, his mind still on weapons and war. If the beastman legion wanted to directly attack Eagle Crest Territory, they would most likely have to pass through the Toronto Mountains, or they could only fight a battle in Black River Territory. Sibin was lost in thought, not noticing Lory had woken up.</p>
<p>Lory, why are you awake? Why don&#x27;t you sleep a little longer? Lory obediently curled up on the bed, profusely thanking Sibin. Master, it&#x27;s thanks to you this time that I was able to feel my bloodline power. Lory didn&#x27;t realize her next words would surprise Sibin. To thank you, Master, I&#x27;ve decided to have a baby for you. At Lory&#x27;s innocent words, Sibin blushed in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Lory, do you know how to have a baby? Lory answered naively, Miss Chris taught me that if I complete the final step of warming the bed, I can have a baby. Sibin covered his eyes with his hand, not knowing how to face this unpredictable teaching. Lory, you&#x27;re still young now. We&#x27;ll reconsider that later. Lory shook her head stubbornly.</p>
<p>Sibin indulgently patted her head and said sternly, No buts. Lory, your bloodline power hasn&#x27;t fully awakened yet. You must take this time to rest and recover your spirit. At Homan Castle, the most majestic place of the Budun family. Presiding over the palace meeting, the head of Budun Territory sat before his generals.</p>
<p>He clasped his hands together solemnly. According to recent news from the border, at the junction of our territory and the Coloniel Empire, an iron ore deposit has been discovered. I have sent people to investigate, and it&#x27;s estimated to be around 800 tons. Immediately, the generals around the meeting table all looked up, their eyes wide with astonishment. Heavens, is it true? Doesn&#x27;t that mean we&#x27;ve struck it rich? The Budun leader&#x27;s face quickly hardened.</p>
<p>But the Earl of the Coloniel Empire, Lord of Eagle Crest Sibin, wants to contest this iron ore with us. He spread the map in his hand. This is the border map that Lord Sibin sent someone to deliver. The soldiers stood around the map, speaking out in anger. This is outrageous bullying.</p>
<p>According to the rules, this iron ore belongs to Budun. How dare Eagle Crest come to snatch it? The Budun leader shot up, fury evident on his face. He is declaring war on us, thinking we are a small viscounty, a tiny piece of land that can be oppressed at will. But can we let him bully us like this? The soldiers declared in unison, We cannot. The Budun leader was satisfied.</p>
<p>Very good. My Budun family has been dormant for so many years. We have finally found a chance to transform ourselves. We absolutely cannot let Sibin disrupt us. The biggest threat to Budun is Sibin himself, a Great Knight.</p>
<p>Beside him is his subordinate Grimon, another renowned Great Knight from Eagle Crest. Apart from these two, Budun has nothing to fear. To ensure victory in this battle, Budun had to use one-third of the iron ore&#x27;s mining rights to borrow from his lordship the Earl. Those three lord knights are on their way from the earldom and will arrive at the border in a few days. The Budun leader said, then placed a hand on his son&#x27;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Jeter, you can show every one. Jeter obeyed his father. He took a deep breath, focused, and immediately, the power in his body began to surge. A stream of green energy slowly spread, forming a brilliant aura around Jeter. The concentration of Dou Qi reached the point of overflowing from the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>This was the sign of a Great Knight. The generals all stared at Jeter in amazement. Heavens, this kid Jeter is only 21 and has already become a Great Knight. Congratulations, Young Viscount. With Jeter and the iron ore, the rise of the Budun family is unstoppable.</p>
<p>On the streets of Lin Dong City, Sibin rode on horseback, his hand loosely holding the reins, letting the horse walk slowly. His expression was thoughtful and gloomy. Today, I have to test the system&#x27;s new villain scoring method. Yesterday, the maid Lory warmed my bed, but I didn&#x27;t get any points. Today, I&#x27;ll try a new method to see if I can trick the system.</p>
<p>Sibin glanced down at the roadside. Seeing a familiar figure, he suddenly called out, Fat kid. The boy recognized Sibin and cried out in alarm, It&#x27;s you, candy, My Lord. Before Sibin could try any villainous tricks, the boy crossed his arms, his face crumpling. My Lord, I don&#x27;t have any candy today.</p>
<p>Can you, can you please not take it from me? My mom was beaten. The boy&#x27;s tears streamed down his face. I have to go buy medicine for my mom, boo hoo. Hearing the pitiful situation, Sibin comforted the boy. Explain clearly, and I won&#x27;t take anything from you.</p>
<p>The fat kid wiped his tears with his hand and said resentfully, My father died in battle. Your knight gave my family a pension, but bad people found out about it. The fat kid choked up. They broke into my house, stole all the pension money, and because my mom wouldn&#x27;t agree, she was beaten. Sibin looked at him with compassion.</p>
<p>This matter, why didn&#x27;t you and your mother report it to me? The boy was timid. He didn&#x27;t speak because his mother said the Lord would not punish the master knight for this matter. The afternoon sun cast their two shadows, the distance between them like the distance the boy wanted to convey. But my mom didn&#x27;t mean to blame you. We are just ordinary freemen.</p>
<p>After my father died in battle, it was already very benevolent of you to give us a pension. At the fat kid&#x27;s house, the boy returned with his arms full of various medicines. Mom, I&#x27;m back. Behind him was the supreme lord, Sibin. The boy&#x27;s mother, with a pale, sickly face, sat up.</p>
<p>The little kid tugged at his mother&#x27;s hand, pointing. Mom, this is the Lord. He came to visit you. This nutritional medicine, he&#x27;s the one who bought it for you. The mother tremblingly performed a salute.</p>
<p>My Lord, this common woman... Seeing the common woman&#x27;s weakness, Sibin ordered her not to stand on ceremony. This is an order. The mother thanked Sibin and lay back down on the bed. Sibin had come not only to see the mother and son&#x27;s situation but also to ask about the matter clearly.</p>
<p>I heard your pension money was stolen by bad people, and there was a knight helping them from behind. The mother explained, My Lord, can you help us? She slowly recounted, It was the Boto gang. They are a group of vagrants outside the city who normally live by collecting protection fees. That day, not long after the master knight came to deliver the pension money and left, they showed up, stole all the money, and beat me into this state. As she spoke, she couldn&#x27;t hold back her emotions.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Sibin&#x27;s blood boiled, and the veins in his eyes became prominent. They also said we could come find them for revenge anytime, that behind them were the master knight and the Lord. Lord. Sibin clenched his fists, wishing he could teach them a lesson immediately. Insolent! These dogs not only do evil but also borrow my name.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth, his anger blazing. I&#x27;d like to see just who the knight behind these vagrants is. Early morning, at a tavern in Lin Dong. This girl in a black bunny outfit was asking a strange customer. Sir, may I ask what you would like to drink? This cloaked customer turned out to be Lord Sibin.</p>
<p>He tossed the girl a gold coin. A glass of your best wine. The black bunny girl immediately took it, thanking him profusely. You are so generous, sir. Please wait a moment.</p>
<p>If you have any other needs, you can also tell me. I&#x27;m Vina. Sibin sat by the tavern window, pretending to be an ordinary person, observing quietly. A thug on the street suddenly caught his eye, drawing his attention. He swaggered around, whistling.</p>
<p>Sibin thought to himself, Finally here. Vina cheerfully brought the drink to Sibin&#x27;s table. Honored guest, here is your wine. At the same time, a sudden gust of strong wind blew, causing Vina to stop in her tracks. After she opened her eyes, her generous customer from before had disappeared.</p>
<p>In an instant, the seat from before was empty without a trace. The thug was beaten black and blue, his face bruised and trembling. Now, I ask, you answer. Sibin pressed his neck against the wall with one hand, suppressing his fury. If you give me a nonsense answer, you will die.</p>
<p>The terrified thug obediently complied. Sibin&#x27;s voice was stern. Was it you who stole the pension from the Burne-Crete family? After he admitted it, he interrogated him further. Whose else? The thug didn&#x27;t dare to lie and confessed one by one. Also, also the Dich family, the Aben family, and the Baro family.</p>
<p>He stammered, Other than that, that&#x27;s all. Only the families living in the tiled-roof area. Sibin knew well that these people couldn&#x27;t act so brazenly alone. He continued to ask, Who ordered you to do this? The thug hesitated. It must be a considerable power that made him cautious and afraid to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Sibin tensed his hand, squeezing the thug&#x27;s throat tightly. Unable to bear it any longer, he cried out, It&#x27;s Grass, Knight Grass! He forced us to do it! Please, please spare me! Sibin couldn&#x27;t help but be surprised by the name that had just come from the thug&#x27;s mouth. Grass? Why would it be him? The memory of Knight Grass was still vivid in Sibin&#x27;s mind, the day Grass knelt before the boy he was, vowing on his knightly faith to follow Young Master Sibin forever. The afternoon sun cast long shadows over Grass&#x27;s villa. Suddenly, the door to Grass&#x27;s villa burst open with a violent noise.</p>
<p>Grass, who was immersed in a moment of pleasure, jumped up with a start. Who is it? Sibin swept his gaze over the scene before him. Having quite a bit of fun, aren&#x27;t we? One man with two women, no less. Since I&#x27;m here, you must know why, right? Grass hadn&#x27;t realized the Lord already knew all of his crimes. He scratched his head and gave a sheepish laugh.</p>
<p>My apologies, Lord. Sleeping with two people at once isn&#x27;t against the law, is it? Sibin lunged forward, his hand gripping Grass&#x27;s neck tightly, his eyes blazing with fire, almost roaring, Stop pretending to be innocent! Did you take the pension money for the fallen soldiers? In a panic, Grass gasped for breath. Lord, so you&#x27;re talking about this. It&#x27;s just a little pension money. Is it necessary to be so fierce in your accusation? Sibin tightened his grip, sparks of mana flashing.</p>
<p>He questioned, Not necessary? This is a capital crime, and you still feel it&#x27;s not necessary? Faced with the accusation, Grass roared in discontent. A Great Knight like me gets a monthly salary of three gold coins, while those dead people get a ten-gold-coin pension after they die. On what grounds? he roared in resentment. Are their lives worth that much money? Their families, those lowlifes, even get an extra five silver coins from the finance department every month. Those lowlifes clearly do nothing at all.</p>
<p>Grass still refused to back down, pointing a hand at the two women on his bed. My Lord, look. With ten gold coins, I can live much more comfortably. Gas looked at Sibin, trying to appeal to his compassion. My Lord, are you really going to kill a knight who has followed you for many years for the sake of some insignificant commoners? His tone was full of urgency mixed with a hint of cunning.</p>
<p>I am a great knight. Sibin had no more patience to listen to Gas&#x27;s absurd excuses. He glared, Inciting ruffians, violating military orders, and you call yourself a great knight? Gas had clearly reached the limit of Sibin&#x27;s loyalty and patience. Don&#x27;t you admire those fallen soldiers? He clenched his fists. Very well, from now on, your family can also receive such a pension, when the palace bell strikes 13.</p>
<p>Everyone in the castle stopped to listen. This was the bell the Lord used to summon the fief&#x27;s people for a public execution. They wondered who the unlucky person was this time. Sibin strode between the rows of guards, his eyes fixed ahead on the place where Gas&#x27;s judgment was about to take place. Gas was tightly bound, a soldier escorting him behind Sibin.</p>
<p>Everyone, Sibin began, I have summoned you all here today to announce a few things and to chop off a head. Sibin looked down, coldly pronouncing the sentence, It is the great knight Gas, who serves under me. The crowd gasped, buzzing at the shocking news. Gods above, it&#x27;s hard to believe. The person the Lord is about to behead is the old knight? Some couldn&#x27;t believe their ears.</p>
<p>How is that possible? Could it be that he slept with the Lord&#x27;s wife? A royal guard, hearing the growing whispers, raised his voice to calm the crowd, Silence. Sibin didn&#x27;t mind stating the reason. He said bluntly, If you all want to know why, I will make it clear. First, defying military orders and stealing the pensions of fallen soldiers. Second, as a knight, he used his strength to bully the weak.</p>
<p>The crowd now fixed their gazes on Gas, who was kneeling on a wooden block, his neck in an iron yoke. The death sentence wasn&#x27;t over. Third, inciting ruffians and disturbing the peace. Therefore, even if he is a great knight, the death penalty must be carried out. Sibin stood next to the criminal, clearing his throat to address all the citizens.</p>
<p>Having you all here today to witness the execution is to let everyone know that here in Eagle Crest, the dignity of a soldier is inviolable, the honor of a soldier is not to be insulted. Sibin&#x27;s gaze fell upon Gas. Whether they are militiamen, guards, or knights, soldiers, there is no distinction between high and low. As people who receive the people&#x27;s support, they must not let the people go hungry and cold. And in the moment before his life was to end, Gas suddenly burst into contemptuous laughter.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha, you will regret today&#x27;s decision. You will definitely regret it. Sibin gave the order, Execute him. The palace bell struck once, and Gas&#x27;s head was severed from his neck in an instant. Host has executed the great knight Gas who followed him for many years, receiving 2000 villain points.</p>
<p>Host, please continue to work hard and soon become the strongest villain. Sibin received the notification from the system, stunned. What? A guard, seeing him about to collapse, asked, My Lord, are you alright? Sibin, feeling helpless, asked the system again. I eliminated a harm to the people and still got villain points. What kind of morality does your system have? Can you tell me? The system explained, showing an image of the frightened populace, Because the ignorant commoners are only terrified of your image.</p>
<p>Then came an image of the guards. And the knights under you, because of that ruthlessness, feel terrified. Sibin was momentarily speechless at the scenes he had just witnessed. Sibin couldn&#x27;t believe his move had gone so wrong. He turned to a knight, You there.</p>
<p>Tell me your thoughts on this matter. I need your most honest opinion. Seeing him hesitate, Sibin added, This is an order. The knight, sweating profusely as he spoke, said, Because the great knight had followed you for so many years and was absolutely loyal, yet you executed Gas for a few dead people, a few ordinary commoners. Sibin cut him off, Absolutely loyal? But do others think like you? The guard&#x27;s face fell.</p>
<p>Yes, that&#x27;s right. The vast majority do. Some others seem indifferent. Even... even Lord Grimon said his crime was not worthy of death.</p>
<p>Sibin sat in his office in the palace, propping his head in his hands and sighing. He recalled Gas&#x27;s last words, You will definitely regret it. Kill me, and everyone will only see that you&#x27;ve killed your most loyal subordinate. Who will trust you, who will want to follow you anymore? His train of thought was interrupted by a knock on the door. Master, may I come in? Recognizing Lory&#x27;s voice, Sibin said softly, Come in.</p>
<p>Lory opened the door a crack, holding milk and cake. Master, will you be having dinner tonight? Seeing the lord looking pensive, Lory asked, Is something troubling you? Sibin hesitated for a moment. It&#x27;s nothing, I&#x27;m just not sleeping well. Lory refused to believe him. Master, if you have something on your mind, don&#x27;t hide it from Lory.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can help you. Sibin finally sighed, his voice low. Alright, it&#x27;s actually about the pension matter. His voice dropped, mixed with fatigue and a haunting quality. I don&#x27;t think I was wrong.</p>
<p>The fallen need to be remembered, and a person like Gas could not be kept. Lory shook her head, saying firmly, How could Master be wrong? She reassured him that her father once said, no one is a born hero. Although a fallen soldier is just the most ordinary person, the crown must bear its weight. The moment they put on armor and take up a sword to go to battle, each of them is a hero. Lory continued to reason, If even a hero&#x27;s back is not protected, but instead is trampled upon at will, then who in this world would want to be a hero anymore ? Those innocent words of encouragement made Sibin feel somewhat relieved.</p>
<p>He caressed the little girl&#x27;s cheek. You&#x27;re so right, Lory. Sibin gently leaned down and placed a light kiss on the little girl&#x27;s cheek. Lory, having you is my greatest luck . Lory&#x27;s cheeks flushed red, and she asked innocently, Master, so can I have a baby for you now? Sibin tried to suppress his awkward expression.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not possible. Wait until you&#x27;re a little older, then we&#x27;ll talk. Be good. Lory was stubborn. But I&#x27;m already an adult.</p>
<p>Sibin was stern. No buts. Tomorrow, I have to take you to perceive the power of the subhuman bloodline. We&#x27;ll talk about the baby after you&#x27;ve fully awakened. Sibin had a hard time convincing the maid who was always asking to have his child, and could only find a temporary excuse to get by.</p>
<p>He acted cold on the outside, but after Lory left, Sibin could only bury his face in his pillow and cry his eyes out. It&#x27;s all the fault of this damn system for constantly emphasizing and reminding me of Lory&#x27;s weak body, when the atmosphere was so good. He consoled himself by seeing what useful things he could exchange for with the 2000 villain points he just got. A new daily necessities section had appeared in the system, full of things like crossbow carts, magic stones, scented soap, and perfume. These things could be taken to the royal capital to make a profit.</p>
<p>Sibin lay there scrolling through these interesting items. Ice silk lace underwear, a set was only 50 points. Explosives, but they were too expensive. Siege weapons, 600 points. As he scrolled to the siege ladder, an idea flashed in Sibin&#x27;s mind.</p>
<p>He immediately sat up and summoned a council of ministers. At the meeting table, Sibin announced loudly, Everyone must know that this time, we are going to war with Budun Fief to seize the iron ore and obtain more resources. The soldiers listened intently. But now I have changed my mind. His eyes shone brightly at the idea he was about to voice.</p>
<p>We will not only seize the iron ore, but we must also take the opportunity to sack their main city, Homan. The generals felt this was impossible, and dissenting opinions arose. This idea is too absurd. In the end, he&#x27;s just a kid with no war experience. It&#x27;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>To think I actually came here to listen to his battle plan. As the soldiers were about to stand up, Grimon spoke up, Please, please wait a moment. He turned to Sibin. Young Master, I&#x27;m afraid the plan to attack Budun City is very difficult to achieve. First, we don&#x27;t have siege weapons, and it&#x27;s too late to build them now.</p>
<p>And even if we had siege weapons, we couldn&#x27;t transport them into Budun Fief. Most importantly, Budun City has magic cannons installed, which are not easy for even a great knight to deal with. Listening to the explanation, Sibin&#x27;s expression was as if he had already thought it through carefully. Leave the problem of siege weapons to me. The room erupted in astonishment after Sibin&#x27;s declaration, Young Master, you can solve it? Even though he was the lord, no one had ever thought Sibin could handle such a great responsibility.</p>
<p>With cunning strategy and careful calculation, Sibin said he had thought of a way to get two giant siege engines into Budun City without anyone knowing. Next, I need the opinions of you ministers. If I can pin down the main forces of the Budun family and also have two siege engines, how much military strength would be needed to launch a blitz attack and defeat Budun City? Grimon advised, Young Master, Budun City is a major city, after all. Even with siege engines and pinning down the enemy&#x27;s main force, it would still be difficult to capture. Besides...</p>
<p>Sibin grew impatient. Besides what? Don&#x27;t hesitate, just say what&#x27;s on your mind. What worried Grimon was related to what had just happened. Great Knight Gas, the one Sibin just executed, was the person in charge of recruitment for the army. Therefore, the number of recruits this time is not ideal.</p>
<p>Grimon sighed. We no longer have the ability to recruit more troops to control a major city. Sibin smirked smugly. What if we don&#x27;t need to control Budun City? The ministers, hearing one absurdity after another, could no longer remain calm. They slammed the table.</p>
<p>No need? Then how do we attack the city? Sibin said softly, Rest assured, I&#x27;m not crazy. We only need to control the city walls and sweep up all the money in Homan City. Grimon saw a glimmer of light in Sibin&#x27;s plan. He advised, If so, only 500 militiamen and ten great knights would be needed to do it. He calculated further, At that time, to protect the iron ore, the Budun family will certainly have to commit all their forces, leaving the guarding force in the city extremely limited.</p>
<p>Therefore, the siege only needs to rely on the siege weapons to capture the city walls and control the magic cannons. Covering the great knights and transporting the wealth will be enough. Then he asked Sibin doubtfully, It&#x27;s just that, Young Master, can you really get complete siege weapons into Budun Fief? Sibin crossed his arms. What? Even you don&#x27;t believe me? Grimon placed his right hand on his left chest, respectfully. I, Grimon, of course, will forever trust you.</p>
<p>Sibin said with satisfaction, Very good. If that&#x27;s the case, then everyone should have no more doubts. Next, Sibin will announce the battle plan. Sibin began to assign tasks clearly. Grimon and the Bloodhood side will lead the main army and set out tomorrow at noon.</p>
<p>No need to hide. Release the news so the Budun family knows we are coming. Remember, just stand parallel, do not attack. The rest of the Bloodhood clan will go with Sibin, leading 500 militiamen, and begin a forced march to Budun Fief tomorrow afternoon. Sibin pointed out each move on the map.</p>
<p>According to the plan, we will arrive at Budun late at night. After arriving, we will immediately begin the siege. We must take the city walls within 10 minutes, evacuate Homan within an hour, and then immediately return to support the main army. Are there any other questions? Captain Goodbye, who had been listening intently, suddenly raised his hand, &quot;My lord, I have a question.&quot; The captain&#x27;s face was full of fighting spirit, as his wish to go into battle was about to be fulfilled. &quot;If we are confident of defeating the Budun family in a frontal assault, why not defeat them first before attacking Budun City?&quot; The crowd fell silent at the Divine Light Town&#x27;s army captain&#x27;s idea.</p>
<p>Amidst the crowd&#x27;s snickering, Grimon irritably shouted, &quot;Are you an idiot? Are you completely certain you can trap all of the Budun family&#x27;s men? Young Master Sibin can produce siege weapons, so this operation is the best opportunity.&quot; &quot;If we attack them head-on, and the Budun family can&#x27;t win and retreats to Budun City, relying on their dozen or so magic mages, what will Eagle Crest use to fight back? Just throw our lives away?&quot; Captain Goodbye suddenly realized how shallow his thinking was; indeed, only Grimon thoroughly understood Sibin&#x27;s moves. Sibin didn&#x27;t elaborate further and concluded, &quot;Well, if no one has any other opinions, we will proceed according to the plan tomorrow. For now, you may all go back and prepare. Meeting dismissed.&quot; In the territory on the other side of the border, Budun had prepared men along the frontier as instructed by his leader. A guard ran up to report, &quot;My lord, a situation has developed in the Eagle Crest territory.&quot; The Budun general was extremely surprised upon hearing this.</p>
<p>&quot;You said you saw Grimon? Then where are the other soldiers and the Lord of Eagle Crest?&quot; The guard stammered, &quot;Yes, my lord. Your subordinate only saw Great Knight Grimon alone.&quot; He tried hard to recall, &quot;There was also a monster, it looked very much like a beastman&#x27;s minotaur, but its physique was much larger, it must have been 3 meters tall.&quot; &quot;And our men discovered, discovered that their army had started to set up camp and cook, showing no intention of starting a battle.&quot; Even General Budun was left spinning after hearing this. He wondered, &quot;What on earth is this Count of Eagle Crest playing at?&quot; They clearly came to seize the iron ore, were arrogant when declaring war, and now that the war has started, they&#x27;re just camped two kilometers away, motionless. To get a grasp of the situation, General Budun ordered, &quot;Continue scouting. Get a little closer.</p>
<p>If you really can&#x27;t, then use the lives of peasants to make up for it.&quot; The subordinate had just left to obey the order when another one returned. &quot;Back so soon? Did you overhear any important news?&quot; the general asked impatiently. The scout, dressed in all black, completely covered, and looking extremely mysterious, looked at the great general with a serious expression. Viscount Budun couldn&#x27;t help but ask suspiciously, &quot;Who are you?&quot; But this cloaked figure just smirked. Then he directly handed him a letter and said cryptically, &quot;I am someone who has come to help you.</p>
<p>The news you want is all here, especially the whereabouts of the Lord of Eagle Crest, which you are most interested in.&quot; Faced with this seemingly heaven-sent piece of helpful news, he couldn&#x27;t help but be suspicious and wary, wanting to reach out for it while also being on guard against the man&#x27;s intentions. &quot;Why should I trust you, and why are you helping me?&quot; Hearing this, the man could no longer hide his intentions. He raised a finger and directly stated his demand, &quot;I have a condition. If you win, I want half the profits from the iron ore.&quot; Viscount Budun, holding the letter, furiously shouted, &quot;Half? Are you insane? What makes you think I would agree to&quot; &quot;you?&quot; The man didn&#x27;t say much more and directly pulled down his hood. Then he smiled nonchalantly, full of confidence that Viscount Budun would have to obey, and replied smugly, &quot;On the fact that without my information, you will definitely lose this battle.&quot; At this moment, over by Budun&#x27;s city wall, which was sturdy, solid, and towered to the sky, Sibin, standing below, had to look up to get a good view.</p>
<p>To be honest, this solid city wall made him exclaim in admiration as he looked at it. &quot;This Budun family must have been really rich before.&quot; This iron-gold stone wall would be impossible to breach without siege weapons. Even for a Sky Knight like me, it would take a very long time. Then, not wanting to waste any more time, he called the system, &quot;I want to exchange for two siege engines.&quot; In a flash, the system reported back. &quot;Ding! Exchanged for two siege engines.</p>
<p>Do you want to spawn them?&quot; He replied decisively, &quot;Spawn them now.&quot; Immediately after, two top-grade siege engines were spawned by the system before everyone&#x27;s eyes. When the siege weapons appeared, the two minotaur brothers were wide-eyed with astonishment, confusion, and bewilderment. Unable to let any more time go to waste, Sibin shot forward with his power. Then he carefully assigned the tasks again, &quot;You guys take the siege weapons and the militia to attack from the other side. I will attack from this side and wait for you to regroup.&quot; &quot;Yes, my lord.&quot; Meanwhile, two city guards were still in their respective corners, one standing and one sitting, sleeping soundly, completely unaware of what was about to happen to Budun City.</p>
<p>As Sibin flew past using his power, the two began to sense a strange aura and groggily woke up, letting out a soft cry, &quot;Ugh.&quot; But before these two could fully wake up, he used his power to put them into an eternal, endless sleep. Just then, another guard saw this from a distance and was stunned in amazement. This man hurriedly shouted to alert his comrades for support, &quot;Enemy attack! Someone is attacking the city!&quot; So, very quickly, a series of other soldiers rushed out to swarm him. There was even one sitting in wait, preparing to fire a cannon straight at him, just waiting for the right moment. However, just as his hand lightly touched the control lever, an unseen shadow appeared behind him, making him feel a significant threat as cold sweat poured down in streams.</p>
<p>It was an extremely suffocating feeling. The minotaur didn&#x27;t say much and directly flung him down from the control machine, causing him to scream loudly in pain, &quot;Ugh, ahhh!&quot; before falling with a thud to the ground. The enemy was gone, so this playground was now for Kax. He looked at the control lever with fascination and enchantment. Next, without much thought, he directly fired this advanced weapon, shooting a blast straight to the opposite side.</p>
<p>A terrifyingly powerful and oppressive blast was unleashed. It shot straight from Kax&#x27;s position to the building opposite and exploded with a boom, creating a powerful, spreading fire. The minotaur&#x27;s eyes lit up with fascination as he exclaimed, &quot;By Mother Earth above, Kax likes this.&quot; So he had to hurry over and remind him, &quot;Alright, stop playing. Leave a few men to guard one side of the city wall. Destroy all the other magic cannons in the city for me.</p>
<p>The rest of you, follow me to loot Homan Castle clean.&quot; This made him jump in alarm, like a child being scolded for doing something wrong. Suddenly, the system&#x27;s notification sound rang out. &quot;Ding! Daily villain quest updated. Villain Quest One: Plunder the iron ore that originally belonged to the Budun family. Villain Quest Two: Loot Homan Castle clean.</p>
<p>Villain Quest Three: In the upcoming battle, kill all the Earth Knights and send the heads of the Earth Knights to Count Amm.&quot; This immediate mission left him a bit stunned and bewildered, because of its reward as well. &quot;Completing all missions has a chance to trigger a critical reward. Host, please continue to work hard.&quot; Great Knight Grimon felt that the situation didn&#x27;t seem right and said, &quot;Strange.&quot; This made Sibin ask with some curiosity, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; Right after, he directly voiced the doubts in his heart. &quot;Logically speaking, Viscount Budun is naturally suspicious. Once he suspected the Eagle Crest army was delaying, he would have launched an attack immediately.</p>
<p>So much time has passed now, why is there no movement?&quot; Then, suddenly, a panicked soldier came running and shouting loudly, &quot;Lord Grimon, I... It&#x27;s bad!&quot; This made him a little worried, and he hurriedly asked, &quot;What is it?&quot; The soldier, out of breath, hastily reported what he had observed, &quot;I went to the enemy&#x27;s position to investigate and found their camp empty.&quot; He was so shocked he couldn&#x27;t believe it and hurriedly asked, &quot;What did you say?&quot; The young man then affirmed with even more certainty and determination, &quot;I saw with my own eyes that there wasn&#x27;t a single soldier in the enemy&#x27;s camp. Judging by the tracks on the ground, it seems they have retreated.&quot; Understanding the enemy&#x27;s plan, his gut burned with anxiety as he exclaimed in horror to himself, &quot;This is bad.&quot; Then he impatiently shouted, &quot;Young Master Sibin!&quot; Next, he hastily ordered a change to the previously established plan, &quot;All soldiers, advance to Homan Castle at top speed!&quot; Meanwhile, Sibin in Homan Castle was still unaware of the terrible things that were about to happen to him, so he was still cheerfully ordering his subordinates, &quot;Take everything that&#x27;s valuable.&quot; &quot;Anything inconvenient to take, like oil paintings and silks, burn it all.&quot; His cold and brutal voice made the few commoners present tremble like leaves. Seeing Kax even gathering some plates, he shouted in annoyance, &quot;What are you taking plates for? They&#x27;re not worth a penny. Smash them.&quot; The system somehow escaped its low-level robbing interest and started down the path of becoming a crazed bandit.</p>
<p>crazed. Kax, as if he had just discovered something interesting, called out to him in an excited voice, &quot;My lord, hurry and come see what&#x27;s here.&quot; This made him reply with some suspicion, &quot;What is it?&quot; As he approached the door that the two minotaurs had opened, the glittering light of gold, silver, treasures, and jewelry flashed out. His eyes immediately lit up, the corners of his mouth curved up quite a bit, and his mood brightened considerably as he exclaimed, &quot;So much gold? Turns out this Viscount Budun is quite something.&quot; His heart bloomed with joy as he thought to himself, &quot;I&#x27;ve struck it rich!&quot; Next, he cheerfully and excitedly ordered, &quot;You and the other minotaurs, come here. Move all of these chests out.&quot; They quickly ran over and hastily replied, &quot;Coming right away, my lord.&quot; Then suddenly, an iron cage abruptly dropped down, imprisoning them. Sibin also shouted a loud warning to everyone, &quot;It&#x27;s a trap!&quot; The minotaur quickly reassured him, &quot;No need to worry, my lord.</p>
<p>Watch me. It&#x27;s just a flimsy cage.&quot; Then he used all his strength to bend the sturdy iron cage. But no matter how much he bent it, no matter how much strength he used, the iron cage was not damaged or moved in the slightest, making the minotaur a little suspicious. &quot;Huh? Strange, why isn&#x27;t it budging at all?&quot; Therefore, the minotaur shouted and turned to warn, &quot;My lord, there&#x27;s something strange about this cage.&quot; Seeing this situation, he also pondered to himself, &quot;If even the minotaur&#x27;s strength is not enough, then even for me, I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s also...&quot; Then, a smug voice suddenly rang out, &quot;It&#x27;s useless. Stop being so gullible.</p>
<p>This cage will absorb all the power emitted from your body. It can&#x27;t be opened from the inside.&quot; He glanced at him with some suspicion and asked, &quot;You are?&quot; &quot;Viscount Budun.&quot; Hearing this, the man laughed sinisterly and said, &quot;Long time no see, Lord of Eagle Crest.&quot; Faced with Viscount Budun&#x27;s sudden appearance, he couldn&#x27;t help but speculate suspiciously, &quot;He&#x27;s appearing here, could it be that Grimon and the others lost?&quot; This gave the man another opportunity to laugh mockingly, &quot;Ha ha, those fools are still waiting for me to launch an attack. By the time they react, they might just be in time to collect your corpses.&quot; He gripped the cold iron bar, his voice becoming grimmer than ever as he asked flatly, &quot;There is one thing I&#x27;m very curious about.&quot; &quot;How did you know I was at Homan Castle? It couldn&#x27;t have been a coincidence that someone told you, could it?&quot; he then looked at him with a cold gaze that seemed to see through one&#x27;s soul, full of sarcasm. Seeing that he had guessed the situation, the man was not angry but laughed out loud, &quot;Ha ha ha, worthy of the Lord of Eagle Crest, you grasped the key point in an instant. It&#x27;s a pity you&#x27;re still too young, unable to see through people&#x27;s hearts.&quot; As he spoke, he clapped his hands, endlessly praising his ability.</p>
<p>Next, he coldly walked to the iron cage and feignedly advised him, &quot;From now on, remember not to trust anyone so easily. And especially don&#x27;t get involved with people you shouldn&#x27;t.&quot; Then he pressed that cold sword against his neck threateningly. His face was full of malice, and a strong killing intent emanated from him. He thrust the sword towards him and said with a heart full of satisfaction, &quot;Time to die, Lord of Eagle Crest.&quot; At the very moment he was about to finish him off, a familiar aura suddenly appeared. The sword he was using for the deed was knocked flying backward, and his face couldn&#x27;t help but show alarm and astonishment.</p>
<p>As for him, he was both overjoyed and worried as he shouted loudly, &quot; Grimon.&quot; At this moment, he had used his fastest speed to stop him. His face was full of worry mixed with guilt as he spoke, &quot;Master, I apologize for being late.&quot; Viscount Budun stood to one side, laughing loudly and exclaiming, &quot;Worthy of a Great Knight, to have broken through the encirclement so quickly. Ohohoho. It&#x27;s a pity you only have one Great Knight who caught up, while we have three Great Knights.&quot; After speaking, his face was now full of smug arrogance. Grimon, refusing to back down, threatened back, &quot;You&#x27;d better release our Lord of Eagle Crest, or our reinforcements will immediately level this place.&quot; But how could these words deceive an old fox like Viscount Budun? He laughed mockingly, &quot;Ha ha ha, what foolish fabrications.</p>
<p>I heard that the Lord of Eagle Crest killed the Great Knight in charge of conscription as a show of force before dispatching his troops, so I guess you don&#x27;t have any reinforcements ready.&quot; &quot; Next, he ordered his subordinates, &quot;Capture him for me.&quot; So they didn&#x27;t dare hesitate and replied, &quot;As you command.&quot; Then they rushed forward and attacked Grimon in unison. A frenzied killing intent erupted from all of them, but he remained unfazed, gripping his sword tightly. But as he was dueling with one of them, another attacked from behind. The chaotic scene before his eyes made Sibin, though trapped, so worried that he had to shout a warning to him, &quot;Watch your back!&quot; At this moment, he could only curse helplessly, &quot;Damn it, trapped in this wretched cage, I can&#x27;t do anything.&quot; After being ganged up on for a while, Grimon finally could no longer hold out. He had gradually lost all his strength and fell flat on the ground.</p>
<p>Sharp blades were also pressed against his neck, ready to take his life at any moment. Just when he thought he was about to lose his life, Viscount Budun suddenly made an offer, &quot;I&#x27;ll give you a chance to survive now. The prerequisite is that you must be loyal to Count Amm. A powerhouse like you shouldn&#x27;t die so resentfully here.&quot; However, for a true powerhouse like him, this was nothing short of a humiliation, so he resolutely replied, &quot;I, Grimon, swear to die loyal to the Lord of Eagle Crest.&quot; Seeing him so resolute, he knew that any further attempts would be futile, so he replied with some regret, &quot;What a pity. Kill him.&quot; At the same time, outside Budun City.</p>
<p>The scene was more chaotic than ever, with soldiers from both sides clashing to determine a victor, everyone&#x27;s face ferocious and filled with a killing intent to take the opponent&#x27;s life. At this time, Sibin&#x27;s soldiers began to panic slightly. They started to fall into confusion and hesitation; the number of enemy troops was too large. &quot;If we continue to be worn down like this, sooner or later our entire army will be defeated, but what about the Lord?&quot; However, there was still someone who confidently reassured his comrades, &quot;Grimon has broken out of the encirclement. He will definitely bring the Lord back safely.</p>
<p>We should retreat first and discuss things more thoroughly.&quot; When there were still some who hesitated, saying, &quot;But...&quot; he once again replied decisively, &quot;There are no buts. If we don&#x27;t retreat now, there won&#x27;t be any time left.&quot; After that, they hid in a safe corner to conceal themselves. But even from a distance, they could see a group of people holding all sorts of crude weapons like hoes, shovels, hammers, and sickles, charging forward with great enthusiasm and shouting, &quot;Kill!&quot; Only now did they joyfully say that reinforcements had arrived. An old farmer even strongly suggested, &quot;Sir Knights, you should go. We are just a group of farmers, but you Sir Knights are the important strength of our Lord,&quot; which made them a bit bewildered and ask, &quot;You are all a self-organized militia, but&quot; &quot;why?&quot; Hearing this, the farmers there also emotionally shared, &quot;The Lord has been compassionate to us, reducing our taxes.</p>
<p>We have nothing to repay him with. We&#x27;re willing to trade these humble lives of ours for the survival of you Sir Knights. You Sir Knights will surely protect Eagle Crest City well and protect the Lord.&quot; Now, deep inside Homan Castle, Grimon could no longer resist. He was lying listlessly on the ground, looking at the cold, sharp sword pointing straight at him. A soldier had begun to execute his technique, gripping the sword in his hand and saying coldly, &quot;Go die,&quot; when suddenly another sword flew in from nowhere.</p>
<p>And the one who threw it was none other than Sibin, but this guy, still unaware, just ducked his head and ran for his life. Then the iron cage suddenly exploded. This guy was still confused, scratching his head and muttering to himself, &quot;Damn it, the sword you threw was off- target.&quot; But he just coldly approached him and asked in a low voice, &quot;Off-target? Why don&#x27;t I feel that way?&quot; This sent a chill down his spine, and cold sweat broke out. Meanwhile, he looked at him coldly, his whole body radiating a furious aura. The soldiers, seeing Sibin who was supposed to be trapped now looming before them, couldn&#x27;t help but be astonished and wonder in disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;How is this possible?&quot; Viscount Budun was similarly suspicious and voiced his doubt, &quot;How did that guy get out?&quot; Then he tried to recall and realized with horror that it was the chaotic sword light from just now, a spell to break the cage from the outside. But he couldn&#x27;t believe it and exclaimed, &quot;So absurd! In such a chaotic situation, and yet...&quot; However, no matter how astonished he was, he still tried to act fine, but deep down he was in turmoil as he reassured the soldiers. &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid! Our side has 3 Great Knights, the advantage hasn&#x27;t changed. Let&#x27;s go together and stop him.&quot; Seeing their commander so confident, the soldiers quickly replied, &quot;Understood!&quot; and heroically charged forward. Facing the large number of enemy troops, Grimon couldn&#x27;t help but worry and rushed forward to remind Sibin, &quot;Young Mas-, be careful, these guys...&quot; But as soon as he uttered the word &quot;Young,&quot; his words got stuck in his throat, his face filled with astonished horror.</p>
<p>Looking at the flame of power burning around Sibin, while he himself was confidently shining like a glittering torch, he couldn&#x27;t help but wonder in confusion, &quot;A pale golden battle aura... what kind of power is this?&quot; However, it seemed the soldiers were not yet aware of what was about to happen to them, so they began to execute their technique, &quot;Sky...&quot; And yet, just as they shouted their slogan, &quot;Sky Knight,&quot; they were immediately incinerated by his battle flame in bewildered horror. After dealing with these minions, he suddenly let out a sigh of relief, while the Viscount began to tremble in fear and screamed out, &quot;Huaaah!&quot; He sheathed his sword behind his back, then turned to ask, &quot;Grimon, are you all right?&quot; Only now did the others frantically report, &quot;My Lord, he&#x27;s too heavily injured and has passed out,&quot; causing him to shout in worried surprise, &quot;What?&quot; Sibin quickly went over to briefly check his condition, then breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Luckily, it&#x27;s not life-threatening. After returning and drinking a Potion of Life, he&#x27;ll be a fine man again.&quot; As the Lord of Eagle Crest, he also had to ponder, &quot;But situations like this will become more and more frequent in the future.</p>
<p>The number of injured will also increase. We can&#x27;t drink a Potion of Life every time. This time, after returning, I must make sure to grasp the timing for Lory&#x27;s awakening.&quot; The bull-headed men began to display their might, directly using their weapons to execute their abilities, &quot;Strength and Loyalty,&quot; causing the surrounding people to only scream and wail, &quot;Huaaah!&quot; which made those around them whisper amongst themselves, &quot;Those... those monsters actually have magic cannons.&quot; But after careful observation, they suddenly realized, &quot;Looking closely, aren&#x27;t those the cannons from our own city walls?&quot; &quot;The Bloodhood clan has joined the battlefield! Quick, report to the Viscount!&quot; The people on Budun City&#x27;s side were thrown into a panic. Then they began to shout in alarm, &quot;Budun City...</p>
<p>Budun City has fallen! Homan Castle has also been completely wiped out! The Viscount is missing!&quot; This caused the entire crowd to fall into chaos, &quot;What?&quot; and then they urged each other, &quot;Retreat! Retreat!&quot; Everything proceeded like this until night fell. Grimon asked with some curiosity, &quot;Young Master Sibin, you&#x27;ve broken through to become a Sky Knight?&quot; to which he nonchalantly replied, &quot;I just broke through two days ago, I just didn&#x27;t have time to tell you.&quot; The steward was now moved, feeling joyful as he exclaimed, &quot;That&#x27;s great, that&#x27;s wonderful. Young Master Sibin, I apologize for my previous doubts about what you were doing. If not for the self-organized militia&#x27;s aid this time, which turned the situation around, this old life of mine would probably have been left here. And you are so young, in the future, you can definitely become a Champion Knight, and even becoming a Legend is not impossible.&quot; This made him smile happily and chuckle in response, &quot;Perhaps one day, under my leadership, the flag of Eagle Crest territory might fly all over the Can Continent, who knows.&quot; The bull-headed men also enthusiastically made promises and vows, &quot;My Lord, the Bloodwood clan is willing to go through thorns for you, to serve you with utmost devotion,&quot; causing him to be so moved he spat out the water he was drinking.</p>
<p>These guys also kept repeating the phrase, &quot;Strength and Loyalty,&quot; which annoyed him greatly as he complained with disdain, &quot;So noisy.&quot; A peaceful and happy atmosphere continued like this until the next morning. When he began to call out, &quot;System, draw reward,&quot; it immediately appeared and announced, &quot;Detected that the host has completed all daily missions. Drawing rewards for the host.&quot; &quot;Congratulations to the host for receiving the troop reward: Three-Headed Hellhound. Critical reward triggered: Special troop upgrade, Saracen, the Hellfire Lord. The reward will be delivered in a reasonable manner.</p>
<p>Host, please prepare an empty plot of land. Detected that the host has completely plundered Budun City and destroyed the accumulated assets of the Budun family, seized the iron ore, killed the capable Great Knights under Count Amm, creating an extremely severe psychological impact on many people. Received 30,000 villain points.&quot; This generous reward made him unable to help but exclaim in happy satisfaction, &quot;Nice, a critical reward, and on top of that, villain points. That much, huh?&quot; the system suddenly chimed with a notification. In the sky above Eagle Crest City, whooshing and swishing sounds suddenly appeared, causing the soldiers standing below to look up and watch.</p>
<p>And the people in the city were no exception; they all had to stop and look up at the blue light that was streaking down, along with the announcement, &quot;The reward has been distributed.&quot; Meanwhile, Sibin was busy guessing what the reward was, humming a tune, &quot;Hellfire, I wonder what kind of unit it is. Probably a fire spirit. I wonder where it will appear from this time.&quot; Then, suddenly, the wall behind him exploded with a loud bang, shattering completely, making his little heart feel like it was about to jump out of his chest. He cursed angrily as the meteorite suddenly flashed with a ray of light and then cracked wide open. His mission reward had appeared.</p>
<p>It was so large it astonished him, while it roared with delight, &quot;Fire, death, ashes, new world, new destruction, the Burning Legion, burn it all!&quot; &quot;Great Lord Akma Sibin, Saracen the Hellfire will pledge my loyalty to you.&quot; But suddenly, the words caught in its throat. It exclaimed in astonishment, &quot;Ack.&quot; It even had the audacity to ask, &quot;Why are you such a tiny worm?&quot; This infuriated Sibin, who gritted his teeth and said, &quot;As you can see, I am the one who summoned you, and also the worm you speak of.&quot; This made Saracen tremble and hastily correct itself, &quot;Ah, damn it. Oh no, I mean, this is wonderful. Saracen the Hellfire will pledge my loyalty to you.&quot; But its insolent mouth was still up to its old tricks. &quot;You lowly worm, ack, great lord.&quot; Sibin could only reply helplessly, &quot;Saracen, right? Can you retract the flames on your body? My desk is about to catch fire.&quot; Seeing him say this, it obediently replied, &quot;Of course, I can.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll do it for you right away.&quot; Saracen, Ashen Form, Identity, Hellfire Leader, Strength, Great Demon Level 55, 51 to 60, Skills, Hellfire Descent, Lava Attack, Volcano Eruption, Passive Demonic Flame. Passive Magic Immunity, Passive Petrification Immunity, Equipment, None, Burning Legion Reputation, 52413, Hellfire Leader, Powerful, younger brother of Supremus the Gatekeeper. Looking at Saracen&#x27;s impressive profile, Sibin couldn&#x27;t help but feel satisfied, thinking to himself, &quot;Hellfire, look at this level. Look at these amazing skills. There&#x27;s no way I could fight it.</p>
<p>As expected, the system&#x27;s critical hit rewards have never been disappointing.&quot; After destroying his desk, it even asked smugly, &quot;How about it, worm? Ack, esteemed great lord.&quot; Sibin pondered for a moment, thinking, &quot;However, in terms of strength...&quot; The fact that it kept calling him a worm was getting on his nerves, so he questioned it, &quot;Ultimately, is it contempt or respect? Can you just stick to one?&quot; But it was still up to its old tricks, &quot;Yes, worm.&quot; This drove Sibin mad, and he quickly reminded it, &quot;Stick to respect, right now.&quot; He had a headache and rubbed his temples, saying in frustration, &quot;I really want to throw this guy into class with Lory.&quot; Speak of the devil, and he shall appear. Lory suddenly pushed the door open and rushed in, asking worriedly, &quot;Master, are you alright?&quot; Sibin was truly helpless and replied wearily, &quot;I didn&#x27;t mean right now.&quot; Seeing the little girl arrive, Saracen ran over in surprise and exclaimed, &quot;Huh?&quot; It then looked at the little girl judgmentally. This hellfire even gave its frank assessment, &quot;A worm, an even smaller worm, and it looks a bit like a beastman. What a strange worm.&quot; This left the little girl wide-eyed and stunned. Fearing she would be hurt, Sibin had to quickly speak up and remind it, &quot;Shut your mouth.&quot; Then he explained in confusion, &quot;Lory, this is...&quot; But before he could finish his sentence, she rushed into his arms and screamed in fear, &quot;Mon-monster! If you&#x27;re going to eat someone, eat me! Master, run away quickly!&quot; So he didn&#x27;t know what to do and just stood there frozen, calling out softly, &quot;Lory.&quot; Before he could feel touched, the little girl said again, &quot;My...</p>
<p>my master stinks, he doesn&#x27;t taste good.&quot; This made him want to cry out loud. They had almost completely forgotten the meaning of the word &#x27;respect&#x27;. He then reassured the little girl, &quot;Lory, Lory, don&#x27;t be afraid. It&#x27;s not like that.&quot; Next, he led the little girl to Saracen and formally introduced them, &quot;This is also my subordinate. He just arrived today, fell from the sky.</p>
<p>Now, get to know each other a little.&quot; The little girl was still astonished and bewildered, shouting, &quot;What? This... this is also Master&#x27;s subordinate?&quot; And that strange flame was still deep in thought, &quot;In comparison, the great lord doesn&#x27;t seem that small after all.&quot; Sibin could only force a smile and explain to her. &quot;Yes, so there&#x27;s no need to be afraid. Just like the bull-headed man, his appearance is just a bit...&quot; Suddenly, a frantic voice called out, &quot;Great Lord, Great Lord, your subordinate was late in coming to your aid! Young Master Sibin, Great Lord, you must not die!&quot; It was none other than the butler and a group of familiar faces from Eagle Crest City, rushing in in a panic, afraid that their lord was in danger. But as soon as they reached the door, they were somewhat surprised and froze solid, exclaiming, &quot;Hey.&quot; Sibin just spoke calmly, &quot;Anyway, let me introduce you all.&quot; Then suddenly, their eyes met.</p>
<p>Both the hellfire and the bull-headed man looked at each other with strange expressions. After that, Saracen was seen saying cryptically, &quot;Hmph, damn it, even more worms. Not to mention this one, why is there a bull-headed worm of Thunder Bluff here?&quot; The bull-headed man directly confronted it and replied, &quot;Great Mother Earth above, how can there be a hellfire here? Has Sazaras&#x27;s hand already reached this universe?&quot; The others around didn&#x27;t pay much attention because what they were focused on at that moment was, &quot;What kind of monster is this?&quot; The bull-headed man continued, &quot;Protect the lord.&quot; Seeing the gunpowder-filled atmosphere on both sides, Sibin laughed helplessly and said, &quot;Alright, um.&quot; He then reassured them, &quot;Everyone, relax. This is a rock man I recruited, named Saracen. From now on, he&#x27;s our comrade.</p>
<p>He won&#x27;t hurt anyone.&quot; &quot;But the premise is that you don&#x27;t touch it.&quot; While Lory kept staring at him blankly, thinking about the hellfire, the bull-headed man suddenly shouted, &quot;What? Great Lord, are you serious? Although it&#x27;s not a pure demon, it still has demon blood flowing in it, a demonic structure with all kinds of fel energy burning on its body. Are you sure it will completely obey your words?&quot; At this point, Sibin felt that the bull-headed man&#x27;s reaction since meeting the hellfire was strange, so he asked suspiciously, &quot;Do you two know each other?&quot; At this time, Saracen slowly spoke up, &quot;Instead of saying we know each other, in reality, we come from the same world.&quot; The bull-headed man added, &quot;In my homeland, we were once forced to cooperate with these monsters to invade other worlds.&quot; Hearing this, Sibin stroked his chin thoughtfully, thinking to himself, &quot;Invade other worlds.&quot; Saracen suddenly burst out laughing, &quot;Hah.&quot; Then it said smugly, &quot;Bull-headed worms of Thunder Bluff, it is your honor to be able to contribute to the great Burning Legion.&quot; But it only reminded him in a cold voice, &quot;Hateful thing, the one you must serve now is Lord Eagle Crest.&quot; The hellfire, not to be outdone, replied, &quot;Damn it, hmph, I mean, praise Sazaras, it is my, Saracen&#x27;s, honor to be able to contribute to Lord Eagle Crest.&quot; They kept arguing back and forth, giving Sibin a headache. He raised his hand to stop them, &quot;Um, if you two giants keep making noise, my room will be destroyed. Send someone to repair my room. Everyone, go back.&quot; Just when it seemed like everything was settled, Saracen looked at him pitifully and asked, &quot;Great Lord, where do I go back to?&quot; It was only then that Sibin suddenly realized and thought in confusion, &quot;Oh right, where should I put this giant flaming thing? Master.&quot; Suddenly, Lory said enthusiastically, &quot;Leave this to me.&quot; This made him a bit suspicious and he quickly asked, &quot;Leave it to you?&quot; The girl just nodded vigorously, smiling brightly as she replied confidently, &quot;Yes.&quot; In just a moment, the sky had gradually turned to dusk.</p>
<p>The people who went out were bewildered and confused. The hellfire was arranged by Lory to rest in a unique spot, which was the small waterfall outside, to prevent it from suddenly bursting into flames. It just sat there dejectedly, while everyone else was still whispering, &quot;The Great Lord&#x27;s hobbies are getting stranger and stranger, huh?&quot; &quot;Indeed.&quot; It was thought that the peaceful atmosphere would just continue like this. Then, suddenly, on the side of Eagle Crest City, strange figures in black cloaks appeared. They were moving in a large group, aggressively advancing.</p>
<p>The leader announced, &quot;According to our information, Lord Eagle Crest returned to Eagle Crest City tonight. This is the best time for an assassination. We must seize the opportunity.&quot; As they were walking brazenly through the city, a voice suddenly stopped them, &quot;You cannot pass this way.&quot; This made them confused and suspicious. One of them even threatened aggressively, &quot;Rotten old man, are you looking for death?&quot; The leader raised his hand to stop him, &quot;Wait a minute. My, my, look who it is.</p>
<p>Parker Luser, do you still recognize me?&quot; At first, he was still confused and suspicious, but when he got a clearer look at the person in front of him, his eyes suddenly darkened, and the corners of his mouth couldn&#x27;t help but tremble, &quot;Wdeh, it&#x27;s you.&quot; Hearing this, the man didn&#x27;t bother to hide anymore, pulling down his hood and laughing mockingly, &quot;That&#x27;s right, Parker Luser. If it weren&#x27;t for those eyes of yours, I&#x27;m afraid I wouldn&#x27;t have recognized you. I didn&#x27;t expect that after only two years, you&#x27;ve aged into this state. Your wife&#x27;s blood was truly useful. I feel stronger than ever now.</p>
<p>Thank you, Parker.&quot; This man even brazenly touched upon the deep pain in his heart, his most beloved wife, with a sarcastic and mocking tone. &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting for you to come and take revenge on me, Alchemy Grandmaster Parker. But haven&#x27;t you run out of magic power? How is a piece of trash like you going to get revenge on me?&quot; The old man&#x27;s trembling hands took out a red pill from a small chest, and his whole body radiated a murderous aura as he said, &quot;I originally wanted to kill a few Holy Temple knights before looking for you. I didn&#x27;t expect you to deliver yourself to my doorstep.&quot; He affirmed in a grim voice, &quot;Revenge? You will see it. I guarantee it.&quot; Then, before the astonished eyes of the group, he swallowed the mysterious pill.</p>
<p>A subordinate, seeing this, exclaimed in shock, &quot;This old man actually used a special potion, burning his life force as a price to reach the realm of a knight, didn&#x27;t he?&quot; Wdeh wasn&#x27;t worried at all; on the contrary, he laughed with interest, &quot;Ha, Number Two, Number Three, come with me. Let&#x27;s play with this old dog.&quot; Next, he ordered, &quot;The rest of you, go and complete the mission given by His Holiness the Pope. We must win this quickly.&quot; Below the castle, an explosion suddenly rang out. Boom! It was so loud that it even startled Sibin&#x27;s room upstairs, causing Lory to ask in fear and confusion, &quot;What exploded?&quot; He quickly got out of bed and went to the window to observe, asking with great suspicion, &quot;What on earth is going on? Why has our fountain turned into an erupting volcano?&quot; Meanwhile, down below, Saracen was smiling with great interest at the group of intruders in the city. &quot;Ah ha ha ha, you insects! The great Saracen must burn you to ashes! Tremble! Scream! Volcano Eruption!&quot; This left them confused and shocked, sweating profusely as they wondered, &quot;Ugh ah ah ah, why is there this lava creature in Lord Eagle Crest&#x27;s city?&quot; Then they cursed angrily, &quot;The people from the intelligence department are truly a bunch of vermin.</p>
<p>His Holiness the Pope should burn them to death.&quot; The crowd fell into a panicked frenzy, shouting amongst themselves. Banda above, avoid the spewing molten lava! Ugh, ah, ah, ah! But the Hellfire was extremely refreshed and excited, laughing. Ha ha ha, suffering, fear, what a delicacy. Meanwhile, they shrieked in panic, Help! He stood high above, observing carefully. After hearing key phrases like &quot;His Holiness the Pope&quot; and &quot;Banda,&quot; he had a vague idea.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s how it is. Then he called out, Lory. The young girl quickly replied, Master. Sibin gently stroked her head and said, Bring me my sword. You stay here in the room, I&#x27;ll be right back.</p>
<p>Lory reminded him worriedly, Master, you must be careful. Because what he was concerned about was, if they keep fighting like this, Eagle Crest City will be destroyed. After he was ready, he put on his armor and charged with his sword, leaving the Pope&#x27;s men staring blankly after him. Then, they suddenly shouted, Another Sky Knight! He took note of their word &quot;another.&quot; Knowing he was a Sky Knight made them even more confused, wondering, It&#x27;s the Lord of Eagle Crest, our assassination target, but isn&#x27;t he an Earth Knight? The more they thought, the angrier they got, telling themselves, The intelligence this time really has a huge problem. If we can get back, we&#x27;ll risk our lives for something else.</p>
<p>Seeing the whole group ganging up on him, he pouted in boredom and said, Pfft, this trick again? Is this all you&#x27;ve got? As the dignified Lord of Eagle Crest, he didn&#x27;t want to waste words on these small fries, so he unleashed his Dragon Vein power. His eyes suddenly blazed fiercely, and his whole body emanated the powerful aura of a divine dragon. Immediately after, he just gently slashed down, creating a huge amount of damage, then leaped towards the Pope&#x27;s men. Witnessing this ultimate display of power made them more bewildered than ever, asking doubtfully, A Sky Knight can kill a Holy Temple Knight of the Earth level with one strike. Damn it, could this also be an old monster who became a Sky Knight many years ago? How old is the Lord of Eagle Crest, is he even 25? Seeing that they weren&#x27;t very focused, he carefully reminded them, Where are you looking? One by one, they trembled like leaves, screaming in terror, Hmph, ugh! Then, from a distance, a familiar voice rang out, My Lord, Young Master Sibin.</p>
<p>The Pope&#x27;s men could only grunt in acceptance. Let&#x27;s regroup with Lord Wade. We&#x27;ve failed this mission. Seeing them scrambling to flee, he just stared at them and said in a low, threatening voice, You wreck someone&#x27;s city and then you want to run? In your dreams. Then he shot straight up to chase them, making the people around crane their necks to look up.</p>
<p>Over on this side, old Parker was still struggling alone against these men. Wade couldn&#x27;t help but feel disappointed, saying, Truly disappointing. A normal person possessing the power of a Sky Knight, with no knightly skills, nor the perception and experience of a knight. Even if you learn how to use a sword, you&#x27;re still just as useless. But the old man still resolutely charged forward to fight to the end, to avenge his late wife.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the subordinates he had just sent on the mission to assassinate Sibin returned, calling out in panic, Lord Wade! This surprised him a little, and he asked, Number 5, Number 7, Number 11, you&#x27;re back so soon? Mission accomplished? But it wasn&#x27;t that easy. One of them frantically warned, Lord Wade, run! The Lord of Eagle Crest has become a Sky Knight. Our intelligence was completely wrong. And there&#x27;s a powerful lava creature in Eagle Crest City, at least at the Sky Knight level. Just then, he appeared behind him, a cold, humorless smile on his face as he said, Are these your last words? Then he slashed straight down, not even giving him a chance to say another word.</p>
<p>The Pope&#x27;s men could only stammer in utter shock, What? My Lord! Seeing the person in front of him, he exclaimed in some surprise, Old Parker, why is it him? The last time he saw old Parker, he was just an ordinary person. How could he survive being surrounded by three Holy Temple Knights now? The system immediately displayed the old man&#x27;s information. Name: Parker Luser. Life Force Overdrawn. Identity: Grand Alchemist.</p>
<p>Strength: Temporary Level 51 Sky Knight. Skills: Advanced Pharmaceutics, Intermediate Fire Element Mastery (Unavailable), Basic Swordsmanship. Equipment: Litna Sword (Exquisite). Colonnel Empire Reputation: 121. He was once a nationally famous Grand Alchemist.</p>
<p>But now he is just a pitiful man who lost his wife, living in obscurity to seek revenge. Eagle Crest Reputation: 102. Many people in Eagle Crest City are full of gratitude for the kind old Parker. However, he was very surprised that such a kind person would resort to this method, thinking to himself, To actually use a special method to overdraw his life force, forcibly raising his strength to the Sky Knight level. Wade shouted an order to his subordinates, You lot, go and stop him! So they charged forward to attack, obediently replying, Yes! A compelling aura emanated from his body as he let out a faint, mocking laugh, Pfft, still want to stop me? But they were still itching for a fight and refused to believe it, so as soon as they charged, he slashed, sending them to their graves.</p>
<p>So, no matter how much he didn&#x27;t want to believe it, he had to gape in astonishment, thinking to himself, He can easily kill Holy Temple Knights with just his sword aura. Only someone who has reached the strength of a Sky Knight can do something like this. Realizing the gravity of the situation, he quickly shouted a declaration, One Parker, one Lord of Eagle Crest. The situation is unfavorable now, we must retreat quickly. But the old man just coldly approached and asked in a low voice, Want to run? He was already eager to make a quick getaway, and now faced with a roadblock like the old man, he angrily roared, Get out of the way, you mad old man! But the old man just snorted coldly and replied, Before I die, I won&#x27;t let you leave here by even a single step.</p>
<p>The anger in him could no longer be contained. Gritting his teeth, he extended his sharp claws, his whole body radiating a compelling aura as he cursed, Then you can go die! After that, a murderous aura was seen surrounding the old man, causing him pain as his eyes turned bloodshot. Next, he showed no mercy and charged forward, stabbing him straight in the stomach, making his face turn pale. from the pain. Seeing this, Sibin screamed in horror, calling out worriedly, Parker Luser! However, no matter how much it hurt, the old man refused to let go of him, holding on tightly, which made him furious as he cursed, Let go, you crazy old man! The old man endured the pain and made his final request to him, My Lord, kill him for me.</p>
<p>So he granted the kind and gentle old man&#x27;s wish, pressing the cold blade of his sword against his neck, causing his eyes to widen in shock and his face to turn pale with fear. Then, what was bound to happen, happened. He collapsed to the ground and breathed his last, while he just casually shouldered the sword. Parker gasped for breath, laboriously calling out, My Lord. I heard, I heard that you also really like a subhuman girl, is that true? He then honestly affirmed, Yes.</p>
<p>Hearing this, the old man laughed loudly, ha ha, then coughed violently, cough cough. Finally, he managed to give his last piece of advice, Then you must, you must protect her well. He then made a promise to himself, I will protect her well. As soon as he returned to the room, he sighed wearily. Suddenly, she threw herself into his arms, hugging him tightly, which made him ask with some concern, Lory, what&#x27;s wrong with you? Hearing this, the little girl sobbed even more, crying her eyes out in his arms, saying in a choked voice, Master, you&#x27;re not hurt, are you? I heard a lot of noise downstairs.</p>
<p>Lory doesn&#x27;t want Master to get hurt. Lory really wanted to go down and protect Master, but Lory was afraid of getting in Master&#x27;s way. Understanding the little girl&#x27;s feelings, he gently comforted her, Lory is not a burden at all. Besides, you&#x27;re about to awaken. After you awaken, you might even be more powerful than Master.</p>
<p>At that time, you&#x27;ll have to protect Master, okay? It was just something he said to comfort the little girl, but Lory kept muttering, Awakening can protect Master. I really want to protect Master. I don&#x27;t want to hide behind him. Lory must become stronger. Then, her whole body began to glow with a strange light, making him turn pale with worry.</p>
<p>Just like that, the little girl unexpectedly awakened right then and there. The whole room was filled with a light so strong that he had to raise his hand to shield his eyes. Sibin just stood there in a daze, not understanding what had just happened. Then he stammered, unable to form a complete sentence, Lory, you... you...</p>
<p>you... Just then, the system panel popped up with a notification. Name: Lory. Identity: Personal Nun, Sibin&#x27;s Lover. Strength: Awakened Subhuman Stage One, Level 42 (41-50).</p>
<p>Skills: Wood Dance of Cold Light (AoE), Endless Proliferation (Single), Holy Spirit&#x27;s Blessing (Defense), Ancient Wood&#x27;s Spring Rejuvenation (Dispel), Natural Harmony (Passive), Plant Control (Passive), Fragrance of Fortune (Passive). Equipment: None. Reputation: Eagle Crest 28. A beautiful young girl, yet unknown to anyone because her body and heart already belong to one person. Subhuman Faction Reputation: 2.</p>
<p>Few people know. Lory&#x27;s eyes were still teary, and her face was flushed as she asked shyly, Um. Master, what&#x27;s wrong? He then jumped for joy, grabbing her hand as if bursting with happiness, saying, Lory, you just awakened! Oh, oh, oh, that&#x27;s amazing! This left him completely dumbfounded. But she had no idea he was secretly smiling darkly, thinking, A healer! I, Sibin, finally have my own healer! Exclusive, top-tier, and knows how to warm the bed. Ha ha ha, who will dare say Eagle Crest City has no healing power now? Can&#x27;t this skill casually wipe out a whole group of priests? Early the next morning, a voice from a small clinic began to announce, Specializing in treating all incurable diseases.</p>
<p>Bruises, wounds from knives and guns, bites from poisonous insects. Fees start from just one copper coin. Saracen was still standing outside in a daze, doing exercises, silently scorning and judging the people around him, Insects are everywhere, disgusting. Saracen hates insects. Lory, on the other hand, was always friendly.</p>
<p>Welcome. Seeing this, some people around sighed, while others gossiped, The person who opened a healing shop is actually a subhuman girl. I heard this subhuman is the Lord&#x27;s new favorite. Ai, maybe she opened the shop just for fun. A beauty who seduces people.</p>
<p>I still miss old Parker&#x27;s shop more. Those words hit Sibin like a punch to the gut, but he just gave a faint smile and lamented, Hmm, just as I expected, the clinic&#x27;s opening is not going smoothly. He kept looking around and had to sigh in frustration. I originally wanted to open a clinic so Lory could be more confident and gradually change the attitude of the people in Eagle Crest City towards subhumans. But now it seems that people&#x27;s prejudice against subhumans is hard to change overnight.</p>
<p>Then, a kid walking by suddenly gave him an idea, and he exclaimed, Hmm. then he burst out, &quot;Got it, chubby kid, come over here.&quot; But the other adorable kid looked at him with sparkling eyes and asked, &quot;My Lord, did you call for me?&quot; White clouds drifted gently across the clear blue sky. The little boy pulled his mother to the front of Lory&#x27;s shop and called out, &quot;Doctor, can you check on my mom? She&#x27;s been coughing for several days.&quot; &quot;Sorry, this child suddenly dragged me here,&quot; his mother could only say with an embarrassed smile. &quot;Hey, isn&#x27;t that Chris&#x27;s chubby kid?&quot; Seeing this, she flashed a bright smile and replied, &quot;It&#x27;s alright, please come in,&quot; then thought happily, &quot;A patient has finally arrived.&quot; The people nearby couldn&#x27;t help but feel pity and sympathy, &quot;Oh, Aubry&#x27;s child is so pitiful, his father died in battle, and his mother is gravely ill. Everyone in the outer city knows about her lung disease, do you think she can be cured?&quot; &quot;What are you thinking? Even the priests couldn&#x27;t do anything, what can a subhuman girl do?&quot; While Lory was enthusiastically examining her, the people outside, already prejudiced against her, were clicking their tongues, thinking, &quot;Old Parker is gone, so Aubry&#x27;s mother is desperate for a doctor, huh.&quot; But a moment later, all three of them came out with cheerful faces, making everyone around them curious.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, they&#x27;re out already, that was fast? Does her complexion really look better?&quot; So they started to probe, &quot;Aubry, your mother is...&quot; The boy couldn&#x27;t contain his joy and jumped up and down happily, &quot;She&#x27;s cured, she&#x27;s cured! That beautiful sister is amazing. She just gently raised her hand, a white light covered my mom, and after that, Mom felt much better.&quot; The boy&#x27;s mother also smiled, touching her face shyly and said, &quot;It&#x27;s true, my lungs don&#x27;t hurt anymore, and I&#x27;m not coughing either.&quot; The women nearby were astonished and quickly asked, &quot;So she was really cured, that&#x27;s truly miraculous, but the treatment fee must be very expensive, right?&quot; The old man next to them, who was already prejudiced against the clinic, added, &quot;Just as I thought, exactly like those priests from the church before. Charging 100 gold coins again, this clinic is no different.&quot; Then, the adorable kid pointed at the advertisement sign, explaining on Lory&#x27;s behalf, &quot;The beautiful sister only took one copper coin from us, isn&#x27;t it written right there? Starting from one copper coin.&quot; This made the old man exclaim in surprise, &quot;Really? Only one copper coin? How is that possible?&quot; Aubry could only smile and confirm, &quot;It&#x27;s true.&quot; Meanwhile, the clueless Saracen only perceived everything around him with a single word: &quot;okay.&quot; After that, people started to clamor, &quot;By the gods above, I have to hurry home and tell my old man, this is too, too good, my daughter can be saved this time, I&#x27;ll bring her over for a diagnosis first and then we&#x27;ll see.&quot; Just like that, the surrounding townspeople no longer held any ill will towards Lory&#x27;s clinic as they did before. At this moment, a young woman suddenly walked up, holding a pen and paper, and said cheerfully, &quot;So this is Eagle Crest City? I&#x27;ve finally arrived. Look at that magic cannon island, hey, is this the clinic? Why are there so many people? Are they lining up for free eggs?&quot; At this time, the townspeople were competing to form a long line, hoping to be examined by her, while Sibin stood outside, carefully reminding everyone, &quot;Everyone, please line up in an orderly fashion, no pushing.</p>
<p>Everyone will have a chance to be treated, don&#x27;t rush.&quot; This girl with glasses stood outside the window, silently observing Lory&#x27;s every move and thought, &quot;So it&#x27;s opened by a subhuman. Shouldn&#x27;t the people here have a deep prejudice against subhumans? But this subhuman girl looks very familiar, very much like the subhuman maiden that the Lord of Eagle Crest rescued during his patrol.&quot; She glanced behind her and thought, &quot;Opening a clinic, is this to show that she&#x27;s safe here? But since a moment ago, someone across the street has been furtively looking in this direction. He saw that she was gradually gaining the goodwill and trust of the local people and curled his lips in satisfaction, thinking, &quot;Not a bad state of affairs, Lory. But what&#x27;s with the person peeking furtively from outside the window?&quot; Then, suddenly, the two of them stared at each other as if trying to identify the other&#x27;s identity. Then they exclaimed in surprise, &quot;Huh.&quot; First, a system panel appeared with his information.</p>
<p>Name: Sibin, Golden Lion. Identity: Lord of Eagle Crest, Count. Strength: Unknown. Skills: Unknown. Equipment: Unknown.</p>
<p>Reputation: Unknown. Threat Level: Nightmare. Recognizing the other&#x27;s identity, she quickly strode towards him and said in surprise, &quot;Lord of Eagle Crest, to think I&#x27;d meet you here.&quot; This made him chuckle inwardly, &quot;That&#x27;s my line.&quot; Next, the system displayed her information. Name: Yan Jian Mei. Identity: Player, Scenery Party.</p>
<p>Strength: Level 20. He unconsciously curled his lips and thought, &quot;Yan Jian Mei. To suddenly meet the big shot from the Scenery Party that I often saw in posts while playing the game in my past life. I didn&#x27;t expect her to come to this game world too. She&#x27;s already level 20, so other players are probably around this level too, with high-level ones probably around level 25.</p>
<p>This young woman walked up to him with a bright smile and greeted, &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m from Divine Light Town. I&#x27;m a traveler, exploring the unknown mystical lands and the people of this world.&quot; He also smiled politely in return, &quot;Hello there. So, big shot, you came all the way from Divine Light Town to Eagle Crest City just for sightseeing?&quot; Jian Mei smiled like a blossoming flower and replied shyly, &quot;That&#x27;s right, my Lord. Can I have your autograph?&quot; Seeing this, the smile on his lips widened as he thought, &quot;As expected of the Scenery Party, look at that sincere attitude towards beautiful things. Hmm, here you go.&quot; Then he readily agreed, &quot;No problem.&quot; As he signed, he thought gleefully, &quot;Has my charisma already permeated the ranks of the players? Seeing that the fish had taken the bait, she gradually revealed a cunning smile.</p>
<p>A strange aura suddenly appeared around Sibin, and his whole body was bound, causing him to choke and cough, &quot;Cough, cough, cough, what the hell is this?&quot; while Jian Mei just coldly interrogated, &quot;Lord of Eagle Crest.&quot; &quot;Speak! What exactly did you do to Saintess Roy that day?&quot; Sibin was still trying to negotiate, &quot;Hey, if there&#x27;s something to say, let&#x27;s talk properly. Roy, what happened to her? Why tie me up like this? Hey.&quot; Then she smiled smugly and probed, &quot;Feeling dizzy? These are, these are the Stun Spores I worked so hard to collect from the wasteland. Struggling is useless, hmph hmph hmph. Are you really concerned about the Saintess, or are you just being lewd?&quot; Hearing this, she suddenly remembered the uncomfortable and restless image of the Saintess at that time, who kept exclaiming, &quot;Ugh, my body is so hot, so cold.&quot; This made her unable to understand, and she questioned sternly, &quot;After you and the Saintess were in the room together, she fell ill the very next day, sometimes hot, sometimes cold. Now she&#x27;s getting weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>Add to that your hatred for subhumans, all the heroic spirits are pointing their spears at you. What else do you have to say?&quot; After hearing this ridiculous reason, he felt helpless and replied, &quot;Give me a break, I only gave her a kiss. Could it be that she got lovesick from seeing how handsome I am?&quot; Then he pondered thoughtfully, &quot;The Saintess in the game from my past life never had this issue. System, do you know what&#x27;s going on?&quot; It then dinged with an answer, &quot;Insufficient current information. Host, please investigate the abnormal location.&quot; Sibin felt like he was struck by lightning on a clear day, wondering in confusion, &quot;Could it be because the world line has changed, so no matter what I do? The players will eventually gather to crusade against Eagle Crest because of the Saintess&#x27;s death, so it&#x27;s an unavoidable fate.&quot; Meanwhile, Jian Mei became even more certain, pushing up her glasses and stating firmly, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen someone so thick-skinned and shameless.&quot; This made someone as afraid of death as him unable to sit still any longer, and he hurriedly thought, &quot;No, I have to do something.&quot; Then, he quickly snapped the ropes binding him, leaving her gaping in astonishment, stammering, &quot;You, you...</p>
<p>weren&#x27;t you stunned?&quot; Hearing this, he just gave a faint smile and replied, &quot;Ridiculous. With my strength, I can recover from these measly stun spores with just a sneeze.&quot; He also solemnly declared one last time to Yan Jian Mei, &quot;Whether you believe it or not, I didn&#x27;t do this, and I have no hatred for subhumans. But to find out the real reason Roy fell ill, I can go to Divine Light Town with you for a trip.&quot; This made her ask, both surprised and a little happy, &quot;Really?&quot; Hearing this, Sibin began to stroke his chin with a sly smile and affirmed, &quot;Really.&quot; Next, he picked up the rope that had just bound him and said cunningly, &quot;Really. But before we go, hehe...&quot; She saw his devilish smile and, full of vigilance, asked defensively, &quot;What do you want to do? Don&#x27;t come over here.&quot; Lory also hurried over and asked, &quot;Master, were you looking for me?&quot; He then patted her shoulder and said, &quot;The clinic is temporarily closed. Come with me on a trip.&quot; This left her a bit confused, but she still obediently replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; Seeing this scene, Jian Mei had to ponder, &quot;This is the subhuman maiden who opened the clinic.</p>
<p>Could it be that what the Lord of Eagle Crest said is all true, that he doesn&#x27;t have any hatred for subhumans? We misunderstood him.&quot; Although the young woman was still extremely resentful, while he was happily humming a tune, Lory remained confused, not understanding what was happening. Somewhere else, people were buzzing with discussion, &quot;Has the protagonist Ye Hao been found yet? Ever since Ye Hao said he was going to find a cure for the Saintess, he still hasn&#x27;t returned. The devil knows where he is now.&quot; They were even all furious as they cursed, &quot;Ma, it&#x27;s all the Lord of Eagle Crest&#x27;s fault, d-m-n it, we have to destroy him sooner or later.&quot; The more they talked, the more worked up they got, &quot;Not only destroy him, but we must also whip his corpse.&quot; Before he could even finish his sentence, Sibin suddenly appeared from behind him, carrying the bound Jian Mei down in his arms. To the astonishment of the surrounding people, he just said faintly, &quot;We&#x27;re here.&quot; Suddenly, he felt that something was wrong and exclaimed in surprise, &quot;Huh?&quot; Then he saw the system continuously report a series of information: &quot;Ding! Abnormal location detected. Ding! Ding! Bzzzt, bzzzt, analyzing abnormal location.</p>
<p>Ding! Detected... detected abnormality with Child of Destiny Ye Hao. The fate line has been severed. The... world line cannot...</p>
<p>bzzzt bzzzt... cannot be restored. Ding! Abnormality detected with Subhuman Saintess Roy. Analyzing rescue measures. Ding! No rescue method currently available.</p>
<p>Forcibly initiating the third stage of the plot. Kidnap the Subhuman Saintess. Saintess Roy&#x27;s life has two hours remaining. Bzzzt bzzzt. Host, please execute immediately.</p>
<p>Host, please execute immediately.&quot; He looked at the system panel and couldn&#x27;t help but curse inwardly, &quot;Is the system crazy, spitting out so much information?&quot; At this moment, the subhuman people looked at him as if he were their mortal enemy. They even furiously discussed, &quot;It&#x27;s the Lord of Eagle Crest! Brothers, everyone, take the Lord of Eagle Crest&#x27;s life to avenge our lord!&quot; Sibin was dazed, listless, contemplating life. Only two hours of life left. There&#x27;s no time. Right now, I don&#x27;t know anything about Roy&#x27;s problem, but according to the system&#x27;s hint, it&#x27;s definitely closely related to Ye Hao.</p>
<p>He suddenly thought of a good idea. The only way now is to quickly bring Roy to Eagle Crest City and have Lory see if she can cure her. No sooner said than done, Sibin quickly drew the treasured sword from his back, intending to handle the trouble before him single-handedly. The guards swarmed forward, flailing their limbs as they rushed to attack Sibin. This bunch of small fry knew everything except who Sibin was.</p>
<p>Sibin casually swung his sword twice, creating an X-shaped stream of spiritual energy that directly cut the group of people in two. He shouted loudly, &quot;Get out of the way!&quot; Sibin walked step by step into the castle to find someone. Our hero had to go through 7749 tribulations just to find his beloved&#x27;s room. Sibin kicked the door open and stormed in; he was dead tired. He was fuming, smoke practically coming out of his ears.</p>
<p>The maid, who had just finished wiping Roy&#x27;s body and was about to leave, heard the forceful sound of the door being kicked open. The girl was startled and looked over, &quot;Who are you?&quot; He walked in silently. Sibin didn&#x27;t have time to answer the girl&#x27;s question; he rushed to Roy&#x27;s bedside. Roy lay there, breathing with great difficulty. Her pale face made him feel a pang of heartache as he asked, &quot;How did you end up like this?&quot; &quot;Alright, let&#x27;s go.&quot; Sibin casually took the towel from the maid&#x27;s hand and wrapped it a few times around Roy&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>He lifted her up. Sibin held Roy with one arm, letting her lean against him, while with his other hand, he drew his treasured sword and raised it, unleashing his divine power to shatter a corner of the castle. The maid almost fainted at the sight before her. From the sky, a beast, half-bird half-animal, landed on the castle. Sibin quickly placed Roy and his disciple on its back and left immediately.</p>
<p>He was worried to death about Roy&#x27;s condition. That beast flew away from the castle, flapping its wings and gliding gently through the air. It flew over towns, and the crowds below immediately rushed out, pointing and cursing Sibin terribly, &quot;Lord Eagle Crest has kidnapped the Saintess!&quot; &quot;That motherfcker Lord Eagle Crest, he actually broke through to Sky Knight. Sooner or later, someone will destroy you.&quot; Who&#x27;s messing with you? Why are you so worked up? Scene change to Lan Dong City, Sibin immediately took Roy to the treatment room. She lay on the bed, her body writhing in pain.</p>
<p>Roy had a constant high fever. &quot;Don&#x27;t,&quot; the girl whimpered, continuously having nightmares. Sibin watched her with worry and pity. Lory noticed this. The young girl stepped forward, channeling her power to suppress the spiritual energy and heal Roy.</p>
<p>Over an hour passed, and Lory was also exhausted, her energy gradually depleting. Roy, on the bed, still showed little improvement. It was truly worrying. Suddenly, Lory could no longer stand steady. She collapsed onto the cold tile floor, her body unable to hold up any longer.</p>
<p>Sibin ran to catch the young girl, asking worriedly, &quot;Lory, are you alright?&quot; Looking at Lory&#x27;s haggard face, Sibin couldn&#x27;t bear to let the young girl continue staying here. Lory leaned against him and confessed, &quot;Master, Lory has no way to completely eliminate this power, I can only temporarily suppress it.&quot; The young girl sobbed. Sibin knew he had to comfort her. He patted her shoulder and smiled gently, &quot;This isn&#x27;t your fault. You&#x27;ve been using your powers non-stop for a day.</p>
<p>This morning, you even treated so many of the fief&#x27;s people. Lory, you&#x27;ve already done very well.&quot; &quot;No, it&#x27;s not.&quot; Lory didn&#x27;t think so. The young girl cried harder, burying her head in Sibin&#x27;s chest and sobbing. &quot;Her situation is very complicated. Lory can feel a stream of evil power invading her body.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a kind of mark that cannot be dispelled; it has burrowed deep into her soul. The reason she can&#x27;t wake up now is because this evil mark has dragged her into a nightmare. If we want to truly remove this mark, it depends on whether she herself wants to overcome it.&quot; &quot;Is that really so?&quot; Sibin looked at Roy in silence. But there was something Sibin was quite curious about. He was full of questions as he continuously patted the little kid&#x27;s head, &quot;Why is Lory suddenly so enthusiastic?&quot; Roy whimpered in fear again.</p>
<p>How pitiful she is. Sibin had been sitting by her bed for a long time, constantly encouraging himself to think of a way to help Roy escape death. &quot;Although there&#x27;s no way to directly save Roy&#x27;s life, perhaps I can help her a little in her nightmare.&quot; In Roy&#x27;s nightmare, the past and present appeared before her eyes one after another. Roy shed tears of blood in agony as countless demons appeared around her. They continuously pointed and criticized Roy, &quot;Roy, you are a Saintess, you must serve Her Highness the Goddess properly.&quot; &quot;Roy, go memorize the scriptures.&quot; &quot;Roy, why couldn&#x27;t you awaken this time?&quot; &quot;Roy, I brought you out of the orphanage hoping you could become an outstanding Saintess.</p>
<p>Roy, you must not disappoint my expectations.&quot; &quot;Roy, the subhuman nation&#x27;s revenge. Roy, protect the subhumans, Roy.&quot; Is anyone going to save her? In another dream, Roy was escorted by them to a prison. She was bound tightly by hundreds of interwoven chains. They dug into her flesh and bones one by one, and the blaming voices of the ghouls rang out again. Roy cried and begged, &quot;Stop talking, please stop talking.&quot; Her tears had run dry.</p>
<p>Suddenly, by some miraculous power, the massive chain was severed. Roy fell freely and frantically. She passed into another dream. Roy fell into a deep, bottomless body of water. She just kept sinking, with no strength left to resist.</p>
<p>The feeling of being submerged in the cold water was so peaceful. Roy closed her eyes and let go of everything. She really wanted to just sink like this, just like this. Damn it! Countless arms rose from beneath the water. As if by some demonic force, they frantically grabbed Roy&#x27;s body, pulling her down quickly.</p>
<p>The demons wouldn&#x27;t let her go. Roy&#x27;s eyes flew open. She raised her hand high, &quot;Don&#x27;t.&quot; She tried to struggle free from the hundreds of arms. Dear Roy looked up at the ray of light on the sea&#x27;s surface. She hoped that on the surface of the sea, someone would be willing to receive her.</p>
<p>The moment she was about to give up, a boy&#x27;s arm directly and forcefully grabbed Roy&#x27;s hand. Roy felt a ray of warmth transmitting from that hand. Someone had come to save her. Roy&#x27;s eyes widened in surprise. Sibin had found Roy in the nightmare.</p>
<p>He held Roy&#x27;s hand tightly and gently pulled her from the deadly water. The two looked at each other, full of longing. The beast just circled in the air a few times. Roy couldn&#x27;t believe her eyes. She asked herself, &quot;Lord Eagle Crest?&quot; There was no mistaking it, it was that damn Sibin, the most detestable person in her thoughts.</p>
<p>Roy struggled with all her might. Roy was shy, &quot;Why are you here?&quot; Sibin cheerfully teased her, &quot;This young master, of course, came to snatch a corpse.&quot; Roy, however, was very stubborn. She kept struggling. Unbelievably, the mean Sibin dared to let go of her with both hands. Roy tumbled onto the beast&#x27;s back.</p>
<p>&quot;You villain, you&#x27;ve hurt this girl to death.&quot; Roy struggled to sit up. Sibin felt a little guilty. He knew his joke had gone a bit too far. Sibin moved to help Roy up. Who would have thought? She directly gave him a punch to the cheek that hurt like hell.</p>
<p>She looks so weak, yet if she&#x27;s not kicking wildly, she&#x27;s using her fists. Sibin was damn addicted to it. &quot;Nice, this young master likes this wild type.&quot; Roy screamed and threw a tantrum, &quot;You, let me down now!&quot; Sibin was afraid that if she struggled a little more, she would fall flat on her face and die. He ordered his little pet to land in a deserted villa area. Without waiting for the beast to land, Roy quickly jumped down like a flying motorcycle.</p>
<p>The kid is really something else. Roy jumped down too fast and twisted her ankle. The pain shot up to her brain; it hurt so much it reached her navel. Roy grimaced and stood there without moving. Sibin just managed to pull her into his arms, afraid the kid would fall.</p>
<p>He gave her a roguish smile, &quot;Hey, hey, this is a dreamscape. How can it hurt? You&#x27;re not really pretending, are you?&quot; Roy looked at him, then down at her own feet. The pain was gone. It seemed it really didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Could it be she was hallucinating? Roy forcefully pushed Sibin away from her.</p>
<p>This guy, in general, couldn&#x27;t be trusted. &quot;What do you mean by what you said? Is this really a dreamscape?&quot; Sibin put on a serious expression and nodded, &quot;That&#x27;s right, this is your nightmare. If I hadn&#x27;t expended a Hypnosis Scroll to connect to your consciousness and rush here to save you, you would have been long gone before sunset.&quot; &quot;You detestable guy.&quot; Roy turned her face away, pouted, and said, &quot;Dreaming of you is the real nightmare.&quot; But she was a little curious. Roy avoided Sibin&#x27;s gaze. She fidgeted shyly, &quot;But why did you save me?&quot; Sibin pretended to think.</p>
<p>He sighed, &quot;There&#x27;s no why. I was afraid that if you died, people would say you died of lovesickness from missing me too much. They&#x27;d put all the blame on my head, then I&#x27;d be so wronged, wouldn&#x27;t I?&quot; Sibin lightly stroked his V-line chin, full of self-admiration. &quot;After all, I&#x27;m this handsome, it&#x27;s quite convincing, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; Roy bristled with anger. &quot;Who said I was infatuated with him? You&#x27;re truly shameless.&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s drop it.&quot; Sibin grabbed Roy&#x27;s hand and ran quickly in one direction within the mansion grounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, let&#x27;s go quickly. We have to find the exit now, or we&#x27;ll really be trapped here until we die.&quot; The two ran into a gate. Roy&#x27;s cheeks flushed slightly, her heart pounded erratically as she looked down. That Sibin guy was holding her hand. They continued to pass through.</p>
<p>The countless classical architectural styles of these buildings were truly eye-catching. Roy struggled again, &quot;Hey, let go of my hand.&quot; &quot;Found it.&quot; Sibin quickly led her by the hand to the place he mentioned. Sibin looked at the architecture with interest. &quot;This place looks a lot like a cathedral. It seems the most frightening thing in your heart is this place.</p>
<p>I think the exit must be inside.&quot; A cathedral? Just hearing about it, a series of unpleasant memories surfaced in Roy&#x27;s mind. The Roy in the memories was so weak. &quot;Don&#x27;t, please don&#x27;t.&quot; The girl cried miserably; she begged, she tried to run, but in the end, there was only one outcome. Roy looked at the cathedral, trembling. She clung to Sibin&#x27;s hand and begged, &quot;I...</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not going.&quot; Sibin was surprised to feel Roy&#x27;s fear; she was trembling. &quot;Is that so? The thing that scares you this much, this is it. The direction is definitely right, let&#x27;s go. You have to go even if you don&#x27;t want to. Behave for me.&quot; Sibin abruptly threw Roy over his shoulder.</p>
<p>He ran quickly into the cathedral. Roy pounded on his back, &quot;Ah, you demon!&quot; Standing majestically in the middle of the hall was a large statue. Roy and Sibin curiously ran over to take a look. &quot;What is this?&quot; This statue, isn&#x27;t it Roy? She wondered, &quot;Why is there a statue of the Saintess here?&quot; &quot;The predecessor? Clearly, the one placed in the temple should be the wild goddess Malon.&quot; Sibin didn&#x27;t pay much attention to what Roy said. He turned in all directions, observing everything.</p>
<p>Then he unconsciously asked again, &quot;Oh, so this is the predecessor.&quot; He clicked his tongue in disdain, &quot;The quality of the subhuman Saintesses is really going downhill.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; Roy shot him a look full of love. &quot;Hey, what&#x27;s with that look of yours?&quot; Sibin said nothing more. He grabbed her by the collar and dragged her away, &quot;Let&#x27;s go, let&#x27;s find the exit.&quot; Roy was fuming, letting that Sibin guy drag her away. But that statue, she couldn&#x27;t take her eyes off it. There was really something wrong with it.</p>
<p>Just as Roy and Sibin disappeared from view, the statue&#x27;s eyes turned blood-red, looking very frightening. Deep within those eyes was an indecipherable skull. Along the cathedral&#x27;s corridor, Roy and Sibin headed towards a room at the end of the hall. They walked quickly to investigate. Sibin curiously threw the door to that room wide open.</p>
<p>It was a classroom. A woman was standing at the podium, writing something for her students sitting below. How strange, what kind of class is as silent as a graveyard? It&#x27;s spooky. Roy walked over to look inside. She asked Sibin in surprise, &quot;Why is the classroom from my childhood orphanage here?&quot; He, of course, knew very well.</p>
<p>&quot;This is your nightmare. It&#x27;s normal for places in a dream and the real world to be different.&quot; Lady Malia stood with her back to the board. She wasn&#x27;t writing anything; in fact, she was using her hand to scratch furiously at the board. Countless scratch marks were clearly visible. Sibin didn&#x27;t pay much mind.</p>
<p>He took her hand and said, &quot;The door is in there, let&#x27;s go.&quot; Roy didn&#x27;t think so. She held his hand back, &quot;Wait a minute, there&#x27;s something wrong with that person in the mirror.&quot; Roy could see that she was being controlled by someone. There was a very special symbol on her neck. Lady Malia turned around angrily. She grabbed the rattan cane in her hand and swung it forward a few times.</p>
<p>Annoyed by the noise, she said, Roy, you disobedient child, get back to your seat quickly. Roy, out of habit, immediately trembled in fear. As if hypnotized, she walked quickly to the study desk, Yes, Lady Malia. Sibin, frantic with fear, called her name, Roy, where are you going? Don&#x27;t wander off, come to me. Suddenly, that Lady Malia angrily rushed over as if she wanted to eat them alive.</p>
<p>She complained, Disobedient children want a beating, don&#x27;t they? Sibin&#x27;s eyes widened in fear. Malia swung the cane with great force into the space between where Roy and Sibin were standing. Damn, that&#x27;s vicious. Is this the kind of force you use to hit a child? Sibin angrily gave her a kick to the stomach. After being kicked, Malia immediately staggered back a distance and knelt down in pain.</p>
<p>A long while later, that Malia once again walked quickly to the center of the classroom. As if it were a joke, she waved her cane and signaled, It&#x27;s time for music class. Let me hear your singing. All the kids in the class stood up. They scratched the desks hard with both hands, leaving rather deep marks.</p>
<p>Each child then began to wail like the moans of ghouls from hell. That sound was truly harmful to a listener&#x27;s ears. Sibin covered his ears tightly in frustration, This sound is so unbearable. If you can&#x27;t win a fight, you resort to mental pollution? Roy realized something was not right here. She looked at each of the fierce-faced children.</p>
<p>Roy lightly touched her heart. This is my childhood orphanage. These controlled children and the hot-tempered Pastor Malia are all from my childhood memories. Roy let out a helpless sigh. Dozens of children surrounded the pastor.</p>
<p>Malia stood imposingly in the center, full of anger. She looked around again, interrogating, Who took my glasses? Hand them over now. If I have to find you, you&#x27;ll get 50 lashes. A mischievous little boy was holding the pastor&#x27;s glasses. He giggled and carefully hid them behind his back.</p>
<p>Malia followed the sound of the laughter and looked over. She smirked and looked in the boy&#x27;s direction, So you&#x27;re over there. Sibin was about to go and save the boy. Roy quickly stopped him. Roy signaled for him to be quiet, She can&#x27;t see.</p>
<p>Sibin looked at Roy, puzzled, She can&#x27;t see? How do you know? Roy turned to face him and whispered, This is my orphanage. She was the pastor who managed us children back then, Malia. Roy looked towards the pastor, her eyes a little sad. In my memory, Malia&#x27;s eyesight wasn&#x27;t very good. But her hearing was extremely sharp.</p>
<p>She could sniff everything out by sound. As soon as she finished speaking, Malia rushed from out of nowhere to attack them. The force she unleashed was immense. A single punch could shatter a large section of the wall. Sibin grabbed Roy and flew up to dodge.</p>
<p>He couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim, So that&#x27;s how it is. He took a coin from his pocket. He now understood why Roy was so aggressive. Violent education, no wonder it produced a saintess who likes to get physical and hit people. Malia stood still, observing them.</p>
<p>Although she couldn&#x27;t see, her sense of hearing was excellent. There&#x27;s definitely someone in front. Sibin secretly tossed the coin he had prepared onto the floor, letting it roll into a corner. Just as Roy had said, the pastor immediately ran in the direction where the coin had fallen. She mercilessly swung her stick, beating each child.</p>
<p>Who&#x27;s being disobedient? Sibin seized this opportunity, immediately grabbing Roy and running for their lives. Right now, let&#x27;s go. The two of them quickly entered the door. Sibin held Roy, floating in mid-air. That door connected to another space.</p>
<p>Something wasn&#x27;t right. They looked up to see a super giant puppet falling down. That dimension opened up, and the puppet, along with Sibin and Roy, was pushed out. Roy landed on top of him in pain. Have they been transported to another castle? Sibin, with one hand squeezing Roy&#x27;s bosom, complained.</p>
<p>That hurts like hell! What is this thing? A puppet? Roy shyly looked down at his mischievous hand. Hey, you pervert, move your right hand now. What do you think you&#x27;re doing? Sibin immediately switched hands, looking at her suggestively. Oh, you prefer this side? You despicable Sibin. Roy, blushing furiously, slapped him.</p>
<p>Get up. No more joking. Sibin sat up and looked around in a daze. Alright, where is this room? Roy placed her hands over her chest and shook her head. This place looked so familiar, but she couldn&#x27;t remember.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Roy said excitedly, It&#x27;s my room at the Divine Light Town Garrison Manor. Sibin realized, It seems the rooms in this nightmare are all formed from the most terrifying places in her memory, created from her most painful recollections. We have to find the next door to get out. Roy looked behind him, pointing at the shadow on the wall. Lord Eagle Crest, behind you.</p>
<p>The super giant shadow gradually loomed over them. Roy sat down in fear. This giant puppet wasn&#x27;t originally in the room. Sibin looked up at the puppet, Your terrible memories are truly numerous. This is...</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Sibin froze for 5 seconds. He and that puppet looked exactly alike, didn&#x27;t they? Whoa, whoa, what the hell is this? The two of them just stood there staring at it speechlessly. Sibin turned to look at Roy. Knowing her guilt, she feigned ignorance and looked away.</p>
<p>Sibin picked up his replica and held it in front of Roy to interrogate her. He said cheerfully, very cheerfully, It&#x27;s fine, no problem at all. My lady Saintess, don&#x27;t you think this puppet looks a lot like someone who is risking his life to save you? And this is your terrifying nightmare? Roy hugged it, unable to deny it. Isn&#x27;t it very cute? Alright, she walked over to the mirror. Roy bent down, her hand pointing to a door on the floor.</p>
<p>Look, the door is to your south. Since you were just lying there, why don&#x27;t we just go? Sibin tossed the damn puppet aside, looked at the opening door, and happily stepped inside. This tunnel is so dark. Sibin complained to Roy as they walked. He felt a little dead inside, finding it unacceptable.</p>
<p>Not only was it a huge doll with no attack power, but it also helped you open the door. In the end, what kind of image do you have of me in your heart? Roy didn&#x27;t know how to explain, so she swallowed her grievances and followed him. Isn&#x27;t it great that there&#x27;s no conflict? Why is this place so dark? Suddenly, a beam of light from a door at the end of the hallway attracted them. Sibin happily took Roy&#x27;s hand and moved forward. There&#x27;s light, that must be the exit from the nightmare.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s get out of here quickly. Sibin felt a sense of unease wash over him. He observed silently; there were footsteps of someone approaching. Roy looked at Sibin, a little puzzled. Why did you stop? Sibin signaled for Roy to be quiet, Do you hear a strange sound? It was Saintess Bero, approaching with a leather whip in her hand.</p>
<p>Bero walked over, raised the whip she had prepared, and brought it down again and again on the Roy from the memory. Bero angrily ordered her subordinates. Why haven&#x27;t you memorized the scripture yet? Someone, lock the Saintess in the repentance cell for me. The young girl under Bero could only sit there, crying and begging, I&#x27;m sorry. Roy was thrown into a dark prison.</p>
<p>She knelt and begged her. Bero, I&#x27;ll memorize it, please let me out, it&#x27;s too dark in here. Roy now realized where she and Sibin were standing. Bero, this is the prison cell. Bero was really standing before Roy and Sibin.</p>
<p>She stood there coldly, holding a weapon. Upon meeting her, Sibin was struck by love at first sight for this woman. His eyes filled with love as he rejoiced internally. Oho, she&#x27;s the real former Saintess, even more of a doppelgänger than the other one. Sibin happily walked forward to greet her.</p>
<p>Hello, beautiful big sister. Before he could say more than a few words, Bero immediately attacked. Sibin vomited a mouthful of blood, looking at her in surprise. A chain had pierced through Sibin&#x27;s chest, holding him tightly in mid-air. Good thing this is a dream, Sibin thought excitedly, So enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Sibin looked at the chain piercing through his body. His divine power was being consumed considerably. So fast. The feeling surpassed the strength of a Sky Knight. Roy looked up at him worriedly from below, trying to shout to Sibin.</p>
<p>Lord Eagle Crest, are you okay? Although Sibin was in some pain, he still tried to act fine to reassure her. I&#x27;m fine. He realized, Getting hit in the dreamscape weakens the scroll&#x27;s power. If I&#x27;m attacked by this kind of power again, I&#x27;m afraid the scroll&#x27;s power will completely vanish. But what can I do if I can&#x27;t fight back? Sibin suddenly thought of Roy.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right, this is a dreamscape. All power must originate from the master of the dreamscape. Sibin struggled to hold on against the chain. His spiritual power was draining rapidly. If he delayed any longer, he was afraid...</p>
<p>He ordered Roy. Roy, quick, imagine me as the most powerful character you can think of in your nightmare. Roy looked at him, a little surprised. The most powerful character? Roy recalled the moment she was locked in the prison, hugging a stuffed rabbit. So dark, so dark...</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want to be locked in here. It was that cute little pink bunny. Roy called out, Mr. Rabbit! Sibin instantly transformed into a muscular, masculine pink rabbit. He gently flicked the chain away.</p>
<p>Sibin was completely clueless about what was happening. What is this situation? Why did I turn into a rabbit? Whatever, this will do. He quickly rushed towards Bero. A person and a rabbit kept punching each other. The spiritual power radiating from them oppressed a corner of the room, truly making it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>And of course, with the power of the original owner, Roy, Bero was completely defeated. She gradually dissolved, revealing part of her body to be a hideous ghoul. It angrily pointed at Sibin and cursed. The demon king was fully revealed. It screamed in pain within the deep blue spiritual power.</p>
<p>The giant demon vanished into the void. Roy ran to the pink rabbit Sibin, looking at him and sobbing. Lord Eagle Crest, your body is fading away. Sibin looked at his own fading illusion. He sadly instructed Roy, The scroll&#x27;s power is gone.</p>
<p>Next, you have to rely on yourself to get out. He reminded her worriedly, Hey, subhuman Saintess, you&#x27;d better not disappoint me. Roy nodded in agreement, happily watching him disappear. Goodbye, Sibin. I will definitely get out.</p>
<p>Back in the Abyss of Can, the demon territory, countless bolts of lightning and fire converged in one place, with each bolt striking down fiercely. Ye Hao jumped out from the lightning, collapsed in pain, and vomited blood. That Ye Hao screamed madly, I was just defeated? How could I fail? A voice echoed from the earth, You have disappointed me greatly, Ye Hao. Ye Hao said nothing more, sitting still and panting heavily from exhaustion. The man in the black cloak slowly approached and reprimanded him.</p>
<p>You were actually seduced by the Abyss of Can for temporary power. Ye Hao looked at him angrily and shouted. Isn&#x27;t it because you didn&#x27;t give me more power? He cried miserably. That prophecy skill is fucking useless. What could I do? Just stand by and watch my woman be snatched away by that hateful lord? The man in the black cloak was truly furious, his voice growling as if he wanted to eat Ye Hao alive.</p>
<p>You waste, just a mere vessel. Yet you failed so miserably, I told you long ago that I am using all my strength to prevent the counterattack of this world&#x27;s will. To create an opportunity for my citizens to invade this world, I don&#x27;t have much time to pay attention to you. You just needed to lead my people well, and even if you encountered that variable, you could still stand in an undefeatable position, but what have you done? We could have relied on our people to slowly grind away the vessel&#x27;s divinity. Then take over her body, but you secretly traded her divinity with the Abyss.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s even more ridiculous is that you could even sell the proof, your foolish actions have ruined my plan. He looked at the half-man, half-demon Ye Hao and gave him one last chance, if you continue to be so obstinately blind, don&#x27;t blame me for using your body as the new vessel. The man in the black cloak ordered, there&#x27;s no more time, the second descent is about to begin. Chapter 56, returning to the real world. Lory looked worriedly at Roy and Sibin lying on the bed.</p>
<p>The little girl had been standing guard here all night. Lory dragged her tired body and sobbed helplessly. When will Master wake up? A whole night has passed. Sibin lay motionless. Roy turned over and hugged him, sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>Time passed just like that. Lory anxiously paced back and forth a few times, her eyes red. At this rate, will there be any danger? That&#x27;s right. Lory recalled what Chris had taught her. I absolutely cannot let my teacher down.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got it. Appropriate physical contact and dressing up can make a person feel safe. That&#x27;s what Miss Chris taught me. Lory naively believed these words, she ran straight to her small wardrobe, rummaging through it to find a few of her favorite outfits. Lory looked at the pile of clothes in her hands.</p>
<p>Does Master prefer black lace or white lace? The noise from the little girl somewhat helped wake Sibin up. He propped himself up, groaning lightly in exhaustion. Suddenly, a fierce clap of thunder came from outside, lighting up a large patch of the sky. Lory was startled and looked out the window. Wow, is it about to rain? It&#x27;s raining.</p>
<p>Sibin opened his eyes wide, staring at the ceiling. He couldn&#x27;t move his arms or legs. Sibin was a bit dazed. What is this. What the hell are these shorts? Sibin glanced over.</p>
<p>Lory, in a seductive nurse outfit, was walking step by step towards him. In her hand, she was even holding a syringe. Is she going to give me a shot? Sibin was wide awake. Lory reached out to touch him. Sibin reflexively grabbed her hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had frightened her. Sibin sat bolt upright, his hand pulling her closer. The close contact between them made Lory blush uncontrollably. Master, you&#x27;re awake. Sibin looked at her.</p>
<p>Lory, why are you dressed like this? Do you even have to ask? Of course, it&#x27;s to help Master wake up faster. That Miss Chris is so effective. Lory was visibly happy. Damn it. Sibin glanced outside, unable to help feeling bitter.</p>
<p>The culprit is you again, that woman Chris. Goodbye happened to hear that the master was awake, he ran in and happily joined the group. He gave a thumbs-up. Goodbye winked at Sibin. Master, do you like it? Sibin looked her over, stroking his chin as he slowly thought.</p>
<p>For a great man like me, having one or two perverted hobbies is nothing strange. Of course I like it, but remember to only wear it when it&#x27;s just the two of us. As for Roy, although she hasn&#x27;t woken up yet, her life probably isn&#x27;t in danger for the time being. Sibin stretched, exhausted, and yawned a few times. Lory, we don&#x27;t need to keep watch anymore, let&#x27;s go to sleep, hmm.</p>
<p>Lory nodded obediently and leaned into Sibin&#x27;s arms, looking at him coquettishly. Master, the thunder outside was so loud just now, Lory was scared. Master said before that after Lory awakens, we would have a baby, right? WTF. Sibin&#x27;s face turned green. Who would promise a child that? No wonder Lory has been so enthusiastic lately, so this is the reason.</p>
<p>Somebody save me. Sibin stammered. Uh, Lory, you go to sleep first, it&#x27;s so late, you have to go to the clinic tomorrow, right? As for now. Sibin grabbed his pants and ran first. He shot out like a motorcycle.</p>
<p>Lory watched his retreating back, her face turning purple with anger. Master, you clearly, you&#x27;re like that. Sibin ran out of the room and locked the door tight. Although he felt guilty towards her, I&#x27;m sorry, it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t want to, Lory, this is all for your own good. Ding.</p>
<p>System notification. Host has kidnapped the Saintess, received 20,000 villain points. Ding. The system screen flashed continuously. For unknown reasons, Glow Beta 2 of the Can Continent has been detected to have opened ahead of schedule, repair failed.</p>
<p>Ding. System is updating. System update complete. Villain Store has added new barracks, host please check. The system earnestly begged Sibin.</p>
<p>Host, please check immediately. Ding. Check immediately. Ding. Quick, look, look.</p>
<p>Sibin looked at the screen worriedly. Why is it moving again? He tapped the system repeatedly. This isn&#x27;t right, the system updated again. The players have already arrived for Glow Beta 2, so fast. Reason told Sibin that something was wrong, in his memory, the number of players in the second part was 10,000, if they were to attack his Lan Dong City.</p>
<p>Although he could escape, the city would be gone, so what kind of lord would he be, the lord of hell would be gone. Sibin stood defiantly outside the room in just his ass-baring shorts. He repeatedly tapped the crappy system, but this system had been getting more and more urgent since last time. So the system actually has emotions? It&#x27;s not the reincarnated damned lord from the game in my past life, is it? System, can you normally see everything I do? see? No matter how hoarsely Sibin asked, the system remained dead silent. Sibin waited until he was blue in the face, urging.</p>
<p>System, I know you&#x27;re there, don&#x27;t play dead. Ding. The system cannot share vision with the host, it can use energy to perform an analysis of the environment around the host. The host can rest assured, your privacy is placed at the highest position within the system&#x27;s authority. Aha.</p>
<p>Sibin laughed sinisterly. He pointed at the system again. Ah, so that&#x27;s how it is. He cursed inwardly. Stupid system, idiotic system, the system is a forever-alone loser.</p>
<p>So it turns out that when I was cursing the system in my head and planning to exploit its loopholes, it wasn&#x27;t that the system was playing dead, but that it simply didn&#x27;t know. Other people&#x27;s systems are all masterminds, specializing in dominating the host, seizing power, and even usurping the throne. The more Sibin thought, the angrier he got. Other people&#x27;s bosses and my boss, my boss is like a piece of shit. My system is like an imbecile forced to sell its life, the key is that it has to work like a dog and has no power at all.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see what the new function of this works-like-a-dog system is like. He pressed to start the upgrade. Current authority only allows unlocking level one troop buildings. Guard Camp, can recruit troops, Crusader, Divine Archer, requires 20,000 villain points to exchange. Beast Pen, can recruit troops, Beastman Infantry, Beastman Spearman, requires 20,000 villain points to exchange.</p>
<p>Shadow Guild, can recruit troops, Shadow Assassin, Shadow Crossbowman, requires 25,000 villain points to exchange. Lava Pit, can recruit troops, Gargoyle, Fire Elemental, requires 20,000 villain points to exchange. Graveyard, can recruit troops, Skeleton Soldier, Skeleton Archer, requires 15,000 villain points to exchange. Lost Forest, can recruit troops, Treant, Black Panther, requires 15,000 villain points to exchange. Sibin looked it over for the first time, he found it very strange.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? I can understand the Crusader and Divine Archer up front, but what are the ones after? Scene change to the real world. Long Pham was leisurely eating with his mother. He deliciously put piece after piece of food into his mouth. A notification suddenly appeared on his phone. Glow Beta 2 of the Can Continent is about to begin.</p>
<p>Really? Sibin excitedly picked up the phone. Alright. He flew out of the dining room like a motorcycle. He only managed to say a few words to his mother before disappearing. Mom, you go ahead and eat, I&#x27;m not eating anymore.</p>
<p>Has the weather turned strange today? His mother sat there, unable to help but worry. This kid, are you a cat, eating so little. Long Pham ran back to his room and shut the door tightly. He once again lay in the time machine to enter the game. The system immediately received the signal and chimed.</p>
<p>Welcome back, player Lam Pham. Ding dong. The game Can Continent is starting, new version detected. Can Continent version 2.0 update complete, logging in with 10 identities. Welcome to the Can Continent, wish you a happy gaming experience.</p>
<p>happy gaming experience. Long Pham opened his eyes wide and looked at the screen. Only now did he realize, this is a new expansion pack. Over here, at Lan Dong Fortress, Roy lay on the bed, writhing and groaning in pain. Without Sibin accompanying her, she was still immersed in that nightmare.</p>
<p>Once again, Roy remembered everything. The image of Roy first meeting Sibin. He coldly killed countless people, the legendary cruel lord. That&#x27;s why in the arena, she was so scared that she lay still on his shoulder, letting him carry her away at will. Suddenly, another memory pierced through Roy&#x27;s brain.</p>
<p>In the distance, the image of Ye Hao. He cried his heart out for her, begging Sibin to release her. How different. How could they be so heartless to me. Long Pham sensed Roy&#x27;s existence.</p>
<p>He made up his mind. Can, Roy, don&#x27;t die, we&#x27;re coming. Can Continent starting. Scene change. Ye Hao gathered all the powerful heroes from all over.</p>
<p>He stood on a high place, and declared in a loud, clear voice. I am very happy to see so many heroic spirits here today, you are all the hope of Guang Town. Seeing that everyone is in high spirits today, I won&#x27;t say much more, I&#x27;m sure everyone already knows the purpose for which we established the Purifier Guild. Ye Hao drew his sword, raised it, and shouted. That is to kill Lord Eagle Crest and rescue Saintess Roy.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. The crowd below was almost brainwashed by him. They enthusiastically supported this idea. The whole group shouted with great spirit. Kill Lord Eagle Crest, rescue Saintess Roy.</p>
<p>Ye Hao unleashed his spiritual power and flew straight into the air. His divine power surged, shining so brightly it was blinding. His cultivation had risen by a level. Ye Hao led the crowd. He screamed.</p>
<p>His eyes now seemed to have surrendered his soul to the devil. This is merely the darkness before the dawn, meaning good will ultimately triumph over evil. The crowd below looked at him, drooling. With this power that everyone coveted, Ye Hao was truly the idol in their hearts. Holy crap, level 53.</p>
<p>The protagonist is so damn cool. He&#x27;s a Sky Knight, hacking is the most dangerous. We all misunderstood Brother Hao. Brother Hao truly lives up to his name. Saintess is saved.</p>
<p>Saintess, can you see? You have to hold on tight. Brother Hao is rising up. Brother Hao, lead us to kill the lord and get his loot. I&#x27;m the best. Ye Hao was smug about being worshipped like this.</p>
<p>He continued to boast loudly. Lord Eagle Crest, I will definitely expose your evil face for all to see. Returning to Lan Dong City, what scheme is Sibin up to now. He slowly approached, filled with a murderous aura. If that&#x27;s the case, I won&#x27;t pretend anymore.</p>
<p>Sibin pushed the small Lory down onto the bed. He directly tore her maid outfit to shreds with one hand. So perverted. We&#x27;re not 18 yet. Author, please have some self-respect.</p>
<p>Sibin looked at her with a covetous gaze. Lory fearfully covered her chest. She cried and screamed. Lory doesn&#x27;t want to be a bed warmer anymore. Master, Master is a bad guy, a scoundrel, a pervert.</p>
<p>Sibin grabbed Lory&#x27;s fair white arms. He directly pushed her down. This villain pinned the young girl&#x27;s hands above her head. Sibin looked all over her body. He smiled slyly and reminded her.</p>
<p>No one can save you today. You must warm the bed for this young master, or I will eat you up. Pervert. Lory sobbed and struggled frantically under Sibin. Very good, the goal has been achieved.</p>
<p>The system&#x27;s notification sounded. Detected that the host forced his maid to warm the bed. A vicious and inhuman act. Awarding 5000 villain points. The host must continue to strive.</p>
<p>Sibin was overjoyed in his heart. Nice. The stupid system let me find a bug. Mission complete. Sibin got off Lory without any regrets.</p>
<p>He stood there looking at her happily. Alright, the experiment is complete. This is good enough. Lory sat up, utterly disappointed. Aren&#x27;t we moving on to the next step? Is that all? Sibin nodded repeatedly.</p>
<p>He winked at her and ordered. This is good enough. From now on, we&#x27;ll perform this once every night before bed. Lory looked at him, disappointed. Her face fell.</p>
<p>Master. The young girl sat there without saying anything. Lory&#x27;s face showed that she had something on her mind. Sibin was dumbfounded and asked curiously. What&#x27;s wrong? The young girl took a deep breath.</p>
<p>She looked at her master shyly. Master, please be honest with Lory, do you have some strange preferences? WTF. Sibin was speechless. How should he answer this? I&#x27;m screwed. Sibin swallowed nervously.</p>
<p>He stammered. No, it&#x27;s not... let me explain. His brain was trying to squeeze out an explanation that the young girl wouldn&#x27;t doubt. But why is it so hard? How could he explain to Lory that he wasn&#x27;t a pervert, but was just doing this to earn villain points? Lory moved closer, pressing her chest against him.</p>
<p>Master, if you have any strange preferences, just tell Lory. Lory will seriously consider Master&#x27;s request. This girl, stop talking. Sibin gritted his teeth and shut his eyes in agony, but everyone in the household was extremely supportive of him being a pervert. Drops of sweat drenched Sibin&#x27;s face.</p>
<p>Seeing her master in such an awkward position, Lory couldn&#x27;t bear to make things difficult for him. The young girl suddenly remembered something, and Lory immediately turned and ran off. It&#x27;s time for my lesson with Miss Chris. Master, please wait for Lory&#x27;s learning results. Sibin sat on the soft bed, letting out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s finally given up. Alright, I&#x27;ll wait for you. After waiting for Lory to be truly out of sight, Sibin excitedly accessed the system. This is definitely not avoiding the problem. Regardless of the second Glow Beta, I should test the system&#x27;s barracks first.</p>
<p>System Store Sentry Post, detailed information. Sentry Post: A structure for recruiting human unit types: Crusaders, Divine Archers. Detailed information: At the Sentry Post, you can spend 50 villain points and two gold coins to recruit a Crusader, or spend 100 villain points and two gold coins to recruit a Divine Archer. Providing enough iron ore can reduce the recruitment cost by half. Note: Recruited units are system units that will completely obey the host and possess a certain level of intelligence.</p>
<p>Sibin thought excitedly, this is awesome. Having a barracks means having military power, so my situation can change from passive to active. Alright, what am I waiting for? He immediately started, &quot;System, exchange for the Sentry Post for me.&quot; Ding! Sentry Post exchanged. Current villain points: 30,450. Does the Sentry Post need a location to appear? Appear in the castle&#x27;s rear garden.</p>
<p>Sibin immediately teleported to the rear garden, and the surrounding scenery changed instantly. He landed gently from above, so gently that a large corner of the rear garden was reduced to a pile of ruins. Sibin stood there and looked up with difficulty. Oh, how convenient. Hey system, first, recruit for me five Crusaders and five Divine Archers.</p>
<p>The system appeared, holding out an empty box in front of Sibin. Payment on delivery. Ding! Host, please deposit funds. No money, no troops, you get nothing. Sibin understood the problem.</p>
<p>He took a bag of silver from his pocket and tossed it into the box. Quite advanced, huh? I thought it would directly deduct my money. Sibin nervously watched the system close, but what was that ugly sound it was making? Why is this box making a sound like jammed money? It can&#x27;t be, right? Recruitment complete. The system immediately spat a bag of silver back out at him. Sibin looked at the bag of silver, full of question marks.</p>
<p>Huh, is this my change? Firmly collecting fees only according to the price list. Suddenly, from behind the castle gate, dozens of uniform footsteps echoed. Through the hazy smoke, countless cavalrymen emerged one by one. They lined up in two neat rows and greeted Sibin. Assembled for the Lord! Sibin nodded in satisfaction at these soldiers.</p>
<p>He was a bit flustered. No need to shout so loudly, otherwise it will be extremely noisy later, so very annoying. Sibin walked up to the leader and observed him carefully. The system then displayed his identity. It turned out his name was Truong Tam.</p>
<p>Identity: Crusader. Strength: Level 15 Swordsman. Skills: Shield Bash, Passive Battle Formation. Equipment: Common Crusader Shield, Common Crusader Longsword, Common Standard Crusader Armor. Reputation: Eagle Crest Territory 1.</p>
<p>This soldier is willing to die for you. Sibin, you should show some concern for this new soldier. He asked him gently, &quot;Truong Tam, right? Are you hungry? Do you want something to eat?&quot; Being cared for by his master like this, Truong Tam stood at attention happily and shouted loudly. Reporting to the Lord, Truong Tam has enough food and requires no supplement. Sibin used the system to scan these soldiers again.</p>
<p>He was a little sad. It seems the soldiers from the barracks lack intelligence and emotions, being more like fighting machines that don&#x27;t care about eating or drinking outside of combat. Ding. The system reminded him, &quot;Host, be advised, the death plot is about to begin.&quot; What? Sibin looked at the system map and paced back and forth in alarm. So the attack has already been launched? Daily Villain Quest updated.</p>
<p>Villain Quest 1: Eliminate at least 2000 players. Villain Quest 2: De-level 500 players back to level zero. Villain Quest 3: Repel Ye Hao&#x27;s revenge. Note: Killing players can earn villain points. This mission is tied to the host&#x27;s life and death.</p>
<p>Please be prepared. Sibin was worried. No, against players who can revive infinitely, these mentally deficient soldiers are not enough. System, I need to exchange for the Sky Knight breakthrough potion. Very well.</p>
<p>Exchange successful. The Sky Knight potion has appeared. Alright. Sibin ran hastily. He did a spectacular flip in the air, directly snatching the bottle and leaving.</p>
<p>Sibin shouted loudly, &quot;Crimon!&quot; As soon as Crimon heard that familiar call, he stopped teaching martial arts to the soldiers. Crimon looked at him in surprise without blinking. Huh? Young Master Sibin, are you also here to join the training? Sibin didn&#x27;t answer. He threw the bottle to Crimon. That&#x27;s not what needs to be done now.</p>
<p>This is for you. Crimon habitually caught it. He looked at the bottle in his hand and asked Sibin curiously, &quot;What is this?&quot; Sibin didn&#x27;t have enough time to sit and explain everything to him. He urged him, &quot;It&#x27;s very good for you, drink it quickly.&quot; Yes, Young Master. Hearing his master say so, Crimon didn&#x27;t hesitate to open the cap and gulp down the potion in the bottle.</p>
<p>Everyone around excitedly watched for Crimon&#x27;s change, whispering and gossiping among themselves. Sibin calmly watched him and thought to himself. Not a moment&#x27;s hesitation. This loyalty was not a waste of my potion. A moment later, Crimon&#x27;s eyes widened in pain.</p>
<p>That potion was absorbed into his body really fast. He suddenly felt a stream of spiritual energy running through his body. Crimon clenched his fists to endure it as countless blood-red streams of power surged through him. Crimon has leveled up to a new power. Crimon absorbed all of that power.</p>
<p>He couldn&#x27;t quite believe it, he was about to cry. Crimon joyfully looked at the spiritual energy flowing around his body. I never thought that in this lifetime, this old man could break through to Sky Knight. It&#x27;s all thanks to the master. Crimon shed a tear, ran over, and knelt to thank Sibin for the grace he had bestowed.</p>
<p>Young... Young Master... this old servant... Before he could finish speaking. Sibin happily helped him up.</p>
<p>He looked at his loyal guard, &quot;Don&#x27;t kneel. There are many important things waiting for you to do.&quot; Crimon looked at him in surprise, full of questions. &quot;What is it, Young Master? Just give the order.&quot; Sibin stood before tens of thousands of soldiers and announced, &quot;I have received information that an army of subhumans from Guang Town is about to charge here.&quot; All the soldiers were quite panicked. Crimon ran to his side. He wanted to ask for the reason but couldn&#x27;t bring himself to speak.</p>
<p>He worriedly reassured himself, &quot;A battle is coming? Why so suddenly? But no, now is not the time to talk about this.&quot; Crimon raised his blade high and ordered the soldiers. Everyone, attention! Set up seven defensive lines outside the city. Prepare rolling stones and caltrops. Announce to the entire city to enter a state of combat readiness before 12 o&#x27;clock tonight. Soldiers, inform all citizens to evacuate from Lan Dong City.</p>
<p>The situation is critical, no one dares to be negligent. They each went to their tasks and carried them out quickly. Crimon looked at Sibin. That gaze was the same as always; he cherished his master the most. Therefore, Young Master, rest assured.</p>
<p>I will definitely risk my life to protect the safety of Lan Dong City and you. Sibin could feel Crimon&#x27;s devotion. He also stood there looking at his aged guard. &quot;It&#x27;s been a while, Crimon. You&#x27;re still the same.&quot; Sibin also had to hurry back to prepare.</p>
<p>He put on the legendary Lord&#x27;s armor. The armor set was specially designed for him by Crimon. Lory ran over, looking at him with teary eyes. He just gently stroked her cheek, From outside came Truong Tam&#x27;s urgent report. &quot;My Lord!&quot; Sibin looked at his frantic appearance and wondered.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s wrong with you?&quot; Truong Tam breathed with difficulty and reported, &quot;The subhuman army you mentioned has appeared. They are currently less than 1 km from Lan Dong City.&quot; The newbies have arrived. Sibin didn&#x27;t seem to care about them. Calmer than calm, he tried to act a little surprised and exclaimed. That was fast.</p>
<p>I thought these players wouldn&#x27;t arrive until noon. How badly do they want to grind me to dust? Sibin gently ordered Lory. &quot;Lory, go see if Roy is awake yet. I&#x27;m going to the city wall to check the situation.&quot; Lory obediently accepted the order. &quot;Yes, Master.&quot; The young girl couldn&#x27;t bear to let Sibin leave.</p>
<p>She reminded him, &quot;You must be careful.&quot; Scene change. The atmosphere at the wall of Lan Dong City was frighteningly silent. There wasn&#x27;t a hint of wind today, and the air was uncomfortably stuffy. Sibin quickly appeared there, observing his surroundings cautiously. Sibin asked the guard, &quot;So, what&#x27;s the situation?&quot; The soldiers stood guard all around.</p>
<p>They had arranged their troops and formations on the city wall, perhaps so solid that not even an ant could get through. Suddenly, a notification from the system appeared. Player killed by a poisonous snake bite, causing severe psychological trauma. Received 20 villain points. Sibin calmly used binoculars to observe the enemy&#x27;s every move.</p>
<p>He shouted, &quot;They&#x27;re almost here! Prepare for battle!&quot; Receiving the order, the soldiers moved into their pre-arranged positions. The system displayed thousands of notifications again, it was about to overheat. Player drowned in sewage, causing severe psychological trauma. Received 20 villain points. The players, under Sibin&#x27;s arrangement, dozens of them fell into traps, dying like flies on the road.</p>
<p>Some panicked and abandoned their comrades to flee. Oh my god, it&#x27;s happening again. The players silently cursed Sibin&#x27;s ancestors for three generations. Who set such an immoral trap? The pit was so deep, and on top of that, there were a dozen venomous snakes inside. What snakes? Someone was vomiting uncontrollably, reminding others, &quot;Don&#x27;t say it, this damn pit is a cesspool.&quot; I&#x27;m starting to get scared of you, my dear.</p>
<p>But the thing is, the more of these mutants died, the more their numbers doubled upon respawning. Creepy, isn&#x27;t it? The group said smugly. Lord Eagle Crest would never have expected it, right? We&#x27;ve set up a temporary resurrection crystal here. Even if we die, we can revive as usual. All players, please be advised: the large-scale war quest &quot;Attack on Lan Dong City&quot; has begun.</p>
<p>Main Quest: Kill Lord Eagle Crest Sibin, the Golden Lion. Optional Sub-Quest: Rescue Saintess Roy. Quest Reward One: All players who accept the quest will receive 30,000 experience points. Players who kill enemies will contribute to an experience pool. After the battle, the experience pool will be divided among everyone.</p>
<p>Experience points can also be used to exchange for Memory Cleansing Potions from Ye Hao, valued at 1,000 experience points per bottle. Quest Reward Two: Common-grade equipment and Hero-grade equipment are free for the taking. Quest Reward Three: Gold coins, free for the taking. Quest Reward Eight: After completing the quest, all players participating in the campaign will receive the title &quot;Overthrower of Eagle Crest.&quot; The excited mutants shouted in a frenzy, &quot;The quest popped up! The quest popped up!&quot; The excited crowd stared at the quest screen before them, their eyes greedily coveting those rewards. Number of players on the battlefield has reached 5,000, activating Legion Campaign Buff.</p>
<p>Current buff level is Lv1. All players receive +20% (+2% per level) Stamina, and +10% (+2% per level) Speed. All players&#x27; respawn countdown time is halved, and experience points deducted upon revival are halved. Faith points daily increase by 20% + 5% per level. The temporary resurrection crystal&#x27;s defense rating is increased by 100% + 50% per lv.</p>
<p>The mutants, under Ye Hao&#x27;s leadership, swarmed towards the walls of Lan Dong City. The crowd had just been equipped with a series of new powers. As a result, they were incredibly energized, shouting at the top of their lungs. &quot;Holy crap, we&#x27;ve been buffed! Charge!&quot; The smell of shit still lingered in the air, causing the mutants to gag and vomit on the spot. They swore an oath, &quot;Generals and soldiers, today we attack this guy and loot for three days! Otherwise, how can we wash away the shame of having to swallow shit today?&quot; I&#x27;m dying of laughter.</p>
<p>Sibin stood high above, observing this amusing scene. The fragrant smell of shit. In life, you need to experience everything. No need to thank me. He ordered Zhang San, &quot;Magic Cannons, free fire! Let&#x27;s give them a taste.&quot; Without hesitation, Zhang San immediately ran to activate them.</p>
<p>Countless cannon barrels aimed directly at the ant-like swarm of mutants below. This time, I&#x27;ll give you a bellyful of shells. One, two, three, light the fuse! Fire! Countless fireballs were shot out, exploding with a deafening roar. See how formidable I am, sweetie? Once again, hundreds of fireballs exploded among the mutants, causing dizziness and ringing ears. The mutants cried and begged for their lives as they died under the fiery barrage, &quot;Help!&quot; A considerable number of mutants were annihilated.</p>
<p>Some legion commanders quickly ordered their troops to evacuate. Mage corps, spread out quickly! Watch out for those strange cannons! Don&#x27;t clump together, spread out now! And yet, there were still many stubborn ones. They set up ladders, intending to climb the city walls. The leaders ordered, &quot;Everyone, get out your prepared grappling hooks.&quot; After a while of scrambling up the walls of Lan Dong City. The siege ladders are limited and can be easily knocked down from above.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s hard to guarantee the first wave of attack. We can&#x27;t rely solely on the ladders. The speed of climbing the wall must be fast! Mages, prepare to provide cover! Revived mages, quickly reinforce and continue providing support! Don&#x27;t run around chaotically! Revived mages, quickly reinforce and continue providing support, don&#x27;t run around chaotically! Sibin looked at the situation before him and sighed wearily. Those mutants just kept reviving one after another. It&#x27;s truly inconvenient.</p>
<p>As expected, I still have to destroy the players&#x27; resurrection crystal. Although the magic cannons are extremely powerful, against so many people, it&#x27;s just a drop in the ocean. But after destroying it, I must retreat immediately. Once I&#x27;m surrounded by over 8,000 players, the consequences will be unimaginable. Sibin suddenly thought of a way.</p>
<p>He looked down excitedly. Is that thing shining like a 36-watt light bulb Ye Hao? That bastard actually dared to come. He must have gotten stronger. It&#x27;s just that he&#x27;s too far away for me to see his face clearly. It was time for Sibin to enter the battle.</p>
<p>He quickly drew the treasured sword from his back. His aura soared, and a source of divine power surged forth, its oppressive presence shining brilliantly around him. Sibin gave an order to Grimon. Grimon, I intend to leave the city and take the offensive. You stay behind and keep an eye on Ye Hao for me.</p>
<p>Grimon obeyed the command, bowing his head as he saw Sibin off. Yes, Young Master Sibin. Outside the city, the stone man Saraken and his soldiers were still diligently standing guard without rest. Sibin walked over and called out to him. Saraken.</p>
<p>As soon as he heard his name called, he glanced over. It&#x27;s the master. The master is calling me. He must need help with something. Saraken tried to drag his heavy body over to Sibin.</p>
<p>With an incredibly innocent look in his eyes, he respectfully greeted him. What is it, my respected Lord? Sibin pointed to the area opposite the city. Do you see those three crystal structures behind the mutant army? Saraken asked naively. The one with the glowing bug in the middle? Did he just call Ye Hao a glowing bug? Sibin clutched his stomach, choking with laughter. He played along and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. He didn&#x27;t hide anything and said it outright. I remember you have a skill called Hellfire Descent, which can fall directly onto a designated location from above the enemy within a certain range. Sibin ordered. Therefore, your mission is to descend from above the crystal structures and then help me destroy them.</p>
<p>Sibin carefully reminded Saraken. Kill as many mutants around the crystals as you can, but after you&#x27;ve destroyed them, you must fight for no more than 10 minutes and then return. Saraken looked at the mutants, happily waving his arms and legs, full of energy. Bursts of thunder and fire enveloped his body, growing larger by the moment. Saraken chuckled.</p>
<p>Saraken is best at this: sabotage, destruction, and death. Alright. He ordered Saraken to go. A second later, Saraken had vanished, leaving only a trail of green smoke. Saraken is off.</p>
<p>Sibin turned and continued to summon another of his subordinates. Ben Blackhood, a demon warrior immediately appeared. He bowed before Sibin. I am here, my Lord. Sibin ordered.</p>
<p>After we leave, the task of defending the city walls is entrusted to you. Ben agreed without hesitation. He reassured Sibin. Rest assured, my lord. I swear to the great mother earth that I will absolutely not let the enemy step past these city walls.</p>
<p>Very well, then. Let&#x27;s go. Sibin ordered the city gates to be opened. Before the eyes of the mutants, the gates of Lan Dong City slowly opened. At first, the mutants thought Sibin had taken the wrong medicine.</p>
<p>They shouted for their comrades to gather around. Look, the city gate is opening! Some wondered. Is Lord Eagle Crest planning to charge into battle? It&#x27;s not that simple. Lord Eagle Crest definitely intends to destroy our respawn point. Last time at Black River Ridge, he most certainly saw our temporary respawn point, and besides.</p>
<p>The temporary resurrection crystal is already quite obvious, and the main character, Ye Hao, standing in the middle, shines even brighter than us, like a high-powered light bulb. Lord Eagle Crest isn&#x27;t blind, needless to say. The whole crowd turned in unison to look at that foolish Ye Hao. Ye Hao was sweating bullets, realizing the mutants were starting to suspect him. He raised his voice to explain.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m here to protect the resurrection crystal! Rest assured, heroes, with me here, Lord Eagle Crest absolutely cannot get even half a step closer. Let&#x27;s just close our eyes and trust him for now, for the fun of it. What if we get our faces smashed in later? Suddenly, Grimon appeared out of nowhere, swinging his sword and slashing repeatedly at Ye Hao. Defeated foe, surrender your life! Damn it, what the hell? He was attacked by surprise. Ye Hao almost lost his life.</p>
<p>Luckily, he dodged to the side. Ye Hao took advantage of Grimon&#x27;s inattention, quickly drew his sword, and the two clashed wildly. As expected of the main character, his plot armor is truly formidable. The mutants below didn&#x27;t know whether to be happy or sad. I can&#x27;t believe this clueless main character.</p>
<p>This won&#x27;t do. It&#x27;s better if a portion of us always stays back to protect the crystal. Although we brought scrolls, we&#x27;re almost out. Setting up a new crystal requires a 30-second cooldown. The crowd changed their plan.</p>
<p>Understood! Everyone, protect the crystal! Over at Lan Dong City, the moment the gate fell, Sibin and his soldiers appeared aggressively, their imposing aura truly humbling. The mutants stared wide-eyed at Sibin. The gate is open! Someone&#x27;s coming out! Everyone, look! That&#x27;s... Lord Eagle Crest, Sibin, Golden Lion Sky Knight, Level 52, Nightmare. The truth was revealed again, and the whole crowd nearly fainted.</p>
<p>Holy shit, he&#x27;s actually Nightmare-grade. Someone crowed loudly. What&#x27;s there to be afraid of, brothers? With so many of us, we can crush him with our numbers alone. Our average level is 15, and we have 1,000 players over level 20. What the hell are we afraid of? That&#x27;s right, that&#x27;s right! Not scared, not scared! Na-na na-na boo-boo! Don&#x27;t forget our mission! We have to rescue Her Highness, the Saintess! After struggling against Grimon for a while, Ye Hao clearly began to lose ground.</p>
<p>Lord Eagle Crest breaking through to Sky Knight was nauseating enough. On what basis did this old man also get to break through to Sky Knight? Who&#x27;s the real one with the hacks? Suddenly, a scolding voice echoed in Ye Hao&#x27;s mind. It was that black-cloaked man. He was cursing him. Motherfucker, are you trying to conquer the world? You should be glad your new world hasn&#x27;t been invaded yet.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t you have any self-awareness of your own capabilities? Ye Hao, the connection between this world and my world has had a breakthrough, so I can temporarily modify the rules of this world for a period of time. The black-cloaked man began to chant. The real world and the dark world began to turn upside down. Is this variable how you save yourself, Kan? If you turn back time for everything and still only make this little progress, then you will ultimately still be unable to escape the fate of destruction. What is this? The time loop seemed to be reprogrammed.</p>
<p>Sibin watched in alarm. The system panel had also been modified. What is this? The pressure is so strong. The system panels of hundreds of players quickly sent a notification. Main boss detected: Lord Eagle Crest Sibin, the Golden Lion.</p>
<p>Due to the vast level difference, modification initiated... Modification complete. Attacking Sibin, the Golden Lion will inflict mandatory true damage. Dammit. Sibin realized there was a problem with this system.</p>
<p>Does the system mean that Lord Eagle Crest has finally been weakened? He&#x27;s been weakened? Sibin was confused, a little worried by his premonition. What the hell? I suddenly feel a chill, like something bad is about to happen. Just as he sensed, that guy launched a sneak attack, but he managed to block the blow. You dare to sneak attack? Battle Aura Defense! And yet, this small missile still hit him, sending him flying a short distance away. Sibin was caught completely by surprise; his knees buckled and he fell to the ground, luckily supported by his sword.</p>
<p>He wondered, how could a tiny fireball break through his defense. The man in the brown cloak was ecstatic. Tearing up with joy, this was the taste of victory for him. I broke his defense! I dealt three drops of damage! I&#x27;m so moved, I finally didn&#x27;t miss anymore. The underlings behind him, their eyes lit up, exclaimed continuously, &quot;Holy crap, he really did it! Holy crap, that&#x27;s awesome!&quot; Meanwhile, he was still celebrating, &quot;I&#x27;m so good.</p>
<p>Now, according to the quest, his battle aura&#x27;s protective mechanism must have been weakened. I told you, how could a game issue a quest that we can&#x27;t possibly complete.&quot; Saraken now looked normal, and was suddenly slashed across the body by Sibin&#x27;s sword. -872,367. Only then did Sibin reflect on the current situation. In short, he now knew what that nameless chill was.</p>
<p>His defensive battle aura had actually become ineffective, but luckily his attack power wasn&#x27;t reduced. This battle was a matter of life and death; he had to win no matter what. Full of fighting spirit, he raised his sword and signaled his soldiers to attack, &quot;All troops, hear my command! Kill!&quot; The hooded man&#x27;s accomplices were no slouches either. Their eyes lit up as they rushed towards Sibin like vultures spotting a juicy prey. &quot;Target Lord Eagle Crest! Control him! Brothers, charge!&quot; They charged forward, one grabbing his neck, another his leg, and another pulling Sibin&#x27;s arm.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to use a great deal of power to make them explode. From this move, he himself was significantly injured, with only about 30% of his life remaining. These guys were truly countless. Seeing Sibin injured, they cheered even more joyfully, &quot;Mage players! Stop being shields! We should sacrifice ourselves! Let&#x27;s go! Fire at him! Don&#x27;t spare a proud flower like me.&quot; &quot;We succeeded! We injured him! Brothers, go again! We&#x27;ll win in no more than three rounds.&quot; Sibin wiped a bit of blood from the corner of his mouth, rethinking how to deal with this mob that used their bodies to overwhelm him. &quot;This won&#x27;t do.</p>
<p>The players can revive indefinitely. At this rate, I could die from exhaustion alone.&quot; He shouted loudly, &quot;Saraken, speed up!&quot; Giant energy diamonds appeared and gathered into a colossal figure that rushed towards them, exploding thunderously. They were sent flying everywhere like cockroaches. The giant man was completely unharmed, and roared in anger, &quot;Insects! Insects everywhere!&quot; Death sprouted like mushrooms. Sibin&#x27;s giant laughed with glee watching these freaks being scattered, &quot;Kha kha kha.&quot; This was the Hellfire Lord Saraken, the Ash Skull Great Demon who had reached level 55, Nightmare-grade.</p>
<p>Saraken let out a series of roars. The cracks on his body all emitted powerful energy beams. Destruction, annihilation, death. The ones who were just demanding to kill Sibin could now only cower in a corner and pray. They were in an uproar, &quot;Holy crap, what the hell is this thing? Why does it look like a Hellfire demon? Why is there another one? Could it be that because Lord Eagle Crest was weakened, we&#x27;re now surrounded by three Nightmare-grade bosses? Then what was the point of weakening him in the first place?&quot; Two leaders of the soldiers discussed with each other, &quot;We&#x27;ve run into a ghost.</p>
<p>There are bosses everywhere. On Ye Hao&#x27;s side, there&#x27;s an old knight, also a knight... no.&quot; The person next to him refuted, &quot;That&#x27;s not right. Lord Eagle Crest is diverting our main forces&#x27; attention. His real purpose is to backdoor us! Quickly tell everyone to be careful with the resurrection crystal!&quot; A soldier rushed over to report breathlessly, &quot;Brother Fan, the resurrection crystal can&#x27;t hold on much longer!&quot; Hearing the report, Brother Fan was both panicked and annoyed, &quot;What? How can it be so fast? Where&#x27;s the super strong physical defense? Where&#x27;s my double 200% defense power?&quot; With that, he signaled for those around him to stop and announced to the players, &quot;Take all the resurrection crystals and temporarily withdraw! Ye Hao is tied down.</p>
<p>We need to stop that Hellfire Lord.&quot; The soldiers heard the command, &quot;We will obey absolutely! Roger!&quot; After the announcement, he immediately bolstered everyone&#x27;s morale, &quot;Everyone, persevere! These are all Lord Eagle Crest&#x27;s generals. It&#x27;s true that we&#x27;re facing three bosses at once, but the quest requirement is only to kill Lord Eagle Crest.&quot; Then, he channeled his power, causing his energy sources to radiate in many directions, signaling for all soldiers to advance together. &quot;Now, split a group to harass the Hellfire Lord. Don&#x27;t let him destroy the crystal easily. The siege players can return to help surround and kill the Lord boss.&quot; Sibin was injured, but hearing their words, he couldn&#x27;t help but laugh, &quot;You think you can kill me with just this? Dream on.&quot; The soldiers on the other side heard his words and panicked.</p>
<p>They kept encouraging each other, &quot;Hang in there! This guy is starting his flag lines!&quot; Sibin was startled, his jaw dropped. &quot;Did I just set a flag?&quot; Suddenly, he felt his body being regenerated with energy. The wounds on Sibin&#x27;s body gradually disappeared completely. His body was recovering. Someone was healing him.</p>
<p>&quot;This light is... it&#x27;s her!&quot; Whipping around, he saw it was Loria. Sibin was alarmed, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you looking after Roy? Go back quickly, it&#x27;s dangerous here.&quot; The little girl rushed forward, hugged his waist tightly, and pleaded, &quot;No! I must stay by Master&#x27;s side and help Master. I awakened my bloodline power with great difficulty. If I can&#x27;t even help Master at a critical moment, then what&#x27;s the point?&quot; Sibin was touched.</p>
<p>He looked at her with a gentle gaze, &quot;Lory, if that&#x27;s the case, then follow me. You must not leave my side for a single step, do you remember?&quot; The little girl obediently replied, &quot;Yes, I remember, Master. Now it&#x27;s Lory&#x27;s turn to protect you.&quot; While Sibin&#x27;s side was joyful, on the other side, the noisy mob attacking him was wide-eyed and open-mouthed, sharing the news, &quot;Hey, hey, look at this!&quot; &quot;Are you crazy?&quot; They looked towards Sibin, who was recovering and growing stronger, and broke into a cold sweat. &quot;Holy crap, Lord Eagle Crest is healing! And he has a healing buff too! Where on earth did this subhuman girl come from? Why is she helping Lord Eagle Crest?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve been fighting for so long, where are the developers? Is no one noticing an NPC hacking in this game? Where did this subhuman Lory come from?&quot; They quickly looked up the little girl&#x27;s information on the system. The screen immediately displayed the information: Name: Lory.</p>
<p>Identity: Maid, Lord Eagle Crest&#x27;s love. Strength: Awakened Subhuman, Stage Level 43, 41 to 50 levels. Threat: Nightmare, other common nightmares unknown. A few of them felt her name was very familiar, &quot;Lory... why does that sound so familiar? I feel like I&#x27;ve seen it somewhere.&quot; &quot;Damn, quick, check the quest rewards! Found it!&quot; They all opened the system to check.</p>
<p>Quest Reward 4: Special NPC Follower, Subhuman Maiden Lory. Note: This NPC cannot be forcibly subdued. Requires Memory Cleansing Potion. This reward is unique. Now they finally realized.</p>
<p>No wonder the required Memory Cleansing Potion was a question mark. &quot;This is fcking love! Her favorability rating has probably maxed out! And the threat level is so damn realistic. Being hugged by Lord Eagle Crest makes her Nightmare-grade.&quot; While they were still wondering about so many things, Sibin had already started his attack. Wherever he went, his overwhelming power crushed people. They all clamored, &quot;Holy crap, he&#x27;s coming!&quot; With one hand holding his sword and the other around Lory&#x27;s waist, Sibin reminded the little girl, &quot;Lory, hold on tight.&quot; Lory obediently listened, &quot;Lory is holding on tight.&quot; This time, Sibin unleashed a ferocious beast, charging straight towards the enemy.</p>
<p>The leaders reassured their subordinates, &quot;Don&#x27;t panic, don&#x27;t panic! Mages, get out of the way! Warriors, warriors! Try your best to die at the boss&#x27;s feet to create obstacles for him! All players, mages, concentrate your fire! Kill the healer in the boss&#x27;s arms first!&quot; They crouched down, playing in a sneak attack style. Sibin, about to be hit by the same Diaochan-like move from before, just realized it and cursed under his breath, &quot;Son of a bitch, this trick again?&quot; The noisy mob had blocks of power ready in their hands small. Preparing to attack Sibin. &quot;Mages, get ready!&quot; They unleashed everything on Sibin in one go. They cheered with joy, &quot;Level 3 Converging Flame Art! It&#x27;s a hit!&quot; One of the leaders of the soldiers cheered happily, &quot;Did we succeed? I wonder how much damage it will do.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s still at full power. A level 3 Flame Emperor Dao Art is so powerful, it should at least break the maid&#x27;s shield.&quot; But he forgot that it&#x27;s not over till it&#x27;s over. After their less-than-graceful attack, Sibin and Lory stood there without a single scratch. This was a scenario they truly hadn&#x27;t considered. &quot;How is this possible? I dealt over 1300 damage, that&#x27;s already very high.</p>
<p>But I saw 10,400 immediately pop up over Lord Eagle Crest&#x27;s head. We can&#x27;t kill this maid anymore. I just realized that true damage only works on Lord Eagle Crest. The maid has a giant protective shield provided by Lord Eagle Crest. No matter how we attack, it&#x27;ll be a miss.&quot; Another, calmer leader analyzed the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Focusing on Lord Eagle Crest is also meaningless. That maid has terrifyingly powerful healing abilities. Dealing with both of them together is an unsolvable problem for us right now.&quot; They all became agitated, &quot;So what do we do?&quot; The female leader said calmly, &quot;Wait for death.&quot; This short sentence was spoken quickly, but it silenced all her subordinates. Perhaps they had all accepted their deaths. The female leader thought to herself, &quot;We can&#x27;t kill Lord Eagle Crest.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t break through Lan Dong City, nor can we save Saintess Roy. The players will automatically respawn at the nearby crystal. Once that giant completely shatters the crystal, players can die and return to Divine Light Town.&quot; Sibin, holding Lory, jumped onto Saraken&#x27;s shoulder. They divided the attack directions. &quot;Using Flame Emperor Art to attack our maid, were you? Today, not a single one of you will escape.</p>
<p>Saraken, leave the last crystal. We&#x27;ll camp and kill them.&quot; The noisy mob below realized it and quickly shared the news, &quot;They... want to camp our respawn point! Spread out quickly! If we get burned by that flame, we&#x27;re done for! Run out of the battlefield! Run as far as you can, it&#x27;s better than being killed and losing levels.&quot; And so, thanks to their perfect coordination, wherever Sibin and Saraken went, they were victorious. The ones who had just been demanding to kill him were now sent flying everywhere like plucked chickens. With Lory by his side, Sibin was like a kite in the wind; no matter how injured he got, he was immediately restored to his original state.</p>
<p>The little girl also constantly encouraged him, &quot;Master, keep it up!&quot; On the castle walls, two strangers appeared, their faces completely covered. The woman dressed as a nun laughed gleefully looking down at Sibin and Lory, &quot;Truly disappointing. So many people, and they still lost. It seems we still need to take action.&quot; The man behind her reminded her, &quot;We are all clear on his trump card. It&#x27;s just that the subhuman maid with extremely strong healing and defensive abilities was not mentioned in the Church&#x27;s intelligence before.</p>
<p>It seems she&#x27;ll be a bit tough to handle.&quot; Hearing this, the woman sneered, &quot;So there are things that the Sword Assassin deems &#x27;tough to handle.&#x27; Isn&#x27;t your title &#x27;one who can silently approach prey, ignore defenses, and kill the opponent directly&#x27;?&quot; With that, her eyes blazed with killing intent. She rested a hand on the man&#x27;s shoulder and whispered, &quot;Remember, the Pope must... We are here to ensure he is killed, so this mission must not fail.&quot; He replied curtly, &quot;Mm.&quot; Sibin&#x27;s enemies were now countless. They were simply overwhelming him with sheer numbers; for every one Sibin killed, another took their place. While Sibin was fighting at the front, a man rushed in from behind, intending to launch a sneak attack on him.</p>
<p>Lory saw it in time and shouted a warning, &quot;Master, be careful!&quot; But it was too late. Lory took the blow for him, and as a result, was stabbed in the chest. Blood flowed in a stream. Sibin was stunned, only able to utter the girl&#x27;s name helplessly, &quot;Lory.&quot; The masked man in black was momentarily surprised that Lory could withstand his attack. Sibin, beside her, was worried sick.</p>
<p>&quot;Lory.&quot; Lory forced a smile to reassure him, &quot;It&#x27;s nothing, Master. Lory previously released the Holy Spirit&#x27;s Blessing on herself, which is why I dared to block the sword for Master.&quot; He chided the girl for her reckless action just now, &quot;Even so, that was too risky.&quot; The man in black landed on the ground. &quot;Immune to instant death skills, huh? An interesting subhuman young lady.&quot; Sibin, who had been enduring a heart-stopping scene, angrily shouted at him, &quot;How dare you harm Lory!&quot; Just then, the system displayed this person&#x27;s information. His name was Sisoka, a Black Sword Soul Master. Identity: Elite Knight of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Strength: Level 49 Assassin. 41 to 50. Skills: Stealth, Pounce Attack, Modified Creature Bleeding Spikes, Modified Creature Flash Step, Low Presence, Modified Creature Hunting Stance. Modified Creature Equipment: Bleeding Black Sword. Titles: Armor City Grandmaster, County Knight, Colon Empire Prestige Grandmaster 9673.</p>
<p>Outwardly, he is the second son of the Lion Clan. Behind the scenes, he is an Elite Knight of the Holy Land. Subhuman Faction Prestige: 142. His hands were soaked in the blood of subhumans. Sisoka observed him and concluded, &quot;An Elite Knight of the Holy Land, so you&#x27;re one of the Church&#x27;s people.&quot; Sibin drew his sword, his eyes filled with killing intent, and growled at him word by word, &quot;I will make you regret this the moment you die.&quot; With that, his fierce tiger-like power lunged at Sisoka, who couldn&#x27;t block in time.</p>
<p>&quot;Such immense strength.&quot; &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect Lord Eagle Crest to go berserk over a subhuman maid.&quot; His hand held his sword to defend, but he couldn&#x27;t resist this terrifying power. He reassessed the situation. &quot;If I face him head-on like this, I most likely can&#x27;t win. I have to find a chance to get behind him.&quot; He began to change direction to circle behind, but the quick-witted Sibin had already detected his intention. &quot;Trying to run? Not a chance.&quot; Sisoka was in a dilemma, and called out for help from the other woman, &quot;Nun, aren&#x27;t you going to lend a hand? Do you want to watch me die?&quot; A turquoise spatial blade appeared as space tore open.</p>
<p>The blade shrank and moved toward Sibin, stabbing straight into his chest. Sibin was caught off guard. When he looked down, he saw blood seeping from his chest. It hurt so much. The tiny vortex burrowed deep into his chest.</p>
<p>Unable to bear it, Sibin spat out blood. Lory was horrified. The girl quickly ran to Sibin&#x27;s side. &quot;Master!&quot; Sibin was tense. He hadn&#x27;t thought such a small spatial blade could bring him to this state.</p>
<p>The flesh and blood on his chest were instantly shredded to pieces by the spatial blade. &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect the Holy Land to have this kind of talent.&quot; He collapsed onto the stone floor. &quot;I was careless.&quot; Lory ran to support him. &quot;Master, how are you?&quot; Lory hugged him, placing her hand on the wound to heal him. &quot;Just half a minute, in half a minute Lory will make you well again.&quot; At this moment, the nun finally revealed herself.</p>
<p>She laughed smugly, &quot;Quite something, aren&#x27;t you? In that case, I absolutely can&#x27;t let you live for another half a minute.&quot; She turned to mock Sisoka, &quot;However, seeing the Black Sword in such a sorry state is actually quite interesting, haha.&quot; Sisoka, embarrassed, urged her to finish the job. &quot;Stop wasting words and deal with them.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s over, Lord Eagle Crest.&quot; Lory and Sibin held each other. Could this be how it all ends? The players, who had been engrossed in the slaughter, now noticed something unusual. &quot;Hey, hey, isn&#x27;t this a bit strange?&quot; They stopped to gossip about the two who were about to kill Sibin. &quot;Those two who suddenly rushed in seem to be people from the Holy Land.</p>
<p>What the hell? A cutscene suddenly started in the middle of our Lan Dong City assault mission? Is that even allowed?&quot; Another chimed in, &quot;The funniest part is them.&quot; They wondered about this anomaly. &quot;We were about to take down Lord Eagle Crest for sure. Does this count as a story kill? If Lord Eagle Crest dies like this, I wonder how the rewards will be calculated.&quot; Sisoka pointed his sword straight at Sibin and shouted, &quot;Die!&quot; Lory, terrified, threw herself into Sibin&#x27;s arms, crying loudly, &quot;Ma-Master.&quot; Sibin shielded her with one arm. &quot;Lory, get down.&quot; Sisoka suddenly froze. Countless sword slashes appeared from nowhere, cutting him several times.</p>
<p>Before he could react, he only managed to utter, &quot;Huh?&quot; before his body disintegrated, torn to pieces. The nun beside him was startled and horrified. &quot;Black Sword!&quot; Sibin looked into the distance and recognized a familiar figure. &quot;You are... Roy.&quot; &quot;Mm.&quot; Roy, with soulless eyes, advanced toward them, looking straight at the nun.</p>
<p>&quot;And you.&quot; The nun was now afraid, her face darkening. &quot;How can she have such terrifying speed? Black Sword was killed before he could even counterattack.&quot; She used her old trick, pulling out the spatial blade. Sibin witnessed this scene again. &quot;This person again.&quot; The nun underestimated Roy&#x27;s current combat ability. &quot;But this fox-eared girl has no battle aura to protect her.</p>
<p>As long as my space tears a little more, she will be instantly shattered.&quot; She didn&#x27;t expect that although Roy&#x27;s body was weak, her reactions and abilities were still so strong. Roy still didn&#x27;t fly higher than the nun&#x27;s spatial blade. The nun remained calm. &quot;Damn it. This strange subhuman mongrel&#x27;s seven orifices have started to bleed.</p>
<p>Her body is clearly bearing a heavy load, a huge one. I just need to stall for a little longer, and she&#x27;s sure to die. Got you... what?&quot; Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, Roy had circled behind her, tightly gripping the arm she was using to channel her power. &quot;How...</p>
<p>how can this be? My spatial magic...&quot; Roy successfully took her down, constantly criticizing, &quot;Too slow. Like a snail.&quot; On his side, Sibin couldn&#x27;t believe his eyes. &quot;Are you kidding me? This is Roy.&quot; Roy held a piece of cloth in her hand and unconsciously said to herself, &quot;How badly injured were you to be wrapped up like this?&quot; Lory gritted her teeth. &quot;Just a little... just a little more.&quot; The girl got out of Sibin&#x27;s arms and stood up, shielding him.</p>
<p>Lory shouted at Roy, &quot;I... I won&#x27;t let you harm Master!&quot; Sibin tried to stop her. &quot;You fool, Lory.&quot; Regardless of what was happening, Roy rushed toward them. She was about to attack. Sibin pulled Lory into his arms, trying to block Roy&#x27;s blow with his sword.</p>
<p>Roy coughed out loud, &quot;Cough, cough, cough.&quot; Blood also trickled from her mouth. Her eyes, crying tears of blood, stared intently at Sibin. Perhaps she had recognized him. &quot;You are...&quot; She unconsciously fell against his chest and passed out. &quot;Hey, Roy.&quot; Everything happened too fast; Sibin still didn&#x27;t understand what was going on.</p>
<p>&quot;What on earth is this? Roy&#x27;s speed just now far surpassed normal speeds. How did she do that?&quot; Black streams flowed from Roy&#x27;s eyes and mouth. Sibin seemed to have guessed what was happening. &quot;Unless...&quot; The system displayed Roy&#x27;s information. Name: Roy.</p>
<p>Identity: Saintess. Personal Strength: Subhuman, First Stage Awakening, Level 50. Skills: Light and Shadow Prayer. Time Freeze, Sword of Faith, Self-Defense Light. The faster the speed, the heavier the load.</p>
<p>Bewitching Fox Scent, Passive Charm, Weak Limbs, Improved Resilience, Passive. Equipment: Tattered Stance Dress. Normal Colon Empire Prestige 200, what reputation? Subhuman Faction Prestige 913. She is a kind-hearted Saintess. Seeing Sibin&#x27;s silence, Lory asked him, &quot;Master, are you alright?&quot; Sibin smiled gently.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m fine.&quot; He looked at the menacing enemies behind them. &quot;Besides, the war is about to end. The players are essentially a mob chasing experience and rewards. Let&#x27;s go back. We can leave the rest to those brutes.&quot; After speaking, he lifted Lory into his arms and slung Roy over his other shoulder.</p>
<p>Lory, worried because he was just injured, wanted to walk on her own. &quot;Master, Lory can walk by herself.&quot; Sibin ignored her, insisting on carrying her. &quot;Be quiet.&quot; Sibin reflected on the matter. With such a major incident occurring during the mission, they couldn&#x27;t just turn a blind eye and continue. The rowdy crowd that was fighting suddenly stood still.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, is that Roy? So ferocious. It seems so, but I can&#x27;t be sure now. So, do we still need to take her back to Divine Light Town?&quot; They discussed among themselves, &quot;I see Lord Eagle Crest is injured. Maybe we should just give up. Not only did this Holy Land thing suddenly happen, didn&#x27;t she just save Lord Eagle Crest? Is she a boss or a side quest? We need to figure it out, or it&#x27;s a waste of time and effort.</p>
<p>We fought two nightmare-grade bosses and got no drops at all. Let&#x27;s go, let&#x27;s go! Grab the crystals, respawn, let&#x27;s just suicide-run out of here. I don&#x27;t want to stay here another day.&quot; Sibin, Lory, and Roy returned to the castle. Sibin placed Roy on the bed. Lory healed Roy&#x27;s wounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Master, all her internal organs are injured. Lory can treat the wounds on her body, but there&#x27;s no way to heal her torn soul.&quot; &quot;For now, this can only recover on its own. She will be quite weak for a very long time.&quot; He noticed the girl seemed uneasy and reassured her, &quot;You did a great job. You should go get some rest.&quot; Sibin was alone in the room, contemplating the past events. &quot;As expected, Roy has awakened her personal bloodline power.</p>
<p>Perhaps she couldn&#x27;t distinguish between dreams and reality, which is why she indiscriminately attacked friend and foe and went on a killing spree after waking up.&quot; Sibin sighed sympathetically. &quot;As the female protagonist, bearing such a heavy responsibility is truly not easy. But her body can&#x27;t handle the power that comes with her speed. So if she unleashes her full power like today, her body and soul are being torn apart every second.&quot; The players were still loitering at the place where the fierce battle had just taken place. They wondered, &quot;I wonder how the male protagonist is doing.</p>
<p>Damn it.&quot; The people from Divine Light Town finally made it back. Someone who had been beaten down to level zero lamented, &quot;I want to quit the game, brothers. I&#x27;m going to become an autist. This game has nothing. You&#x27;re supposed to pick up rewards, but the important thing is we didn&#x27;t pick up a damn thing.</p>
<p>I feel like we&#x27;re about to lose our starter village too.&quot; The players blamed Ye Hao. &quot;And the protagonist, Ye Hao, is also too terrible. Who knows where he ran off to this time. He&#x27;s useless here anyway, just losing, losing, losing, losing, losing.&quot; A voice echoed from somewhere, &quot;Ye Hao, you have failed again.&quot; He asked the figure of fire in front of him, &quot;Can I ask you something?&quot; Seeing the fire figure remain silent, he knelt on one knee. &quot;Why was it that when Lord Eagle Crest first came to me, he could have completely killed us but didn&#x27;t?&quot; Only then did the fire figure speak, &quot;I am trying to understand the power of this world.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t Can also trying to understand my power? He and I are both absorbing the unique rules of each other. Ye Hao gradually understood everything. So, the reason Lord Eagle Crest didn&#x27;t completely kill me and the players was because he intentionally wanted to maintain contact with the players, to help the existence behind him learn about the Latinh world. In that case, Lord Eagle Crest and I are just chess pieces for two world wills, with the Canê continent as the chessboard. The help the Latinh will gave me is the players; the help the Can will gave Lord Eagle Crest is those strange monster soldiers.</p>
<p>The mysterious fire person reminded him, &quot;The battle between worlds is extremely perilous. I am not omniscient and omnipotent in this world, so you cannot continue to be reckless.&quot; &quot;You were the one who told me to attack Lan Dong City, and now you&#x27;re the one blaming me for being reckless. And I&#x27;m supposed to be the child of destiny? Might as well change my name to the child of disaster.&quot; He raised the hand holding the globe-like object. &quot;I have deciphered some of this world&#x27;s rules and can stably provide some help. From now on, you must rely on yourself.</p>
<p>Time is running out. If you fail again, you should know your fate, right?&quot; Ye Hao could only obediently obey him, &quot;Yes.&quot; In the sky, a woman appeared in mid-air, her voice echoing down, &quot;Esteemed heroes from another world. I am the Subhuman Goddess Ma Long Men. I know of the setbacks you have experienced in Lan Dong City.&quot; The crowd began to murmur, &quot;Hey, look, it&#x27;s a goddess.&quot; &quot;Hehe, a goddess, what&#x27;s this? A new storyline?&quot; &quot;Holy crap, brothers, I can get behind this. This is a cutscene, the devs are really going all out.&quot; A few perverts even joked, &quot;Hee, that generous bosom, that graceful waist, those long, smooth legs, that thin, see-through chiffon skirt, I&#x27;m ready.&quot; The Subhuman Goddess Ma Long Men continued, &quot;This is not your fault.</p>
<p>Lord Eagle Crest&#x27;s power and cunning were beyond the data, but you cannot just give up. My pitiful servant, that Saintess, still needs your help.&quot; The girl standing among the players understood, so the Lan Dong City instance will be forcibly modified. The subhuman goddess encouraged them, &quot;Brave warriors, you still have a chance. It&#x27;s just that your current strength is still weak, and you must temporarily avoid the storm. Head west, brave warriors, leave Lord Eagle Crest&#x27;s territory.</p>
<p>You will eventually soar high. I will be in the shackles of the gods, using this remnant of mine to pray for you.&quot; Quest update completed. Original main quest, &quot;Restore the Empire,&quot; has been personally modified to &quot;Required Level: 40+.&quot; Side quest updated, Epic-grade, &quot;A Long Journey.&quot; Quest description: Under the guidance of the Subhuman Goddess, you have decided to head to the west of the Canê continent, where the vast Beastman Empire is located. Obtain the artifact lost by the subhumans in the Blood Rock Tribe and offer it to the goddess to greatly enhance your power. Each player&#x27;s system screen displayed: New quest.</p>
<p>Quest requirement: Attack and conquer the Blood Goose Clan, obtain the Subhuman Artifact: Flowing Fang Totem.

<p>See the shop for mount details. exchange. Lory, in a cute and pleading tone, begged her master not to be angry anymore; she knew she was wrong. At this moment, Lory was sitting with her knees drawn up in Sibin&#x27;s lap. He snorted and warned her, &quot;Let&#x27;s see if you dare to block a sword again next time.&quot; Lory blushed shyly, closed her eyes, and placed her hands on Sibin&#x27;s shoulders.</p>
<p>Lory lowered her head, her mind in a jumble, wondering why her master had asked her to kneel on his lap. This way, her knees didn&#x27;t hurt, but it was so embarrassing. These thoughts made Lory feel shy. Lory&#x27;s eyes looked up at Sibin&#x27;s face, a proud smile on her lips, as she silently admired him. Master is so handsome, our children will surely be extremely cute, right? But will they have ears and a tail like me? Sibin saw Lory looking at him and turned his face away, as he still hadn&#x27;t figured out how to punish her.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lory suddenly opened her mouth and called out, &quot;Master.&quot; Her lips were slightly seductive as she said she wanted to be with her master, probably intending to say she wanted to have children with him, but she was cut off by Sibin before she could finish. Flustered, he ran a hand through his hair and said loudly, &quot;What children? It&#x27;s broad daylight!&quot; The sudden embarrassment made Sibin forget all his serious thoughts about reprimanding her, and the idea of a severe punishment vanished. Lory spread her arms and threw herself at her master, hugging him tightly. Sibin, now embarrassed, didn&#x27;t know what to do, and could only hold his arms wide. Lory&#x27;s chest pressed against Sibin&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and tilted her face up to kiss Sibin, who cried out in a fluster. While fumbling awkwardly, Sibin&#x27;s hand touched Lory&#x27;s soft brown tail. Lory immediately let out a soft moan. Being touched on the tail caused Lory to react; her eyes became hazy, her arms went limp, her mouth opened wide, and her chest heaved. Lory then said to Sibin, &quot;You can&#x27;t just touch a subhuman&#x27;s tail.</p>
<p>Lory&#x27;s knees instinctively drew up. After all, that&#x27;s a place only a husband can touch. If you touch it, you have to take responsibility.&quot; At this moment, Sibin suddenly had an idea. Now he knew how to punish Lory. He smiled brightly and raised his hand.</p>
<p>Sibin continuously touched and stroked Lory&#x27;s tail again and again, asking her while stroking her tail if she would dare to do it again. anymore. Lory immediately felt she couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. Her chest heaved, her head tilted back, her face flushed, and sweat began to pour down. In a seductive manner, Lory begged, &quot;I won&#x27;t dare.&quot; Sibin let go, and Lory immediately hugged his arm, looking like a puppy as she said she knew she was wrong, apologized to her master, and even had a gift for Sibin.</p>
<p>Sibin now smiled triumphantly. Lory opened her hand. Inside was a four-leaf clover bracelet. She explained that in her homeland, the four-leaf clover is a symbol of luck. Wearing it would make her master luckier and luckier.</p>
<p>The four-leaf clover shone with a strange golden light. Sibin asked if it was made from the bottle of life water he had used to heal Lory before. Sibin took the bracelet and held it up to inspect it, then continued, &quot;I thought you threw that bottle away a long time ago.&quot; Lory said huffily that it was the first gift her master had given her, full of symbolic meaning, so how could she throw it away. After hearing this, Sibin became a little curious. Seeing a three-leaf clover necklace around Lory&#x27;s neck, he asked what the three-leaf clover on her neck symbolized.</p>
<p>Lory looked down shyly, a gentle smile on her lips, and said softly, &quot;I won&#x27;t tell you about this three-leaf clover, Master.&quot; Then she ran out the door, turned back to wave at Sibin, and said with a smile, &quot;You&#x27;ll have to guess, Master. I have to go to Miss Cris&#x27;s class now,&quot; leaving a still bewildered Sibin behind. Sibin relaxed, leaning back in his chair with his hands behind his head and his feet propped up on the desk. He smiled and asked the system, &quot;This time, I repelled the players and modified the predetermined fate. There should be a reward, right? The system hasn&#x27;t popped up recently, I wonder what it&#x27;s been doing.&quot; The system immediately announced: &quot;Death storyline completed.</p>
<p>Received one Chain of Fate. The child of destiny, Ye Hao, currently has two fate lines remaining. The host can use it at any time.&quot; Sibin was confused. Sibin said, &quot;Speak of the devil, and he shall appear. I was just thinking about the system, and it popped right up.&quot; &quot;One Chain of Fate that can be used at any time.</p>
<p>System, does it matter when I use it?&quot; Sibin asked the system after receiving the notification, focusing on the system&#x27;s information panel in front of him. The system replied, suggesting it could be used during battle to make the child of destiny uncomfortable. This information made Sibin wonder. &quot;Uncomfortable? How uncomfortable?&quot; The system replied, &quot;Very uncomfortable.&quot; Sibin was left speechless. Tired of talking to the system, he brushed his hair back and thought, &quot;I&#x27;m not wasting any more words on this stupid system.</p>
<p>If I keep talking, I&#x27;m afraid my IQ will be dragged down by it.&quot; He requested to draw his reward. After hearing Sibin&#x27;s request, the system displayed a notification: &quot;Host has completed the daily villain quest. Beginning reward draw.&quot; Sibin&#x27;s reward was an equipment reward. No critical bonus this time. The system congratulated the host on receiving the special hero-grade equipment: the Holy Robe of Vina.</p>
<p>Sibin stood there, scratching his head in confusion. &quot;The Holy Robe of Vina? Why does that name sound like something a woman would wear?&quot; Sibin tapped on the clothing icon on the system screen. system. Suddenly, the system exploded with a loud noise, and a dazzling golden light enveloped the area, forcing Sibin to cover his eyes with his hands. At this moment, the system explained, &quot;The Holy Robe of Vina is a holy garment personally crafted by the Goddess of Beauty Vina.</p>
<p>There are only three sets on the entire Canê continent. One set is currently known to be in the possession of the Elf Princess. Skill: Blessing of Dustlessness (Passive). Skill: Charm Increase (Passive). Skill: As the Heart Desires.</p>
<p>Skill: Advanced Natural Grace (Passive).&quot; A black outfit shrouded in golden light appeared before Sibin. Sibin looked at the outfit and remarked, &quot;The name already sounded like it, and looking at it, it looks even more so.&quot; But Sibin still didn&#x27;t understand what &quot;As the Heart Desires&quot; meant, so he asked the system. The system responded, &quot;That skill allows it to transform into any shape the host and the owner desire. The transformation can occur just by imagining it in your mind. The Holy Robe of Vina is also known as the Goddess of Beauty&#x27;s Wardrobe.&quot; Sibin thought deeply.</p>
<p>&quot;It can transform into any shape.&quot; Countless images of Lory appeared in his mind: Lory in a cool bikini, Lory in a cute school uniform, Lory in a seductive short top. Sibin&#x27;s face couldn&#x27;t hide his craving. Sibin raised a hand to scratch his nose and said shamelessly, &quot;Let&#x27;s try the Saintess outfit too.&quot; Lost in thought, he was cut off by the system&#x27;s prompt: &quot;Host, it has appeared.&quot; Sibin angrily yelled at the system, &quot;What the hell are you rushing me for? Instead of making it appear, can&#x27;t you just toss it over to Mimi&#x27;s place and turn it into two for me? This system is driving me crazy.&quot; Sibin took the reward outfit in his hand; it felt smooth and cool to the touch. &quot;Wearing hero-grade equipment like this must be very comfortable. I probably won&#x27;t even need to wear underwear, huh?&quot; Sibin exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>An image of Lory&#x27;s body in a seductive, tight-fitting black lingerie set, her arms open wide for Sibin, appeared in his mind. Just the thought of it made Sibin&#x27;s nose bleed with pleasure. &quot;During the day, the Holy Robe of Vina will turn into a maid dress. At night... well, whatever.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not talking anymore, I&#x27;m going to take a bath.&quot; In the quiet room, a young girl was sound asleep on a luxurious bed. The girl opened her eyes drowsily and wondered, &quot;Where is this?&quot; Roy gently placed her feet on the ground. She walked around, looking at her surroundings, not knowing if this was a dream or reality, but she had never dreamed of a place decorated like this before. Roy pushed the door with her hand, and the large, exquisitely carved door creaked open. She wondered if this door was the way out of the dream.</p>
<p>Roy stepped inside, Inside, Sibin had just finished showering, with only a towel wrapped around his waist. As he was raising his hand to dry his hair, he suddenly saw a girl with white hair. Her small ears and tail were also white. The girl was wearing a knee-length dress with deep, form-fitting cuts. Both of them were surprised.</p>
<p>Roy was deeply shocked, pointed at Sibin, and shouted, &quot;A naked person!&quot; Why would something so perverted appear in her dream, and why is it Lord Eagle Crest? Finishing her words, Roy immediately turned away, covering her flustered face with both hands. Her face flushed red as she thought, &quot;Even so, I can&#x27;t deny he has a really nice body.&quot; Standing before the flustered Roy, Sibin held the towel wrapped around his waist and asked with a smile, &quot;You&#x27;re awake?&quot; Immediately, Roy held her hands out in front of her, shut her eyes tightly, and said loudly, &quot;Her Highness, the Subhuman Saintess Roy, will not be afraid of this nightmare creature!&quot; Roy&#x27;s reaction left Sibin stunned. Roy lunged at Sibin and hugged him tightly. Sibin almost fell backward. She used all her strength to bite Sibin, making him cry out in pain.</p>
<p>He had to tell Roy to stop, even asking if she was born in the year of the dog. Unable to bear the pain, Sibin tightly gripped Roy&#x27;s hands and pinned her to the floor. He told her to snap out of it, that this was the real world, not a dreamscape. Roy stared intently at Sibin and said she didn&#x27;t believe him, that all the liars in dreamscapes say this is the real world. At this moment, Sibin leaned in close to Roy, whose face turned crimson.</p>
<p>To prove his words, Sibin bit her. Roy, in pain, grimaced and screamed. She thought, &quot;So everything is happening for real...&quot; &quot;...real. Then what just happened was so embarrassing.&quot; A hint of confusion flashed in her eyes, her face still blushing with shyness. Sibin looked at Roy lying on the floor and asked, &quot;Do you believe me now?&quot; Roy, with a pouting face, looked away in another direction.</p>
<p>Just then, the system notified Sibin, &quot;Post-story mission: Abduct the Saintess, Humiliate the Saintess has been unlocked. Upon completion, you can participate in one prize draw. Host, please complete it soon.&quot; After hearing this, a sly smile appeared on Sibin&#x27;s face. He thought, &quot;Humiliate the Saintess? Aren&#x27;t I already doing that? The system really gets me.&quot; Sibin immediately reached out and squeezed Roy&#x27;s chest hard. She was startled, then swung her hand and slapped Sibin hard across the face.</p>
<p>The five-finger mark imprinted on his face made Sibin hurt and cry out. Roy covered her chest with her hands, her face annoyed as she called Sibin a pervert. At that moment, Lory arrived with water for her master. Arriving at the door, she heard a strange sound and wondered what it was coming from her master&#x27;s room. Lory was worried and asked, &quot;Master, are you in there? I&#x27;m coming...&quot; &quot;...in.&quot; The call from outside the door made Sibin freeze his hand in front of Roy&#x27;s chest.</p>
<p>Sibin looked at the door in a panic, realizing with some alarm that Lory was outside. Roy was also surprised. Lory pushed the door open and entered, telling Sibin that since Miss Chris wasn&#x27;t there today, she came back a little early. Seeing Sibin just standing there, Lory asked him, &quot;Why are you standing there like a fool?&quot; Sibin blinked, and seeing that Roy was gone, he was bewildered. Lory closed her eyes and sniffed the air.</p>
<p>The little girl smiled and asked Sibin, &quot;Have you been alone in the room this whole time?&quot; She was still holding the plate of food she brought for her master. Sibin quickly raised a hand to scratch his head and explained, &quot;Roy was just here. It&#x27;s just that her state was a bit strange, maybe she couldn&#x27;t distinguish between reality and a dreamscape, but she has probably gone back to her room by...&quot; &quot;...now.&quot; Outside, birds soared in the clear blue sky. The magnificent castle stood silently on its vast grounds. A small bird perched on the windowsill, intently peering around.</p>
<p>It turned out that outside the window, Roy was pressed against a narrow ledge, her back flat against the wall, carefully balancing. Her eyes were shut tight in fear. The small bird flew past, and Roy exclaimed in fear, &quot;This is way too high.&quot; Tears welled up in her eyes, and she gripped tightly with both hands to keep her body balanced. Lory placed two glasses of water on Sibin&#x27;s table and said, &quot;Master, look.&quot; Lory gently touched her dress. &quot;The gift you gave me, Master, it&#x27;s so comfortable to wear.&quot; Sibin&#x27;s eyes crinkled with delight.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, it&#x27;s hero-grade equipment. It&#x27;s extremely comfortable to wear, and it can also transform into different types of clothing. For example, your maid dress. It also has other functions, like being dust-repellent, naturally elegant, and it can even increase your charm. Wearing it, you&#x27;re definitely the most beautiful subhuman girl.&quot; Lory smiled brightly as the outfit gradually transformed into a different dress.</p>
<p>&quot;Really? Are you pleased?&quot; &quot;Of course it&#x27;s true. Our Lory is the best.&quot; Lory recalled Chris&#x27;s words, &quot;increase your charm, then it will be easy to get Master to have a baby with me.&quot; Now is the time to strike while the iron is hot. She had a realization, &quot;I understand, Miss Chris.&quot; Lory suddenly lay prone on the table. &quot;Master.&quot; Sibin gave a clueless smile, &quot;Hmm, what is it?&quot; From Sibin&#x27;s perspective, he could see the little girl&#x27;s bare back and charming bottom. Lory shyly asked him, &quot;This backless sweater, do I look good in it?&quot; Without thinking, Sibin immediately replied, &quot;Extremely beautiful.&quot; Lory said demurely, &quot;Master.</p>
<p>Lory listened to you and has been obediently drinking milk every day.&quot; Sibin covered his mouth with one hand to hide his smile, while patting the little girl&#x27;s head with the other. &quot;Is that so? Lory is so good.&quot; Lory hesitated, &quot;Yes, so...&quot; &quot;...one day Lory will definitely become as voluptuous as Miss Chris, so Master has to wait for me.&quot; He gently pinched Lory&#x27;s cheek, &quot;Ouch, Lory is already charming enough as she is.&quot; Lory then got to the main point, &quot;So, having a baby...&quot; Mentioning this topic felt like a huge rock had been dropped on Sibin&#x27;s head. &quot;We still have to wait, wait until after your birthday. Next time, for sure.&quot; Lory was reluctantly made to lie on the bed. &quot;But Lory wants to.&quot; Sibin tucked the little girl in.</p>
<p>&quot;No, you don&#x27;t want to. It&#x27;s very late, go to sleep now.&quot; Sibin wiped the sweat from his forehead. &quot;Geez, for real, Lory&#x27;s behavior is getting more and more dangerous. What if I really can&#x27;t hold back?&quot; Lory mumbled in her sleep on the bed, &quot;Hee hee, Master, have a baby.&quot; Sibin screamed internally, &quot;Not now! At this rate, I won&#x27;t be able to sleep. I&#x27;ll go get some cold air.</p>
<p>There are still many things to consider. The changes from the Dragon Blood Potion to my body have...&quot; &quot;...begun to emerge. The skill&#x27;s duration is too long, while the cooldown is too short. It hasn&#x27;t been long, and the skill has already refreshed.&quot; Just as he stepped outside, he saw Roy standing still for so long that she was about to freeze into a moving ice block. Sibin cried out in alarm, &quot;Roy, what are you doing? Surely you haven&#x27;t been standing here all night?&quot; Roy was sobbing, &quot;Huhu, it&#x27;s so cold.&quot; She climbed onto the ledge, holding out a hand for Sibin to support her.</p>
<p>&quot;I had no choice. There&#x27;s no way to go from here, but there is a way. You people just wouldn&#x27;t leave.&quot; Sibin chided her, &quot;It&#x27;s so late at night, what were you doing leaving your bedroom?&quot; Sibin blamed himself, &quot;But I really did forget she was still here. Geez, you&#x27;re freezing cold.&quot; Sibin put his arm around her waist to support her. Sibin instructed Roy, &quot;Your body hasn&#x27;t recovered yet.</p>
<p>Hurry back to your room, take a bath, and go to sleep. We can talk about whatever it is tomorrow.&quot; In his arms, Roy&#x27;s cheeks flushed pink. &quot;So warm.&quot; A guard from outside burst through the door to report, &quot;My Lord, a secret message from the royal capital.&quot; As soon as he entered, he saw the scene of Sibin holding Roy and froze at the door, struggling to get out the last word, &quot;...message.&quot; Sibin angrily chased him out, &quot;Get out now!&quot; The result for the person who barged into Sibin&#x27;s room to report was being punished by kneeling on both knees, holding a greatsword. He was crying silently. Sibin shouted, making him jump, &quot;That&#x27;s enough, be quiet!&quot; He put a hand to his forehead and sighed, &quot;Really, why was I so thoughtless as to bring this troublemaker back?&quot; Roy thought to herself, &quot;Why did he drag me here? I missed the chance to ask.&quot; Lory frowned, looking at the person next to her, &quot;Why is she here? Isn&#x27;t she an outsider?&quot; Sibin asked seriously, &quot;Back to the matter at hand, Alunsi, why are you here? You look a mess.&quot; Alunsi replied respectfully, &quot;Young Master Sibin, the king is about to die.</p>
<p>The Pope is plotting a rebellion to take advantage of the situation. The royal capital has been surrounded by the Church&#x27;s army, and the Duke has also been trapped in the capital.&quot; Sibin asked in alarm, &quot;What?&quot; Alunsi elaborated, &quot;Within a short week, using some unknown means, they successively killed many Sky Knights who controlled the royal army. Now, the king&#x27;s military system is in a state of semi-paralysis. Also, Young Master Sibin, your elder brother, Count Hitler, the Golden Lion, has taken refuge with the Church, and with the Pope&#x27;s help, has completely seized the Duke&#x27;s assets.&quot; Sibin froze upon hearing this news. The other person continued, &quot;He even wants to launch a surprise attack on Eagle Crest, to kill you and eliminate the threat for good.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t easy for me to escape from the Duke&#x27;s territory.&quot; Standing behind Sibin, Lory was indignant, &quot;That&#x27;s outrageous! They actually want to harm Master.&quot; Sibin remained calm, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not that easy.&quot; However, he still felt uneasy. &quot;But it&#x27;s strange.&quot; He thought to himself, &quot;Did my dear brother get his head caught in a door? Attacking Eagle Crest, this godforsaken place. Besides the chance to run into some beastmen brothers, what else is there? Why attack Eagle Crest? There are quite a few subhumans here.&quot; He suddenly realized, &quot;He received help from the Church. That&#x27;s right, it might really be because of the subhumans. No wonder people from the Church attacked me time and again before.</p>
<p>I thought it was because I had messed with their people and they came for revenge. Turns out there was another reason. In that case, isn&#x27;t my situation actually very dangerous?&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I just barely escaped the players&#x27; mess, only to be greeted by the Pope&#x27;s rebellion. System, why don&#x27;t you just put me out of my misery.&quot; Seeing Sibin remain silent, Alunsi continued, &quot;Young Master, this is a letter from Marquis Calante to all the lords.&quot; &quot;A secret letter? You&#x27;re tossing it around too casually.&quot; Alunsi knew, &quot;It&#x27;s fine, a normal person wouldn&#x27;t be able to read it anyway.&quot; Indeed, the handwriting on the paper was like a cat&#x27;s scratch. Sibin looked helplessly at the paper.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this a dog&#x27;s chew toy? On the other hand, it&#x27;s very much in the style of the simple-minded, brawny First Prince.&quot; The three of them stared at the letter, not understanding anything. After a moment, Roy realized, &quot;I think this way is correct.&quot; The letter read as follows: &quot;The royal capital is about to fall into enemy hands. I, representing the will of the First Prince, invite all lords to Ash Rock Ridge to participate in a round table conference. Together, we will discuss an alliance to deal with the Pope. I hope all of you understand the urgency of the matter.</p>
<p>The First Prince and I will wait at Ash Rock Ridge for five days. The fall of the royal capital is only the beginning. The Church&#x27;s Holy Knights will sooner or later step into your territories.&quot; Sibin held the letter and gave a forced smile. &quot;This threatening letter basically has only one meaning: the First Prince is going to war, are you coming to help or not? If you don&#x27;t come, you&#x27;ll face the consequences when you get attacked later...&quot; &quot;...yourself.&quot; Alunsi asked for Sibin&#x27;s opinion, &quot;So, are we going or not?&quot; Sibin analyzed clearly, &quot;We definitely have to go. Not because of the threat from that warmonger Calante, nor does it have anything to do with the First Prince, but because the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p>
<p>We have a common enemy.&quot; The paper floated to the ground. Sibin continued seriously, &quot;The Church of Bana.&quot; Roy stood nearby, thinking to herself, is it okay for me to hear this? A servant reported, Young Master Sibin, this is some information I obtained from a detective in the royal capital. It&#x27;s related to the Church, and also related to the subhumans. Roy was alarmed. This matter...</p>
<p>it&#x27;s actually related to the subhumans. She hurriedly asked Sibin, What is the news? Sibin calmed her, Don&#x27;t be anxious, let me take a look. On the paper was a clear title: Paradise Plan. Inside a certain castle, a loud cry echoed, What... what on earth are you people doing? Let go.</p>
<p>That cry for help belonged to a subhuman whose hands were bound by two priests, being escorted somewhere, with a man leading the way in front. The female subhuman was led to an iron room, the outside of which was covered by a large white cloth. The woman pleaded continuously, Don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t kill me, I beg you. Regardless of her pleas, the group of priests still threw her into the room. The subhuman, thrown in unexpectedly, screamed loudly, Ah! They warned her, Don&#x27;t make a noise, get in.</p>
<p>The subhuman saw something, her eyes widening in trembling fear. In front of her were many other subhumans, sticking out their tongues and looking at her greedily. Their eyes glowed bright red, just like vultures waiting for their prey. Next, only the piercing scream of the subhuman was heard as before. She screamed continuously, Don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t come here, get away, argh! The ones who escorted her didn&#x27;t pay any attention, acting calmly as if this wasn&#x27;t the first time they had done this.</p>
<p>This female subhuman slave is lucky this time. When it was over, the corpse of that subhuman was thrown onto the pile of other subhuman corpses. The two priests, having finished their work, calmly stepped out from that pile of corpses. Wherever their feet went, red bloody footprints were imprinted on the floor. It&#x27;s true, she&#x27;s basically considered intact, not torn to shreds by that drugged-up crazy mob.</p>
<p>On Sibin&#x27;s side, they were still tensely discussing the matter, Young Master Sibin, according to the information you gave me before. I thought the Church produced Templar Knights through the fresh blood of young female subhumans, having gotten a taste for it. Alunsi spoke seriously about this issue, but it seems because the conversion rate is quite low, they now intend to start researching the subhumans themselves, including genetics. Sibin cursed inwardly, Damn it, I thought that underground level was already the limit, I didn&#x27;t expect the Church&#x27;s insane ambition to once again redefine my understanding. Roy asked, Wait a minute, you mean, they use the blood of subhumans to create Templar Knights? How can that be? Lory whispered into Sibin&#x27;s ear, Master, is this true? Lory is so scared.</p>
<p>Sibin reassured her, Don&#x27;t be afraid, I won&#x27;t let this kind of thing happen in my territory. Yes, Master. With that said, Lory shook Alunsi&#x27;s arm, First, I&#x27;ll take Alunsi to rest, and I&#x27;ll take care of him while I&#x27;m at it. Sibin pondered, So my elder brother Hitler wants to attack Eagle Crest, not because he&#x27;s brainless, but more than half of the reason is the Pope&#x27;s orders. Perhaps, the damn lord from my past life also hunted subhumans everywhere because of the Pope&#x27;s orders, with his own desires being only part of the reason.</p>
<p>While lost in thought, the system suddenly appeared. Host has activated stage four mission: Capture female subhuman slaves, promote the Subhuman Slavery Convention. Ding, Saintess Roy detected to be alive. Zzt, zzt, mission is changing. Zzt, thus, ding, host only needs to complete the capture of over one hundred female subhuman slaves.</p>
<p>This mission is a death plot, Host, please be prepared. Sibin looked towards Roy, full of worry. The system&#x27;s story mission actually changed, and it was because of Roy. But not needing to promote the Subhuman Slavery Convention, that&#x27;s a good thing. What&#x27;s left is capturing female subhuman slaves.</p>
<p>By now, the Paradise Plan must have already spread. I&#x27;m afraid that more and more subhumans hiding in the shadows will flee to Eastgrave Town, at times like these. If I follow the system&#x27;s request to capture female subhuman slaves, I&#x27;ll just become a great villain, the enemy of the subhumans in everyone&#x27;s eyes. Who would believe that the real demon is actually the Church? Sibin had a headache, lightly rubbing his temples. Is this a return to the previous life? The current Saintess is clearly here.</p>
<p>It would be great if Roy could convince the subhumans to follow me directly. Those who can&#x27;t awaken their abilities can just find any job to make a living. Those who can awaken their abilities can be organized into a special branch of power. The problem is, that guy Ye Hao will definitely prevent things from developing this way. Sigh, since this life is related to the Church, and the mission belongs to the system, then it must also be related to Ye Hao, right? Ye Hao is in this.</p>
<p>What role do I have to play this time? While drifting in his own thoughts, someone suddenly called his name loudly, startling him, Lord Eagle Crest. He answered instinctively, Huh? Roy, you should go rest too. I still have things to do, I can&#x27;t sleep with you tonight. Roy blushed, Who was talking about that? What do you mean by tonight? Roy leaned in close to ask Sibin, You just said you wouldn&#x27;t let this kind of thing happen in your territory, right? Sibin nodded, Yes, I said that. Why? Roy suddenly knelt down, I beg you, save the subhumans.</p>
<p>If you can save them, I am willing to do anything for you. Sibin glanced over at her, smiling faintly, Really, anything at all? He moved closer to Roy, How about this? Roy was flustered, You. She thought to herself, could it be that he wants me to offer myself to him? Roy suddenly shot up, causing her head to hit Sibin&#x27;s jaw. Wait, wait, let me think about it. Sibin, whose chin was hit unexpectedly, cried out, Ouch.</p>
<p>Sibin got a nosebleed and glared at her, Ugh, what are you doing? I just wanted to say that after this is successful, I want you to become my maid. Roy froze, A maid. She knelt down, I&#x27;m, I&#x27;m sorry, how about I help you stop the bleeding? At the mayor&#x27;s residence in Divine Light Town, Ye Hao was standing before his desk when he heard the sound of footsteps approaching from behind. He raised his sword warily, Who? The one approaching was the succubus Sia. She licked her finger, Your Excellency Ye Hao, looking so fierce and brandishing your sword like that, you&#x27;re making little Sia a bit scared, you know.</p>
<p>Ye Hao looked at her defensively, Hmph, I&#x27;ve never invited a guest like you. I invite you to get off my territory. He thought to himself, I was horribly screwed over by a demon last time. I can&#x27;t believe this bitch still dares to come find me. Even if you&#x27;re going to fleece a sheep, you should at least find a different one to fleece.</p>
<p>She writhed, Ooh, ooh, ooh, my, my, when you first summoned me, you even called me little Sia. Now you&#x27;re being so rude, you&#x27;re breaking my heart. Ye Hao watched her writhe helplessly, That&#x27;s because last time I didn&#x27;t know your filthy nature, you even screwed over the human you were cooperating with. She calmly sat on the chair and crossed her legs, We demons naturally don&#x27;t need to follow any rules when dealing with humanity, but Your Excellency Ye Hao, you are now a half-demon, you have the qualifications to make a fair deal with us. His sore spot having been touched, he drove her away, I don&#x27;t want to make a deal with you, get lost.</p>
<p>She remained shameless, We are very sincere this time, Your Excellency Ye Hao. You can consider it for a bit before you speak. She waved her hand, and a purple light emanated from her palm, forming a small array on the table. This is a peak master-grade longsword. If not for a few side effects, in terms of power, even a hero-grade weapon would not surpass it.</p>
<p>If Your Excellency Ye Hao agrees to cooperate with us, this longsword will be yours. And, and if you want Sia, Lord Fenton will also agree. The system screen displayed, Demon Sword Bateo Queen, a master-grade demon sword. After being filled with demonic energy, it is incredibly sharp. It can combat aura and magic shields to a certain extent, and has an extremely strong suppressive effect against light-type protection skills.</p>
<p>Note, once Bateo Queen is bound to its owner, it must consume one pure soul every seven days, otherwise it will devour the owner&#x27;s soul as food. Ye Hao calculated, I haven&#x27;t had any breakthroughs in my skills recently, and I only have a stupid set of grandmaster-grade equipment. I lack a weapon that matches my strength. This thing is good, and the side effects are acceptable. A soul, huh? I can just find some wild beast and kill it.</p>
<p>Even if there are some requirements for the soul, even if it means killing people, that&#x27;s acceptable. After all, he is an intruder, with no connection to this world. Finally, he agreed to the deal, This thing isn&#x27;t bad, what do you guys want? Sia smiled smugly, Very simple. She moved closer to Ye Hao, Using your current prestige among the subhuman race, we need you to periodically deliver subhumans into the abyss teleportation array. Ye Hao lay down to let Sia sit on his stomach, but his mouth still asked, You demons can travel back and forth in the human world, why don&#x27;t you do this kind of thing yourselves? The succubus Sia replied with a flirtatious expression, We can travel in the material plane, but our strength will be weakened, and if we happen to encounter a judge from the Church of Light, then we&#x27;d be finished.</p>
<p>He sat up straight, hugging Sia, But what&#x27;s the use of you capturing subhumans who can&#x27;t even truss a chicken? She leaned close to Ye Hao&#x27;s ear, I suppose I can tell you this. Coincidentally, Lord Fenton discovered the existence of a powerful ancient divinity on the bodies of subhumans. And it&#x27;s absolutely not the low-level divinity of a wild god, it&#x27;s just that the amount of divinity on different subhumans varies. He wondered, Divinity. That&#x27;s right, the subhuman named Roy from last time had very strong divinity on her.</p>
<p>Lord Fenton originally wanted to perfectly devour this divinity to enhance his own strength. Unfortunately, he still failed in the end, so now Lord Fenton can only capture more subhumans and take the divinity in their bodies as a substitute. Ye Hao gave a cunning smile, So that&#x27;s how it is. This cooperation, I agree, but the conditions aren&#x27;t enough, you have to add more. Sia breathed hotly onto Ye Hao&#x27;s face, What more do you want? How about Sia serves you? Ye Hao suddenly pushed her off of him, Do you think I&#x27;m still someone who can be easily seduced now? Save your service for your master Fenton.</p>
<p>Pushed away unexpectedly, she yelled in Ye Hao&#x27;s face, You actually. Ye Hao glared, My condition is, give me a squad of Horned Demon Overseers. I need more power to attack the beastman tribe. On the streets, many flyers were scattered with the title Subhuman Park, a place providing unlimited fun for fellow subhumans. unlimited.</p>
<p>A certain subhuman finished reading the flyer and looked left and right. This female subhuman asked a passerby, Hello everyone, I&#x27;m Xiao Xue. This gentleman, do you know where Subhuman Park is? Subhuman Park. He frowned, What place is that? I&#x27;ve never heard of it. The female subhuman happily explained, Oh, haven&#x27;t you received the propaganda leaflet? The powerful awakened one, Lady Anna, relied on her own strength to successfully negotiate terms with the Church of the Colonia Empire.</p>
<p>The Church agreed to gift the entire Eastgrave Town to Lady Anna to govern, making it a home for subhumans. There, we won&#x27;t have to worry about food and clothing, we&#x27;ll be free and at ease, with fine delicacies every day. The more she spoke, the more captivated the passerby became. Most importantly, Lady Anna has grasped the correct method for subhumans to awaken. Any subhuman who comes to Eastgrave Town can receive the best education, and if their talent is sufficient, they will be able to awaken their bloodline power.</p>
<p>The male subhuman passerby found this very appealing, Awaken bloodline power, is that for real? The little girl with him was also overjoyed, wow, is there really such a place? Of course it&#x27;s real, my friends have all gone to the park, but I was just delayed for a bit due to some personal reasons. The subhuman man hesitated, not knowing if going now would still give him a chance to have his awakening ability tested by Lady Anna, and he also hesitated, if his little sister Bai Ya went with him. she would have a better chance at education and awakening, but such a good thing, suddenly. Their conversation was suddenly interrupted by a masked person, are you looking for the way to the Subhuman Park? The subhuman man was anxious, you know where it is? The masked person enthusiastically gave directions, of course, Eastgrave Town is right next door, I was just returning from buying materials for the Awakening Assembly. If you want to go, I can take you with me.</p>
<p>The subhuman girl was excited, That&#x27;s great, the subhuman man&#x27;s sister urged her big brother, brother, why don&#x27;t we go together. The subhuman man was still hesitant, but, the passersby were in an uproar, it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s Her Highness the Saintess, Her Highness the Saintess is back. Everyone turned around, Her Highness the Saintess, but, but why is Her Highness the Saintess with the army of Eagle Crest. Roy was walking down the street with Grimmon when she heard a voice call out, Saintess big sister. As soon as she turned around, a very adorable little subhuman girl rushed to hug her waist.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re back, Bai Ya missed you so much, She said, Bai Ya, you. She was halfway through her sentence when someone pulled Bai Ya back forcefully and said: Bai Ya, come back right now, we have to go. Bai Ya turned to look at her brother, bewildered and not understanding what was happening, seeing the person approach, Roy said:. Oto, where are you two going? Bai Ya spread her arms and said with a bright smile:. We&#x27;re going to Eastgrave Town, there&#x27;s a Subhuman Park there, many subhumans live there very happily.</p>
<p>Even talented subhumans can successfully awaken their abilities. Saintess big sister, come with us. Hearing this, Roy was startled and asked again: Eastgrave Town, a park? At this point, she gritted her teeth and thought coldly:. As expected. She recalled her conversation with Sibin, she wanted to save the subhumans.</p>
<p>Roy knelt down and said sincerely:. As long as I can save them, no matter what you want me to do, I am willing. Seeing Roy kneel, Sibin blurted out:. You. Then he gave a sly smile, came closer, and lifted Roy&#x27;s chin with his hand, saying: You guessed what I wanted to ask, so you deliberately said that, right? Are you looking forward to it? Hearing this, Roy&#x27;s face turned red and she said shyly: You, I&#x27;m being serious.</p>
<p>Sibin asked her in return:. Is that so, what if the price is to harm the subhumans? price? Hearing this, Roy was surprised and questioned:. Harm? At this moment, Sibin said seriously:. If you want to save the subhumans, you must do as I say, whether you are willing or not. Thinking of this, Roy made up her mind and said to the butler.</p>
<p>Grimmon: Arrest them all. The subhumans were alarmed upon hearing this:. What? Grimmon raised his hand and signaled the soldiers: Move. The subhumans were tied up, some lifted up, crying. Vansin said: Your Highness the Saintess, why is this happening? Help, save us, we don&#x27;t want to be captured by the Lord of Eagle Crest.</p>
<p>Sob sob sob, Bai Ya also called out in alarm:. Saintess big sister. Roy&#x27;s face was completely flushed at this moment, she closed her eyes, clasped her hands and thought:. I&#x27;m sorry, everyone must endure, only in this way, can I ensure you all escape a terrible fate. Sibin was currently sitting in a flying carriage in the sky, he smiled and said: Leaving Divine Light Town to Roy should be no problem, after all, she has Grimmon to help her.</p>
<p>Lory, sitting beside him, asked: Master, why didn&#x27;t you bring Mr. Grimmon along to meet the Crown Prince at Greystone Ridge? Sibin replied: They have other things to do, besides, this time the nobles are gathering here, it&#x27;s the Crown Prince who requested our aid, there won&#x27;t be any danger. A moment later, the carriage arrived, This was a prosperous and bustling city, on the streets, people were hawking their wares animatedly. Does anyone need a guide? For just five copper coins, I&#x27;ll take you to enjoy the scenery all over Greystone Ridge. Come and see, come and see, freshly made booster potions here, reasonable price, and it comes with a free bottle of stamina potion.</p>
<p>The greaves of Ambassador Caris of Greystone City, usable by both mages and knights, only one left. Sibin was currently holding Lory&#x27;s hand, strolling happily through the streets. Lory looked around curiously at everything:. Master, the nights in Greystone City are so lively. Sibin could only sigh and think to himself:.</p>
<p>Eagle Crest is truly a place where birds don&#x27;t even bother to shit. Look at this place, Although there aren&#x27;t an extreme number of mages, in terms of density, it&#x27;s definitely no less than the knights in Lan Dong City. Suddenly, Lory&#x27;s face flushed red as she pointed and said:. Ah, Ma, Master, that is. Hearing this, Sibin looked in the direction she was pointing.</p>
<p>It was a nobleman holding a leash tied to the neck of a subhuman crawling on the ground, wearing a very sexy pink nightgown. Seeing this scene, Sibin could only curse inwardly: Holy shit, it really is a big city, they play rough. He noticed Lory&#x27;s reaction next to him was a bit off, so he looked over. Lory, why are you looking over there with such admiring eyes? He only thought this but didn&#x27;t dare to ask, lest she demand to imitate it, and also, that guy is. As he looked over, the nobleman also looked at him.</p>
<p>He smiled brightly and said:. Look who it is, long time no see, Count Sibin, the second son of the Golden Lion family. Sibin smiled and replied:. Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince. After greeting him, he thought to himself: Crown Prince Beloflin.</p>
<p>That night, the moon was very full and beautiful, in the bedroom, Lory was wearing a very sexy outfit. She was pressing on top of Sibin, saying coquettishly:. Master, Lory still wants to kiss. Sibin lay properly, his face flushed red, and said:. The illusory holy garment isn&#x27;t for you to play like this.</p>
<p>Saying that, he sat up and kissed Lory&#x27;s forehead, saying:. I really don&#x27;t know what to do with you. She was a little shy but not satisfied, so she pushed Sibin down on the bed and said:. You can&#x27;t just kiss my forehead, Master is being perfunctory again. Sibin laughed and said: As expected, it&#x27;s not enough, huh.</p>
<p>Lory proactively pushed him down and kissed him on the lips, the two of them embraced and kissed passionately. A moment later, he stroked her head and asked:. Is that enough now? It seemed Lory was still not satisfied, he thought to himself:. If this continues, I&#x27;m really going to fire the gun. Lory propped herself up and protested:.</p>
<p>But Master, Lory wants. Sibin flicked her forehead, cutting her off:. You&#x27;re not allowed to want, this isn&#x27;t Lan Dong City. Besides, we have to attend the round table conference tomorrow. Hearing this, Lory was annoyed and recalled Chris&#x27;s words: if you get rejected again next time, just say this.</p>
<p>Then she leaned in and whispered to Sibin:. Master, is it true that you really can&#x27;t perform? Hearing this, Sibin&#x27;s face darkened, not bothering to refute it. The next morning, in the council chamber, the Crown Prince spoke up: Let&#x27;s begin now, those who wanted to attend the conference are all here now, as for those who didn&#x27;t want to come, there&#x27;s no need to wait any longer. You all must have heard, His Majesty the King has returned to the embrace of the Lord Bakda. Currently, the Colon Empire has a third legendary-level powerhouse.</p>
<p>The Pope is now plotting to usurp the royal authority, unify royal power and divine right, to become the sole dictator of the Colon Empire. I believe you have all heard more or less about the Church&#x27;s way of doing things, although we both worship Lord Bakda, the people of the Church are, from beginning to end, lunatics. Hearing this, everyone started murmuring:. How can that be? Sibin looked over and thought to himself:. What a top-tier description.</p>
<p>He pondered: Not having a legendary-level powerhouse means losing the power to intimidate surrounding nations. And now the Pope is plotting to usurp the throne, significantly weakening the last vestiges of the Colon Empire&#x27;s strength, what is the best course of action? If the Colon Empire is invaded by another empire. I&#x27;m afraid the first to suffer will be us lords. Someone suggested:. Why don&#x27;t we just gather our money and run.</p>
<p>At this moment, a shout was heard:. Silence. It startled everyone who was murmuring. Sibin, however, had no reaction. The big-nosed, pot-bellied man said:.</p>
<p>Look at the state of you all, do you still look like glorious imperial nobles. A bunch of trash. The Crown Prince laughed and intervened:. Alright, Calante, it&#x27;s time to tell everyone the good news. Hearing this, the big-nosed, pot-bellied man explained:.</p>
<p>Although the Pope is very well-prepared, it will still take time to take down the royal capital, and now with so many lords united like this, it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s no chance of victory. No joke, a group of Outlanders who can endlessly resurrect has also reached a cooperation with the Crown Prince, they will help us crush the Church&#x27;s most numerous core forces. Hearing this, Sibin was immediately startled and surprised. Everyone began to discuss:. Infinite resurrection, isn&#x27;t that even more terrifying than the undead sao? The Crown Prince then spoke:.</p>
<p>Please invite those Outlanders in. A servant replied:. Yes. Sibin was questioning in his heart:. Outlanders who can endlessly resurrect, no matter how you hear it, it sounds just like players, huh.</p>
<p>The conference room door opened, and a group of five people walked in, led by a person in a trendy green frog costume who spoke up to greet them: Good day, Your Highness the Prince. Good day, my lords. After saying that, he glanced at Sibin and whispered:. Good day, Lord of Eagle Crest, we meet again. Seeing this, Sibin smiled without saying anything.</p>
<p>He thought to himself: How did this damn group of players silently contact the royal capital? Weren&#x27;t they supposed to have returned to Divine Light Town. Sibin stared at the group of players, pondering:. What the hell do these damn players want to do? Could it be that after the failed attack on Lan Dong City, these player representatives learned a painful lesson, gave up the main quest of killing the lord and saving the saintess, and started looking for a new way out for the players? At this moment, the people around were murmuring:. Bakda, above, Calante is too big. Silence, as mentioned before, the main source of the Church&#x27;s military power is a few nobles and the royal legions that have defected to the Pope.</p>
<p>Their numbers are extremely huge. But now that we have these resurrecting Outlanders, it can be considered that they have helped us solve this difficult problem. The most important purpose of summoning you all here today is to deal with another branch of the Church&#x27;s forces, the Templar Knights. Hearing this, a person raised his hand and said:. Wait a minute, Lord Calante, as far as I know, the number of Templar Knights is less than 100, even if they are all Earth Knights.</p>
<p>Casually sending a marquis from a central territory would be enough to easily suppress them, where is the need to use so many of our troops? Calante closed his eyes and said with a sarcastic smile:. Fool, go back and check if your territory&#x27;s spies are spending all day gathering intelligence on women. 100 Templar Knights was a year ago, now the Church&#x27;s Templar Knights number close to 1000. In addition, they have at least 30 who are Sky Knights. The person who spoke was alarmed and stood up, saying:.</p>
<p>Th-thirty Sky Knights, how is that possible? The others also began to worry and murmur:. That&#x27;s more than three times the number of Sky Knights in the royal army. Calante spoke up and asked: Frog, uh, Your Excellency Scheming Frog, can you Outlanders reach Greystone City within half a month? After asking, he also wearily thought to himself: what kind of name is that? The player Scheming Frog listened attentively then smiled and replied: We Outlanders have very few means of transportation, but we will try to gather quickly and head towards Greystone City. Hearing this, Calante said: If that&#x27;s the case, we at Greystone City will dispatch mages to help you build a temporary teleportation circle. You can come directly through the circle, but you must be quick, the teleportation circle&#x27;s consumption is extremely high, meaning even Greystone City cannot sustain it for too long.</p>
<p>Scheming Frog replied: In that case, I am truly grateful for your benevolence. The Crown Prince, who had been thinking, just listened with a faint smile. Seeing this, Sibin thought to himself, what a smug look, if it weren&#x27;t for these special circumstances, he would never tolerate this uncontrollable bunch of players. after some time discussing the plan, the meeting also ended. Sibin slowly walked towards the door, thinking to himself, it&#x27;s finally over, next up.</p>
<p>As he was thinking and stepped out the door, he saw a group of players, let&#x27;s see what this bunch of players who don&#x27;t know their own limits wants to do. Seeing Sibin come out, Scheming Frog greeted him, long time no see, Lord Eagle Crest. Sibin smiled and replied, it hasn&#x27;t been that long, just a bit unexpected. Why have you all appeared here, and even specially ambushing me here, surely you don&#x27;t want to drag me into the woods to play games, do you? The male players heard this and angrily said, who would want to, are you crazy, you guy. while the female players blushed and discussed among themselves, I think it&#x27;s fine, after all, Lord Eagle Crest is very, right? Hearing this, Scheming Frog&#x27;s face darkened and he interrupted the chattering crowd, let&#x27;s talk business, I heard you are blatantly capturing subhumans, I want to know why you are doing that.</p>
<p>Sibin smiled and said, if I said it was to protect the subhumans, would you believe me? I&#x27;m telling you the Church is capturing subhumans for experiments. Do you believe me? Hearing this, the players all started talking at once, what, protect subhumans, are you bullshitting? Seeing this, Sibin walked straight ahead, pushing the players aside, making them stumble left and right, saying, you were the ones who asked, and when I answer you don&#x27;t believe me, then good dogs shouldn&#x27;t block the way. One of the players who fell said angrily, what the hell, he even pushed me, as expected, this guy can&#x27;t be telling the truth. Scheming Frog just rubbed his head, it was unclear what he was thinking. When Sibin returned to his room, Lory, wearing a maid outfit, enthusiastically greeted him, Master, you&#x27;re back.</p>
<p>Then she rushed into his arms and said, Lory has been missing you, Master, so much that I was about to die. Seeing this, Sibin could only cough dryly. At this moment, a servant interrupted their reunion, I&#x27;m sorry to disturb you, Your Excellency the Count, His Highness the Prince requests your presence. Sibin asked in confusion, right after the meeting just ended? Lory, having just reunited with her master only to be interrupted, angrily puffed her cheeks and hugged Sibin tightly, looking extremely adorable. The servant spoke fearfully, oh, I&#x27;m terribly sorry.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s probably not anything bad, His Highness the Prince has already met with four other lords, you are the fifth. That&#x27;s right, your maid may also come along. Hearing this, Lory&#x27;s attitude changed immediately. Sibin thought to himself, aha. He&#x27;s just acting as if he&#x27;s about to become king, wanting to recruit some potential nobles, so confident.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s already considering matters of his ascension before the war has even started. Hearing she was allowed to go, Lory hugged Sibin tightly and asked coquettishly, can I, Master? He smiled and replied, of course. Worthy of being called the star of the empire, Count Eagle Crest was accepted as a disciple by Lord Sadin. At 20 years old, he already possesses the strength of a Sky Knight. His Highness Prince Balovern raised his wine glass, offering praise to Sibin.</p>
<p>He humbly replied, you are too kind, who would dare to accept such praise from His Highness the Prince . The arrogant prince, sitting on his throne, sipped a glass of red wine while using a petite maid as a footstool. The small girl trembled, not daring to resist. I greatly admire a talented youth like Count Eagle Crest, perhaps it is with the guidance of Lord Barda that we are able to meet in the inner city. Sibin sat upright in his chair, observing this very royal luncheon, I&#x27;m a little curious.</p>
<p>So this is the prince&#x27;s style of luncheon, or is it because of Lory&#x27;s presence that he thinks I like this sort of thing, either way, it&#x27;s unsettling. Then, as a prince of the Colon Empire, I must also make a gesture. As he spoke, he stepped on the beautiful elf&#x27;s neck. The girl cried silently, holding back the pain as tears streamed down her face. The prince heard the girl&#x27;s soft whimpers, frowned, and pulled the chain around her neck tighter.</p>
<p>This is an elf maiden that General Calante captured at the Jade Border. Although she&#x27;s not any rare species. He trailed off, recalling the scene at that time, but back then, she snuck into the stronghold alone, assassinating over 80 soldiers and two of my Great Earth Knights. Luckily, as she was leaving the stronghold, she foolishly stepped on a trap, and that&#x27;s how we caught her, she almost pulled it off. And yet not a single soldier could fight her, she was still untouched, her magic power has been sealed.</p>
<p>After capturing her, I just had people torture and whip her for a month. The prince tightened the collar&#x27;s rope, as long as you like her, this top-quality elf slave will be yours, not a bad collector&#x27;s item, right? Sibin truly felt insulted, he was indeed being seen as one of this guy&#x27;s kind. He tactfully refused the prince&#x27;s offer, no, how could I take away His Highness the Prince&#x27;s toy. Lory, sitting beside him, was trembling nonstop . The prince seemed to have other intentions, no need to be so polite.</p>
<p>He said cheerfully, if you really mind, ah, that&#x27;s right. Saying so, he pointed towards Lory, then let&#x27;s trade yours for mine, what do you think? Lory was speechless, not daring to protest. I&#x27;m very interested in your maid, if you are willing to give her to me, I can grant you one condition, a fiefdom, weapons, an army, I can grant you anything. Sibin was truly furious. He smiled gently, but a few cracks appeared on the wine glass in his hand.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry, Your Highness the Prince, I must refuse. Everyone has their own way of playing, I still cherish my maid very much, without her care, I would be very troubled. The prince acted as if he understood, oh, so Count Eagle Crest is that kind of person, I understand, I understand. He released his hand, letting the elf maiden catch her breath, but that&#x27;s not important, I can still give this elf slave to you. He generously offered her to him.</p>
<p>Sibin still adamantly refused, thank you for your kind intentions, Your Highness, but the Eagle Crest fief is a borderland, war could break out at any time, we must constantly maintain high alert. It&#x27;s better not to indulge too much. His meaning was very clear, go give her to someone else, don&#x27;t push her onto me. Suddenly, Lory, sitting beside him, looked down. A thin, pale hand was struggling to reach out and touch her leg.</p>
<p>The prince, looking disappointed, said, is that so, then I guess I&#x27;ll just have to throw her into the barracks&#x27; infirmary at the Jade Border. The pink-haired elf maiden tearfully mouthed for Lory to understand, save, save me, please. Lory suddenly began to cry uncontrollably. She fell into a dreamscape, it was the World Tree, a scene of widespread slaughter, elves, spirits, soldiers, civilians, it was impossible to tell who was who. Lory&#x27;s emotions fell into a deep pit of despair, like a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Sibin noticed Lory&#x27;s abnormality, he softly called out to her to wake her from the dreamscape. Lory suddenly mustered her courage and asked the prince, that, um, may I ask, Your Highness, if she is thrown into the barracks&#x27; infirmary, what will happen to her? The expression on his face turned savage, I&#x27;m not sure either, but those wounded soldiers hate elves the most. Perhaps she won&#x27;t even last a few days in there before being tortured to death, or maybe she&#x27;ll be chopped into pieces and fed to the dogs, who knows, ha ha. Balovern said perceptively, your maid seems interested in this slave, do you want to reconsider and take her in? he said while pulling the collar tight. Although Sibin didn&#x27;t understand, he still accepted the gesture, in that case, thank you for the gift, Your Highness the Prince.</p>
<p>Balovern happily swirled his wine glass, you really do dote on that maid of yours. Leaving the prince&#x27;s luxurious room with the elf slave, Sibin felt more relaxed. He tied the elf maiden onto the back of the large bird, this should be fine, the skill I learned from the round-faced little sister is useful after all. He turned around and saw Lory still standing there waiting for him, what&#x27;s wrong Lory, didn&#x27;t I tell you to get on first and wait for me? He was worried her legs would get tired from waiting, and that talking with that Balovern guy earlier must have made her very tense and scared. Lory stammered, um, that, th-that.</p>
<p>After a while, she finally managed to say what she meant, Ma-Master, Lory has caused trouble for you. She was extremely worried. Sibin didn&#x27;t care that much, he swept Lory up into his arms and gave her a deep kiss, isn&#x27;t it just selling a favor? It&#x27;s no big deal, anyway, if he didn&#x27;t give me the elf, he would have given me something else, if I hadn&#x27;t accepted, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to leave Greystone City. Before Lory could come to her senses, he had already placed her down on the seat. Lory blushed and chided, Master, honestly, we&#x27;re on a main road.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so embarrassing. Sibin smiled brightly, then let&#x27;s continue when we get home. Lory said happily, make a baby when we get home, Master? Ugh, except for that, Lory. The large bird spread its wings and flew away from Greystone City, carrying the man and woman, along with the still unconscious elf maiden. Meanwhile, in the middle of a forest, a subhuman named Medua was trembling behind a bush, what should I do, what should I do, what should I do.</p>
<p>All around were shouts urging, move it, don&#x27;t dawdle. Ahead was the Saintess&#x27;s carriage convoy, the Saintess was actually leading human soldiers to capture subhumans, I can&#x27;t stay here any longer. She spread some maps on the ground, confused, but besides Divine Light Town, where else can I go, ah. She happily grabbed a piece of paper. That&#x27;s right, the Subhuman Park.</p>
<p>So there is a way to survive. She sat down to study the map. Hmm, I see, I just need to go to Eastgrave Town, then, blah blah. Absorbed in studying the map, she didn&#x27;t notice two big brothers had returned and were standing behind her. Hey, isn&#x27;t this a child from Divine Light Town? Little one, why did you run all the way here by yourself? She ran over crying, big brother Ling, boo hoo hoo.</p>
<p>She recounted what she had just seen to the two of them. Everyone was captured by Lord Eagle Crest, even Saintess Tùy has been brainwashed. How could something so absurd happen? The two of them couldn&#x27;t believe their ears. But, but Medua knows, Eastgrave Town has a Subhuman Park. We can find a powerful awakened subhuman to help us, and beg that great lord to save everyone.</p>
<p>Little one, slow down, what Eastgrave Town? A while later at the Subhuman Park, the atmosphere here was extremely lively. Everything was peaceful and happy, as if the outside world had no effect on this place. Everywhere were invitations, please have a cup of this honey water. Welcome to the Subhuman Park. The three people with their strange appearance entered the park, surprising the greeter at the gate.</p>
<p>S-sorry, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve seen such strange... ah no, such special subhumans. The two big brothers were also awkward, it&#x27;s nothing, we&#x27;ll handle it ourselves. We&#x27;ve traveled a long way from the northern lands, through wind and dew, so our fur and hair are a bit shabby. &quot; The gatekeeper had to suppress her emotions, mainly because the demi-human girl was too ugly; it was the first time she had seen someone so ugly.</p>
<p>Of course, she only dared to think this to herself. &quot;So that&#x27;s how it is, but don&#x27;t worry, the demi-human park will help you. First, let us take you to have a meal. &quot; The gatekeeper led the guests while introducing the surroundings, but the two of them didn&#x27;t hear a single word. &quot;Hey, have you noticed anything? Yeah, even going to eat, we&#x27;re accompanied by strange, masked soldiers.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s really suspicious.&quot; The three of them tried to act as naturally as possible, sitting down at the table for a sumptuous meal. &quot;Doesn&#x27;t it feel unreasonable? It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re treating criminals.&quot; &quot;Speaking of unreasonable, the park&#x27;s propaganda has been completely unreasonable from the very beginning. This right now is clearly to prevent the demi-humans from running away.&quot; Medua, as if starved, ignored the two&#x27;s discussion, her eyes shining as she looked at the hot food being laid out before her. A clear voice came from a distance. &quot;Hello, new compatriots.&quot; It was a hot, red-haired demi-human; she seemed to be a waitress here.</p>
<p>&quot;I am your person-in-charge, Chia. From now on, I will be your guide, teaching you how to live in Eastgrave Town and what rules you must follow.&quot; Chia, wearing a seductive red dress, walked over. &quot;After everyone has eaten their fill, I will take you to participate in the town-welcoming ceremony here. By the way, you can also meet our leader, Lady Anna. She is revered by the human church as Phục Oa.&quot; The surrounding demi-humans were overjoyed.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve finally escaped that dreadful Eagle Crest Fief. This really is the demi-human park, it&#x27;s all real. Only a leader who even the human church respects could establish this park.&quot; The three of them remained silent. Chia responded cheerfully, &quot;Aiya, it seems everyone is eager to meet Phục Oa, aren&#x27;t you?&quot; Cheers erupted from all around, &quot;Yes, yes, exactly.&quot; &quot;Then everyone, please finish your meal quickly and follow me. That lady is in the cathedral, earnestly wanting to meet you all.&quot; Chia&#x27;s expression became frightening.</p>
<p>The towering cathedral behind her seemed to be emitting some kind of charm, hiding a mysterious secret waiting to be discovered. Throughout the city, there were clouds of crimson gas everywhere. On the stage, Anna spread her arms and said, &quot;Welcome, everyone, to Eastgrave Town.&quot; &quot;In the future, this place will become your home. I am a subordinate of the gods, a handmaiden of fire, Anna. You can also call me Phục Oa.</p>
<p>However, to live in this park, you must offer a part of your own power. Your blood, body, and soul will all bring joy to our Lord. Are you willing to offer your all to the Lord?&quot; She wore a red dress with a slit that exposed half a leg all the way to her waist, and with her sensual gaze and alluring lips, it made people stare, unable to look away. The demi-humans below, after hearing her speak, responded with great excitement and enthusiasm, &quot;We are willing! For the glory of demi-humans, for the future of demi-humans!&quot; But there were exceptions. Joaquin, holding a little girl, and Hạp Tử, covering his nose, whispered to each other, &quot;Absolutely do not let Medua inhale this gas.</p>
<p>The system keeps warning of an abnormal status. Looking at the situation around us, it&#x27;s clear. This is not a demi-human park at all. We have to get Medua out of here quickly.&quot; Anna continued to pose seductively and said, &quot;Next, the town-entry ceremony begins.&quot; Behind the iron bars behind her were what looked like the silhouettes of demons with blazing red eyes and sharp teeth. Seeing this, Joaquin and Hạp Tử thought in horror, &quot;Demonic beasts.&quot; The released demonic beasts roared ferociously, staring intently at the crowd of demi-humans.</p>
<p>Anna shouted, &quot;Revel, my kin!&quot; Seeing that the crowd was not afraid but was cheering instead, Joaquin and Hạp Tử whispered, &quot;Are they insane? We have to run.&quot; But the demonic beasts were very fast and ferocious, approaching to tear at their clothes and grab them. Joaquin cursed loudly, &quot;Holy shit. These demi-humans have all gone mad from inhaling that gas.&quot; Hạp Tử cried out, &quot;Let go, I already have someone I like.&quot; Disguise torn. &quot; Anna, on the stage, noticed something strange and looked in this direction. She said in surprise, &quot;Humans.</p>
<p>Soldiers, go kill those two spies. Don&#x27;t let them escape under any circumstances.&quot; The two of them were back-to-back in a defensive stance against the surrounding demonic beasts. On the flying vehicle, Sibin was sitting with Lory when a system message arrived. He opened it in surprise to see, &quot;Daily Villain Mission Update. Villain Mission 1: Kill Phục Oa.</p>
<p>Villain Mission 2: Destroy the Demi-human Park. Villain Mission 3: Leave a psychological scar on at least 100 players.&quot; Seeing this, Sibin&#x27;s head was full of question marks as he thought, &quot;These missions... telling me to go to Eastgrave Town now and destroy it. But, speaking of opportunities, this is indeed an opportunity. After all, the Sky Knights must have already been deployed to the Royal Capital.</p>
<p>Eastgrave Town should be at its weakest right now.&quot; Thinking this, he said, &quot;Fire bird, turn around, fly northeast.&quot; The fire bird heard the command, screeched loudly, and changed direction. In Eastgrave Town, the two were now running with the little girl in their arms, fleeing from the fireballs created by the demonic beasts. &quot;Damn it, although there&#x27;s nothing too strong, their average level isn&#x27;t much different from ours, but there are just too many of them.&quot; The rat-toothed soldiers looked towards the three and laughed, &quot;Not bad, not only did a demi-human child come, but also a mage. They are all top-grade experimental materials. Don&#x27;t kill them, capture them alive.</p>
<p>Lady Phục Oa will reward us.&quot; Joaquin, holding the little girl while running, said, &quot;That&#x27;s right, Hạp Tử, have you screenshotted the situation and posted a call for help on the forums yet?&quot; Hạp Tử laughed and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I screenshotted it a long time ago and posted it to the world channel. It&#x27;s professional instinct.&quot; At this moment, on the forums, there was a post with an image of demonic beasts attacking demi-humans: &quot;Eastgrave Town in the Frostmourne Range, next to Greystone Fief, is using our Divine Light Town residents as experi ments. My friend Joaquin and I are carrying a little demi-human girl named Medua and are being hunted by the guards of Eastgrave Town. Urgent call to arms.&quot; In the picture, Medua was terrified, her mouth open in a loud cry. Seeing this, people immediately responded, &quot;Holy shit, where are you, bro? Send me your coordinates right now.&quot; &quot;Damn, is this for real?&quot; &quot;Little Medua, I just told her a children&#x27;s fairy tale.&quot; &quot;Send the coordinates.&quot; Joaquin handed Medua back to Hạp Tử and drew his sword.</p>
<p>&quot;Remember to keep holding on. You run. I&#x27;ll go to the respawn point and come right back.&quot; Hearing this, Hạp Tử asked, &quot;Are you planning to become a hero here?&quot; Joaquin charged into the demonic beasts behind them, saying, &quot;Melee fighters don&#x27;t need to worry about running out of energy.&quot; Hearing this, Hạp Tử turned and ran, saying, &quot;Makes sense.&quot; Medua watched Joaquin&#x27;s back, crying and calling out, &quot;Brother Ling Kaka.&quot; &quot;We? Are we going to die here? It&#x27;s because Medua said we had to come to Eastgrave Town that I&#x27;ve harmed you brothers.&quot; Hearing this, Hạp Tử patted the little girl&#x27;s back to comfort her, saying, &quot;He&#x27;ll be fine, little Medua. You know we can respawn, right?&quot; After speaking, he thought to himself, &quot;The problem is, when NPCs die, it&#x27;s really the end for them. Why are these soldiers clinging to us like mad dogs?&quot; As he was running, a very large shadow of a fire bird enveloped him.</p>
<p>Medua stopped crying, raised her head to look at the flying vehicle in the sky, and said curiously, &quot;Brother Ling. Brother Ling Kaka. In the sky. There&#x27;s a giant bird in the sky.&quot; Sibin looked down and thought to himself, &quot;It&#x27;s so noisy down there. Hmm? Is someone being hunted?&quot; &quot;A little demi-human child.</p>
<p>And a player.&quot; After thinking, he stood up on the flying vehicle and said, &quot;Fire bird. Take your mistress to the sky above that forest and wait for me. If you encounter danger, descend.&quot; The fire bird turned its head back to confirm the mistress was Lory, then screeched loudly to confirm it understood. After giving his instructions, he jumped straight down from the flying vehicle in a free fall. From above, Lory shouted a reminder, &quot;Master, please be careful.</p>
<p>You must come back soon.&quot; Sibin, holding his sword as he free-fell, replied, &quot;Okay. I promise.&quot; As soon as he landed, he crushed a rat-toothed soldier flat. &quot;Oops? Wrong landing spot. Stepped on a bug. Or was it a rabbit?&quot; Seeing him fall, Hạp Tử was also startled and looked over.</p>
<p>Who did he recognize immediately? &quot;Lord Eagle Crest.&quot; Sibin was very efficient. Upon landing, he immediately rushed into battle. He unleashed slashes of purple sword ki, cutting down the enemies. Hạp Tử thought to himself, &quot;As expected. The giant bird Medua just saw is his mount.</p>
<p>Why do I run into this NPC everywhere? With such a high appearance rate, I seriously suspect Lord Eagle Crest is the final boss of the current version. And real men should indeed play with greatswords. Look at that effortless single slash. We&#x27;re both melee fighters. Why is he so handsome?&quot; Very quickly, there were no rat-toothed soldiers left around.</p>
<p>Sibin slung his sword over his shoulder and wondered, &quot;So that&#x27;s it?&quot; Hạp Tử and Medua approached and said, &quot;Ah, thank you for your help, Lord Eagle Crest.&quot; Hearing this, Sibin smiled and replied, &quot;Oh, you mean you want to thank me?&quot; Hạp Tử broke out in a sweat and said, &quot;Ah, what do you want? My self-made wolf tail looks pretty real.&quot; Sibin laughed and said, &quot;What would I do with that toy? We&#x27;re so familiar with each other. You should understand my style by now. If you truly want to thank me, then repay me with your body.&quot; Hearing this, Hạp Tử was horrified, imagining the scene of Sibin laughing lecherously while defiling a girl. So he backed away repeatedly, saying, &quot;You, you&#x27;re even into men... Right, is this a benefit designed for female players? I can&#x27;t, I already have someone I like.&quot; Sibin didn&#x27;t care.</p>
<p>He smiled, hugged Medua, and stabbed Hạp Tử straight through the chest. &quot;Oh, then I wish you success in escaping singlehood soon. From the way you talk, it&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re in a one-sided love. Consider this your thank you.&quot; It turned out Hạp Tử&#x27;s dirty mind was running wild. The result was that he spat blood and died.</p>
<p>System notification: You have backstabbed and killed a player after toying with their affections. Caused severe psychological trauma, received 50 villain points. Mission 3 progress +1. Sibin stood up and laughed, &quot;Who was toying with his affections? Wasn&#x27;t he the one overthinking things?&quot; Medua was now burying her face in his chest, sobbing. Sibin pulled the little girl away by her collar and asked, &quot;Kid, what are you making a fuss about?&quot; Medua, with tears streaming down like rain, said, &quot;Did, did you kill Brother Ling Kaka? Sob, sob, you bastard, you demi-human-catching bastard.&quot; Hearing that, he asked back, &quot;You don&#x27;t know he can respawn? Hmm?&quot; At that moment, a loud noise from another direction made him turn his attention.</p>
<p>Over there, a group of fully armed players had arrived and were attacking. &quot;Brothers, charge! Rescue the demi-human maiden, crush these beasts!&quot; Seeing this, the rat-toothed soldiers&#x27; formation fell into chaos. They said in a panic, &quot;Where, where did these people come from? Quick, go report to Lady Phục Oa.&quot; Anna heard the report, frowned, and looked over. &quot;What? Suspect a news leak? Someone is attacking us?&quot; The girl next to her, whose revealing attire was no less than Anna&#x27;s, also said, &quot;How? How could they be so fast? Lady Anna, what should we do?&quot; Hearing this, Anna slapped the girl straight across the face and yelled, &quot;Just a bunch of lowly bugs. When something happens, all you know how to do is panic and cry.&quot; &quot;S-sorry, my lady.&quot; After hitting her, Anna gave an order, &quot;Awaken the Ice and Snow Empress.</p>
<p>Also, send a magical message to His Highness the Wind Emperor, telling him Eastgrave Town is under attack by an unknown force. We need reinforcements.&quot; The girl nodded in acknowledgment and went to carry out the order immediately. &quot;Yes.&quot; On the city wall, a person jumped down, laughed, struck a pose, then stood up, turned back and said, &quot;Brothers, I&#x27;m the first one on the wall, remember to screenshot this for the forums for me.&quot; Another person jumped up after him and said with annoyance, &quot;It&#x27;s just getting on the wall, so dramatic.&quot; Yet another person poked his head up and said, &quot;Hey, Brother Ri, in front of you.&quot; Hearing this, the first person to get on the wall turned his head to look. What met his eyes was a white-haired girl in a sexy blue bikini, posing suggestively and asking, &quot;Hey big brother, I&#x27;m so cold, can you hug me?&quot; Hearing this, the young man drooled and said, &quot;I can, of course I can.&quot; After replying, he thought to himself, &quot;Holy crap, nbcu, these proportions are too top-tier.&quot; The sexy white-haired girl rushed forward and wrapped her arms around Cuong Ban Nhat Xuyen&#x27;s neck. She looked at him with a gentle, affectionate gaze and said, &quot;Caca, I&#x27;m still so cold, hurry and hold me tighter.&quot; Faced with her charm, he couldn&#x27;t help but say, &quot;Okay, okay, hug, a little tighter.&quot; But the &quot;holding tighter&quot; here was strange; before they knew it, the two were kissing passionately.</p>
<p>On the city wall, a young man who had just climbed up drooled and said, &quot;What is the player Cuong Ban Nhat Xuyen doing? He&#x27;s actually hugging a babe during a game war. I&#x27;m so jealous.&quot; Hearing this, the girl next to him smacked him hard on the head and yelled, &quot;Babe my ass! You male players are really something else. Look closely, her health bar is red. She&#x27;s obviously a boss.&quot; Looking at the system display, the sexy white-haired girl turned out to be an Elite Holy Temple Knight, the Ice and Snow Empress Mirabel Skull, a temporary Level 53 Great Demon Army Daoist. Nightmare.</p>
<p>Mirabel stepped back, laughed, and said, &quot;Foolish humans who dare to invade Eastgrave, then feel the feast of ice and snow within my body.&quot; After speaking, Mirabel used a skill, &quot;Fatal Snowstorm, Eternal Curse of the Snow Kingdom on the Mortal World.&quot; Masses of blue airflow accompanied by ice crystals appeared everywhere. Very quickly, the group of players was trapped in large blocks of ice everywhere. The surrounding temperature dropped rapidly. Debuff effect: Frozen for 30 seconds. The trapped players chatted with each other through the interface.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t move anymore.&quot; &quot;Me neither.&quot; &quot;Cold, so cold.&quot; &quot;Why can this game only adjust the pain sensation? This is not good.&quot; &quot;In this formation area, we&#x27;ll be frozen into ice statues. The debuff will be sent after 30 seconds.&quot; &quot;Can anyone remove this debuff?&quot; &quot;Mom&#x27;s cooking, I only have 15 seconds left.&quot; At this moment, Sibin was moving through the air holding his sword, a yellow energy swirling around the blade. As he approached the city wall, he was also affected by the skill, but he was not frozen. Quickly, he reached the frozen players. Seeing this, everyone started buzzing.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not seeing things, am I? Was that Lord Eagle Crest who just passed by?&quot; &quot;Where&#x27;s the screenshot? How can Eagle Crest be yellow?&quot; &quot;Damn it, is it for real?&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s all the noise? If his health bar isn&#x27;t lit up, I&#x27;m actually a bit unused to it.&quot; Sibin appeared behind Mirabel and raised his sword. Sensing something behind her, she turned and said, &quot;What is that?&quot; He swung his sword, and the yellow energy took the form of a ferocious lion&#x27;s head, lunging towards her. But she was very fast, managing to dodge this violent attack in time. In the air, the very sexy Mirabel looked down and said, &quot;Oh, so that&#x27;s how it is. Is this caca a Sky Knight?&quot; Sibin charged forward again, thrusting straight at her.</p>
<p>She quickly drew a circular pattern to block him, saying, &quot;Caca, you&#x27;re too fast. Slow down a bit.&quot; The two streams of blue and yellow power collided violently. Sibin said indifferently, &quot;Compared to our little loli&#x27;s master, this &#x27;caca&#x27; of yours truly has no soul. The Ice and Snow Empress, right?&quot; &quot;Watch me defeat you.&quot; After speaking, he swung his sword down hard. A huge stream of yellow power slammed into her, causing Mirabel to fall straight to the ground, crashing and sending dirt and rocks flying.</p>
<p>Taking the hit, she cried out, &quot;Ah, that hurts!&quot; But she changed her demeanor very quickly. By the time Sibin landed, she was already sitting up, smiling, and saying, &quot;Wait, wait. I surrender. Please spare me.&quot; Then she used her old trick, getting close to Sibin, hugging his arm, and saying seductively, &quot;As long as you&#x27;re willing to spare me, I&#x27;m willing to offer my everything to you.&quot; Then she leaned in with her sexy lips and said, &quot;Let Mirabel kiss you... and serve you.&quot; Her words were answered by a sword piercing straight through her.</p>
<p>Sibin smiled and said, &quot;Sorry, I don&#x27;t like the cold beauty type. But if you were frozen solid, I might consider it.&quot; Mirabel fell to the ground, blood spurting from the wound around her. Gasping, she said, &quot;You... actually...&quot; Midway through her sentence, her life ended. Sibin turned his back, spread his arms, and said, &quot;Besides, didn&#x27;t I already say? Your acting is too soulless.&quot; &quot;If this is going to be called an amusement park, you should at least prepare some high-quality hospitality.&quot; He looked straight up at the sexy Anna on the grandstand and said, &quot;What do you think?&quot; Hearing this, Anna&#x27;s cheeks flushed as she replied provocatively, &quot;Well said.</p>
<p>The aura on you is truly intoxicating. Knight, why don&#x27;t you join us? Eastgrave Town really needs a talent like you.&quot; Sibin held his sword, thinking, &quot;Why bother with her?&quot; He smiled, and a terrifying power enveloped his sword, creating dazzling sparks. &quot;Villains die from talking too much. Kill first, talk later.&quot; Sibin rushed forward. The girl in front of him emitted a surrounding red aura, frowning at Sibin and saying, &quot;Refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit.&quot; She waved her hand, and the power of flames blocked Sibin&#x27;s sword path.</p>
<p>The red and yellow colors clashed, creating a small bolt of lightning. She said to Sibin, &quot;You are very strong, Knight. But before the vessel becomes the Flame, I will also be protected by my master,&quot; her face full of provocation. Sibin hovered in mid-air, ensnared by a red power shaped like a giant, dark snake with its mouth open, ready to devour him. He shouted, &quot;You&#x27;re a demi-human, yet you believe in the God of War and Fire, Bada?&quot; The girl controlled her power, holding Sibin tightly.</p>
<p>He was bound upside down. She spoke to him nonchalantly, &quot;Belief and race have nothing to do with each other. Everything was bestowed by my master, so naturally, I will dedicate everything to my master.&quot; She held a small dagger, its sharp tip pointed at Sibin&#x27;s neck. He had now been pulled down close to her. Their faces were only a short distance apart.</p>
<p>She said, &quot;A person like you who doesn&#x27;t know their own limits will eventually become my food.&quot; Sibin asked with a blank expression, &quot;Is that so?&quot; Then he said, &quot;In that case, let&#x27;s see if your master can protect you.&quot; She was surprised, only now realizing that something was wrong. It turned out that while she wasn&#x27;t paying attention, Sibin had left the Heart of Ice Seal in her mouth. She said to Sibin in a panic, &quot;The Ice and Snow Empress&#x27;s Heart of Ice Seal! You&#x27;re truly a madman, leaving it in my mouth.&quot; She raised her hand to her mouth. Sibin smiled, thinking, &quot;Actually, it&#x27;s in the system&#x27;s item box, which is in her mouth.&quot; The Heart of Ice Seal is an ice crystal in the shape of a heart. A dropped item from the Ice and Snow Empress boss after her death, the system explained.</p>
<p>At this moment, Sibin&#x27;s power erupted violently. Flashes of golden light overpowered the girl&#x27;s power. He said, &quot;Oh? You&#x27;ve weakened so quickly? As expected, the Fire God has an attribute that clashes with this thing. Now, it&#x27;s my turn.&quot; After speaking, Sibin launched a powerful counterattack. At this moment, the opponent used a suppressive power.</p>
<p>Her eyes stared straight at Sibin. Sibin was surprised, wondering, &quot;What&#x27;s going on? My movements have slowed down.&quot; Sibin held his sword, floating in space, feeling as if all his body movements were not under his control. The girl now looked up at Sibin and said, &quot;I&#x27;ll remember you, Knight.&quot; In her hand, she held a scroll. Inside it was a power formation emitting blue rays of light. Sibin thought, &quot;Could it be that her gaze can control the speed of my actions?&quot; The girl&#x27;s eyes flashed red.</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth and said to Sibin, &quot;Wash your neck and wait for my master&#x27;s iron heel.&quot; The blue rays of light opened another dimension that was enveloping her. Sibin shouted, &quot;You damn bastard, you want to run when you can&#x27;t win?&quot; Then he swung his sword down forcefully. The sharp sword path blazed brightly. A loud explosion rang out, and a dazzling golden light erupted like a powerful fire in front of the opponent, who was already fading away. Boom! The explosion caused the church to collapse.</p>
<p>The pressure from the blast spread out powerfully, enveloping the surroundings. People outside screamed and fled. Standing amidst the smoke from the explosion, one person said, &quot;Is this because Lord Eagle Crest is fighting inside?&quot; Another person immediately asked, &quot;So, is he dead?&quot; and even said cheerfully, &quot;That&#x27;s good news. Let&#x27;s go look later. If he&#x27;s dead, we&#x27;ll pick up his equipment.</p>
<p>If he&#x27;s half-dead, we&#x27;ll kill him. If he&#x27;s jumping around happily...&quot; Before he could finish, a figure suddenly appeared behind them. With blood-red eyes and a squinting smile, he interjected, &quot;...then you&#x27;ll be killed by me? You like my equipment that much, huh?&quot; The guys from before turned to look. One minute they were happily chatting and making plans, the next they were flustered and terrified to see Sibin standing right behind them. Sibin held his sword and said cheerfully, &quot;Come on, no problem.</p>
<p>Enjoy yourselves to the fullest.&quot; His mouth was smiling, but a murderous aura surrounded him, and his eyes remained cold. He said, &quot;Welcome to Eastgrave Town,&quot; and then rushed in, beating the group of people relentlessly. The men only had time to scream, &quot;Damn you, you&#x27;re not even the boss of this area!&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s even saying his lines when he appears! It&#x27;s a bug, definitely a bug!&quot; The group was beaten to a pulp, and the surroundings were filled only with screams submerged in the thick dust of the horrific brawl. The system displayed a notification: Third Mission Completion Level +1, Third Mission Completion Level +1, Third Mission Completion Level +1, Third Mission Completion Level +1, Third Mission Completion Level +1. The beaten group trembled, their eyes welling with tears, and said, &quot;That&#x27;s enough! It wasn&#x27;t easy to level up again, and now we&#x27;ve been beaten back to level zero.&quot; Sibin rested his sword on the ground, smiled cheerfully, and said, &quot;I saw you had a horse before, right? Hand over your horses to me.</p>
<p>If not, I&#x27;ll just kill you.&quot; The beaten group weakly explained, &quot;Not everyone has one.&quot; Another one also said, &quot;That&#x27;s right, horses are very expensive. We&#x27;re very poor.&quot; Sibin ignored them and continued, &quot;Hurry up. You think it&#x27;s over just like that? If you have horses, hand them over. After that, everyone strip for me.&quot; Hearing this, the men were horrified, covering their bodies as if protecting their precious virtue, and said, &quot;What? What do you want to do to us? Don&#x27;t think you can do whatever you want just because you&#x27;re strong and handsome!&quot; Sibin grinned slyly and told them, &quot;Being both strong and handsome, of course I can do whatever I want.&quot; The system announced continuously: Received Horse x20, Received Equipment x20n, Received Weapon x30. The stripped group could only scream, &quot;Beast!&quot; while Sibin cheerfully rode a horse, leading several others behind him as he left.</p>
<p>At this time, the system also announced: Villain Mission Three, &quot;Leave a psychological shadow on at least 100 players,&quot; has been completed. At the same time, a group of people was crossing the bridge into the city. Sibin ordered, &quot;Clement, take the horses and equipment down and store them.&quot; Clement respectfully said, &quot;Yes, Young Master.&quot; Sibin observed his surroundings and said, &quot;So many demi-humans. Are they all the ones who captured Eastwood City while I was away?&quot; A voice came from a distance, &quot;Correct. They were all brought here from Divine Light Town by Clement and me.&quot; Sibin turned to look back.</p>
<p>Rui slowly approached, speaking to Sibin as she walked, &quot;During your absence, I did my best to explain to them the conspiracy of the demi-human amusement park and to soothe their emotions. However, not many of them truly believed it.&quot; Sibin looked at Rui with a bright smile and asked her, &quot;Is that so?&quot; seeing Rui&#x27;s soft, white tail, he couldn&#x27;t help but rub against it repeatedly, sniffing it while saying, &quot;No problem, just as I expected. You&#x27;ve done very well. It&#x27;s normal for them to have a hard time accepting it in such a short time.&quot; Rui, startled by the touch on her tail, yelped. Then she threw a hard punch at Sibin&#x27;s face, shouting, &quot;Let go, you pervert!&quot; Sibin could only weakly explain, &quot;I just did it because you looked so down.&quot; At that moment, a fish tail thrashed powerfully in the pool of water next to where Sibin was standing.</p>
<p>A beautiful mermaid was sitting there, and several other merfolk around her were also looking towards Sibin. Sibin then asked, &quot;Are merfolk also demi-humans?&quot; Rui explained, &quot;They are, but they&#x27;re different from the aquatic races in the sea. The aquatic races can hardly leave the water, but demi-human merfolk can transform their tails into legs after coming of age.&quot; The mermaid from before stepped out of the water, her fish tail now transformed into a perfect pair of legs. Sibin exclaimed, &quot;What a magical species.&quot; After transforming their tails into legs, the mermaids jumped out of the pool, running and shouting, &quot;Help! It&#x27;s Lord Eagle Crest! That tyrant is back!&quot; Both Sibin and Rui were stunned. Hearing this, Sibin angrily grabbed Rui&#x27;s tail again, and Rui blushed and screamed.</p>
<p>Under the clear blue sky, Rui stood in the center and announced loudly, &quot;All demi-humans, the Lord has an important announcement. Please gather around.&quot; Sibin stood with his back turned. The demi-humans below whispered among themselves, &quot;Has the Holy Maiden completely submitted to the Lord&#x27;s orders now? The cruel Lord.&quot; Sibin stood before everyone and said confidently, &quot;I am Lord Eagle Crest, the Golden Lion CV. Although you are all demi-humans, since you are in my territory, you are also my people.&quot; &quot;I have gathered everyone here today for two reasons. First, to reveal a cruel truth to you all, and second, to test your abilities,&quot; Sibin said, standing on a high platform.</p>
<p>On one side was Rui, on the other were several attendants. Below, a defiant demi-human spoke up, &quot;Ridiculous. His people? Is he going to give us demi-human land?&quot; At this time, Sibin continued, &quot;Those who pass the test will stay in the castle to work, and those who fail can also be given a plot of land. Don&#x27;t worry about the land being taken away. The Eastwood city guard will protect everyone&#x27;s property.&quot; Below, they began to whisper after hearing the mention of land, turning to ask each other, &quot;Can we have our own land?&quot; An angry demi-human spoke up, &quot;Bah! He won&#x27;t care if we demi-humans live or die.</p>
<p>Even if we have land, we&#x27;ll just be bullied by others. He won&#x27;t save us.&quot; Sibin continued his speech, saying, &quot;Furthermore, I will also enact laws regarding the rights of demi-humans to ensure the basic rights and safety of demi-humans in my territory.&quot; The demi-humans below were all surprised and skeptical. Sibin casually continued, &quot;Now, let&#x27;s talk about the cruel reality I mentioned earlier. I know many of you have heard of Eastwood Town. The demi-human amusement park.</p>
<p>And before I invited you here, some of you were already on your way to Eastwood Town. But now, Eastwood Town has been destroyed by me,&quot; Sibin said. Below, the demi-humans began to wonder and were stunned after hearing that Eastwood Town was destroyed. The demi-human who had been speaking out against Sibin&#x27;s words shouted indignantly, &quot;See! I told you so! His true colors are showing! The land and laws are all lies to trick us! Lord Eagle Crest just wants to cut off our retreat! He&#x27;s a demon!&quot; Sibin waved his hand, ordering the attendant behind him, &quot;Go call those little turnip heads up here.&quot; The attendant immediately bowed and obeyed him. Several more demi-humans appeared on the platform.</p>
<p>Below, a stir went through the crowd about the children. Someone even asked, &quot;Isn&#x27;t that Little Mai Duo? Why are they here?&quot; The demi-humans who had just stepped up were all small-statured girls. Each of them held their skirts and bowed to their Lord. Sibin thought to himself, &quot;Although time was short, Mrs. Chris still did a great job with their basic training.&quot; Sibin then said, &quot;No need for formalities.</p>
<p>Come over here and tell them what you heard and saw in Eastwood Town.&quot; The child obediently complied with him. The demi-human turned to the crowd below and said loudly, &quot;Everyone, please listen to me. Everything in Eastwood Town is a scam. It&#x27;s all fake. There&#x27;s no demi-human amusement park there at all.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s hell. The people of the Holy See are imprisoning demi-humans, then torturing and killing them.&quot; After hearing this, the demi-humans below were all utterly shocked. Someone from below shouted, &quot;Do you have any proof? What if you&#x27;ve also been brainwashed by Lord Eagle Crest?&quot; Hearing this, Sibin thought to himself, &quot;It&#x27;s a shame I don&#x27;t have such a convenient skill.&quot; The little demi-human asserted to everyone that she had proof. She took out a piece of her sister&#x27;s brow armor, then explained, &quot;This is my sister&#x27;s brow armor. As you all probably know, a Pangolin Armor demi-human can only have their precious brow armor removed after death.&quot; The little girl thought of her sister, unable to hold back her tears, her eyes welling up.</p>
<p>Continuing the story, &quot;That day, my sister was taken away by them after participating in the initiation ceremony, and she never came back. I snuck to that Wind Hall and saw them releasing crazed beastmen and selling demons to harm demi-humans. This is what I managed to pick up.&quot; After hearing this, everyone below was bewildered. The whispers grew louder. Someone asked, &quot;How could this be?&quot; Someone else asked, &quot;Is it really all a lie? Could it be that Lord Eagle Crest really saved us?&quot; On the platform, Sibin sighed and told the demi-humans below that he had ordered their capture.</p>
<p>&quot;I know you don&#x27;t like a lord like me. You think I invaded your homes, but if I hadn&#x27;t forcibly issued the order, the devil knows how many people would have run to Eastwood Town and died tragically there. I helped you for the sake of your Holy Maiden and my personal maid,&quot; Sibin said, turning to look at Rui. Rui lowered her head shyly. Below, everyone was saying, &quot;So we&#x27;ve wrongly blamed Lord Eagle Crest, and we misunderstood Her Highness the Holy Maiden too.&quot; &quot;Her Highness the Holy Maiden...&quot; Sibin turned his back to them and said, &quot;Apologizing too much is useless.</p>
<p>If you have any more doubts, you can ask your Holy Maiden and these little imps directly. Now, dismiss. Don&#x27;t forget the test starts at 5 PM. Be ready.&quot; A few small snowflakes began to fall. Lori stood behind Sibin, her hand on his shoulder, asking curiously, &quot;In other words, Master, you want to use the power in your body to test them one by one with a handshake?&quot; Sibin stood there and laughed loudly, saying, &quot;If I do that, I won&#x27;t be done even by tomorrow.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry.&quot; Below, the demi-humans looked up intently. Sibin sat there cross-legged, leisurely using his hand to control the crystal ball in front of him, explaining, &quot;With this crystal ball, I can expand the perception range of the Great Wilderness&#x27;s source.&quot; The ball emitted a soft, gentle golden light. Sibin glanced back at Lori, a sly look in his eyes as he told the little girl, &quot;It won&#x27;t drain my energy for sleeping with you tonight.&quot; Hearing this, Lori blushed shyly. Lori frowned and said to Sibin, &quot;Master, you&#x27;re so naughty. That&#x27;s not what Lori meant.&quot; Sibin smiled brightly and began to unleash the power of the ball.</p>
<p>The ball continuously emitted a stream of golden light, expanding to envelop everything around. Below, everyone panicked, &quot;What is this?&quot; Sibin explained, &quot;Now, everyone, follow the awakening method in your bloodline memories to perceive this thing.&quot; Wherever the ball&#x27;s light reached, it made the demi-human girls feel comfortable and warm. Everyone blushed, saying they wanted to be hugged by Lord Eagle Crest. The demi-human boys also felt that Lord Eagle Crest was handsome and elegant, and wanted to pounce on him too. Sibin fell silent, a stiff smile on his face as he thought, &quot;Still none? Not even one?&quot; At that moment, something suddenly surprised him.</p>
<p>He glanced over. The little demi-human girl, Nina, was enveloped in a brilliant golden light. The light flared up like erupting volcanic lava, confusing the person next to her. The little girl&#x27;s eyes were slightly parted, her face showing a hint of enjoyment. Over by the pool, a fish tail thrashed powerfully.</p>
<p>The mermaid from before also surfaced. Her eyes looked upward, full of submission to the power enveloping her surroundings. Sibin was a little worried. Looking at the two in front of him, he thought to himself with a stiff smile, &quot;Finally, someone has awakened.&quot; &quot;But out of 800 people, there are only two. This probability is unbelievably low.&quot; Nina stood next to a small water container.</p>
<p>Inside the container, the mermaid pouted and said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been caught again.&quot; Sibin leaned down, resting his chin on his hand with an interested look, and said to the mermaid, &quot;I already know Nina. What&#x27;s your name?&quot; The mermaid shyly ducked her head and said to Sibin, &quot;My Lord, I don&#x27;t have a name.&quot; Sibin raised his hand and gently touched the mermaid&#x27;s head, saying, &quot;In that case, from now on, I&#x27;ll call you Bongbong.&quot; The mermaid said happily, &quot;Oh, from now on, my name is Bongbong. Bongbong.&quot; On the other side, Nina excitedly shouted, &quot;My Lord, my name is Nina!&quot; Sibin, slightly flustered, said, &quot;I know you. You have great spirit, but next time, don&#x27;t shout so loudly.&quot; He then thought to himself, &quot;The current order is: one, power and loyalty; two, destruction, death, and annihilation; three, my name is Nina; four, loyal to the Lord.&quot; Sibin told the two of them, &quot;Tell me the images you saw during your perception. Let&#x27;s start with Bongbong.&quot; Bongbong recalled the image she saw and said, &quot;I saw the sea, storms, and a ship being swept away by a whirlpool.&quot; An image of a ship struggling against massive waves appeared.</p>
<p>Bongbong continued, &quot;There was also a great flood, with waves a hundred times taller than Bongbong.&quot; After listening, Sibin rested his chin on his hand, smiled, and said, &quot;Very good. You&#x27;ve been requisitioned by the castle. You start work tomorrow. Your workplace will be on the public balcony of my floor. There&#x27;s a fountain there.</p>
<p>You can stay there for now.&quot; Bongbong timidly asked Sibin, &quot;So, if I have a job, I won&#x27;t be caught by humans with nets anymore, right?&quot; Sibin, leaning on his hand, assured Bongbong, &quot;Of course. Anyone who wants to catch you will have to defeat me first.&quot; Hearing that, Bongbong smiled happily until her eyes crinkled. Sibin looked over at Nina and said, &quot;It&#x27;s your turn.&quot; Nina obediently complied. Nina recounted, &quot;My situation was, first I saw a patch of darkness, surrounded by mud and earth, then a desert, and also various types of rocks.&quot; An image of a volcano, with streams of lava flowing from its mouth, ready to erupt at any moment. Sibin was bewildered, wondering, &quot;Various types of rocks, minerals? Could Nina&#x27;s skill be throwing rocks or squeezing a rock-headed person?&quot; He immediately imagined Nina holding a rock and throwing it hard, and Nina standing happily next to a rock person she had just built.</p>
<p>He said, &quot;You&#x27;re also requisitioned by the castle. For now, I don&#x27;t know what to have you do, so you can lead those kids and manage them for me.&quot; Sibin pointed behind him as a signal. Nina happily shouted, &quot;As you command, my Lord!&quot; Sibin was startled. The order in his thoughts had changed again. Nina had jumped to the second position.</p>
<p>At this moment, Sibin stepped down and said to everyone, &quot;Alright, you may all leave now. If there are any problems, find Claremont.&quot; He called for Claremont who was standing below, and Claremont immediately came to receive his orders. Sibin said to him, &quot;Next, we need to make arrangements for these demi-humans. How are the reorganization and reforms of the outer city coming along?&quot; Below, the demi-humans were chattering amongst themselves. &quot;Did you see? Nina and that singer have awakened.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t believe Lord Eagle Crest has the ability to awaken demi-humans.&quot; Claremont then reported, &quot;My Lord, the reorganization and reforms of the outer city are basically complete. All the vagrants have been sent to mine iron, and the tiled-roof housing area has been repaired.&quot; Sibin then gave further orders, &quot;Help me register these demi-humans in a ledger. Record their names, number of family members, and characteristics. Arrange jobs for them in Eastgrave Town based on this information. As for housing, put them in the repaired tiled-roof area, and provide them with free food for 3 days.</p>
<p>After that, we won&#x27;t be responsible anymore. Those who work will get to eat. Eastgrave Town doesn&#x27;t support freeloaders.&quot; Sibin gestured, and Claremont bowed in obedience. At that moment, he reported to Sibin, &quot;There is one problem now. It seems we are about to run out of money.&quot; This sentence struck Sibin like a bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>He worriedly thought, &quot;Out of money already?&quot; Sibin pondered. A few days ago, after the round table conference ended, the nobles around Eagle Crest Fief had also left, and he couldn&#x27;t just openly plunder. Before the demi-humans could settle in and contribute, he wouldn&#x27;t see any return. Charity is indeed very expensive. Suddenly, a thought flashed through Sibin&#x27;s mind as he thought about charity.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#x27;t this a charitable cause for the entire fief? There&#x27;s no reason for the lord to be the only one responsible, right?&quot; Sibin then ordered Claremont, &quot;Summon all the wealthy merchants in the city for me at 9 a.m. tomorrow. I need to have a meeting with them. If anyone doesn&#x27;t want to come, send that guy to the iron mines.&quot; Claremont immediately followed Sibin&#x27;s command, saying that tomorrow, all the wealthy merchants of Eastgrave Town would gather in the castle&#x27;s conference hall on time. Outside the castle at this time, the sun was gradually setting, painting a corner of the sky orange with the colors of dusk.</p>
<p>Sibin walked wearily, yawning as he said, &quot;Busy all day, I can finally get some rest.&quot; Just as he stepped through his room&#x27;s door, he felt something was wrong. A demi-human holding a table lamp rushed to attack Sibin from behind. Sibin thought, &quot;An ambush,&quot; and quickly grabbed the demi-human&#x27;s hand. The lamp fell, and the girl could only scream in pain. Sibin held both her hands tightly, slamming the demi-human&#x27;s back hard against the door behind them, and asked, &quot;It&#x27;s you?&quot; Sibin&#x27;s body pressed tightly against the girl&#x27;s.</p>
<p>She cried out, &quot;Let go!&quot; Sibin smiled slightly and said, &quot;How strange. I brought you here from that abusive grand prince&#x27;s place. Not only do you not thank me...&quot; He then activated the system to identify her information. The system displayed a small circle over Sibin&#x27;s eye, analyzing the person opposite him. He asked her, &quot;Instead, you repay kindness with malice and ambush me.</p>
<p>What kind of logic is that?&quot; The system analysis provided the information: Name: Aisilia. Identity: Princess of the Elven Royal Court, younger sister of the current Elven Queen. Strength: Combat-type Elven Magus, Level 49-41-50 (Sealed). Skills: Advanced Natural Affinity. Proficient in Advanced Water Magic (Sealed).</p>
<p>Proficient in Intermediate Elven Magic (Sealed). Transformation Art: Nightingale Form (Sealed). Elven Signal Activated. Equipment: Lori&#x27;s Maid Dress. Reputation with Elven Faction: 15,748.</p>
<p>She is a pampered elven princess, but to avenge a friend, she secretly infiltrated the human world. Empire Reputation: 1. Only you know her true identity. Sibin thought, &quot;Great. No wonder she didn&#x27;t want to reveal her identity.&quot; The girl whose hands were held tight frowned angrily and shouted, &quot;You people invaded my home first! I must kill you all!&quot; Sibin yelled at her, &quot;Is there something wrong with your head? I don&#x27;t even know where your home is.&quot; Sibin thought to himself, &quot;If the grand prince found out about this, he would probably tie her up directly and send her to the Jade Border as a hostage for the Human Empire&#x27;s coalition forces to threaten the Elven Royal Court.&quot; &quot;A problematic identity and she&#x27;s hostile towards me.</p>
<p>What a hot potato.&quot; Sibin kept one hand holding the girl&#x27;s hands, while his other hand pointed at her chest. The girl blushed and stammered. Sibin smiled and asked, &quot;Still not convinced?&quot; But then he noticed another piece of information, thinking, &quot;I didn&#x27;t notice it before. Why is this line of text printed in red?&quot; The system screen displayed the information: Elven Signal Activated. Sibin wondered, repeating, &quot;Elven Signal?&quot; The girl in front of him was surprised.</p>
<p>She asked Sibin, &quot;How do you know about that?&quot; Sibin froze and thought to himself, &quot;System, quickly tell me what an Elven Signal is. Judging by her reaction, it&#x27;s definitely not something&quot; good. The system reported the result: The Elven Signal is a magical pattern for mutual location tracking among elven royalty within a certain range. It was accompanied by an image of two elves locating each other via a signal between their chests. Sibin was shocked and thought, &quot;Damn, isn&#x27;t this a living locator? If there are any elven royalty nearby, they&#x27;ll come straight here, right? Isn&#x27;t this more direct than just telling people I&#x27;m the Lord of Eagle Crest, come and kill me?&quot; Sibin angrily shouted, &quot;You damn elf! I already told you that you have the wrong target for your revenge! And yet you still activated the Elven Signal!&quot; The girl also said loudly, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about.&quot; Sibin spoke loudly, but in his head, he thought, &quot;This one is clearly doing it on purpose.</p>
<p>Asking is useless. What a terrible personality.&quot; The girl glanced at Sibin provocatively. Sibin, with veins popping on his forehead in anger, asked the system, &quot;The Elven Signal can be turned off, right?&quot; The system replied, &quot;It can, but you need to find the signal&#x27;s location. To avoid detection, the Elven Signal is usually carved by elves on the last anterior vertebra or the lower abdomen. After activation, a pattern displaying the Elven Signal will appear.&quot; Sibin forcefully tore the dress on the girl and asked, &quot;Like this?&quot; The girl blushed and begged, &quot;Don&#x27;t.&quot; At this moment, Sibin found the pattern on her body.</p>
<p>It was a small, pink, glowing pattern located above her navel. Sibin held her body tightly, pointed at the pattern and said, &quot;How do I turn it off? Is it a manual switch?&quot; The girl shouted, &quot;Stop it!&quot; Suddenly, Lori walked in from outside. Seeing the scene, her face darkened and she asked, &quot;Um, Master, what are you two doing?&quot; Both of them were stunned in surprise. Sibin quickly let go, his eyes panicked as he asked Lori, &quot;When did you get here?&quot; Lori calmly replied, &quot;I just arrived. The door wasn&#x27;t closed, so I let myself in.&quot; Sibin thought back.</p>
<p>&quot;The door wasn&#x27;t closed? That&#x27;s right, I was ambushed by this stupid elf as soon as I entered.&quot; Cutting off Sibin&#x27;s thoughts, Lori said, &quot;Master, this won&#x27;t do. How can you do this kind of thing without closing the door?&quot; Sibin asked, &quot;What?&quot; and tried to explain to Lori, &quot;It&#x27;s not what you think. Let me explain.&quot; Lori just huffed, her face clearly showing her sulkiness. Lori pouted, her cheeks puffed up as she glared at Sibin. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing to explain.</p>
<p>It is your freedom to choose who warms your bed, Master. Lori is just a maid, I can&#x27;t meddle in such matters.&quot; Sibin found her adorable and chuckled gleefully. &quot;How could that be? To me, Lori is of course not just a simple maid. I wasn&#x27;t trying to do anything. I just wanted to turn off the Elven beacon on her abdomen.&quot; Lori stared at her abdomen.</p>
<p>&quot;Elven beacon.&quot; The place where the Elven beacon is emitted is her chest. That&#x27;s right, that place is used to broadcast her location. Seeing this, Lori got even angrier. &quot;This damn elf, you did it on purpose, didn&#x27;t you? You could have turned it off earlier or later, but you had to do it now.&quot; Her Elven beacon was already off. She stammered under Lori&#x27;s questioning, &quot;I...</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about.&quot; She leaned close to Lori&#x27;s ear and whispered, &quot;Please help me. I was just delivering food. As soon as I entered the room, my clothes were torn.&quot; Hearing this tone, Lori cursed inwardly, &quot;Damn it, this damned green tea demon.&quot; The little girl spoke calmly, &quot;It&#x27;s alright, you don&#x27;t have to be afraid.&quot; The other girl was surprised, &quot;Huh?&quot; Lori&#x27;s face darkened, looking dangerous. &quot;Master is a very good person. He would never force someone to bear his children.&quot; The girl was mentally overwhelmed by Lori and could only speak haltingly, &quot;I-is that so?&quot; After speaking, Lori turned to ask Sibin, &quot;Right, Master?&quot; He forced a smile, holding a red pill in his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; Suddenly, Sibin shoved the pill into her mouth. &quot;Who would be interested in a damn elf that reeks of green tea?&quot; She was in a passive position and had to swallow the pill. Once she collected herself, she turned angrily towards him, &quot;What did you make me swallow?&quot; Sibin&#x27;s eyes lit up, and with hands on his hips, he replied gleefully, &quot;Poison, of course. Look at your arm. Isn&#x27;t it red and swollen?&quot; Indeed, she looked at her arm and saw that red blotches had appeared on it.</p>
<p>&quot;You... you really poisoned me?&quot; Sibin smirked. &quot;Only I have the antidote for this poison. If you don&#x27;t obey, then just wait until your whole body rots and you die.&quot; Lori asked, puzzled, &quot;Master, what are you planning to do?&quot; He explained to the little girl, &quot;Lori, she came from the grand prince&#x27;s place. She might be up to some tricks.</p>
<p>What if she&#x27;s a spy?&quot; Lori suddenly remembered, &quot;That being said, it was a bit strange. Back then, when she touched me, a few images appeared in my head. I felt a sudden emotional urge to save her.&quot; The girl standing by tried to recall, &quot;What images?&quot; Sibin hugged Lori, stroking her head and asked, &quot;What kind of images?&quot; Lori nuzzled into his chest. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Master. Stupid Lori can&#x27;t remember anything after leaving the grand prince&#x27;s place.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I would have told you long ago.&quot; Sibin kissed the little girl&#x27;s forehead. &quot;Good girl. If you can&#x27;t remember, then don&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t need to blame yourself. From now on, let this elf follow you.&quot; Lori obediently replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; Sibin whispered in her ear, &quot;However, we can&#x27;t let our guard down.</p>
<p>Have Mrs. Trissy make a custom outfit for her, one that exposes the location of the Elven beacon. She is only allowed to move around on this floor of mine.&quot; He instructed her further, &quot;This matter cannot be delayed. Lori, take her to change her clothes now, then go to Mrs. Trissy&#x27;s workshop.</p>
<p>The clothes must be finished tonight. Oh right, have Roy go with you. It&#x27;s getting dark, it&#x27;s not safe.&quot; &quot;Yes, Master.&quot; Then she turned to the other girl and said, &quot;You, follow me.&quot; The girl was very obedient now. &quot;Okay.&quot; She followed behind Lori and asked the little girl, &quot;Excuse me, that day, you saw everything, didn&#x27;t you?&quot; Lori was silent. The girl continued, &quot;Are you an awakened elf? I can feel the power of nature on you.&quot; Lori could no longer stay silent and spoke up.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, nor do I know what I saw. I am just the personal maid of the great Lord.&quot; The girl grabbed Lori&#x27;s hand. &quot;Please wait, but you...&quot; Lori frowned slightly. &quot;You said you were bringing food for the Master, but I don&#x27;t see any dining utensils. Instead, I only saw the broken lamp outside the door.</p>
<p>Moreover, although the Master hides some things from me, he has never lied to me.&quot; Lori yanked her hand away, and you, saved by us yet showing no gratitude, are sneaking around instead. The girl was startled, that is. Lori&#x27;s face darkened, it was because I saved the Master that he brought you back. Therefore, if you dare do anything detrimental to the Master. Lori enunciated each word, I will definitely take responsibility and kill you.</p>
<p>Lori felt unsafe with this strange woman, she stopped and instructed her, you wait here for me a moment. For the young girl, it was better to be wary of this elf. That elf had become much more obedient ever since being poisoned by Sibin, upon hearing the girl&#x27;s words, she only replied softly, alright. Lory thought to herself, what&#x27;s this about the noble elf acting all friendly with me, but the Master has saved so many people, I&#x27;ve never seen him so wary of anyone like this, I shouldn&#x27;t have said I wanted to save her. That&#x27;s right, I&#x27;d better say, Lory stood before Roy&#x27;s room and knocked.</p>
<p>Roy, are you in there? Lory was a little jealous, he treated this saintess too well. Roy had just finished bathing, still wrapped in a towel as she came out. Lory, what is it? Is something the matter with Lord Hevey? Lory lowered her face, looking more pensive than usual. That&#x27;s right, the Master told me to go with you and this elf to Mrs. Chrissy&#x27;s place.</p>
<p>Roy was quick, is that so? Wait for me to change my clothes and I&#x27;ll be right there. Lory stopped her. I told her to wait over there, there&#x27;s something I want to ask you. Roy, you... Lory hesitated.</p>
<p>Then her expression turned serious, her cheeks flushed, asking Roy, you like the Master, don&#x27;t you? Roy was a bit surprised by this question, so she answered haltingly, I, I really do like Lord Hevey very much, but this is because. Lory didn&#x27;t wait for Roy to finish and continued her sentence. Because of the dreamscape, right? After you returned from the dreamscape, your attitude towards the Master completely changed. Lory moved her face close to Roy&#x27;s, what exactly did you see in the nightmare, to be so unforgettable about the Master? Roy sighed, actually, it&#x27;s not just because of that dreamscape, but how could she possibly say these things? Thinking this, Roy ignored Lory&#x27;s interrogation and calmly replied, these things have nothing to do with you. Lory beside her was completely shocked.</p>
<p>Lory shyly declared, anyway, the one who will have the Master&#x27;s child is me. Roy broke out in a cold sweat, have you two already reached that stage in your relationship? Lory fought back possessively, in short, it&#x27;s already reserved. Roy said seriously, then doesn&#x27;t that mean nothing has happened yet? Roy was as happy as if she&#x27;d won the lottery, that&#x27;s right, I know Lord Hevey and Lory are very close, but nothing has happened between them yet. From childhood until now, I have lived for the church, I&#x27;ve never had anything that belonged to me. Roy looked up at the starry sky, all the pent-up frustration she felt, now she would be determined to fight back for this one time only.</p>
<p>Now that I finally have a piece of affection that belongs to me, am I really willing to let it just die silently like this or not? Lory was annoyed, and said loudly, so what is it that you want. Roy restrained herself, don&#x27;t, stay calm, Roy. Roy suddenly placed a hand on Lory&#x27;s cheek. Then that&#x27;s really unfair, I saw Lord Hevey kiss you like that, you two have kissed many times, haven&#x27;t you? Roy&#x27;s face was beet red, this time it was her turn to overwhelm Lory, didn&#x27;t you ask me what happened during the nightmare? Lory, in the nightmare, Lord Hevey and I exercised 17,395 times to have a baby. Lory felt a pang in her heart, tears welling up, what? This isn&#x27;t fair.</p>
<p>Roy provoked her further, that&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s extremely unfair, that in reality, you&#x27;re the only one he has ever kissed. I want to have a good taste of the places he has kissed too. Roy angrily grabbed Lory&#x27;s hand as she tried to run. Lory tried to run but was stopped, are you out of your mind? Lory didn&#x27;t want this.</p>
<p>Roy became even more determined, don&#x27;t even think about escaping. It&#x27;s true that when women get jealous, they can do anything they want. Roy panted, where else did he kiss you? Your neck? Wait, wait a minute. Roy kissed Lory&#x27;s neck, making the girl scream, Ma-Master, help, there&#x27;s a pervert here. Sibin, who was reading documents in his office, had a premonition, why does that sound like Lory&#x27;s voice? But that&#x27;s impossible, this floor uses the best soundproofing materials, it must be because there&#x27;s been too much going on lately, I must have misheard.</p>
<p>Roy then grabbed Lory&#x27;s tail, he must touch your tail often too, right? Lory screamed helplessly, Master. Both of them were embarrassed, but their jealousy made them unwilling to back down. The pile of documents was stacked high on Sibin&#x27;s desk, he placed the last sheet on the stack, breathing a sigh of relief, it&#x27;s finally done. He stretched tiredly. Ah, I&#x27;m dead tired, one more group of people means ten times more work.</p>
<p>Sibin happily realized, but now, it&#x27;s time to rest, come on system, I want to do a lottery draw. System activated, ding, detected that the daily derivative quest has been completed, the main story quest has been completed, obtained one Chain of Fate, below is the quest reward the host has drawn. Ding, congratulations to the host for obtaining the troop, Undead Corpse Shaman x20, ding, this reward is a jackpot, obtained the troop Terror Wraiths x10. Sibin was happy and satisfied, not bad, a jackpot. The system announced, the reward is being deployed in a reasonable manner, please prepare well, host.</p>
<p>This time Sibin asked carefully, wait, reasonable in what sense? What do I need to prepare for? Don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s big rocks falling from the sky again this time. Plumes of purple smoke suddenly appeared on the screen, they began to spread throughout Sibin&#x27;s room. What&#x27;s this commotion? The smoke, it&#x27;s black. That smoke began to solidify into a shape, it seemed to be an extremely large object. Sibin only came up to the elbow of this object.</p>
<p>This is, an undead knight? System display, Name, Terror Wraiths, Identity, Undead, Strength, Sky Knight Lv. 51, 51 to 60. Skills, Undead Physique passive, One-Hit Kill, Reanimate, Nightmare&#x27;s Advent passive, Equipment, Dreadnaught&#x27;s Heavy Armor, Master, exclusive to undead, Wailing One&#x27;s Soul-Purging Sword, Master, exclusive to undead. Details, Undead Physique, immune to mental magic and poison, increases damage to the light system by 30%, reduces physical damage by 30%. One-Hit Kill, when attacking, has a chance to kill the enemy in one hit, the greater the level difference compared to the Terror Wraiths, the lower the probability.</p>
<p>Reanimate, after being killed for the first time, may have a chance to revive again. Reputation, Undead Physique, no, Coloniel Empire Reputation, one. Sibin marveled at this reward, such strong combat power? These are definitely not the undead knights of the Kaeon Continent. The undead knights of the Kaeon Continent are not this robust, they&#x27;re just a horse skeleton. He scrambled to think, no, right now I should be thinking about the arrangement problem first, with a bunch of these undead things suddenly appearing, how am I supposed to explain this to the outside world? The minotaur from before could be said to be an invited guest, the hellfire could be said to be a construct, what should I say about the undead now? A human lord recruiting undead, this isn&#x27;t very reasonable.</p>
<p>If the Church of Light, which fights undead day in and day out, finds out, I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be good. I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;ll immediately dispatch a team of angels to fly here and chop me in half, the thought sent a chill down Sibin&#x27;s spine. He stared at this problematic reward, what to do? Except for the undead horse which looks obvious, a knight wearing such a full set of heavy armor would be hard to identify as an undead creature. If the warhorse of the Terror Wraiths was covered in a set of 360-degree, no-blind-spot armor then. As for the rotten breath of the undead, as long as it&#x27;s not someone from the Church of Light, they probably won&#x27;t be able to detect it.</p>
<p>He instructed the undead knights, before the battle armor is forged, everyone will have to stay in the warehouse for now, don&#x27;t make any noise, understood? He left the office, that&#x27;s settled for now, time to go back and sleep. Huh, in front of the door was, a familiar figure appeared. Lory, what&#x27;s wrong with you? Why aren&#x27;t you going in? Lory turned to look at him, her eyes welling with tears, Master. Lory blamed him, Master is so mean, obviously, obviously Lory came first, why did you have a baby with Roy, over 20,000 times too. Sibin&#x27;s dirty mind immediately started racing, is what you&#x27;re saying what I&#x27;m thinking.</p>
<p>There was something that good? How come I didn&#x27;t know? Lory aggrievedly pushed her hair aside to show him the hickey Roy left, she&#x27;s not a good woman, Master, look at this, what did she do to me just now? Sibin immediately thought of a steamy scene between these two lovely girls, what I&#x27;m imagining is wrong. Sibin chuckled with delight, Lory, did you drink with Roy just now? You can&#x27;t drink yet. Lory was genuinely angry now. Ah. Master, really, I didn&#x27;t drink.</p>
<p>Lory hugged Sibin tightly, sobbing continuously as she explained, that woman in the dream, influenced by the aura on Master&#x27;s body, fantasized a Master. In the dream, she fell in love with the Master 1,000 times, and then, and then. Then sob sob, hearing her story made him sweat profusely as he understood with relief, so it was in a dream. However, he couldn&#x27;t bear to see her cry like this, so he comforted her, don&#x27;t be sad, those twenty thousand times were all fake. If you&#x27;re heartbroken, let&#x27;s have one now, hearing this, she looked up and asked, really? A teardrop still clung to the corner of her eye, her face flushed from crying so much as she hugged him tightly.</p>
<p>Ah, next she was so happy that she directly pushed him down onto the floor, still in disbelief. Master, can we really have a baby just by hugging like this? I always feel like something&#x27;s not right, Master isn&#x27;t tricking Lory, is he? Lory&#x27;s childish reaction made him find it funny as he patted her head. Of course not, even if you go ask Mrs. Chrissy, she would also tell you. This way you can have a baby.</p>
<p>Alright, go to sleep early now, sleeping early and waking up early helps with having a baby, with no other choice, she had to obey him. Sibin lay on the bed with his arm behind his head, although he said nothing, his mind was filled with thoughts. Lory&#x27;s body is still weak. She can&#x27;t give birth and use healing magic at the same time, but healing magic can&#x27;t reduce the suffering and fatigue on her body, let&#x27;s wait longer. Over on this side, Roy was wearing a comfortable set of pajamas, her long tail exposed behind her as she knelt on the ground doing something there.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while lying quietly, he was tightly bound by something, causing his face to break out in a sweat as he opened his eyes to look. As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw Roy sitting and smiling to one side, and his neck was being wrapped by her tail, making his face flush red. Roy, next she leaned in and blew a breath into his ear, whispering, love me, won&#x27;t you? Without waiting for him to react, she then pushed him down and sat on top of him, you must really like this spot, right? The hand she was holding tightly was brought close to his rear, making his nose bleed. He was panicking inside, he was about to die. According to the plot, on the second day, news would spread that he had molested the Saintess.</p>
<p>Then it would lead to the ending of being castrated. No, right now the most important thing is to survive. It&#x27;s better to pretend to be asleep. So he decided to act and pretend to fall dead asleep, ignoring her frantic calls, Lord Sibin, hey, wake up. However, this act did not deceive Rui, but instead angered her.</p>
<p>Pretending to be asleep, are you? Suddenly, Lori, lying next to him, breathed into his ear. Master. Just this made Sibin&#x27;s face turn as red as if it were about to explode, but he still had to bite his lip to not reveal that he was faking sleep. Before Lori came to see him, it turned out she had gone to see her first and proposed, do you want to let Lord Sibin and you have a baby? Let&#x27;s just cooperate. In the end, the two of them held hands intimately and agreed, deal.</p>
<p>In the conference hall of Eagle Crest Castle, everyone had gathered inside, but they were all whispering, not knowing why they had been summoned here. Does anyone know why the Lord of Eagle Crest summoned us here? Victor, you&#x27;ve been in Eagle Crest City for so long, haven&#x27;t you heard any information? I feel it&#x27;s very likely he wants to raise taxes. As they were discussing, the door suddenly opened. Sibin walked in with the whites of his eyes showing and a lifeless face. In contrast to him, Lori and Rui on either side had cheerful faces full of vitality.</p>
<p>Seeing them made everyone whisper even more. I heard the Lord has been indulging in women lately. Even in a situation like this, he brings two people with him. It must be true. That tired look, he must have been with them day and night.</p>
<p>He looked at the two girls sticking to him like glue with his dark-circled eyes, feeling helpless. He couldn&#x27;t refute it. Although it felt less like he was playing and more like he was being played by them all night. They thought he couldn&#x27;t hear and continued to whisper among themselves, the Lord is taking in so many people like that, does he want to start a human slave business with us? By now, he was getting irritable and spoke up, if everyone has arrived, let&#x27;s get to the main topic. He thought unhappily, stop guessing randomly.</p>
<p>So he began to speak, I have summoned you all today mainly for two matters. The first matter is to recommend a product produced by Eagle Crest Castle itself, perfume. Hearing that, Rui smiled and held up a box, opening it. Inside the box was a beautiful small pinkish-purple bottle. When the bottle was uncapped, he told them, everyone, you can take a look.</p>
<p>Does it have brand value? The fragrance wafting from the bottle made everyone excitedly take deep breaths. Oh, this scent is so soothing to the soul. Just one sniff gave Victor the illusion that he was blissfully holding two beautiful women in his arms. I have never smelled such a special fragrance. It&#x27;s like being in a sea of lavender, a young woman past 18.</p>
<p>This made him not hesitate to discuss with him, Lord, Victor is willing to sell this perfume for you. It will bring immense wealth to the Eagle Crest Territory. I can even do it without taking a profit. That condition made him smile happily. Is that so? However, someone else&#x27;s voice rang out, interrupting the conversation.</p>
<p>Victor, wait a minute. Their faces were all filled with desire as they rushed forward, determined to fight for it. Lord, I can also open a sales channel for you, and I have connections with Meton Park. Lord, I also... The chaotic scene made Sibin speak up to calm them down, alright, alright, everyone calm down and sit down first.</p>
<p>He glanced at the beautiful Lori standing behind him and told them mysteriously, I know you all want to get the rights to sell the perfume. But today, I want to use a new method to cooperate with you, ensuring that every one of you can get the rights to sell the perfume. Her hand holding a scroll, she smiled and walked over to give it to Victor. Please take this. He was a bit puzzled by this.</p>
<p>What is this? Seeing this, he explained, on this parchment is the cooperation method I have prepared for you. Please look at it carefully. If you have any questions, you can ask. Inside the scroll was the perfume authorization plan with each condition clearly written. Merchants are divided into one to five stars.</p>
<p>All merchants attending this meeting are automatically upgraded to one-star merchants. One-star merchants can have 5% of the perfume sales rights. This 5% is divided equally among all one-star merchants. Two-star merchants can have 15% of the perfume sales rights, also divided equally among all two-star merchants. Similarly, three stars correspond to 20% sales rights, four stars to 25% sales rights, and five stars to 35% sales rights.</p>
<p>Benefits: one-star merchants get a 2% tax reduction, two-star merchants get a 4% reduction, and so on, with five-star merchants getting a 10% tax reduction. They all focused on reading every word of this long plan carefully. This also means that the higher the star level, the higher the proportion, the more profit, and there&#x27;s also a tax exemption. Being so engrossed in reading, they didn&#x27;t notice Sibin smirking slyly on the side. That&#x27;s right, this is the famous thing from my previous world.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the recharge system. Remembering how his own pitiful money just vanished into thin air made his heart ache non-stop. I too was gradually fleeced by these unscrupulous merchants. Although he was smiling on the outside, inside he had laid out a cunning plan. Now it&#x27;s your turn, merchants.</p>
<p>Time to recharge. One of them asked loudly, Lord, may I ask how one can become a high-star merchant? Sibin replied, wanting to become a high-star merchant is actually very simple. Just buy a membership. The answer confused Victor. Buy a membership? Seeing he didn&#x27;t understand, he patiently explained, that&#x27;s right, buy a membership.</p>
<p>Buy the corresponding membership, and you will immediately become a merchant of that star level. For just 10,000 gold, you can have the status of a five-star merchant for a whole year. Although it seems like a lot, on average, it&#x27;s only a little over 800 gold per month. For example, he might feel that 10,000 gold is a lot, but when converted to 800, it&#x27;s small money. The cost of this perfume is 100 gold per bottle.</p>
<p>You can buy it from me for 120 gold and sell it in the royal capital. Even if you pay an 800 gold membership fee each month, the profit is still very substantial. Moreover, I can also give five-star merchants a 10% tax reduction. But a man who still had something he didn&#x27;t understand obediently raised his hand with a question, Lord, we can&#x27;t afford 10,000 gold, but we don&#x27;t want to give up the right to buy perfume. Could you please tell us the prices for the other star-level memberships? The conference hall was now no different from a classroom, and he was the teacher diligently answering the students&#x27; questions.</p>
<p>Of course, two stars for a 1,000 fee, three stars for a 3,000 fee, four stars for a 5,000 fee. The higher the star level, the more you pay, and the benefits are naturally greater. His face beaming with interest, he stepped before him. Lord, I, Victor, want to become a five-star merchant. I will have someone deliver the membership fee.</p>
<p>A box containing a gold medal was presented to him. Then congratulations, Mr. Victor, on becoming the first five-star merchant of the Eagle Crest Territory. This is your medal. Seeing the treatment he received, everyone else started to get restless.</p>
<p>Lord, I want to become a three-star merchant. Lord, my name is Kaman, I want to be a four-star merchant. Lord, I don&#x27;t have much money, so I can only apply to be a two-star merchant. The crowd&#x27;s reaction made Sibin extremely excited. No problem, everyone should act within their means.</p>
<p>In his head, he couldn&#x27;t help but curse, buy it, you fresh sprouts. Outside, there was a beautiful, clear blue lake, with a mermaid happily swimming around while Saraken sat silently in the middle. When she surfaced, the water rippled and accidentally splashed onto Saraken, causing him to turn and look. Suddenly, he flew into a rage and rushed over to scold her, damn it, you splashed water on the great Saraken&#x27;s body again, you damn fish worm. She was startled and tried to explain, oh, sorry, flaming rock, I forgot you hate water.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just so forgetful. However, not only did he not calm down, but he became even more agitated, just standing there shouting loudly, fish worm, fish worm, no, why is there a fish worm in my territory? Ignoring his anger, Tinh Hai fearlessly swam over to chat. By the way, big rock, what do you do for a living? But he still didn&#x27;t like her at all. Enough, the great Saraken does not want to talk to you. I have told you about my background 57 times already.</p>
<p>This is now the 58th time you&#x27;ve asked me. The three of them walked over together. Seeing the two of them ahead, Sibin spoke up, it seems you two are getting along quite well. As soon as he saw him, he hurriedly bowed. Worm, great Lord, Saraken greets you.</p>
<p>Her face was blank with confusion. Who is that? Hearing this, he was surprised by her phenomenal memory. You&#x27;ve even forgotten the Lord of this place? Hearing that, she smiled brightly, finally remembering. Ah, that&#x27;s right, hello, hello, Lord, and Your Highness, the Saintess, too. The three of them smiled and greeted her.</p>
<p>He cheerfully checked on them both. When the hospital is not open, Saraken has returned here, has he? Bongbong, how are you feeling today? She swam closer to him and replied, I feel great, my head is very clear. But behind her, he silently cursed in his heart, liar. He couldn&#x27;t know his inner thoughts. Hearing what she said, he felt more at ease.</p>
<p>Then let&#x27;s try to perceive again today. By the way, tell me, what did you perceive? His large, warm hand placed on her head made her squint her eyes in comfort. Her large, round eyes opened as she recounted, the deep sea, I saw the endless deep sea. Ferocious schools of fish, a whale that sank and died at the bottom of the sea. Her face showed a look of loneliness as she clasped her hands tightly.</p>
<p>She continued, a fisherman returning from across the sea, walking towards me. He is my father, father. At this point, her eyes widened again, her voice trembling slightly. He said, Tinh Hai, run away quickly, don&#x27;t awaken, don&#x27;t become a vessel of a god, forget, forget it. As soon as she finished speaking, she fell backward, splashing water everywhere.</p>
<p>He had to quickly reach out and catch her to keep her from sinking. It&#x27;s a success, another aberrant. Her information also appeared. Name: Tinh Hai or Bongbong. Identity: Presider of the Crystal Palace of the Demi-human Royal Court, but deposed.</p>
<p>Strength: Awakened Demi-human, Stage One, Level 41. 41 to 50. Skills include: High-level Water Element Affinity (Passive), Tsunami Induction, Storm Induction, Whirlpool, Water Gentle as Jade (Passive), Memory Imprint, Sealing Blade. No equipment. Demi-human Faction Reputation: 238.</p>
<p>Presider of the Crystal Palace, but now hardly anyone knows of her. Colonial Empire Reputation: 1. Only you know her true identity. Seeing her faint made him confused. Why did Bongbong faint? Seeing Rui step forward to help her up, he also guessed that she probably just fainted because successfully awakening consumed too much of her stamina; a little rest should be enough.</p>
<p>The thoughts flooding his mind left Sibin a bit bewildered. Just now when Bongbong awakened, she mentioned being a vessel of a god. Does that refer to the sleeping gods in Ragnatok who are about to awaken? But why would they want to borrow the bodies of demi-humans to awaken? Lori walked over, a little worried, and asked, &quot;Master, do you need Lori to heal her?&quot; But he smiled and refused, &quot;No need, just let her be.&quot; Suddenly, he realized something. That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s divinity. Gods cannot enter the main material plane like the Can Continent to move around; they are repelled to their own divine kingdoms.</p>
<p>But in order to compete for faith to enhance their divine power, they must devise all sorts of methods to descend to the main material plane, and moreover, demi-humans with divinity serve as the medium for this. Initially, Bishop Anna in the Demi-human Paradise also mentioned the word &quot;vessel,&quot; so awakened demi-humans are premium vessels. Furthermore, the divinity they possess is extremely abundant, aligning with the rules of various godheads, for example, time, life, or the power of the ocean. No wonder they want to launch a God War, no wonder they had to attack the demi-human kingdom. It turns out it was all to steal divinity and perfect their godheads.</p>
<p>The two girls came forward to support Tinh Hai. Does she have to be soaked in water? She is a mermaid, after all, so she would recover faster that way. He was now completely immersed in his thoughts. If his speculation holds true, then awakenable demi-humans will become absolutely fewer and rarer. By then, more powerful forces will emerge to snatch these vessels.</p>
<p>Seeing him standing completely still made Lori walk over in confusion, &quot;Master, what&#x27;s wrong?&quot; Only then did he snap back to his senses and reply, &quot;Hm, it&#x27;s nothing. I was just wondering when Bongbong will wake up.&quot; Rui hugged one of his arms tightly, bringing her face close, which made his cheeks flush red with embarrassment. &quot;She&#x27;s sleeping very soundly, it might be until tomorrow.&quot; Seeing this, she cried out in annoyance. Lori argued like a child who had her toy snatched away, &quot;Rui, you&#x27;re not allowed to snatch him and run away.&quot; Her attitude annoyed Rui, who retorted, &quot;You&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s like that. We said we&#x27;d cooperate, but you always want to have him all to yourself.&quot; His words made him go blank for a moment, turning to look at both of them and asking, &quot;What are you two talking about? What cooperation?&quot; Rui&#x27;s face turned red and she refused to answer, &quot;Men shouldn&#x27;t ask about this kind of thing.&quot; The reply made him feel helpless, &quot;Uh, uh, but it&#x27;s clearly related to me, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; But Lori shouted, &quot;Even so, you&#x27;re not allowed to ask!&quot; He silently resolved in his heart, &quot;Whatever the gods&#x27; purpose for returning is, whether good or bad, I will not allow their bodies to become awakening vessels.&quot; Suddenly, the system appeared.</p>
<p>&quot;Ding! The system store has updated the Level 2 military barracks architecture. Host, please inspect.&quot; Sibin&#x27;s expression turned a bit serious as he said, &quot;Inspect.&quot; Upon hearing that, a notification panel appeared. &quot;Level 2 Military Barracks Architecture List: Hermitage, buildable. Can recruit soldiers: Priests. Requires 40,000 Villain Points to exchange.</p>
<p>Condition must also be met: Possess a human territory. Details: After building the Hermitage, Priests can be recruited for 400 Villain Points, five gold coins, and five mithril. Note: Recruited Priests are considered system soldiers, will be completely subservient to the Host, and possess a certain level of intelligence.&quot; After reading, he stroked his chin with a pensive look. &quot;A level 2 military barracks architecture is only 40,000 points. I&#x27;m someone with a six-figure villain point total.&quot; Rui and Lori&#x27;s strange behavior also made him speculate, &quot;during the defensive battle of Lẫm Đông City before, with Lori&#x27;s coordination, I earned a lot of villain points, including the villain points I got when Rui and Lori got into the blanket last night.&quot; Ignoring the two girls who were still arguing heatedly on the side, he focused on planning well.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems I&#x27;ll have to have them trouble themselves to get into the blanket more often in the future. Getting in once is 5,000, the two of them together is 10,000. As long as they get into the blanket once every day, sooner or later there will be a day I can level the continent.&quot; An image of the beautiful Lori appeared in his mind. &quot;Right now, although I have the super nanny Lori, I&#x27;m actually still lacking support-type and healing-type units. Priests, they seem to be a healing-type troop, similar to pastors.</p>
<p>Exchanging for the Hermitage is not a bad choice.&quot; Therefore, he made a decision and said to the system, &quot;System, exchange for the Hermitage. As for the construction site, put it next to the guard post.&quot; The system received the command and sent a notification, &quot;Ding! The Hermitage has been completely built. Host, please proceed to the front to inspect.&quot; That swift action made him extremely satisfied. &quot;The system&#x27;s efficiency is really fast.&quot; Then, Sibin turned around, waved his hand, and said, &quot;If you two continue to argue, I&#x27;ll go to the castle&#x27;s flower garden by myself.&quot; Although they were arguing, as soon as they heard that, they both turned and loudly stopped him, &quot;You can&#x27;t!&quot; Their reaction startled him, making him jump. At the castle&#x27;s flower garden, his attention was drawn to something hanging in front of the door.</p>
<p>After he put a bag full of gold coins into it, that thing immediately emitted a sound. &quot;System. Recruit 10 Priests.&quot; &quot;Priest, the official title of a Catholic clergyman, also called a celebrant.&quot; Tall men suddenly appeared and shouted in unison, &quot;My Lord, may the glory of the gods accompany you.&quot; Looking at the tall man standing imposingly like a statue in front of him made him gasp in astonishment. &quot;This physique and these muscles... he looks so robust.&quot; &quot;They even have metal scepters taller than they are.</p>
<p>Is this really a support-type unit?&quot; This person&#x27;s information panel appeared. &quot;Name: Sigma, Identity: Priest. Strength: Level 30 Fanatic (21-40). Skills: Sacred Guardian Shield, Cleansing Aura, Holy Healing Art, Fierce Attack. Equipment: Self-Discipline Robe (Fine), Heavy Self-Discipline Scepter (Fine).</p>
<p>Reputation: Eagle Crest Territory.&quot; A powerful battle pastor. Fanatics. Their core spirit is to use punishment in place of preaching. Not only can they protect themselves on the battlefield, but they also shoulder the important task of protecting their allies. Now, under the guidance of the gods, they are ready to become a sturdy shield in your hands.</p>
<p>Reading this made him break out in a cold sweat because of how domineering they were. &quot;Using punishment in place of preaching, too... very well, this is a battle pastor, right? Directly delivering physical salvation.&quot; Sibin cleared his throat a few times, his face slightly displeased. &quot;System, I remember completing the &#x27;Humiliate the Saintess&#x27; mission last night. I should have another lottery draw.</p>
<p>Be a little more proactive next time, don&#x27;t always make me remind you.&quot; Only after hearing that did the system deign to appear. &quot;Verified that you completed the &#x27;Humiliate the Saintess&#x27; mission last night, obtaining one special lottery draw. Commencing the draw for the Host.&quot; Next, the system continuously displayed notifications. &quot;Lottery draw complete.&quot; &quot;Congratulations to the Host for obtaining a Mysterious Crystal Fragment and a Mysterious Egg (1/1). Reward distribution complete.</p>
<p>The Mysterious Egg has been automatically placed in the Host&#x27;s room. Please go and inspect.&quot; After reading, he complained in annoyance, &quot;Why is everything so mysterious?&quot; Suddenly, a blue spirit stone appeared. Taking it in his hand surprised Sibin. &quot;Is this the Mysterious Crystal Fragment? I get the feeling the system just took it from somewhere.&quot; Over on this side, a piece of someone&#x27;s pendant cracked. Ye Hao saw it and was startled.</p>
<p>Small blue frames appeared around him, numerously. Seeing this, someone shouted loudly, &quot;What is this? I&#x27;m being forcibly logged off.&quot; In front of everyone, a system notification window appeared: &quot;Game temporarily updating.&quot; Seeing this, they all started making a commotion. &quot;The game is updating!&quot; The announcement continued to appear, &quot;To further enhance the player experience, 500 slots to join the Eagle Crest Territory faction have now been opened, exclusively for new players,&quot; &quot;with new professions to choose from. Hello, welcome.&quot; Now everyone was in an uproar. &quot;What? You can even join the villain faction? Could it be because of the forced log-off just now?&quot; The bright sunlight shining down on the city made the place even more radiant.</p>
<p>A young man stretched, his face full of excitement, &quot;This time I finally got a slot for the game! The villain faction is so cool!&quot; The young man in armor standing next to him was also happy, &quot;So this is Lẫm Đông City? It&#x27;s much better than Thần Quang Town.&quot; Over here, a short-haired girl with two small ears on her head saw the young man in front of her and was overjoyed, &quot;Ah, Brother Anh Linh.&quot; The young man with a tail behind him looked at her with endless joy. &quot;Little Mai Đóa.&quot; In the distance, another young man was also smiling as he watched them, &quot;Are all the demi-humans over here?&quot; Suddenly, a hand placed on her head reminded her, &quot;You little rascal, if you want to have a reunion, wait a little longer. Lead the people to the square for me first.&quot; She had no choice but to obey. When Sibin, Rui, and Lori walked over, the soldiers automatically formed ranks, creating an open path for them. Everyone around saw this and started chattering excitedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Behind him are two gorgeous furry girls. Isn&#x27;t that our Saintess Rui? The other one is the maid Lori, right? I saw her during the attack on the city last time.&quot; Mai Đóa walked at the front and said loudly, &quot;Brothers and sisters, Anh Linh, come this way.&quot; The man standing above reminded them, &quot;Everyone, be silent.&quot; When he had stepped up, he turned to look at everyone below and introduced himself, &quot;Welcome, you Otherworlders, to the heart of Eagle Crest Territory, Lẫm Đông City. I am the head of Eagle Crest Territory, your old acquaintance, the Eagle Crest Count,&quot; &quot;or the Golden Lion.&quot; His voice rang out loudly, &quot;I have some good news to tell you all. A war is about to begin. This battle will start from the Colonial Empire and spread to every corner of the Can Continent.</p>
<p>In the days to come, you will all participate in this battle under my rule, and you will witness the rebirth of blood and fire here. Overthrow the corrupt dynasty, build a new order.&quot; After hearing this, everyone looked at each other in confusion. &quot;Is this a newly updated storyline? A large-scale world quest?&quot; At this point, his face showed a radiant confidence. &quot;Everyone, it can be said that you are all extremely lucky. Because you were summoned to Eagle Crest Territory, you will soon, along with me, bloodwash this world.&quot; After hearing this, everyone&#x27;s face broke into a bright smile, feeling incredibly excited.</p>
<p>&quot;Wreck the world with the villain? A thousand likes.&quot; &quot;Bloodwash, bloodwash, bloodwash! Lord Eagle Crest is amazing!&quot; &quot;This is great! From now on, we won&#x27;t be beaten back to level 0 by Lord Eagle Crest anymore.&quot; Standing before everyone&#x27;s cheers filled his heart with satisfaction. &quot;Being able to snatch a group of players before the great war begins, I&#x27;m also very lucky, although I was almost sidetracked by beauty.&quot; This all goes back to an hour ago. Sibin held the string with the beautiful blue spirit stone and offered it. &quot;Here, Lori, this is for you.&quot; Seeing that made Rui&#x27;s face flush red with embarrassment, &quot;Is that for me?&quot; Her eyes welled up with emotion, &quot;this is the first time anyone has ever given me a gift.&quot; He looked at her, smiled, and praised, &quot;It&#x27;s beautiful.&quot; In his head, he thought, &quot;I don&#x27;t even know what this crystal fragment I got from the lottery does, do I have to collect a full set to summon a divine dragon?&quot; Hearing this, the system explained, &quot;This mysterious crystal fragment is a part of the Rain God&#x27;s divinity. Possessing it will grant the host the ability to recruit players.&quot; The news struck him like a lightning bolt, leaving his whole body frozen like a statue.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh crap, why didn&#x27;t you say something so important sooner?&quot; The notification board continued to reply, &quot;However, most of the authority is still in Ye Hao&#x27;s hands; you only have a portion of the authority.&quot; She had just replied, &quot;Thank you, my lord, I will take good care of it,&quot; when he suddenly acted overly frantic, panickedly reaching for her chest, which surprised her. &quot;Wait, Rui.&quot; Looking closely, he saw it: there was a crack on this crystal fragment. Her face turned as red as a ripe tomato, and she turned her head, not daring to look at him. &quot;It&#x27;s okay, as long as it&#x27;s from you, I want it.&quot; Her reaction made his whole body feel like it was steaming. &quot;How can you say such things in this position?&quot; Next, he brazenly pulled her into his arms and whispered, &quot;The first gift you receive shouldn&#x27;t have any flaws.</p>
<p>I will find the most perfect gem to give you. As for this fragment, let me take it back for now.&quot; She was completely taken in by his sweet words, and her bright smile only made him feel worse about himself. &quot;Although I feel very bad for Rui, this is a very important item. Moreover, it&#x27;s something that guy Ye Hao once possessed, so I can&#x27;t let it stay on Rui.&quot; Watching the two of them being so intimate, Lori frowned and thought to herself, &quot;The atmosphere between Master and Rui is very strange. While I was looking for Ms.</p>
<p>Krissy, could Rui have been doing something sneaky behind my back?&quot; Back in reality, Sibin continued his speech, &quot;To live in Lẫm Đông City, rules are extremely important. Next, I will have someone lead you all to familiarize yourselves with the inner city, and at the same time, tell you what you should do, and what will get you killed if you so much as touch it. As you have all seen, Lẫm Đông City recently had a large influx of demi-humans immigrate here. Therefore, the fastest leveling tasks right now are mining ore, chopping trees, and building houses. There is also a large area in Lẫm Đông City with dilapidated tiled houses.</p>
<p>Your mission is to renovate these places.&quot; Hearing this, they became more curious, feeling as if they had suddenly been thrown into a simulation management game. &quot;I think this is pretty cool, the quests are here.&quot; The moment they saw the board allowing them to change job classes, they were stunned. &quot;Oh my god, there are so many!&quot; It included five different job classes: Swordsman, Knight, Divine Archer, Crusader, Priest, and all of them required level 10. He continued, &quot;In short, try your best to level up to level 10, then come find me, and I will handle your job class change.&quot; But they were no longer listening to him. Because everyone had erupted into a noisy clamor, &quot;Five job classes, a full five job classes.</p>
<p>The protagonist&#x27;s side over there only has Warrior and Mage.&quot; &quot;Nobody better stop me, I&#x27;m going to chop down every tree in Lẫm Đông City!&quot; &quot;Mining ore, mining ore!&quot; &quot;Building houses, building houses!&quot; Their reaction made Sibin extremely satisfied. &quot;Excellent. I thought I&#x27;d have to waste more breath, but I didn&#x27;t expect these players to not even see themselves as human, being so proactive.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t until he returned to his room and sat down on a chair to rest that Sibin let out a tired sigh. &quot;Phew, these players are so much trouble, it&#x27;s a real headache. Now I can finally rest.&quot; Suddenly, a girl in a red dress with a chain on her leg walked in, but since his eyes were closed, he couldn&#x27;t see who it was.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh well, I won&#x27;t think about it anymore.&quot; This led him to mistakenly call out, &quot;Lori, pour me a glass of water.&quot; The girl&#x27;s outfit was rather revealing and didn&#x27;t do much to hide her huge chest. The girl said nothing and just gently handed him the glass of water. He took it and had a sip. &quot;Thanks, but why does the tea taste different today?&quot; Seeing that the person in the room didn&#x27;t answer, he opened his eyes to look. The sight made him spit the water out of his mouth in shock.</p>
<p>Unlucky Icelia took the full force of that spray, leaving her drenched and shivering. He felt puzzled. &quot;Icelia, why are you here, and dressed like this?&quot; Her face flushed red as she replied, &quot;Lady Lori told me to change and then wait for her here. Besides, it was you, Master, who told me to dress like this.&quot; Her answer left him helpless. &quot;I...</p>
<p>I just needed the spirit mark on your abdomen to be visible. I didn&#x27;t expect that when it comes to costume design, Ms. Krissy would have such unique ideas.&quot; The perverted him couldn&#x27;t help but imagine Lori and Rui also wearing such skimpy outfits, charmingly calling out &quot;Master,&quot; hehehe. Just as he was thinking about it, the two of them entered. Lori smiled and announced, &quot;Master, we&#x27;re back.</p>
<p>Those Otherworlders have been properly settled.&quot; Seeing Icelia standing in the room startled her. &quot;Why are you here? Didn&#x27;t I tell you to stay in the first-floor corridor?&quot; Probably out of fear, her whole body trembled slightly. &quot;I... I&#x27;m sorry, Lady Lori. I heard Master say he wanted tea, so I came in to serve him.&quot; In her heart, she was a little wary, &quot;Surely, my attempt to steal the antidote won&#x27;t be exposed, right? Damn it, I turned the whole room upside down and couldn&#x27;t find anything.&quot; For some reason, all four people in the room shivered, feeling an intense cold.</p>
<p>Sibin even let out a loud, confused sneeze. &quot;Why did the room suddenly get so cold?&quot; Rui turned her head and noticed something radiating an icy aura in the corner of the room. &quot;It&#x27;s the cold air coming from that.&quot; The four of them gathered in front of the bed to look at the object. Looking at it, he remembered, &quot;I almost forgot about it.&quot; Looking at the thing made him a bit curious. &quot;This cold air is coming from the egg.</p>
<p>Could it be an ice-element magical beast?&quot; Rui&#x27;s hand touched the surface of the egg as she exclaimed, &quot;It&#x27;s so big, so big.&quot; Her expression made him give her a disdainful look. &quot;Why are you blushing?&quot; Suddenly, her face turned bright red as she replied, &quot;It&#x27;s not me, it&#x27;s that the area around this egg has become very hot.&quot; It was strange that the egg could radiate cold and heat at the same time. The scene made his face darken. &quot;What is this? A dual heaven of ice and fire?&quot; He held the egg in his arms, his face still full of bewilderment. &quot;Can two completely contradictory elemental forces really coexist peacefully inside a single creature&#x27;s body? Shouldn&#x27;t it explode?&quot; The system panel appeared with a description.</p>
<p>This egg has no name, its identity is an egg, its strength is level 20, its skills include jumping, spinning, and colliding, effective cooling, effective heating, and its equipment is an eggshell. Its reputation is with Eagle Crest, a bride to be raised from an egg. The information surprised him. &quot;A bride.&quot; Seeing the eggshell turn red made him start acting foolishly as well. &quot;Huh, what&#x27;s it doing? Did it get embarrassed from being touched? The world is truly vast and full of wonders; even an egg can get shy.&quot; He reached out, pointed at the egg, and asked, &quot;System, how do I make this egg hatch?&quot; As soon as Sibin asked, the system answered.</p>
<p>&quot;The mysterious egg likes ice and fire attribute magic cores. It also likes to be bathed and have its shell rubbed. If the host can satisfy these three conditions, then its hatching speed will be greatly increased.&quot; Lori suddenly stepped up from behind, leaned against him, and asked, &quot;Master, whose egg is this?&quot; As he turned his head, his face was smothered by her chest, leaving him frozen. Rui was about to step forward to stop her, &quot;Lori, you again,&quot; but she ignored her and interrogated him, &quot;It&#x27;s not your love child with someone, is it? How could you suddenly produce such a big egg?&quot; Hearing that, the egg trembled with anger. He had just started to explain, &quot;This is a summoned helper, like Saraken and the others— Ah!&quot; The egg angrily blasted a wave of hot air towards the three of them.</p>
<p>&quot;So hot!&quot; Meanwhile, Celia was the complete opposite, as her entire body was now being frozen. &quot;So cold!&quot; Despite the egg&#x27;s tantrum, he still wrapped himself around it, using a sweet voice to soothe it. &quot;Why such a big reaction all of a sudden? Don&#x27;t you like being bathed and having your shell rubbed? What about that maid from before... So hot! You don&#x27;t want the beast-girl maid to do it? Suddenly, he proposed, &quot;How about we assign this task to the Otherworlders? The first thing to do every morning is to have the players come and rub the eggshell. After rubbing, they hand over magic cores, and then take the egg for a bath.&quot; The egg continued to complain, &quot;So cold.&quot; The egg&#x27;s attitude started to make him agitated.</p>
<p>&quot;Is the information wrong? You don&#x27;t want your shell rubbed, you don&#x27;t want magic cores, and you don&#x27;t want to be bathed?&quot; The two girls stood silently behind him, listening to him talk to the egg. &quot;Is it that you don&#x27;t want the maid, and you don&#x27;t want the Otherworlders to rub your shell and take you for a bath?&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re only willing to let me rub your shell, and only willing to bathe with me? Ah, it&#x27;s warm now. Was I right?&quot; Rui&#x27;s face showed a hint of jealousy as she climbed onto the bed. &quot;No way, we want to go too.&quot; Lori also came forward to suggest, &quot;Rubbing the shell and helping it bathe can be left to Master. But Master&#x27;s bath must be left to us.&quot; The two of them kept making a fuss, frightening him.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, you two are suddenly causing a scene, it&#x27;s...&quot; Sibin raised his hand to stop them. &quot;Alright, we&#x27;ll talk about the bathing later. Let&#x27;s name it first.&quot; Then, he said excitedly, &quot;Since it&#x27;s still an egg right now, how about we call it Dan Dan?&quot; The moment he finished speaking, the egg angrily froze him, which the two girls found amusing. &quot;Looks like it doesn&#x27;t like it.&quot; Rui smiled and offered a suggestion, &quot;How about we call it Kang Nai? What do you think? In the demi-human language, Kang Nai means strong and noble. I hope that in the future, Kang Nai can become a strong and noble magical beast.&quot; When she finished speaking, a gust of air emanated from the egg, delighting her.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, a warm breeze, as if spring had arrived.&quot; He also comfortably enjoyed the breeze. &quot;It seems to like this name a lot. Then we&#x27;ll call it Kang Nai from now on. The naming issue is settled.&quot; Sibin opened the system and performed a few operations. &quot;Now all that&#x27;s left is to solve the food and drink problem.</p>
<p>Alright, system, I want to issue a quest to the players.&quot; The system opened. &quot;Please describe the quest content, host.&quot; He began to speak, &quot;Clear out the magical beasts around Lẫm Đông City. Anyone who collects 30 level-one ice or fire attribute magic cores can exchange them for one fine-grade piece of equipment. For other level-one magic cores, 40 are needed. If they are level-two magic cores, 10 are enough.</p>
<p>Any higher and the players won&#x27;t be able to defeat them.&quot; The system recorded everything he said. &quot;New Quest: Clear Out Magical Beasts. Ding! The quest has been published.&quot; Outside, everyone who was chopping wood and building houses saw the notification and paid close attention. &quot;What&#x27;s this? There&#x27;s a new quest?&quot; &quot;Clear out the magical beasts around Lẫm Đông City. Anyone who collects 30 level-one ice or fire attribute magic cores,&quot; &quot;can exchange them for a fine-grade piece of equipment.&quot; A young man excitedly stood up with his sword and said to another boy wearing glasses, &quot;Oh my god, this is a grand gesture from the Eagle Crest Lord! We&#x27;re only level 10 and we can already get fine-grade equipment as a reward?&quot; &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m telling you, brother, stop doing this grunt work.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go do the quest, the reward is a fine-grade piece of equipment!&quot; but he refused and continued with his work, &quot;No, you guys go ahead, I still want to slowly build and level up, all that fighting and killing is too bloody.&quot; That calm reaction left the young man speechless, &quot;Listen to you, are you really treating this as a business simulation game?&quot; The content of the recruitment notice board was very appealing. Comparing the experience between construction quests and the new beast-hunting quests, a hot topic, discussing which profession is more worth choosing, working with the demi-humans in Lẫm Đông City. One person&#x27;s hands trembled in disbelief. &quot;What? Joining Eagle Crest Territory means you can have five professions, and even fine-grade equipment.&quot; They were all in a state of confusion, some crying their eyes out, others tearing their hair out in chaos, filled with envy. &quot;Why does Eagle Crest Territory&#x27;s faction only have 500 slots? Can&#x27;t you add me? Plus one, I don&#x27;t want to stay in this main character&#x27;s camp anymore.&quot; An angry person clenched his fist and slammed it on the table, &quot;Even the demi-humans are gone, what&#x27;s the point of staying here?&quot; Ye Hao was so furious he felt like he was about to explode, &quot;That detestable Eagle Crest Lord, how dare he steal my godhood fragment.&quot; It cost me a group of heroic spirits, and moreover, all those demi-humans seem to have been taken to Lẫm Đông City.</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll be very difficult to find a second group of demi-humans. His face darkened, his eyes bloodshot, looking utterly distressed, &quot;What to do? What should I do now?&quot; Suddenly, someone called his name, making him startle and his eyes widen, &quot;Ye Hao.&quot; A mysterious figure in a black cloak appeared, &quot;I already know about the godhood matter. This is the counterattack of the Will of Can.&quot; The person wore a mask, so their features were unclear, but there were two long, blood-red lines by their eyes. A sphere resembling the Earth floated in their hand as they continued. &quot;However, it&#x27;s not like I haven&#x27;t gained anything.</p>
<p>I have finished analyzing the relic of that beast tribe. I can now grant your people the beastman profession. The current problem isn&#x27;t something that can be solved just by opening up a beastman profession.&quot; However, Ye Hao grew even angrier. The players&#x27; anti-war sentiment towards Eagle Crest Territory was already very clear. &quot;They even secretly formed an alliance with the First Prince of the Kolon Empire.</p>
<p>But what about me? I&#x27;m just a clown. Do you know what those players are saying about me on the forums? They call me the third wheel, the wronged party, a piece of trash.&quot; Despite his outburst, the figure replied calmly, &quot;The First Prince of the Kolon Empire, in order to gain power, has turned into a vampire. I can help you expose this secret of his to the people.&quot; &quot;Furthermore, your choice to deal with the Abyss is irreversible. Go cooperate with the Bakda Theocracy, get demi-humans from the Bakda Theocracy.&quot; His eyes widened as he received the plan from the figure. &quot;In the subsequent battle, you can also lead my people in a counterattack.</p>
<p>Attack the First Prince and the Eagle Crest Lord, and be the fisherman who reaps the benefits.&quot; As the figure held out a hand, surging waves appeared from within it. &quot;The slumbering deity of Can has begun to awaken. Currently, the Eagle Crest Lord has four vessels of divinity. I snatched one from the endless sea, which can help the deity who holds the power of the sea&#x27;s wrath to awaken.&quot; A golden scepter flew into Ye Hao&#x27;s hand, surprising him. &quot;If you can help the deity awaken, then before the deity returns to the divine kingdom, they can also lend you a hand.&quot; His eyes showed a serious look as he frowned and asked, &quot;Then what should I do?&quot; The figure&#x27;s voice deepened as they replied, &quot;Take this, find the demi-human named Tinh Hai, and use this to stab her in the heart.&quot; He wondered to himself, &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard this name before.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t she a demi-human from Divine Light Town?&quot; He looked at the thing before him and wondered, &quot;What is that nauseating black thing?&quot; The room was filled with swirling black smoke. The figure&#x27;s answer made him fearful, &quot;Don&#x27;t touch it. That is the filth of an Old God. Once you touch it, you will fall into endless ravings, eventually degenerating into a slave of the Old God, beyond saving.&quot; Suddenly, the system panel slowly appeared. &quot;Temporary Epic-level War Quest: Royal Capital Melee,&quot; &quot;Quest Description: Allies of the First Prince, you are preparing to attack the Royal Capital together to prevent the Pope from usurping the throne.</p>
<p>But you are unaware, the First Prince has been transformed by the undead into a special Vampire Prince. He wants to use the meat-grinder battlefield of the Royal Capital as a ritual formation to summon the terrifying Undead Scourge,&quot; &quot;using the Kolon Empire as the center to spread everywhere, until the entire central continent of Can is turned into a sea of undead.&quot; After reading, everyone was stunned. &quot;What is this? Although the Eagle Crest Lord&#x27;s side had a large-scale update, it&#x27;s reasonable for the main character&#x27;s side to get an update too.&quot; The quest board continued to display information. &quot;Ye Hao, as the Son of Heaven&#x27;s Mandate, has long seen through the First Prince&#x27;s conspiracy. He has decided to beat him at his own game.</p>
<p>At the critical moment, deal a fatal blow to the First Prince and prevent the Undead Scourge from occurring. Quest Limit: None. Quest Reward 1: Equipment of Grandmaster-grade or lower, Rare Gryphon Mount, Rare Wolf Mount, a large amount of experience points, qualification to change to the Beastman profession, equipment enhancement ticket. Quest Reward 2: Players who accept the quest can immediately receive a set of common-grade equipment and three free skill enhancement scrolls. Each scroll can replace one skill point.&quot; A young man walked up and asked, &quot;Brother X, could it be that the operators are unhappy with us abandoning the main character to ally with the First Prince?&quot; Brother X stared at the notice board and replied, &quot;That might be the case.&quot; They gathered in a group to discuss.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt this First Prince was strange from the beginning. The way he looked at me was so evil, as if he was thinking about where to start eating.&quot; &quot;It could also be a coincidence, he&#x27;s a story NPC after all. So, Brother Frog, are we taking this quest?&quot; He answered immediately: &quot;Take it. Why not? We work for whichever side gives us more benefits, that&#x27;s all there is to it.&quot; Brother Frog smiled. &quot;Besides, the quest description also makes it very clear that this Baler Frank guy is no good either.</p>
<p>This kind of setup clearly implies he sees us as food on his plate. The operators don&#x27;t want us to join him.&quot; The sky turned to dusk. Inside the room, Sibin was extremely flustered. &quot;With the players&#x27; help, the arrangements for the demi-humans are more or less done. The three Ampere Viscounts of the Andora Empire are gathering their forces.</p>
<p>The enemy either wants to take this opportunity to attack the Royal Capital, or they want to attack Eagle Crest Territory. We must be on guard.&quot; A knock on the door startled him. &quot;Who is it? Come in.&quot; Roy entered after being permitted. &quot;My Lord, I am Roy. She was wearing a maid-style dress, but it was extremely revealing.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to come talk about the demi-humans.&quot; The sight of her made his nose bleed. &quot;Dressed like this to talk?&quot; His infatuated eyes were glued to her like a fool&#x27;s. &quot;I came to thank you. The demi-humans have been living very well here these past few days. Also, about what I agreed to before, becoming your maid.&quot; He spoke up: &quot;So that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re dressed like this? Are you preparing to seduce me?&quot; She blushed all over and gave him a charming look.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not. These are Lori&#x27;s old clothes. Some parts were too small, so I altered them a bit to make them less uncomfortably tight.&quot; His nosebleed gushed like a fountain. &quot;Lori&#x27;s old clothes, what&#x27;s this about being too tight, is she hinting for me to rip it off quickly?&quot; Seeing the beautiful girl in front of him pressing close, Sibin&#x27;s mind went blank, unable to think of anything. &quot;As expected, no matter what, she is a Fox Tribe Saintess.</p>
<p>When it comes to seducing others, other tribes can&#x27;t compare.&quot; In the dark of night, somewhere, a fire blazed, sending up thick smoke. &quot;Everyone, let&#x27;s go, block the other side!&quot; A group of people was trying their best to kill a demonic beast. &quot;Killing this Blazing Fire Boar will be enough to collect 30 fire-element magic cores. We can go find the Lord to exchange for fine-grade equipment.&quot; The black-haired young man swung his sword down. &quot;Got it.&quot; A red spirit stone suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>The young man held it in his hand, extremely excited. &quot;That&#x27;s enough. Let&#x27;s hurry, the sun is about to set. Let&#x27;s go exchange for the equipment quickly.&quot; &quot;Brother Yan Xu, you&#x27;re really getting more and more skilled.&quot; Suddenly, a shout made the young man turn his head to look. &quot;Careful, ahead!&quot; A spider-shaped demonic beast crawled over.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his movements were agile, so he jumped high to dodge it, but it was enough to give him a good scare. &quot;Oh my god, what is this? It&#x27;s a level 9 Jungle Wolf Spider. Fear, Riot, Threat Level: Hard.&quot; Seeing this, the people on the side also panicked. &quot;Oh crap, a spider, a level 9 spider, it&#x27;s huge. I hate spiders, nobody likes these things.&quot; He stabbed his sword into the ground to reassure them.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone, don&#x27;t panic. With the few of us, we can still kill it.&quot; When they saw the thing, everyone was terrified, their jaws dropping. &quot;Oh my god.&quot; Someone warned him: &quot;Brother Yan, ahead, in front of you!&quot; He looked ahead and saw countless red eyes staring at him, making his hair stand on end. &quot;Oh heavens, why are there so many spiders?&quot; The wolf spiders looked at them with great craving, looking extremely terrifying. &quot;Their average level is 9.</p>
<p>We definitely can&#x27;t win against this.&quot; He was startled as he realized something. &quot;Huh, wait, something&#x27;s not right.&quot; The young man behind him shouted: &quot;Brother Yan Xu, don&#x27;t confront them head-on, come over here first!&quot; They hid behind a large rock to avoid the spiders outside and discussed. &quot;Did you guys notice anything? Next to the spiders&#x27; health bars, there are two very strange buffs: Fear and Riot. So, is a demonic beast riot going to happen?&quot; The red-haired girl asked curiously: &quot;But what would cause the demonic beasts to riot? Could it be that something is chasing them away?&quot; But he replied: &quot;Whatever the reason, this isn&#x27;t a normal situation. Therefore, this is very likely a hidden quest.&quot; His answer caused a stir among them.</p>
<p>&quot;A hidden quest? Brother Yan Xu, are you sure? I&#x27;ve never triggered a hidden quest before.&quot; He smiled confidently: &quot;Of course, how could I not be sure?&quot; The sword he had stuck in the ground began to glow. &quot;Look, this sword itself was from a hidden quest. You all have to trust me, my nose for these things is extremely accurate.&quot; The brown-haired young man asked worriedly: &quot;So what do we do now? How do we do this quest?&quot; He turned and asked the young man in return. &quot;When you encounter a hidden quest, you naturally have to find the key NPC. Who do you think the key NPC around us is?&quot; &quot;Gremont, he&#x27;s definitely at the training grounds.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t go over there without a certain rank. The maid Lori and the Saintess Roy are mostly by the Eagle Crest Lord&#x27;s side, right?&quot; After hearing that, the red-haired girl replied: &quot;Um, well then, that&#x27;s a goodbye.&quot; Her answer satisfied him. &quot;That&#x27;s right. We just need to tell him about this demonic beast riot. Then we&#x27;ll know if it&#x27;s a hidden quest or not.</p>
<p>right away. &quot; Over here, Good Bye&#x27;s face was full of vigilance. &quot; Who is it? A sneak attack in the middle of the night? Yan Xu hurriedly spoke up:. Don&#x27;t be hasty, it&#x27;s us. Seeing them surprised him:.</p>
<p>Players, it&#x27;s so late, what&#x27;s the matter? He recounted everything. When we were on a mission in the Sunset Forest, we discovered that the Jungle Wolf Spiders were rioting. Their numbers are huge, there must be hundreds of them. Right now, they are heading this way. Hearing this made him panic, but he was still suspicious.</p>
<p>&quot; What? Are you sure? This is extremely important, you can&#x27;t just say things recklessly. The spiders outside are slowly crawling towards the city. We&#x27;re sure, they really are rioting. Moreover, they&#x27;ll be here soon. If that&#x27;s the case, then stop killing demonic beasts.</p>
<p>Go back and wait for me to report to the Lord and we&#x27;ll figure it out from there. &quot; Good Bye&#x27;s footsteps were hurried as he ran like the wind. &quot; This is an emergency, this is an emergency, there can be no delay. However, just thinking of the scene of Sibin with two beauties in his arms made him so jealous he could cry a river. However, our master is a wonderful man at night.</p>
<p>As soon as he reached the door, he heard strange sounds coming from inside the room. Ah, Lord Hevey. Don&#x27;t stop. &quot; It made him break out in a cold sweat, not knowing what to do. I don&#x27;t want to be punished by having to wash underpants again.</p>
<p>The sound continued:. So comfortable. &quot; His hand on the door trembled as he started to cry. &quot; As expected, the Lord is busy. If I burst in now, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to wash underpants and socks for a year.</p>
<p>But what if I don&#x27;t go in? Inside the room, Sibin was kneeling on the bed, placing his hand on Roy&#x27;s back. See that? This strength, this technique, a massage has to be like this. If you want to serve me, you still have a lot to learn in the future. Lying prone on the bed, she replied softly:. Mm, I will practice diligently.</p>
<p>His face flushed as he watched her wrap her arms around his neck. Then, her whole body wrapped around him seductively as she said: &quot; Why don&#x27;t we... try it right now. His face full of satisfaction, he was pushed onto his back on the bed by her. &quot; This time, I will definitely master the strength.</p>
<p>&quot; He closed his eyes in enjoyment and said:. I have a feeling that mastering all kinds of strength on my spot isn&#x27;t easy. &quot; Her two hands rested on his abdomen. However, before she could do anything, he arched his body, making her tremble. My lord, my lord, don&#x27;t move around.</p>
<p>However, he quickly sat bolt upright, grabbing her in alarm. That&#x27;s not right, it&#x27;s not me, the ground is shaking. A sharp, clawed foot stomped heavily on the ground. A dragon-like demonic beast appeared with a ferocious look. Around it were spiders wolf spiders with it.</p>
<p>A knight on the wall saw it and announced in panic:. Demonic beasts are attacking the city, demonic beasts are attacking the city. With no other choice, Good Bye could only burst in, crying. Report, reporting to the Lord. Players have discovered a demonic beast riot in the forest.</p>
<p>&quot; Hearing that, he was surprised:. Then why didn&#x27;t you report to me sooner? This angered him, and he reprimanded him as he walked. For your poor performance, you will wash the entire army&#x27;s socks for a year. He had already expected this outcome, so he could only accept his fate. Yes.</p>
<p>&quot;. Next, he turned to give orders:. Roy, I&#x27;m going to the city wall to check the situation, please go and calm the demi-humans. She didn&#x27;t hesitate to stand up:. I understand, please be careful, my lord.</p>
<p>The quest panel appeared. Ding, the daily villain quest has been refreshed. Villain Quest One:. Eliminate the Courting Dragon Beast Casim. Villain Quest Two:.</p>
<p>Eliminate all the pitiful demonic beasts that were chased here to attack the city. Villain Quest Three:. Steal the treasure of the Courting Dragon Beast Casim. He hurriedly ran down the stairs in surprise:. Hmph.</p>
<p>&quot; An idea suddenly flashed in his mind:. What the hell is a Courting Dragon Beast Casim? Courting who? Pursuing who? Greemont City has no dragons. Ah. &quot; Suddenly, Sibin remembered the presence of the egg: &quot; That&#x27;s not right, although they say Greemont City has no dragons, there is a suspicious egg. Could it be that there&#x27;s a dragon inside? His face lit up as he imagined a cute dragon girl: &quot; The system is giving me a dragon girl? So exciting, is it really possible? He rushed outside with his sword and ordered:.</p>
<p>Attention everyone, all personnel to the city walls to defend the city, listen to the command of Clement and Ben. They were surprised to see him:. My Lord. He stood on a high platform and ordered them: &quot; All players and Crusaders, follow me out of the city to meet the enemy. Defend Greemont City, Bloodhoof Clan protect the Priest Legion, follow me closely, open the city gates.</p>
<p>The system began to announce:. Ding, a hidden quest has been activated. Follow the Eagle Crest Lord out of the city to fight the beast tide, protect Greemont City. Quest Reminder:. The number of monsters is very large, follow the Eagle Crest Lord&#x27;s footsteps closely, perhaps you will live longer.</p>
<p>The Priest Legion has healing abilities, if you are caught by a monster, you can ask a priest for help. Quest Reward One:. A large amount of experience points, fine-grade equipment exchangeable with demonic cores. Quest Reward Two:. The top five players who kill the most monsters will have a chance to be taught skills by the Eagle Crest Lord.</p>
<p>Eagle Crest Lord&#x27;s favorability with you +10, reaching Normal. Current favorability is zero. After reading it, the players were excited:. Oh my god, a hidden quest really was activated. Brother Yan, we brothers will follow you this time.</p>
<p>If favorability reaches 100, can we romance the Eagle Crest Lord? &quot; &quot; Brother, what&#x27;s your sexual orientation? Suddenly, a loud noise rang out, startling them: &quot; Quick, quick, look over there, what kind of monster is that? It&#x27;s so huge. The dragon&#x27;s bloodshot eyes stared at them, even its roar was terrifying. Warning: &quot; World Boss Casimi has been discovered, the World Boss raid quest has begun. &quot; Quest Objective:. Under the leadership of the Eagle Crest Lord, eliminate the Dragon Beast Casimi, end the beast tide.</p>
<p>Quest Rewards:. A huge amount of experience points. A chance for a sub-dragon blood bath, various rare materials, the title of Leg-Washing Ambassador. Quest Reminder:. Follow the Eagle Crest Lord&#x27;s footsteps, he beheads...</p>
<p>&quot; everyone added on. Sibin&#x27;s glowing figure flew over, surprising two guys:. Oh my god, it&#x27;s a World Boss. Whoa, it looks so big. But the girl next to them was confused:.</p>
<p>What does this reminder related to the Eagle Crest Lord mean? His whole body emitting a brilliant golden light, he flew towards the dragon beast: &quot; I don&#x27;t care what kind of World Boss you are, you can&#x27;t steal my little dragon. The beast is currently at level 52 Nightmare, its health bar reached 20,000, making everyone also stunned: &quot; Holy crap, this health bar, why is it so long? Level 52. Nightmare-level threat? Is that all? I thought it would be much stronger. Hey everyone, its wings are so small, could it have been born prematurely? Suddenly, it opened its huge mouth, and fire rushed out, wanting to burn everyone:. Damn it, why does this flame effect look so real? Then, it raised its giant hand, making them run away in fear:.</p>
<p>Get out of the way, it&#x27;s going to stomp on us. Just as that hand was about to grab a young man, for some reason it stopped. It turned out that Sibin had arrived in time and was holding its tail. The dragon beast roared angrily, with the meaning: &quot; Detestable, how dare you grab the tail of the great, terrifying, and evil dragon Casim. You insect will pay the price for your ignorant actions.</p>
<p>It was so angry that a fiercely glowing fireball appeared inside its mouth. But he was not afraid and held its tail tightly:. Since you like to talk so big, have a taste of yourself. &quot; Saying that, he brutally and unexpectedly shoved its tail into its mouth, making it drool everywhere and whimper pitifully. Next, he stood on its head, raising his glowing sword: &quot; The game is over, go die.</p>
<p>His hand came down, slashing its horn, reducing its health by 5888, leaving only 14112. It was terrified:. Luckily I dodged quickly, this insect cannot be underestimated, run away. &quot; No sooner said than done, it immediately turned and fled cowardly, making everyone hurriedly throw their weapons at it:. Don&#x27;t let the boss get away.</p>
<p>The Eagle Crest Lord is so scary, he took out 1/4 of its health in just two hits. Use chain hooks. Use the chain hooks, listen to my command, aim carefully and throw the chains together, then find a place to hook on and pull tight. One, two, throw. &quot; As soon as the words were out, a series of chain hooks were continuously launched.</p>
<p>In the end, it couldn&#x27;t avoid being tied up. They held the chains tightly together to prevent its escape and shouted:. My Lord, finish it, we&#x27;ll help you hold it down. Use your ultimate, use your ultimate. Sibin began to use his Converging Sword Qi skill, his whole body surging with power.</p>
<p>Behind him, a giant golden lion appeared, opening its mouth wide, full of sharp teeth, looking very frightening. Then that stream of power shot like the wind towards Casim. The power wrapped around its whole body like a rope, making it scream. The scene made them gasp in shock:. We won, so cool, such a big and long sword qi.</p>
<p>Besides, they were rejoicing as victory drew nearer: &quot; It still had 3/4 of its health, and he killed it with just one sword strike. Is this the damage of a Berserker. From this day on, I am the Eagle Crest Lord&#x27;s puppy. Don&#x27;t you all fight me for the position of his number one puppy. Watching the falling specks of light, he frowned in thought:.</p>
<p>That ultimate skill just now was not only magnificent but also extremely powerful, but the charging time is too long. I don&#x27;t usually use it, so this time, the players&#x27; coordinated operation was not bad. They controlled the dragon beast, bought time, and achieved the required support effect. Then he ordered:. System, distribute the rewards now.</p>
<p>Immediately, a golden circle descended. Everyone looked at it in surprise:. It&#x27;s real, this is the sub-dragon blood, my level is increasing. I&#x27;ve obtained Primary Giant Strength. Woof woof, thank you, my Lord.</p>
<p>The system issued an announcement to everyone:. World Boss Casim has been killed, the defeater is the Eagle Crest Lord. All participating players will receive rewards based on their contribution level. In this battle, you restricted Casim&#x27;s movement, creating an opportunity for the Eagle Crest Lord. You have gained 15,000 experience points.</p>
<p>Congratulations on obtaining the title &quot;Leg-Washing Ambassador&quot;. Congratulations on receiving a sub-dragon blood bath. After the sub-dragon blood bath, your skills and level have been significantly increased. Casim&#x27;s dismembered parts lay on the ground, making everyone gather around excitedly to touch and see: &quot; Is this the World Boss&#x27;s claw? Take a picture. Post it on the forums, look at the quality of this material.</p>
<p>Half of the materials really belong to us? The Eagle Crest Lord is so generous. Sibin stood with his arms crossed, observing the situation from the side. It&#x27;s good that they&#x27;re voluntarily cleaning up the battlefield, but letting the players take such high-grade materials is a waste. System, if players provide the materials, can you craft equipment for them? The system appeared to answer his query: Ding, after obtaining the mysterious crystal shard, through a series of analyses and refinements of the crystal shard, a large number of player-related features have now been unlocked. Materials obtained by players can be converted into villain points.</p>
<p>Players can use materials to craft equipment, but it will consume the host&#x27;s villain points. The answer made him a bit curious: Materials can be converted into villain points? Then can the materials I obtain be converted into villain points? But the system replied that it was not possible. Seeing this, he asked again: What if I give the materials to the players, and then the players submit them? The system analyzed for a moment before replying: Host, please do not look for loopholes in the system to bend the rules. Converting materials into villain points will be based on the actual value of the materials themselves. The higher the grade of the material, the greater the loss.</p>
<p>100 grams of boar teeth will convert to 10 points, while 10,000 grams of dragon claws will get you 100 points. After reading, he rubbed his chin thoughtfully: So that&#x27;s how it is, then forget it. System, set up a feature for me where consuming materials can enhance equipment, and let&#x27;s set the success rate at 20% for now. The system received the command and presented a panel: The enhancement feature template has been uploaded. Enhancing equipment requires four materials, s or no.</p>
<p>&quot; But he wasn&#x27;t a fool who could be tricked: You want to spend my villain points? No way. Crafting equipment? Failing once or twice is reasonable, right? Thinking of this, his expression brightened: By then, players will spend five portions of materials to succeed once. I&#x27;ll take the other four portions, convert them into villain points, and I won&#x27;t be at a loss anymore. So much money to be made. The news of Casim&#x27;s defeat was also announced: Breaking news, Greemont City, a world boss has appeared, after bathing in sub-dragon blood.</p>
<p>&quot; My stats, after bathing in sub-dragon blood, my stats! From now on, I am the number one dog of the Eagle Crest Lord. &quot; A person in a black cloak and a few eggs on the ground were surrounded by a group of people: &quot;These Greemont City players are getting more and more outrageous. I can&#x27;t believe they even got a hidden world boss quest. In comparison, look, what&#x27;s our hidden quest? It&#x27;s up to fate, everything is up to fate.&quot; The person in the cloak said to them: &quot;How about it? As long as you all complete the mission, each of you will get a carnivorous bird egg. &quot;.</p>
<p>They are not only excellent combat companions, but also very advantageous mounts. A sudden announcement was made, a hidden quest has been activated. Quest objective: Escort the demi-humans to the target location. Quest description. The mysterious person agreed to escort these demi-humans deep into the forest near Divine Light Town.</p>
<p>However, this mysterious person seems to have urgent matters to attend to and cannot complete this mission. He hopes to use the carnivorous bird eggs to hire you. Mission limit: 10 people. Mission reward. 10,000 experience points, carnivorous bird egg.</p>
<p>Note: This is a unique quest, please do not share it with others, or the mission reward will disappear. &quot;Alright, stop complaining. After all, the reward is a rare mount. Although it&#x27;s very rare, does anyone want to ride a carnivorous bird?&quot; A man with sturdy muscles said loudly. &quot;No matter what, it&#x27;s just an escort mission, it probably won&#x27;t be too difficult.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll take this mission.&quot; After saying that, he looked over at a group of people standing there smiling at him. &quot;But I have a question, what are you demi-humans doing running to such a gloomy forest?&quot; The slightly naive-looking young man replied, &quot;Respected adventurer, we are demi-humans from the royal capital. We came here to search for the demi-human&#x27;s sacred relic. This is extremely important to us, I hope you can help us.&quot; Hearing this, he laughed, gave a thumbs-up, and readily agreed, &quot;Alright, alright, we will protect you all and escort you to a safe place.&quot; But he didn&#x27;t notice that far in the distance, behind a tree, a figure was watching them. That person was Ye Hao, holding a sword with a fierce expression, thinking to himself, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, players, this is the only way I can reduce the chance of being exposed to a minimum.&quot; Unexpectedly, the sword in his hand trembled and spoke, &quot;Hungry, hungry, eat, eat everything, souls.&quot; It made him break out in a cold sweat, &quot;Hungry again?&quot; A while later, after he had returned to his room, he sighed to himself, &quot;Really, where am I supposed to find so many souls?&quot; He walked over and opened a cabinet.</p>
<p>Inside, two girls were tied up, trembling with fear. &quot;And it only eats the souls of infants and young demi-human girls. If this sword wasn&#x27;t so powerful, I would have thrown it away long ago.&quot; Despite them trembling in fear, he showed not a shred of pity. &quot;Don&#x27;t blame me. Being weak is a sin, just like my current self.&quot; The sword continuously emitted sounds, &quot;Want, want to eat.&quot; Deep in the two girls&#x27; eyes, one could see that despair had completely taken over.</p>
<p>His voice was soft yet incredibly terrifying, &quot;By any means necessary, I must become stronger.&quot; After he spoke, the scene turned completely red with blood. It was understood that the two unfortunate girls had lost their lives at the hands of Ye Hao. Inside the forest, a group of people had gathered to start the mission. &quot;Brothers, why is this forest so gloomy? It was normal before. I don&#x27;t know what happened, even the trees are all tilted and crooked.&quot; One person among them looked at them, a little scared, &quot;Demi-human brothers, you all are really calm.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t you scared?&quot; The muscular guy looked at the system notification panel, &quot;We&#x27;ve arrived at the location marked on the map.&quot; In front of them was a strange circle, and in the middle of the circle was the shape of a red eye. &quot;We&#x27;ve finally arrived. Why is the pattern on the ground so strange?&quot; The young demi-human man and the other demi-humans suddenly broke into a bizarre smile, &quot;Thank you very much for your help. Brave adventurers, this is the location where the sacred relic once appeared. We will search around here.</p>
<p>You may all leave now.&quot; However, he didn&#x27;t sense anything strange in that smile and started to leave, &quot;That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s not convenient for outsiders to see the demi-humans&#x27; sacred relic. If you need any help in the future, you can find us again.&quot; Suddenly, the young demi-human man grabbed a girl&#x27;s hand and said, &quot;Well, then, let&#x27;s begin.&quot; However, that was just a pretense. In reality, they were hiding behind a bush to observe the group of demi-humans gathered around the circle, performing some kind of ritual. &quot;Everyone feels it&#x27;s strange too, right? Their smiles are so fake. Plus, every single one of them is smiling.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s so funny.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s true. Seeing them smile gives me goosebumps down my back.&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s movement, look quickly.&quot; From within the circle, a head that looked like a dragon&#x27;s with blood-red, demonic eyes appeared, but they didn&#x27;t stop and continued to chant something. &quot;Great Abyss General Fenton, your loyal servant Xiana is here to offer a sacrifice to you. Please open the gate to the Abyss.&quot; The monster&#x27;s hideous appearance became clearer and clearer, frightening anyone who looked at it. That monster turned out to be a gate.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s called the Abyss Teleportation Gate, but the inside was pitch black, so there was no telling where it led. After witnessing that scene, he urgently said to everyone, &quot;Brothers, quickly stop these demi-humans! Don&#x27;t let them enter that gate! It&#x27;s highly likely they&#x27;ve been brainwashed.&quot; The demi-human young man who was smiling amicably earlier discovered them behind him, &quot;Adventurers, what do you think you&#x27;re doing?&quot; His face tensed as he retorted, &quot;What are we doing? Do you know what you&#x27;re doing? This is the Abyss Teleportation Gate! Do you want to go in there and become food for demons?&quot; The demi-human girl, with a bewildered face, wanted to walk towards the gate but her hand was grabbed by him, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re saying. We&#x27;re just on our way home. Returning to the nation of the great General Felong.&quot; He tried to make them understand, &quot;Doing this, you&#x27;re walking right into the belly of a demon.&quot; Suddenly, a giant, crimson arm emerged from the gate and sent him flying with a single punch. The owner of the arm stepped out.</p>
<p>It was a level 40 Demon General in the form of a large, white skeleton. Upon seeing it, they broke out in a terrified sweat, &quot;A level 40 Demon General.&quot; Because he was punched, they worriedly turned to look at him, &quot;Brother Nhat Xuyen Cuong Ban, are you okay?&quot; It seemed the blow didn&#x27;t affect him much, as he was able to stand up strongly and reply, &quot;I&#x27;m fine. One person, knock out those demi-humans and save them! Then find a chance to slip away and inform Brother Frog.&quot; He turned to look at it and shouted, &quot;Chop its legs! Chop its legs!&quot; The young man immediately complied, and one slash deducted 375 from its health. Next, another person used a sword to slash at its underside, deducting up to 769 from its health. &quot;Nice! Take a &#x27;Thousand Years of Death&#x27; from me.&quot; Surrounded by them, it grew angrier.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my god, brothers, it&#x27;s a critical hit! This spot is a weak point, come and stab it!&quot; Being stabbed in the back by multiple swords at once made it cry out in pain. Finally, unable to bear it any longer, it fell to the ground amidst his mockery, &quot;Is that all you&#x27;ve got? It seems the strength of demons isn&#x27;t all that great. Brothers, let&#x27;s hurry and get these demi-humans out of here.&quot; Suddenly, a shadow appeared and cursed, &quot;Useless trash.&quot; They still didn&#x27;t understand what was happening and asked in confusion, &quot;What was that sound?&quot; Just as they weren&#x27;t paying attention, a pitch-black hand with sharp claws reached out. With just a light slam, it deducted 7856 and 3924 from their health. The young man, after being hit, was still dazed and didn&#x27;t understand, &quot;Brother Nhat Xuyen Cuong Ban, what happened? Why is everything black? We&#x27;re dead.&quot; His eyes were shut tight in resignation, &quot;How could we not be dead? A level 78 Demon General...</p>
<p>it wiped us out with just one hand. It seems our rescue attempt this time was a complete failure.&quot; A series of notifications appeared. It reached out its hand and grabbed a few people. Then it slowly pulled them through the gate. Name: Fenton Kulisso Najievon.</p>
<p>Identity: Demon General. Strength: Level 78 Abyss Lord. 61 to 80, Champion. Others: Not yet available. On the other side, a person was continuously knocking on the door, calling out loudly, &quot;Big Brother Ye Hao, are you there?&quot; Ye Hao, looking tired, scratched his head and came out, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot; Seeing him come out, Brother Frog said, &quot;So sorry to bother you while you&#x27;re resting.</p>
<p>We killed a Demon General and got three demon crystals. We wanted to ask you to take a look and see how much they&#x27;re worth, and if we can exchange them for some equipment?&quot; The news shocked him. &quot;A Demon General.&quot; So he wondered to himself, &quot;Could it be that the players didn&#x27;t obediently escort the demi-humans to the Abyss Teleportation Gate? Or did they get into a conflict with the demons in the teleportation gate?&quot; Seeing his face darken and that he said nothing, he also fell silent. a few seconds later, he asked with concern, big brother Ye Hao, what&#x27;s wrong? The question startled him back to his senses, and he forced a smile, no, it&#x27;s nothing, I&#x27;m just happy for everyone, is that so? You all managed to work together to kill a three-headed hellhound? That must be at least a mid-rank demon existence, right? He reached out to take the item from Brother Frog&#x27;s hand, come on, give me the demon crystal, if so, its demon crystal is worth 500 gold coins. One can be exchanged for about five sets of fine equipment, if it&#x27;s a high-rank demon, one demon crystal is worth 1000 gold coins, and can be exchanged for 10 sets of fine equipment from me.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Brother Frog waved and smiled goodbye, thanks, I&#x27;ll go discuss it with the other aberrants then, if we want to trade, we&#x27;ll come find you later. He also smiled in reply, do your best. However, Brother Frog&#x27;s face suddenly turned serious, contrary to his bright smile from a moment ago. Nhat Xuyen Cuong Ban saw him return and asked curiously, oh, you&#x27;re back, how did it go, Brother Frog, did you find anything out? He replied, somewhat dejectedly, I couldn&#x27;t find anything out, I just have a suspicion. Brother Frog told everyone, I suspect Ye Hao is the man in black you all were talking about, the news surprised everyone.</p>
<p>He widened his eyes in disbelief, are you crazy? How could that be? Isn&#x27;t he the protagonist? Brother Frog seriously told everyone his reasoning, think about it carefully, Divine Light Town is just a very small place in Eagle Crest Territory, why would the demons build a separate teleportation gate here? If it&#x27;s for the demi-humans of Divine Light Town, that doesn&#x27;t make much sense, because almost all the demi-humans of Eagle Crest Territory are now in Greemont City. Plus, those demi-humans came from the Royal Capital, so the mysterious person who gave that quest must be an insider from Divine Light Town, and is also colluding with the Royal Capital. After hearing those words, he was also completely convinced, that makes sense, the girl next to him wondered, then why do you think it&#x27;s Ye Hao? Brother Frog didn&#x27;t hesitate to explain, after playing the game for so many days, hidden quests are activated either by players thinking they are, or they come from Ye Hao, or are related to Ye Hao. Of course, the Greemont Castle side is an exception. After hearing this, the group became dejected and gloomy.</p>
<p>The most obvious thing is, this mysterious person understands players too well, knew that we had our mounts stolen not long ago, and knows how to use carnivorous bird eggs to entice people&#x27;s hearts. Nhat Xuyen Cuong Ban finally believed his reasoning, so the man in black can only be Ye Hao. Hearing this, the girl sighed sadly, I can&#x27;t believe the protagonist is the villain. Although there have been quite a few games like this recently. The bald guy next to them asked, the Greemont Castle side is playing a business simulation.</p>
<p>Are we on this side playing an adventure puzzle? But Brother Frog quickly instructed them, this isn&#x27;t urgent, call up all the remaining people first. We should probably go to the First Prince&#x27;s castle to gather. Hearing this, they immediately accepted the order, yes, Brother Frog. As he turned to leave, an interested smile appeared on Brother Frog&#x27;s face, a hypocritical protagonist, a straightforward villain, this game is getting more and more interesting. On this side, a group of people was assembling in neat rows, My Lord, the expeditionary force has fully assembled, please give your instructions.</p>
<p>He replied, I know. Behind Sibin was an entire army ready to fight alongside him, the entire army will march out. With that, he pointed his sword straight to the sky, full of confidence and determination to win the battle. The scene changes to inside a castle where a young man is holding a girl in his arms as a knight approaches to report. Your Highness, the lords, they, they should be arriving soon.</p>
<p>The young man just replied quietly, I know. He was a handsome, fair-skinned, golden-haired young man, so much so that the girl couldn&#x27;t help but look at him with an infatuated gaze. Let them come, let them all come, the more the better, the more that come, the more will die, and the smoother my plan will go. Suddenly, he bared his blood-red fangs and moved close to the girl&#x27;s neck, but the girl, unaware of what was happening, was still smiling. Father, I never wanted to do this, it was you who forced me.</p>
<p>How am I inferior to that useless Second Prince? If it weren&#x27;t for you, I wouldn&#x27;t have turned into this current form that is neither human nor ghost. I clearly dedicated everything to this nation. Bright red blood splattered out, he had now transformed into the appearance of a vampire with fresh blood staining his mouth. The poor girl thus lost her life completely in his hands. As expected, only blood thralls and the undead are loyal.</p>
<p>Outside, an army of soldiers, each holding a weapon, stood in neat rows. A man with a potbelly announced, after many days, I am very happy to see everyone gathered at this fortress again. The First Prince will not forget the loyalty of all of you. Inside the room, everyone was gathered and seated, listening. Sibin cursed inwardly, loyalty in your dreams.</p>
<p>But the man continued to speak loudly, currently, the lords of Roder Territory, Monte Territory, and Wolf Fang Territory have defected to the Holy See. Their armies are also protecting their respective territories, forming the first line of defense against an attack on the Royal Capital. The most important thing we need to do is to break this defensive line, and then jointly attack the Royal Capital. The more he spoke, the more unpleasant his expression became. I will now assign the attack missions to everyone.</p>
<p>Earl Eagle Crest, Earl Most, your two armies are the largest, attack the largest territory, Roder, together. The young man sitting next to him maintained a smile on his face as he listened to the assignments. Viscount Fitt and Baron One of Tulip Territory will follow me and the First Prince&#x27;s fortress army to attack Monte Territory. Finally, Earl Frost Wolf and Viscount Fengxin, along with the aberrants, you will all attack Wolf Fang Territory together. Hearing this, two men inside whispered to each other, perhaps in the future, everyone will have to go to Earl Eagle Crest to earn a living.</p>
<p>Ye Hao is no good, and the First Prince is no better. His voice continued to ring out, the other minor nobles who only have titles but no territory. You just need to lead your troops and follow your respective lords. After capturing the three territories, gather at the designated location, are there any other questions? Suddenly, the blue-haired Earl Mong, with a mocking expression, stroked his beard and said, First Prince, rest assured, in terms of military strength, no one can compare to me. I will definitely capture Roder Territory quickly.</p>
<p>Earl Eagle Crest, a pleasure to cooperate with you. Sibin also smiled friendly, I also hope that you can remain this happy forever. The man held a sparkling blue orb in his hand and presented it, the battle situation is urgent, all lords please proceed to your attack positions before noon. I have already drawn the subsequent assembly point on a simple map, this is a communication crystal. After everyone arrives, just use this to report back to me.</p>
<p>Earl Mong, sitting next to him, spoke up, rest assured, I will report to the First Prince in a timely manner. He reached out his hand to take the orb, but suddenly it flew into Sibin&#x27;s hand. This scene made him so angry his face turned red and he gritted his teeth. Why was the communication crystal given to Earl Eagle Crest and not me? My soldiers are clearly the most numerous. Is Earl Eagle Crest Calang&#x27;s father? Outside, the sun was glaring, and seeing Sibin&#x27;s majestic figure standing with Lori and Rui was even more of an eyesore to him.</p>
<p>This kind of little brat who has to bring maids to a battle, I&#x27;m afraid he won&#x27;t even know how he died. Next, he turned his head to look at his own soldiers and smiled smugly, anyway, my army is large, I just need to force Earl Eagle Crest to hand over the communication crystal. Once he sees my army, he won&#x27;t dare to resist. When it&#x27;s time to attack the city, I&#x27;ll let the army of Eagle Crest Territory be the cannon fodder. Hehe, at that time, not only will his army be mine, but his women will be mine too.</p>
<p>After finalizing his plan, he took the initiative to walk over and start a conversation. I say, Earl Eagle Crest. Seeing him talking to him, Sibin also asked, oh, Earl Mong, is there something you need? His face was flushed as he gave a perverted smile, you see the troops behind me, don&#x27;t you? An item like the communication crystal should be held by the main force. However, Sibin didn&#x27;t comply and instead stood there with his hands on his hips and burst out laughing, I told you so, ha ha ha, so what if I don&#x27;t? Seeing him refuse so bluntly surprised him. The flag, the Golden Lion battle flag, are those all soldiers from Eagle Crest Territory? Didn&#x27;t you say you only brought a few troops? Seeing this, Sibin adopted a teasing tone, that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s just a few, just this many, I don&#x27;t even know if they can withstand the magic cannons of Roder City.</p>
<p>So, Earl Mong, from now on, you will follow my command, right? Let me use your soldiers as sacrifices. Earl Mong acted as if he heard a joke and mocked him, yes, that&#x27;s right, ha ha, you little brat, you think I would say that? But Sibin wasn&#x27;t angry and just stood there looking at him. Earl Mong was boasting about himself, who do you think you are? I am the great Earl Mong. when suddenly he was pierced by a sharp object, sending blood splattering everywhere, and he also spat out a mouthful of blood. Sibin calmly watched as two black-clad knights skewered Earl Mong to death and muttered softly, as expected, he doesn&#x27;t know his place.</p>
<p>However, the soldiers standing below were terrified. What, what? Earl Eagle Crest, are you insane? How dare you kill the Earl, avenge the Earl. The swords in the hands of the two black-clad knights were enveloped in a terrifying aura of power, but when did those knights appear beside him? He didn&#x27;t give them a chance to be surprised for long as the two knights flew over and unleashed immense power like lightning bolts striking down on them. Ahh, ahh. Next, a knight pointed his sword directly at them, sending a chill of fear through everyone.</p>
<p>How about it? The sight of them being subdued by him was amusing to Sibin. Surrender or die directly? Forced to choose, they stammered, I, we. With no other choice, they had to choose the option that would save their lives, we are willing to obey the orders of Earl Eagle Crest, we will go through mountains of daggers and seas of fire. We will never refuse. The answer made Sibin smile with satisfaction, very good, much wiser than your Earl Mong was.</p>
<p>Outside a sturdy fortress wall, Sibin had moved there on his warhorse, he observed it carefully for a moment then spoke slowly, I have arrived at the attack point. But on each wall of Roder Territory, there are 10 destruction-grade magic cannons, their power is extremely strong, attacking the city will be incredibly difficult. All the walls of all the core territories of the Royal Capital are like this, use the lives of soldiers to besiege it, no matter what method you use. As long as you can reach the designated assembly point in three days, it will be fine. Then he thought to himself, then what&#x27;s the use of you as the operational commander? A low-level tactic like trading lives for the objective even requires a special communication crystal for this? I can&#x27;t understand how this pig-headed Calang became a general.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, Rui ran over and called out, My Lord, I think I can solve your problem. He gently pinched her cheek, teasing, &quot;Oh, what brilliant idea does my Knight of Time have?&quot; which made her immediately correct him, &quot;Don&#x27;t joke at times like this, really.&quot; Then, she suddenly spoke in a serious and direct tone, &quot;What I want to say is, if we can get close to the city wall, you can let me use Time Stagnation to reduce the time. This range has a maximum radius of 10 meters, which should be enough for us to enter Roder City.&quot; This made him a bit doubtful, and he hurriedly asked, &quot;You want to use your awakening skill?&quot; Sibin was so worried that he hastily jumped off his horse, grabbed her arm tightly, and frantically asked, &quot;If you use that, your body... You really don&#x27;t have to force yourself like this. I can definitely think of another way,&quot; which made her answer with some embarrassment, &quot;Um, maybe...&quot; Then, the young lady sighed softly and expressed her feelings, &quot;I want to help you, can I?&quot; As soon as she finished speaking, his cheeks flushed red as he softly called, &quot;Roy.&quot; His mood brightened up considerably as he hugged her tightly and replied with a smile, &quot;I understand.</p>
<p>In that case, I will now have the aberrants and Mong&#x27;s soldiers launch a frontal assault on the city wall to draw their fire. You absolutely must not force yourself, okay?&quot; Seeing him agree, she also beamed and said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then the system suddenly announced, &quot;Ting! Attention players, an epic-level war quest has now been announced: Attack Roder City. Quest Description: Because Roder City has destruction-level magic cannons, to complete the decapitation strike plan, Lord Eagle Crest requires you to lead Mong&#x27;s army and attract the enemy&#x27;s attention on the city wall. Be careful to avoid the attacks of the magic cannons. This quest has an extremely high risk of death.</p>
<p>Quest Objective: Launch a fearless, all-out assault on the main wall of Roder City. Quest Rewards: Experience points, equipment enhancement vouchers, equipment lottery vouchers. Quest Reminder: Please be careful to avoid the attacks of the magic cannons, they will cause you great harm.&quot; However, the players, whose fighting spirit was already boiling, all spoke nonchalantly as if they didn&#x27;t know the meaning of fear, &quot;What&#x27;s the risk of death to us? As long as this fine set of gear gets enhanced again, lottery vouchers... the hearts of us gamblers are burning up. Destroy Roder City!&quot; At this moment, inside a room, a subordinate respectfully reported, &quot;My Lord, there&#x27;s new intelligence.</p>
<p>Over 10,000 soldiers have appeared outside the city and are launching an attack on Roder City.&quot; After looking at it, not only was he not flustered, but he just sighed contemptuously, &quot;10,000... over 10,000 soldiers want to take Roder City? Is there something wrong with that Calang&#x27;s head? Truly a pipe dream.&quot; Seeing this, his subordinate asked quizzically, &quot;My Lord, could there be a trap in this?&quot; Hearing that, he just replied calmly, &quot;There&#x27;s definitely a trap. But on the other hand, it also shows that the enemy&#x27;s forces are insufficient to assault Roder City head-on. If that&#x27;s the case, we just need to defend the city, no matter what happens. Do not go out of the city to engage them.</p>
<p>Right now, most of our manpower is in the Royal Capital. The destruction-level magic cannons on the city wall are our greatest advantage.&quot; The continuously firing magic cannons made the players discuss uncomfortably, &quot;Damn, ugh, the effects in this game are top-notch. Stop blowing up, keep moving forward. Watch out for the magic cannons. Brothers who respawn, remember to find the priest for a shield.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t let the soldiers on the wall rest. We have to buy time for the Lord.&quot; Sibin, also observing the situation from the outside, could only shake his head and sigh. &quot;The players at the front are wasting their efforts. Over here, there are only two soldiers guarding the Saraken magic cannon. We can make our move.&quot; Finally, Saraken got his chance to shine and quickly rushed forward with its size, saying eagerly, &quot;Hey, please watch me, Saraken.&quot; &quot;crush these insects,&quot; causing the soldiers on the city wall to scream in fear, &quot;Ahhh, enemy attack! Fire the cannon, quick, fire the cannon!&quot; Seeing that this was the right moment, Roy immediately stepped forward to cast, &quot;Time Stagnation.&quot; He also began to assign tasks, &quot;Everyone, split up and eliminate the enemy.</p>
<p>Quickly seize the city wall.&quot; So they didn&#x27;t dare to hesitate, replying, &quot;As you command!&quot; then dashed forward, while the enemy could only wonder in suspicion, &quot;What... what is this?&quot; The enemy troops frantically asked, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with the cannon? Why has it suddenly become so slow?&quot; Seeing this, he also hurriedly reminded her, &quot;We&#x27;ve broken through, Roy. You don&#x27;t have to force yourself anymore.&quot; At this point, she was also exhausted, coughing, with blood flowing out, trying to reassure him, &quot;I... I&#x27;m fine. You...</p>
<p>you go do your thing first.&quot; While he, full of worry, looked at her with pity and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t say anything. Rest. Leave the rest to me.&quot; Although it was extremely chaotic outside the city, the old man was still enjoying himself with some courtesans. One of them even carefully reminded him, &quot;My Lord, there are enemies.&quot; But he just replied indifferently, &quot;I know there are enemies, outside the city wall. No need for that lovely face to worry.</p>
<p>Now, bring the snacks here. Let&#x27;s play the grape-feeding game again.&quot; Hearing this, a guard rushed in to report urgently, &quot;No, my Lord! It&#x27;s other enemies, on the city wall! Our other city walls have fallen! The enemy is incredibly strong. We can&#x27;t fight back, we can only be killed.&quot; Only then did he exclaim in a panic, &quot;What? Where is the mage corps? And my honor guard and sky knights?&quot; This man also reported honestly, &quot;Your mage corps was transferred to the Royal Capital. You said you didn&#x27;t need an honor guard, that the maids were enough. The Lord Sky Knights said...</p>
<p>said that with the destruction-level magic cannons, even a pig could guard the city wall, so they went to the tavern to drink.&quot; He trembled with anger and shouted, &quot;What... what?! These bastards! So what am I supposed to do now?&quot; Then he angrily pushed the courtesan in his arms away, making her scream in pain, &quot;Ah!&quot; At this moment, Sibin had also found his way to the old man&#x27;s den and leaped in, saying, &quot;Look at this!&quot; which made the frightened old man quickly push a maid in front of him to block the full force of the attack, causing her to scream in agony, &quot;Ugh!&quot; then he cursed angrily, &quot;Damn it!&quot; Next, this cunning old man stubbornly cast a special move to block his attack, then said confidently, &quot;This is a magic shield of the Archmage level. I used the hide of a high-grade blackwater crocodile magic beast, a sophisticated and complex magic formation, and infused it with magic power for seven days and seven nights to create it. Moreover, a second one has never been made since. If it could be shattered so easily by you, what would be the point?&quot; Hearing that, he sneered, pointed upwards, and asked, &quot;Can&#x27;t be broken, right?&quot; His attitude, as icy as ever, he directly cast a skill and shouted, &quot;Smash it hard for me!&quot; Lord Roder, after taking a thorough beating, had to hastily say, &quot;Stop...</p>
<p>stop! I surrender, ugh.&quot; The system announced, &quot;Ting! The first phase of the Attack Roder City quest has been completed. All players have received 10,000 experience points and three equipment enhancement vouchers. Please go to NPC Khang Lai to use them. Five equipment lottery vouchers, please go to NPC An Xa to use them. The progress of the Attack Roder City quest has been updated.</p>
<p>Phase two quest: Launch an all-out assault. Quest Rewards: Equipment enhancement vouchers times three, equipment lottery vouchers times five, 5,000 experience points. Favorability with Lord Eagle Crest +1. Quest Reminder: Please use the siege rams to break open the city gate, creating an attack opportunity for the army under Lord Eagle Crest.&quot; People suddenly cheered joyfully, &quot;The city wall was broken by Lord Eagle Crest! Woohoo! I told you! Why aren&#x27;t the magic cannonballs firing this way anymore? Brothers, get the siege rams, let&#x27;s ram the gate together.&quot; Realizing the opportune moment had arrived, he immediately gave the order, &quot;All troops, advance! The target is Roder City!&quot; which made everyone&#x27;s morale surge upon hearing it. At this time, in the main hall of Roder City&#x27;s castle, Sibin, who was getting a shoulder massage from Lori, suddenly asked, &quot;How is Roy?&quot; The young lady then reassured him, &quot;Master, rest assured.</p>
<p>I have used a healing spell on Roy. She will surely recover very quickly.&quot; However, the young lady suddenly became charmingly suggestive and proposed, &quot;Master, there&#x27;s no one to disturb us right now. Why don&#x27;t we celebrate the victory?&quot; While he just replied with an awkward smile, &quot;Now doesn&#x27;t seem like a very appropriate time.&quot; Then she even took his hand and pleaded, &quot;Please, Master.&quot; Just then, a soldier suddenly burst through the door, panting and shouting loudly, &quot;My Lord, intelligence report!&quot; So the two of them immediately separated as if nothing had happened. He coughed dryly, &quot;If you have something to say, say it quickly.&quot; Therefore, the soldier didn&#x27;t dare to delay and directly reported, &quot;My Lord, we encountered two aberrants from Divine Light Town while searching for the secret tunnels. They said they wish to see you.&quot; He placed a hand on his chin, thinking to himself, &quot;Players from Divine Light Town...</p>
<p>what are they doing here? They&#x27;re not planning to take this opportunity to kill me, are they? After all, my death outcome hasn&#x27;t been resolved yet. To this day, we are still in an adversarial relationship.&quot; At this moment, Lori, from behind, was still relentlessly trying to entice him, &quot;Master, come on now!&quot; which just made him smile wryly. Finally, he stammered out, &quot;Angry.&quot; &quot;Bring them up,&quot; while Lori, behind him, had a dark, angry expression. As soon as the two of them appeared, they said in unison, &quot;Good evening, my Lord. I have some intelligence that you will surely find interesting.&quot; Hearing this, he immediately perked up and asked, &quot;Speak, let me hear it.&quot; The frog-man looked at him and seriously announced as a reminder, &quot;This intelligence is a bit hard to believe.</p>
<p>I hope you will listen seriously until I finish. The First Prince is actually a special vampire. He wants to use the soldiers who died on the main battlefield of the Royal Capital to summon a necromantic cataclysm. At that time, with the Royal Capital as the center, it will slowly spread until the entire Cologne Empire turns into a sea of undead, and he will become the new Undead Monarch.&quot; As soon as he finished speaking, he just replied flatly, &quot;Is that all?&quot; Seeing his reaction, he was a bit disappointed and thought to himself, &quot;Lord Eagle Crest is indeed an unfathomably deep person. A secret that players like us need a system prompt to even know is fundamentally nothing to Lord Eagle Crest.&quot; Immediately after, he smirked slyly and thought to himself, &quot;I knew there was something wrong with the First Prince.</p>
<p>After all, how could the prince of a country be just an ordinary person whose display panel the system can&#x27;t see? Hehe, as long as I act calm like this, as if I know everything, then I won&#x27;t have to give the players any reward.&quot; Then he put on an expression as if he knew everything. In the end, the frog-man had to give up and said sadly, &quot;It seems my Lord already has a plan in mind. I was being meddlesome.&quot; Hearing that, Sibin just replied straightforwardly, &quot;It&#x27;s alright. I accept the intelligence that you two went through the trouble of bringing me. Now, you two can state your request for a reward.</p>
<p>If it is within my capabilities, I will try my best to satisfy your request.&quot; His mood suddenly brightened up as he asked expectantly, &quot;As long as it&#x27;s something within your capabilities, anything is possible?&quot; Therefore, he affirmed with certainty, &quot;Of course. I, Lord Eagle Crest, am first and foremost a knight. The most important principle of a knight is honesty,&quot; which made the two of them suddenly fall into deep thought. Then, the man named Ich didn&#x27;t hesitate to directly propose, &quot;I want you to help us kill that Ye Hao guy,&quot; which made his friend beside him a bit surprised and hastily ask, &quot;Kill Ye Hao?&quot; This friend found it a bit hard to believe and kept pressing, &quot;Brother Ich, I&#x27;ve never heard you talk about this,&quot; but he just hurriedly replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll explain the reason later.&quot; Then, he urgently asked, &quot;Lord Eagle Crest, can you help me?&quot; while the other guy kept hesitatingly suggesting, &quot;How about we discuss it again?&quot; Meanwhile, he was deep in thought. The Continent of Geng is a game world with extremely high freedom, so in theory, it&#x27;s also possible to kill the main character.</p>
<p>From the fact that Lord Eagle Crest could summon a portion of the players at will, it could be seen that Ye Hao was not indispensable. Because he had speculated that, up until now, basically no one could fully understand the entire plot. If Ye Hao is a character who undergoes a 180-degree change that the later stages want to feature, then the players following him now are completely wasting their time. This hateful reaction from the player made him ponder to himself, &quot;Just how many evil things has that guy Ye Hao done?&quot; to make even the players want to deal with him. But no matter what, the main character is the login coordinate for the Divine Light players.</p>
<p>If Ye Hao dies, it&#x27;s hard to say if these players can continue to exist. It can&#x27;t be because they want to come to Lin Dong City, can it? Then, he spoke with some embarrassment, &quot;This matter...&quot; Just then, the system suddenly issued a notification: Death Storyline Mission has been activated. Current mission: Kill Ye Hao on the King&#x27;s Battlefield. Note: The Death Storyline has extremely high difficulty. Host, please prepare thoroughly.</p>
<p>Completing the Death Storyline Mission can yield great rewards. Currently, Ye Hao has 2 Fate Meridians. The Host has 2 Fate Chains. Please use them wisely. Ding! Daily Villain Mission has been refreshed.</p>
<p>Villain Mission 1: Kill Anna, the vessel of War and Fire. Villain Mission 2: Inflict psychological trauma on the Divine Light players, excluding Uncle X Miu Mo and Round-faced Fat Chicken. Villain Mission 3: Wear the crown and ascend to the throne. Reading the missions on the system panel, he couldn&#x27;t help but wonder to himself, &quot;Did that idiot not only offend the players, but also the system?&quot; No matter how you look at it, it seems like it was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t agree, so it forcibly added a mission. &quot;System, what you&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t right.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a good person, how can you give me a mission to usurp the throne?&quot; Then, a notification suddenly rang out again, but this time it was scolding him. Ding! As a villain, backstabbing allies, stepping on the corpses of your own league members to ascend the throne. This is the art of a villain, the Backstabbing King. This made him just laugh awkwardly and think to himself. The suggestion to deal with the First Prince is very tempting, but &quot;Backstabbing King&quot; sounds too harsh.</p>
<p>More importantly, my current military strength is still not quite enough. Finally, the system gave a reminder. Ding! The Host only needs to complete the Death Storyline Mission first, shatter Ye Hao&#x27;s Son of Fate body, and leave the rest to fate. Deal with him. Therefore, he was certain of one thing: the other things are optional, the main thing is to deal with Ye Hao? That idiot really did offend the system.</p>
<p>Then, the frog-man suddenly called out to him again, &quot;Lord Eagle Crest...&quot; He thought for a moment, feeling it wasn&#x27;t a bad idea, then waved his hand as if to say, &quot;Move aside, move aside.&quot; Then he wondered in confusion, &quot;If that&#x27;s the case, what&#x27;s there to consider?&quot; And his final decision was, &quot;I agree to your request. I will help you kill Ye Hao,&quot; which made one of them gasp in astonishment while the other smiled faintly in delight. A moment later, Sibin spoke tiredly, &quot;Although I said that, it&#x27;s not urgent right now. The urgent matter now is, when can my subordinates finish organizing everything in the castle? I&#x27;ve been wanting to see just how much wealth that Marquis Roder has.&quot; A soldier suddenly ran over to report, &quot;My Lord, we found this while searching Roder Castle.&quot; He looked at it with suspicion and asked, &quot;What is that?&quot; Then they directly uncovered the black cloth and said, &quot;My Lord, please take a look.&quot; When the three of them saw the person inside, they all widened their eyes in astonishment and exclaimed, &quot;A demi-human!&quot; It was the first time Lori had seen a winged race. But what caught his attention was the thought, &quot;No, it&#x27;s not just that.</p>
<p>This is... an awakened demi-human.&quot; Name: Bai Yao, Status: Prisoner, Strength: Awakened Demi-human, Stage: Season, Level 43 (41-50). Skills: Lightning Defense (Sealed), Electric Field Coverage (Sealed), Thunder Pulse (Sealed), Storm Current (Sealed), Discharge Constitution (Passive). Equipment: Prison Garb. Faction Reputation: Demi-human: 8.</p>
<p>Before being captured, she was just an unremarkable figure, but she seems to have another identity. Kolon Empire Reputation: -327 in Roder City. Many people know that this strong-willed demi-human girl almost electrocuted Marquis Roder to death to avoid being violated. But this feisty girl opened her mouth and immediately cursed him relentlessly, &quot;Bastard, pervert, scumbag, beast, damn it, evil!&quot; which annoyed Sibin, who thought to himself, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this just a power generator?&quot; This demi-human loli is a standard battle mage model. Moreover, she has a pair of wings, so she can most likely fly.</p>
<p>While she kept cursing, &quot;Disgusting, vile, shameless, despicable, low-life humans!&quot; Meanwhile, he was lost in thought, &quot;If I can recruit her as a subordinate, then I&#x27;ll have my first aerial military unit.&quot; But thinking of that foul mouth spouting all those venomous words, he became purple with rage and ordered, &quot;Lori, my sword!&quot; &quot;You won&#x27;t die a peaceful death!&quot; because he was thinking, &quot;It&#x27;s better to just kill her. I&#x27;m not short on awakened demi-humans.&quot; Roy had to step forward to shut this foul mouth, which made her scream in fear. &quot;What do you want to do to me, Bai Yao? Mmph mmph mmph!&quot; At this point, Sibin had lost his patience. He looked at her with a cold smile and reminded her, &quot;Please take a closer look. I am not Marquis Roder.</p>
<p>If you still speak recklessly after seeing clearly, I don&#x27;t mind plucking all your feathers, chopping off your wings to roast and eat, and then cutting out your tongue,&quot; which made this girl panic, &quot;Mmph mmph mmph!&quot; Next, he bluntly declared, &quot;I am Lord Eagle Crest. Roder City has now been occupied by me. So, in theory, you are my prisoner of war, my spoil of war.&quot; After hearing this, Bai Yao dejectedly uttered, &quot;Oh.&quot; Then he carefully reminded her, &quot;You can live freely, that&#x27;s fine, but you must join my army and serve me. As you can see, I have more than one demi-human under my command. Besides Roy and Lori, there is also a merman named Tinh Hai.&quot; Yet, the girl still looked at him suspiciously and asked, &quot;You say you&#x27;re Lord Eagle Crest? The Lord Eagle Crest who destroyed the demon&#x27;s den in Zhen Mu Dong?&quot; Then she suddenly screamed, &quot;Ah, it hurts!&quot; which annoyed him.</p>
<p>&quot;What right do you have to cry pain?&quot; But Bai Yao still said firmly, &quot;You are Lord Eagle Crest. You can&#x27;t fool me.&quot; Next, she arrogantly told Sibin about the rumors she had heard. &quot;Everyone says Lord Eagle Crest is a hawk-faced demi-human with three heads and six arms, over ten meters tall, with a green face and yellow fangs. Although his appearance is ugly, he is kind-hearted, especially coming to Zhen Mu Dong to destroy the demon&#x27;s den to prevent people from being deceived. How could it be a human like you? Hmph!&quot; Then she cursed him inwardly, &quot;Arrogant, tyrannical, vicious, and evil.</p>
<p>Hmph.&quot; After hearing this, he angrily yelled in her face, &quot;Who are you calling ugly? The Kolon Empire is an empire of humans. How can the master of the Eagle Crest territory be a demi-human? Furthermore, being over ten meters tall isn&#x27;t called a demi-human, that&#x27;s a Titan! What do Titans have to do with demi-humans? Who the hell is spreading these damn rumors?&quot; He even pulled her ear, making her cry out in pain. &quot;How would I know about that?! I&#x27;ll temporarily believe you&#x27;re Lord Eagle Crest, alright?&quot; Thinking that everything was settled, he finally proposed, &quot;Since you already know my title as Lord Eagle Crest, then there&#x27;s nothing more to say. Join as my subordinate. Your position will temporarily be a maid.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll follow Lori and Roy.&quot; But the girl suddenly became stubborn and replied, &quot;Oh, that won&#x27;t do.&quot; Then she put on an arrogant expression and said, &quot;Unless you invite me properly. Hmph, hmph, you have to say, &#x27;Beautiful, kind, and lovely Miss Bai Yao, I beg you to join my command. This is the honor of my lifetime.&#x27;&quot; Sibin was furious with this girl and couldn&#x27;t help but speak up. &quot;Lori, sword! I must chop her up today.&quot; But Roy had to hastily advise, &quot;Your Excellency, please calm down. Lori, don&#x27;t give him the sword.&quot; Only then did Bai Yao pout and speak up.</p>
<p>&quot;Geez, I get it, I get it. But you have to remember, you were the one who actively invited me. I just felt sorry for you, so I reluctantly agreed.&quot; Bai Yao excitedly shouted, &quot;Off, take it off!&quot; Her whole body emitted a strange light as she said cheerfully, &quot;Look quickly, Lord Eagle Crest!&quot; Then she happily ran over to Roy and boasted, &quot;Hmph, hmph, my whole body is always in a state of discharge.&quot; Meanwhile, he sheathed the sword in his hand and instructed with disdain, &quot;Roy, take this silly girl to wash up and change into different clothes. Then have her follow you for now. If she doesn&#x27;t listen, just hit her.</p>
<p>Remember to wear gloves to protect against the electricity.&quot; So she just replied softly, &quot;Yes, my Lord.&quot; Next, he sat down and let Lori give him a massage, ignoring Bai Yao&#x27;s scolding, &quot;You&#x27;re so hateful. Aren&#x27;t you going to ask my name, my identity, or if I have any friends?&quot; but he just shooed her away. When she was gone, he finally breathed a sigh of relief, &quot;Phew, it&#x27;s finally quiet.&quot; However, in his mind, he still had a hint of regret and curiosity, thinking to himself, &quot;Although I&#x27;m quite interested in who the friends Bai Yao mentioned are, this girl is just too noisy.&quot; As the guards were patrolling around, something suddenly rushed past them, making them feel that something was wrong, filled with confusion and doubt. Meanwhile, this suspicious girl was looking blankly, disappointed, thinking to herself, &quot;Still not on this floor.&quot; Finally, she secretly deduced, &quot;One more floor down is Lord Roder&#x27;s living and resting area.&quot; &quot;There will probably be more guards. I have to be careful.&quot; Then she hurriedly left.</p>
<p>But as she kept going without encountering any obstacles, she thought in confusion, &quot;Strange, why are there no guards on this floor?&quot; Then she suddenly heard voices, forcing her to quickly hide behind a wall. &quot;That person is really strange. Don&#x27;t you think so?&quot; The girl suddenly became alert and thought, &quot;Someone&#x27;s coming.&quot; Roy replied in confusion, &quot;What about it?&quot; Seeing this, Bai Yao, who was still angry, was about to turn back to ask. &quot;No, I have to go back and ask why he didn&#x27;t even bother to ask for my name.&quot; So Roy had to coax her, &quot;Let&#x27;s go take a bath first, you can ask next time.&quot; U Da, hiding behind, thought with suspicion, &quot;This voice... it&#x27;s Bai Yao.&quot; Then she rushed out aggressively and demanded, &quot;Let her go!&quot; which made Roy vigilant.</p>
<p>She charged forward fiercely, extending her claws, which made Bai Yao scream. &quot;Ah!&quot; But in an instant, the person in front of her disappeared, making her widen her eyes in shock and wonder, &quot;Disappeared?&quot; &quot;So fast!&quot; Then she fainted from Roy&#x27;s attack. Roy looked at the girl in front of her and uttered with suspicion, &quot;Another demi-human?&quot; Now realizing it was her friend, she was completely flustered, ah, it&#x27;s U Da. Seeing this, Roy immediately inquired, &quot;Do you two know each other?&quot; Bai Yao hurriedly replied, &quot;Of course we know each other, she&#x27;s my good friend, why did you knock her out?&quot; However, she just explained frankly, &quot;Then do you know, if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that she had no killing intent, she would be dead by now? From the lord&#x27;s standpoint, her actions are no different from an assassin&#x27;s. Who knew the lord would suddenly switch people?&quot; Roy also found it reasonable and replied, &quot;That&#x27;s true, I guess.&quot; After that, the two of them carried U Da away.</p>
<p>Roy had to decide, &quot;We&#x27;ll have to trouble the Lord again. Lori won&#x27;t treat her without an order.&quot; Meanwhile, Bai Yao, still full of doubt, asked her, &quot;No matter what, that&#x27;s still a person, do you really trust him?&quot; Remembering Sibin&#x27;s image, her cheeks suddenly flushed red, her eyes filled with infatuation as she shyly replied, &quot;Mhm, because he is a truly good person. My body and heart belong to Lord Eagle Crest forever.&quot; Then she smiled brightly and prompted, &quot;Let&#x27;s go.&quot; This left Bai Yao speechless, muttering to herself, &quot;My... my lord.&quot; Then she chased after Roy, panting heavily, saying, &quot;Wait, slow down, my legs are short, I can&#x27;t keep up.&quot; Sibin looked at the two demi-humans before him and asked directly, &quot;So you two are the leaders of the Winter&#x27;s Hollow Society, and your purpose for establishing it was to find more demi-humans to go to Winter&#x27;s Hollow City with?&quot; Bai Yao also admitted in response, &quot;That&#x27;s right, but before that, I was captured by that bastard Lord Roder. U Da rushed to save me.&quot; Hearing this, he started to feel something was off and sarcastically implied, &quot;Then aren&#x27;t you two asking me for help? Why did someone just say that unless I begged her, she wouldn&#x27;t join?&quot; This made her stammer and explain awkwardly, &quot;That...</p>
<p>wasn&#x27;t that just to get some better treat- -ment?&quot; Seeing this, U Da came to her friend&#x27;s rescue, &quot;I hope you can be magnanimous and forgive her. I rushed to save Bai Yao because I was afraid her tactless mouth would get her hacked to death.&quot; Hearing her friend say this, the girl cried out aggrievedly, &quot;U Da!&quot; while Roy and Lori just nodded and sighed, &quot;That almost happened.&quot; At this point, he could somewhat guess their personalities, thinking to himself, &quot;These two have very opposite personalities. One is hyperactive like a mad rabbit, the other is as tranquil as autumn water. But being crazy has its merits. Compared to Bai Yao, this calm-faced U Da has not completely let down her guard.&quot; While Bai Yao was constantly making a fuss and angrily asking, &quot;Are you listening to me?&quot; U Da&#x27;s expression remained indifferent as she replied, &quot;No.&quot; The system panel then displayed the information: Name: U Da.</p>
<p>Identity: Vice Leader of the Winter&#x27;s Hollow Society. Strength: Awakened Demi-human, Season Stage Lv 41, Lv 41-60. Skills: Feline Grace, Inseparable as Shadow, Sneak Attack, Silent and Soundless (Passive), Light as a Swallow (Passive), Jade-like Feet (Passive). Equipment: Common Clothes. Demi-human Faction Reputation: Perhaps the Winter&#x27;s Hollow Society only has 6 members? Imperial Reputation: Two, a nobody.</p>
<p>After a moment of contemplation, he could see that she was a standard assassin template. Except for the last passive skill whose effect was unknown, the other skills were all for ambushing and assassination. It&#x27;s just that with her being so vigilant right now, he couldn&#x27;t get any effective information out of her. Then he stood up abruptly and asked, &quot;Are you two hungry?&quot; which made them confused and bewildered. He, however, casually suggested as usual, &quot;It&#x27;s so late, and we haven&#x27;t eaten yet.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m hungry too. The kitchen has just prepared a sumptuous dinner, why don&#x27;t you two join us?&quot; The girl, Bai Yao, looked at the table full of food and exclaimed in amazement, &quot;How sumptuous!&quot; Sibin also put on a business-like smile, &quot;Go ahead and eat your fill, it&#x27;s alright.&quot; This made Bai Yao suddenly change her gaze and reply, &quot;You&#x27;re not so bad after all.&quot; But he had already calculated all this, thinking with satisfaction, &quot;To build a relationship, table culture is the best.&quot; Noticing that the other party had gradually let down her guard, he directly asked, &quot;Since you want to join Winter&#x27;s Hollow City, may I ask you a few questions?&quot; U Da also cautiously replied, &quot;If you have any questions, please ask.&quot; Bai Yao, while eating, asked angrily, &quot;What, why aren&#x27;t you asking me?&quot; But he ignored her and asked, &quot;U Da, you have a skill called Inseparable as Shadow, right? After we finish eating, can you demonstrate it for me?&quot; The ignored girl could only watch as U Da replied, &quot;Alright.&quot; After the meal was finished, she began to demonstrate her skill. &quot;Please stand here.&quot; Sibin also complied, asking blankly, &quot;Like this?&quot; As she walked over, she replied, &quot;That&#x27;s right.&quot; Then she stepped into position. Then Roy shouted in surprise, &quot;She disappeared!&quot; Lori exclaimed in amazement, &quot;She disappeared into the shadow.&quot; He just let out a soft &quot;oh&quot;. Sibin asked with some curiosity, &quot;You can enter shadows? What if the shadow disappears?&quot; U Da reappeared and explained, &quot;If there is no shadow, I will reappear.&quot; He then replied, &quot;So that&#x27;s how it is.&quot; He asked with some doubt, &quot;Is this a tracking skill? As long as the opponent has a shadow, you can follow them indefinitely regardless of obstacles?&quot; So she answered honestly, &quot;It can also be used for travel.&quot; Next, he probed further, &quot;Does your Winter&#x27;s Hollow Society have other awakened demi-humans?&quot; She just replied softly, &quot;No.&quot; Bai Yao started to scold shrewishly, &quot;Hmph, where would you find so many awakened demi-humans? You should be thrilled to have recruited the two of us.</p>
<p>Besides, U Da and I are both combat-type demi-humans, we&#x27;re very strong. Don&#x27;t be so greedy, hmph.&quot; U Da added, &quot;Combat-type awakened demi-humans seem to be much more dominant.&quot; The other girl stubbornly continued, &quot;Mhm, Winter&#x27;s Hollow City has four awakened ones, only Lori is a support type.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re lying, right? Huh, you already have four people on your side?&quot; But she was completely ignored. His eyes were full of indulgence as he replied, &quot;It&#x27;s fine even if there aren&#x27;t any.&quot; &quot;U Da will also join the maid corps, working by... The remaining demi-humans, I will arrange for soldiers to escort them to Winter&#x27;s Hollow City. For now, let me introduce you.</p>
<p>This is my personal maid, Lori. Consider her your superior. In terms of age, she&#x27;s also your older sister. Normally, just do as she says.&quot; Accordingly, she stepped forward to introduce herself, &quot;Hello everyone, I&#x27;m Lori.&quot; Bai Yao spoke up unhappily, &quot;Listen to her? Isn&#x27;t she just a support-type demi-human?&quot; which made U Da quickly remind her, &quot;Bai Yao.&quot; Sibin happily came over, patted Lori&#x27;s hand, and proudly declared, &quot;What, you think support types are weak? In the next battle, our Lori will be the key.&quot; The next day, in a certain part of the city, urgent calls suddenly rang out, &quot;Are there any other units that haven&#x27;t assembled? Lord Eagle Crest&#x27;s and Earl Mong&#x27;s units still haven&#x27;t arrived.&quot; Seeing this, he urgently declared, &quot;Tsk, did they fail? Pass down the order, stop waiting, march immediately.&quot; Then suddenly, a subordinate shouted in surprise, &quot;It&#x27;s... ah, General, they&#x27;ve arrived.</p>
<p>It looks like they&#x27;ve been through a fierce battle.&quot; Sibin, holding Lori tightly in his arms, hurried forward with his army. Seeing this, the man gritted his teeth and thought to himself, &quot;What Star of the Empire? Is that all he is? To still be carrying a maid at a time like this. With morale this low, it&#x27;s hard to say if they can even withstand the first wave of attack from the Royal Capital&#x27;s army.&quot; Then he couldn&#x27;t help but silently judge, &quot;No matter how you look at it, he just seems like a good-for-nothing who relies on his family&#x27;s power to get by, just like those silk-clothed dandies in the Royal Capital. What a pity, wasting so much military strength.&quot; Then he turned and asked him, &quot;Where is Earl Mong?&quot; So he immediately started acting and replied, &quot;Your Excellency Calen, Earl Mong was a true warrior. He led the vanguard to charge the city walls in the battle for Vroder City.&quot; He even recounted with tears welling in his eyes, &quot;However, Earl Mong was careless for a moment and was unfortunately hit by a destruction-grade magic cannonball, dying on the battlefield.</p>
<p>He is a true hero.&quot; Meanwhile, Lori burst out laughing so hard her whole body trembled, forcing him to signal a reminder, &quot;Lori, don&#x27;t laugh.&quot; Calen hurriedly came forward and reported respectfully, &quot;Your Highness, all troops have assembled.&quot; The First Prince heard this and praised with satisfaction, &quot;Very good, everyone. You&#x27;ve worked hard.&quot; Then he declared with great vigor, &quot;Right now, including us lords, we have 21 Sky Knights. In addition, among my subordinates, there are 23 Sky Knigh... meaning a total of 44. But this number is still not entirely enough to confront the Pope&#x27;s forces.</p>
<p>But please rest assured, to win this battle, I have also invited the respected Archmage Bobosa here, along with 10 siege cannons made by the dwarves.&quot; Next, he pointed to the mysterious cloaked man and introduced, &quot;This is Archmage 61 to 80 Bobosa. His entire life has been focused on studying necromancy.&quot; Earl Xuong Lang couldn&#x27;t help but say in surprised confusion, &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect that person to be a researcher of necromancy. Wasn&#x27;t that sect wiped out by the Church of Light? Why would the First Prince invite someone like this? That person will desecrate the remains of the warriors.&quot; When old Calen heard these words, he angrily shouted, &quot;Silence!&quot; The First Prince also spoke with empathy and understanding, &quot;I know everyone is very averse to things related to necromancy. It&#x27;s just that special times call for special measures. We need more sacrifices to wear down the enemy&#x27;s forces, and the undead are the best choice.</p>
<p>They can be revived indefinitely and are much more efficient than aberrants. Surely you don&#x27;t wish for the soldiers you&#x27;ve painstakingly trained to all die in the siege battle?&quot; After hearing this, the people below began to whisper among themselves, their stances gradually wavering as they hesitantly replied, &quot;This...&quot; then looked at each other hesitantly, no longer objecting. Finally, they completely agreed, &quot;I... I think His Highness&#x27;s idea is very correct. Indeed, in special times, this is also because there is no other way.</p>
<p>I think if necromancy is used in the right place, it&#x27;s not that evil. Agreed.&quot; But Sibin remained silent in contemplation. The First Prince, seeing his goal was achieved, laughed heartily and said, &quot;I am very happy that everyone has reached a consensus.&quot; At this moment, that old fox finally began to speak, &quot;Next, let&#x27;s go into the tent to discuss.&quot; After that, they all entered the tent together to discuss tactics. Then, in front of everyone, Bobosa demonstrated his ability, causing them to discuss in confusion, &quot;What... what is that scroll? What is he doing?&quot; Seeing everyone&#x27;s confusion, he spoke up to reassure them, &quot;My lords, there is no need to worry.</p>
<p>This is just a sound-proofing barrier. Now everyone can discuss freely with peace of mind.&quot; The old man also began his work with an announcement, &quot;Our current siege forces only consist of the dwarves&#x27; cannons and a few ordinary catapults. But on the walls of the Royal Capital, there are dozens of destruction-grade magic cannons. Without any preparation, it will be impossible to breach the city walls no matter what. Therefore, we need to come up with some special plans to attack Dragonfire City.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas for this?&quot; then a lord suddenly raised his hand to offer an opinion:. we can dig a tunnel and attack Dragonfire City directly from within. the Pope would surely never expect it. that way we can catch them completely off guard. &quot; but after hearing these words, he let out a sarcastic laugh:.</p>
<p>your armor seems a bit small. it appears to be blocking the blood flow to your brain. I suggest you change into a larger set. I hope you all will stop raising such foolish issues. dig a tunnel? can&#x27;t you see the massive river protecting the city? are you digging a tunnel to drown yourselves? Earl Xuong Lang also raised his hand to give his opinion:.</p>
<p>then, Your Excellency Calen, could we perhaps poison the river protecting the city? &quot; he also nodded and replied:. this idea is not bad. however, although the river protecting Dragonfire City is its only water source, this river is too large. to poison the entire river to a lethal level, the amount of poison required is something we simply cannot prepare. actually, to contaminate the water source, you don&#x27;t necessarily need poison.</p>
<p>there is something even more potent than poison, which also doesn&#x27;t require a large amount to be effective. that is plague. their insidious plan made him ponder to himself:. a plague, because of Dragonfire City&#x27;s geography. I had already guessed that they would definitely make a move on the river surrounding the city.</p>
<p>but I didn&#x27;t expect them to use a plague. for any territory, this is a devastating catastrophe, a difficult problem that even priests cannot solve. even the purification spell has limited effectiveness. to completely eliminate it, one can only use the corresponding medicine, holy water, and the elves&#x27; water of life. but what he despised the most was this Calen fellow, who, in order to win, was truly shameless and despicable without any limits.</p>
<p>he even got angry and shouted when he saw the lords whispering among themselves:. if you have any problems, just say them out loud, don&#x27;t discuss them privately. he had some doubts and spoke up to ask:. Your Excellency Calen, I want to know, if the plague breaks out on a large scale, even our own soldiers will be affected, so what should we do then? everyone around enthusiastically chimed in:. that&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>the Pope has holy water, but we have nothing. this method isn&#x27;t very good. although it&#x27;s effective, it&#x27;s really too dangerous. Your Excellency Calen, we should think of another way. suddenly receiving a series of opposing opinions left him able to only say helplessly:.</p>
<p>you people... &quot; then Bobosa replied with a smirk:. hee hee, holy water, hee hee, how much holy water can they possibly have? the more severe the plague, the more holy water it consumes. they can only let their core forces use the holy water. as for the ordinary soldiers, I guarantee they will definitely die.</p>
<p>hee hee hee. &quot; he giggled like a madman and said: &quot; every, hack hack hack, everyone don&#x27;t be afraid. hee hee, hack hack, I have the antidote for the plague. hee hee don&#x27;t be afraid. the river protecting Dragonfire City originates from a stream formed by the snowmelt of the Firon mountain range.</p>
<p>we just need to spread the plague at the headwaters of the stream. so, may I ask if you have any other opinions? upon hearing this, that group of fence-sitters replied:. no, no more. if His Excellency Bobosa says he has the antidote, then we have no more problems. me neither.</p>
<p>&quot; once outside, Sibin said nonchalantly: &quot; it would be strange if he could actually produce a real antidote. he suddenly remembered a very important matter and quickly asked. lori, I remember your ability can resolve all plagues, right? she also answered honestly, that&#x27;s right, any plague can be eliminated using withered wood rejuvenation. in addition, lori can also infuse the healing power of withered wood rejuvenation into water. although the effect will be slightly reduced, dealing with an ancient infectious disease is not a problem.</p>
<p>so, the problem is considered solved. he happily planted a quick kiss on the bridge of her nose and exclaimed with delight. you&#x27;re so amazing, it&#x27;s a good thing you&#x27;re here. this made her lips curve slightly into a giggle, hee hee. the soldiers of the Pope&#x27;s army were all coughing, cough cough cough, some felt unwell and dizzy, panting heavily, others were nauseous and covered their mouths with their hands.</p>
<p>seeing this, he tried to reassure them, everyone don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s just a common cough, you&#x27;ll get better after taking the medicine I&#x27;ve prepared. but the soldiers&#x27; morale was no longer stable. they were constantly tormented by the discomfort, crying out for help. ah it&#x27;s so itchy, here, what the hell is this thing, someone save me. when he saw this scene, he ran out like a flash, shouting in panic, pla, plague, this is a plague, com, commander, there&#x27;s a plague outbreak in the military camp.</p>
<p>this news was then urgently reported to His Holiness the Pope. learning of this matter, the first thing he suspected was whether it was caused by Calen&#x27;s group. his subordinate then replied thoughtfully, I don&#x27;t think it could be Calen&#x27;s group, because a plague is very difficult to control. if they were to spread a plague, it would be no different from seeking their own death. of course, if they have a way to avoid the plague, then that&#x27;s another matter, it&#x27;s just that this subordinate does not know of the existence of such a method.</p>
<p>right now, only holy water and the water of life can completely eliminate the plague. the corresponding medicine is also very difficult to produce. therefore, most plagues can only be controlled and contained. I suggest having the sky knight-level lords round up the sick people. guard them strictly.</p>
<p>those who are not sick, be careful not to use raw water, because all water sources in Dragonfire City have been completely contaminated. as soon as he finished speaking, the atmosphere was completely stirred up, and the soldiers couldn&#x27;t help but feel panicked and worried. next, the Pope asked with some curiosity, how much holy water do we have left? hearing this, she also answered honestly. Your Holiness the Pope, we have over 100 liters of holy water left. it was previously used for the alchemists to research the plague.</p>
<p>which means they used over 200 liters of my holy water, and in the end, still couldn&#x27;t solve the plague problem? his every word made the subordinate tremble like a leaf, while she also answered honestly, yes, Your Holiness. he roared with blazing anger, utterly useless fools. suddenly she asked with curiosity, what&#x27;s that sound? one person pointed outside and exclaimed in panic, it sounds like it&#x27;s coming from the city gate. re, report, someone is attacking the city, what. the massive cannons were continuously fired towards the sturdy city gate.</p>
<p>sibin watched from a distance and couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim in silent admiration, calen is indeed a genuine warmonger, understanding the principle of striking a man when he&#x27;s down. he has some brains, at least. it&#x27;s just this method of attack, I can&#x27;t let my own army sacrifice themselves in vain here. I can only let the players give it a try. then he suddenly reminded the players below in a stern voice, remember, our goal is to harass them, there&#x27;s no need to sacrifice yourselves in vain.</p>
<p>the one who performs the best will receive a set of flame armor. hearing this, they responded with a resolute roar, we understand, what&#x27;s a little harassment, we know it all too well. one person rushed to the front, puffed out his chest, and said with bravado, let&#x27;s go everyone. then suddenly one person asked curiously, looking up at the sky and pointing, hey brother frost, look at that thing on the city wall. the pope stood on top, filled with confidence, chuckling, don&#x27;t waste your efforts.</p>
<p>this city gate has a special shield added to it. even if you fire cannons for 3 days and 3 nights, don&#x27;t even think about breaking it. but he hadn&#x27;t been laughing for long before he was cursed and insulted by that group of players, old man, come down here if you&#x27;ve got the guts, don&#x27;t hide in there like a coward. however, he still tried to suppress the fire of anger in his heart and sneered arrogantly, did calen send this bunch of shrimp to try and force us to open the gate and meet them in battle? hmph, don&#x27;t waste your efforts. seeing this, he could only sigh helplessly and say, that old turtle hiding in his shell simply won&#x27;t budge.</p>
<p>brother frost also rolled up his sleeves, puffed out his chest, and replied with bravado, you guys are no good, let me. he then proceeded to display his skill of scolding people as if singing beautifully, drop dead pope, you damn old geezer, an animal with an incompletely evolved colorectal anus. a gibbon with a mutated evolutionary gene. you call yourself a pope being such a coward? if you&#x27;re so great then come down here and fight me. are you hiding on the city wall to show off your uselessness? look at yourself, your wrinkles could trap and kill a fly.</p>
<p>and dressing so gaudily, who are you trying to put on a show for? after hearing these words, the players could only nod in admiration, brother frost is the best. hey everyone, look at the pope&#x27;s health bar. then they started buzzing with discussion, his health bar appeared? oh my god, level 68, nightmare. the system panel also displayed his information, pope bakuda kunmura, skull, pope, 61-80, level 69, nightmare. to retaliate against these insults, he furiously ordered, archers, fire for me.</p>
<p>this made them cry out, holy crap, a sneak attack. just like that, a series of attacks were continuously fired towards these players, making them all flustered and panicking all over the place, get out of the way, get out of the way, priest, heal, what are you standing there for, does being low level mean you don&#x27;t know how to heal? brother frost, your door is really reliable. earl xuong lang was amazed by the scene before him and exclaimed in admiration, it&#x27;s truly hard to imagine. the soldiers under earl eagle crest are also so brave and fearless of danger. even their scolding is, also so brave and fearless of danger.</p>
<p>but he just replied indifferently, you flatter me. although he was impressed, he still asked with some curiosity, but if we just keep scolding like this, when will it start? the gate of dragonfire city is reinforced by a special force. it can only be attacked from the inside. even a super cannon can&#x27;t blast it open. but he just smiled nonchalantly and replied, don&#x27;t worry, it will open on its own soon enough.</p>
<p>this made him exclaim in surprise, what, what? hearing this, calen angrily shouted a reminder, war is not a game. I hope that lord eagle crest can do as he says. but he didn&#x27;t want to say much more and just replied nonchalantly, just wait and see. the pope continuously had his soldiers fire arrows, but he dodged them all and even taunted him back, I dodge, I dodge again. then he laughed excitedly, hehe, can&#x27;t hit me, can you? bald old man, what are you doing hiding on the city wall shooting arrows? showing off your uselessness? being taunted by him like this, he flew into a rage and cursed, you dregs, you will pay the price for your ignorant stupidity.</p>
<p>then he unexpectedly jumped straight down from the city wall towards them. his entire body emitted an aura of killing intent and mighty power. only now did he start to panic and wonder, damn, why did this guy suddenly jump down here? good thing I turned off the pain sensation beforehand, so I can&#x27;t feel the sensation of suffocation. but with his trollish nature, he continued to taunt the old man, bald old man, and then let out a mocking laugh. this made the old man go mad with anger and roar furiously, you&#x27;re courting death.</p>
<p>he then proceeded to unleash his move. The players, seeing him leap down, fearfully whispered to each other, &quot;He&#x27;s charging towards us, run quickly.&quot; But he just laughed with interest and said in a low voice, &quot;It&#x27;s too late to run.&quot; On top of the wall, the atmosphere suddenly became unusually quiet, and U Gia was also slowly advancing towards them. Next, she aggressively made a scene with this group of people. &quot;The Pope has personally left the city to fight, you bunch of trash, why aren&#x27;t you deploying?&quot; Hearing this, they replied with some caution. &quot;But I haven&#x27;t received any orders for us to go outside the city to engage in battle.&quot; Seeing that her words carried no weight, she advanced and stabbed him once, then commanded with a scolding tone, &quot;You idiot.</p>
<p>The Pope personally gave the order to wipe out the enemy&#x27;s den, and you&#x27;re still dawdling here. Do you want to receive punishment by the holy fire of Saintess Anna?&quot; He began to panic and spoke fearfully, &quot;Holy fire, so you are a Saintess, please calm your anger, we, we will deploy immediately.&quot; Just like that, this bunch of clueless people hastily opened the entire city gate and rushed out together the city. The Pope, seeing them charge over, flew into a rage and cursed, &quot;You idiots, who told you to open the city gate?&quot; This left them bewildered, wondering, &quot;Didn&#x27;t you say you wanted the army to destroy their den? How could we get out without opening the gate?&quot; The Pope furiously asked, &quot;When did I say that? Get back here for me.&quot; Very quickly after, Sibin&#x27;s group swiftly blew up the city gate. This made the Pope&#x27;s subordinates even more bewildered as they hurriedly asked, &quot;Pope, what do we do now? The city gate has been blown up, we can&#x27;t get back anymore.&quot; The angry Earl Xuong Lang asked with his mouth agape in astonishment, &quot;Lord Eagle Crest, you&#x27;re really amazing, the city gate actually opened. How did you do that?&quot; But Sibin just replied blandly, &quot;It was just a coincidence.&quot; Calen couldn&#x27;t wait any longer and quickly interrupted, &quot;Alright, now is not the time for this talk.</p>
<p>Right now, all lords, lead your armies and prepare to assault the city.&quot; He didn&#x27;t waste any more words, raising his sword high and shouting, &quot;Generals of the Eagle Crest Territory,&quot; &quot;Charge!&quot; After that, they all fearlessly rushed forward in unison with the determination to win. Seeing the enemy formation surrounding them, the Pope&#x27;s general said helplessly, &quot;Hmph, there&#x27;s no way to retreat anymore, everyone fight with all your might.&quot; He then raised his sword and shouted powerfully, &quot;Kill!&quot; Seeing the enemy gradually weakening, he couldn&#x27;t help but mock, &quot;The sick soldiers indeed can&#x27;t withstand a single blow. What Holy Templar Knights, they can&#x27;t even hold their swords steady. I think they should be called Truly Weak Knights.&quot; Hearing this, the Pope flew into a rage, pointed straight at his face and cursed, &quot;You shameless braggart,&quot; then attacked, causing the general to scream in panic, &quot;Help, save me!&quot; At the critical moment, Sibin rushed over to block the blow for him and carefully reminded him, &quot;That skeleton can&#x27;t stand being insulted by others. Earl Xuong Lang, be a little careful.&quot; As for the Earl, he lay sprawled on the ground in fear, crying out in alarm: “Lord Eagle Crest! He walked directly in front of the Pope and aggressively declared war: “Hey, I advise you to surrender quickly.</p>
<p>If you surrender, I can leave you with a whole corpse.” Hearing this, the Pope snorted coldly, while Earl Xuong Lang&#x27;s eyes sparkled as he looked at him like a god, exclaiming:. &quot;He looks so cool!&quot; As expected, the Pope couldn&#x27;t stand this humiliation and angrily cursed:. &quot;You yellow-haired brat, cut the arrogance!&quot; Next, he unleashed his technique, causing him to gasp in astonishment and think to himself:. &quot;Space distortion. Distorting space to teleport somewhere, just like the nun who ambushed me before.&quot; While he was lost in his train of thought and didn&#x27;t notice the Pope attacking him, Roy quickly rushed over to block the blow for him and reminded him:.</p>
<p>&quot;Lord Hevey, please don&#x27;t be careless.&quot; Her astonishingly fast appearance couldn&#x27;t help but startle and surprise the Pope as well. Roy looked powerfully at the enemy and asked in a low voice:. &quot;You want to compete in speed, right? Then let&#x27;s see who&#x27;s faster,&quot; and then shot forward. This made even someone like the Pope, who usually looked down on his enemies, marvel and exclaim to himself: “Such fast speed! After a while of fighting, he couldn&#x27;t help but wonder to himself: &quot;All my moves have been seen through. Could she also be an awakened demi-human?&quot; Realizing that fighting Roy was too disadvantageous, he turned to taunt him:.</p>
<p>&quot;You coward who clings to life and fears death, to think you&#x27;d let your maid fight on the battlefield, do you have any shame?&quot; Hearing that, he just casually retorted to the Pope: &quot;Can&#x27;t be helped, I&#x27;m handsome and have many maids. Are you jealous?&quot; Just then, Lori appeared and reported:. &quot;Master, I&#x27;ve brought Bong Bóng and Thạch Đầu.&quot; The Pope was too shocked to speak:. &quot;You...&quot; Then suddenly a soldier ran up breathlessly, calling: &quot;Your Holiness the Pope! &quot;The soldiers affected by the plague have been greatly weakened, and moreover, the soldiers who were killed have all turned into undead and are attacking us back!&quot; Only then did he exclaim in horror:. &quot;What? Does the enemy army have a mage specializing in necromancy?&quot; After a moment of thought, he finally let out a soft sigh:.</p>
<p>&quot;Tsk, the situation is too unfavorable, I must retreat first.&quot; This made the soldier ask in confusion:. &quot;Your Holiness the Pope, then what should we do?&quot; The Pope then suddenly shouted angrily:. &quot;You all defend the city walls for me!&quot; Hearing that, the soldier cursed in frustration:. &quot;Damn it, he runs so fast. These are undead, you can&#x27;t kill them by slashing, how are we supposed to defend now?&quot; Seeing this, Roy couldn&#x27;t help but speak up angrily:.</p>
<p>&quot;This is bad, he wants to retreat.&quot; She even intended to give chase but was stopped by Sibin. He calmly reminded her:. &quot;Roy, there&#x27;s no need to chase. He can run, but the city can&#x27;t. The focus right now is over there.&quot; Meanwhile, Hellfire was extremely annoyed and irritable, instructing:.</p>
<p>&quot;You fishy worm, do not shoot at the great Sarakan.&quot; Bong Bóng also obediently replied:. &quot;Okay.&quot; Down below, Sibin was holding Roy tightly, causing her to blush shyly. Bong Bóng continued to let water flow out, flooding the area and making the soldiers unable to stand firm due to the excess water, crying out in distress. The Pope&#x27;s men saw this and wondered in confusion: &quot;Why has so much water suddenly appeared? Run, run quickly!&quot; While everything was becoming chaotic, one person was happy. Diệp Hạo curled his lips slightly and thought to himself: &quot;Finally, I&#x27;ve found her.</p>
<p>The Blue Star&#x27;s Will only told me the name and power characteristics of Tinh Hải. This trident has been unresponsive all this time, and I didn&#x27;t know where to find her.&quot; &quot;I got her without any effort. It turns out she is Tinh Hải. But damn it, Hellfire is beside her, it&#x27;s not convenient to make a move.&quot; At that moment, Sarakan was furiously scolding her, while she timidly shrank back and hurriedly said:. &quot;Sorry, Thạch Đầu, Bong Bóng forgot.&quot; He hesitated, contemplating:.</p>
<p>&quot;But I have no more chances to fail. The Grand Prince won&#x27;t spare me, neither will the Pope, and the Blue Star&#x27;s Will certainly won&#x27;t let me live. During the all-out assault, the battlefield is chaotic, Hellfire can&#x27;t possibly protect that demi-human named Tinh Hải forever, right? I just need to stab this trident into Tinh Hải&#x27;s heart, and I can obtain the power of the sea god Poseidon. At that time, I can directly turn the tables and trample both the Grand Prince and the Pope under my feet. Then, Lord Eagle Crest will be nothing but a small fry that I can do whatever I want with.&quot; The soldiers were still boiling with fighting spirit: &quot;Don&#x27;t stop the catapults, brothers, charge, keep it up!&quot; Then they worked together to push the catapults to attack the city gate and laughed cheerfully:.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my, my goodness, isn&#x27;t this so exciting?&quot; The enemy&#x27;s cannons fired continuously, forcing them to raise their guard and rally their spirits, reminding each other: &quot;The counterattack is here, mage shields up, warriors charge to the front!&quot; On the Pope&#x27;s side, it was no less fierce. A cloaked figure came forward and hastily issued an order: &quot;Move aside, move aside, the magic cannon is launching its first wave of attack first!&quot; The continuous earth-shattering explosions signaled a fierce and arduous war between both sides. At this time, Bong Bóng was still very focused on chanting: “h i l i a r e f e r a o i a a l i n g s. And Sarakan, who loved destruction, was still closely protecting her. Under her summons, layers of water like vicious waves continuously submerged the enemy soldiers, causing them to cry out in agony but still trying to encourage each other:.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, a a a, hold on, try to hold on!&quot; Just then, Sibin arrogantly walked over while holding Lori, sneering coldly: &quot;What&#x27;s there to hold on for? The Pope has already run away. Relying on a crumbling city wall and you few small-fry soldiers, you think you can stop me?&quot; This made them exclaim in shock and horror:. &quot;Lord Eagle Crest!&quot; However, one fearless soldier took out a potion, drank it, and arrogantly replied:. &quot;Whether we can stop you or not isn&#x27;t for you to say.&quot; The beast beside him, with its blood-red eyes, kept growling fiercely at him. Sensing something ominous, Lori, full of worry, reminded him:.</p>
<p>&quot;Master, quickly stop them. I can feel that the potion they&#x27;re drinking is a stronger, modified version made from demi-human blood.&quot; However, his expression remained as calm as water from beginning to end as he replied with a slight curl of his lips:. &quot;It&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s an old trick of the Church.&quot; Sibin watched the Pope&#x27;s men recklessly use the enhancement potion and declared in a cold voice: &quot;Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re the only ones with enhancement potions. Today, I&#x27;ll let you broaden your horizons and see what a true, shameless enhancement is.&quot; After that, his whole body emitted an unusual aura, causing them to exclaim in fear and panic:. &quot;Is he crazy? What kind of enhancement is that?&quot; The system panel then displayed his current status: &quot;+50% Shield, +70% Healing, +90% Speed.&quot; He grinned and instructed:.</p>
<p>&quot;Lori, you wait for me over here.&quot; So she also replied very obediently:. &quot;Yes, Master, be careful.&quot; Next, he advanced, raised his sword high, and arrogantly declared:. &quot;This is what real hacking is.&quot; Sibin then shot forward to fight, making them exclaim in astonishment and panic:. &quot;So fast! Even after transforming, we can&#x27;t keep up with his movements. If this continues, we won&#x27;t be able to hold on.&quot; While he was busy attacking these groups, one of them took the opportunity to lunge towards Lori, extending its fangs and claws, saying:.</p>
<p>&quot;If this is the work of an enhancement, then let&#x27;s deal with the support first.&quot; He noticed something was wrong and turned to shout worriedly:. &quot;Lori!&quot; Just in that hair-raising moment, a familiar shadow appeared and spoke in a powerful voice:. &quot;Just do as we discussed before, you can fight without worry. I&#x27;ve got this side.&quot; It then quickly revealed its true form, standing protectively in front of Lori, leaving him to only exclaim in amazement:. &quot;So reliable, U Dạ.&quot; Bạch Diêu also appeared, snorting coldly and pouting as she spoke: &quot;Praising him already, isn&#x27;t it a bit too soon?&quot; Her entire body continuously discharged terrifying electric sparks, making him unable to remain calm, his mouth agape in astonishment.</p>
<p>The girl confidently spread her proud wings, flew up, and said: &quot;Watch me, here I come!&quot; Next, a terrifying aura was seen being released from her body. it was so large that it made the papal army soldiers scream one by one:. ugh, ah, ah, ah, what is this? and of course, with her releasing it so uncontrollably, even Sibin was no exception, he was zapped and cried out in pain:. ah, ah, ah!” then hurriedly reminded her:. you don&#x27;t have to go that overboard, look carefully before you discharge electricity.</p>
<p>yet Bạch Diêu just scratched her ear, pretending to be careless, and replied with a smile: “oh dear, it was just a small mistake, next time, next time for sure. making him so angry he gritted his teeth, and U Dạ, afraid he would get too mad and beat up his close friend, reluctantly spoke up: “I hope you can forgive her. Lori at this moment became quite fierce, surprising the men beside her:. how did she achieve such a fast speed like that?” but they didn&#x27;t know that it was because she had smelled the fresh blood of her kin on them that she became so enraged. carrying her hatred, she immediately eliminated all those who dared to harm the demi-humans.</p>
<p>after finishing, she immediately turned her head:. Lord Hevey, this side has been cleaned up. he stood above, looking down and pondering:. I never expected there would be a day I could win by doing nothing, I basically don&#x27;t need to lift a finger. just the maid squad alone could instantly eliminate more than half, it seems this battle will end faster than I thought.</p>
<p>at this moment, down in the battle, it seemed there was a man with ulterior motives, just as the Will of the Blue Star had said, all he needed to do was use this trident to stab the heart of the demi-human named Tinh Hải. the will of the sleeping Sea God inside would use her as a vessel to awaken. and as the one who helps the Sea God, I will receive the help of a deity. my current level is 57, completely comparable to the level 55 Hellfire Lord. so this is my chance to carry out the task of resurrecting the Sea God.</p>
<p>after that, he immediately thrust the trident straight forward: “receive the judgment of the gods!” Tinh Hải saw this and was startled, but luckily, the golem beside her appeared just in time to block it. being thwarted, that guy clenched his teeth:. damn it!”. He looked at him and roared, where did this riff-raff come from to dare challenge the great Saraken. &quot; after that, he was very thoughtful and created a cage to help Tinh Hải escape.</p>
<p>the other guy now felt the flames begin to engulf his body and felt immense pain. but because of the divine guidance, he remained very tough and retorted, it&#x27;s just a block of rock. quickly hand over the mermaid in your hands to me. &quot; however, because he talked too much, he was punched into a wall by Saraken. but now, that guy didn&#x27;t feel discouraged but laughed loudly, so this is your weak point.</p>
<p>and so he immediately rushed forward and attacked Saraken&#x27;s chest directly, causing him pain. that guy became more and more smug, your heart is just like your nature. both foul and hard. after finishing his mockery, he immediately stabbed his blade straight towards the heart stone. the power he put into it caused his heart to crack instantly.</p>
<p>Tinh Hải, inside the protective membrane, saw him sacrificing himself to protect her and cried her eyes out, don&#x27;t, Stone Head. that guy now became smug, you might as well hand the mermaid over to me, otherwise, two more strikes at most and you&#x27;ll be in hell. upon hearing that, he flew into a rage, go to hell? you riff-raff who doesn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for you. I have sacrificed countless times, the flaming army has never feared sacrifice. hearing that, he didn&#x27;t care and decided to deliver the final blow.</p>
<p>Tinh Hải screamed at this moment, stone man, let me go, if this continues you will really die. but Saraken didn&#x27;t bother and directly took out his own heart. throwing it straight at the bastard in front of him. along with that, his entire body was quickly disintegrating. seeing this, tears quickly fell from the mermaid, Stone Head, can you tell me the story about that place again? although he found it very troublesome, he still patiently told stories to the little mermaid girl in front of him, making her happy.</p>
<p>at that time, she even thought the two of them were best friends forever. although there were times he was a bit hot-tempered, to her, he was still the first friend. after his heart was separated from his body, it immediately created an explosion that attracted the attention of others. Sibin also quickly looked in that direction, what happened over there, who is in charge of that city wall section? &quot; at this moment, the system reminded him again, detected that the Hellfire Lord has died, soul has been recovered. hearing this, he knew something bad had happened on the opposite side and led his two maids to go there and assess the situation.</p>
<p>after moving for a while, they also arrived at this area. Sibin looked at his maid and reminded her, &quot; Lori, don&#x27;t waste your energy, he&#x27;s already dead, go find where Tinh Hải is. &quot; while searching, they saw Diệp Hạo lying to one side with the trident stuck in him. Sibin looked at him and wondered, this blue flame, it seems the one who caused Saraken&#x27;s death is him. regardless of what relationship he has with the Papal State, since he has eliminated my subordinate and the whereabouts of Bubble are unknown, I cannot forgive him.</p>
<p>&quot; just as he was about to deal with that Son of Heaven&#x27;s Mandate, Lori also found Tinh Hải in an unconscious state. while Sibin was about to finish off the man in front of him, he was called out to by his maid. Rui looked at the stone slab in her hand, please take a look at this stone fragment, it has very mysterious patterns on it. this is the core of the Hellfire Lord, he must have torn out his stone heart to self-destruct in order to protect Bubble. Sibin went to ask Lori about Bubble&#x27;s injuries, although they were not serious, Lori was at a loss because she refused to leave Stone Head&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>seeing that, Sibin asked the system, &quot; can Saraken be resurrected. according to the system&#x27;s notification, he needs to collect enough materials to be able to resurrect him. hearing this, he sighed, it&#x27;s good that he can be resurrected, if he had just died like that, I would have lost a talented general. after that, he asked about the materials to resurrect him. according to what the system said, he needs a high-level demon&#x27;s heart along with 10 tons of spirit steel.</p>
<p>after that, a master-level dwarven craftsman is also needed. hearing this, his expression immediately stiffened, do I have to use a living person as a material, is this okay? the system continued to report, the technology to recreate a hellfire is extremely complex, especially the process of crafting the lava heart. even if the system provides the plan, ordinary human craftsmen still cannot create it, so the host needs to find a master-level dwarven craftsman. hearing this, he immediately felt better because at least it wasn&#x27;t about cooking a person to become a material. while he was pondering, Rui quickly rushed up to him, My Lord, be careful.</p>
<p>because at this moment, Diệp Hạo appeared from nowhere and was approaching him. what, that guy hasn&#x27;t gone to see the King of Hell yet, he has a long life. but at this moment, he sensed something was not right, &quot; does that appearance look like he&#x27;s alive, what on earth is happening? Rui looked at him and shook her head, I felt a strange aura constantly coming from that direction, so I went to check. as a result, Diệp Hạo suddenly stood up, sticky tentacles grew out of the wound where he was stabbed. &quot; luckily I stopped him and came back here, I don&#x27;t know why but I have a feeling that I can&#x27;t touch him.</p>
<p>that&#x27;s understandable, looking at his state, it would be strange if you touched him and didn&#x27;t get infected. it turns out the main cause is the Sea God&#x27;s trident stuck in his chest. at this moment, thousands of eyes appeared from nowhere, surrounding Sibin. he also began to become unconscious, why am I still in one piece here? but luckily, Rui, who was beside him, promptly stepped forward to stop his self-destructive act. Lori also appeared by his side and immediately used her life force to revive her master.</p>
<p>Sibin now regained his senses, I&#x27;m fine, thankfully it&#x27;s because of you girls, perhaps I was affected by those enchanting words just now and couldn&#x27;t control my thoughts. I feel that I can&#x27;t face that guy head-on. &quot; at this moment, a line appeared on his information panel, which was that he was being infected. the system also immediately warned that if his tentacles hit someone, the infection rate would be very high. having no other choice, he could only charge forward to eliminate the dangerous man in front of him.</p>
<p>each flame on his sword seemed to ride the wind, lunging straight at him. after that, he also prepared to use another ultimate skill to control Diệp Hạo. Sibin looked at the man in front of him and immediately cast his ultimate skill, Chains of Fate. the two maids looked at their master with a confused expression. but this did not stop the Chains of Fate from rushing forward to bind Diệp Hạo tightly.</p>
<p>he was immediately enveloped by the chains in the center. but he was tied up in a way that couldn&#x27;t be more BDSM. the maids saw this and immediately thought of a scene that was not very proper. Lori also exclaimed, last time after seeing him tie someone like that, I went and asked Christy. she said it&#x27;s the turtle shell tie method.</p>
<p>if the master likes this style, maybe next time Lori can do it and perhaps I can ask for a baby with him. &quot; Rui, beside her, remained very serious, don&#x27;t let your guard down, the master is still fighting, he hasn&#x27;t allowed us to go over and help him. &quot; although it looked like he had been suppressed, the ominous feeling coming from Diệp Hạo hadn&#x27;t diminished much. Sibin was very confident at this moment, these chains are indeed effective, unexpectedly suppressing his level down to 40. if it weren&#x27;t for this ancient infection, it might have dropped even further.</p>
<p>but this is enough, just level 40, I can eliminate him with a wave of my hand. with the confidence he had, he quickly used his fire sword to attack. but no matter how many times he attacked. the ancient infection was still constantly helping him recover. seeing that, he was surprised, what is this situation, is it impossible to destroy him? do I have to destroy him a few more times to deplete the energy in his body, or do I need to use some special method.</p>
<p>If he couldn&#x27;t let the maids help, ah, that&#x27;s right, didn&#x27;t he have a group of people who weren&#x27;t afraid of being infected? So, he quickly used the system&#x27;s function to announce a temporary epic quest for the players. They were immediately overjoyed upon receiving the system notification. However, only Lin Fan was very clear-headed, &quot;Does everyone feel like maybe our side is the one starting the game normally? The game&#x27;s name is the Can Continent, not Invasion War, so from the Can Continent&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s very likely that Lord Eagle Crest is the protagonist. To Lord Eagle Crest and this continent, we players and Ye Hao are actually the invaders. This could also explain why the game&#x27;s difficulty decreased when we joined the forces of Lẫm Đông City.</p>
<p>At this point, they immediately went to the battlefield area. Found him, is that Ye Hao? Oh my god, it hasn&#x27;t been that long, how did that guy turn into a transforming worm. Seeing his appearance like this, I can&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s a protagonist. While they were still in heated discussion, the ancient curse quickly targeted them. It quickly affected their minds, &quot;There are strange sounds ringing in my ears, can everyone hear them? It feels like those eyes of Ye Hao are making me nauseous.</p>
<p>But for the players, this wasn&#x27;t a big problem at all. For the sake of the quest, they charged forward to attack like madmen, without a thought for the consequences. Even the mages wanted to use their magic to burn that guy. This scene was considered quite cruel even to Sibin, but luckily, it seemed the ancient infection was ineffective against those players. Rui looked over, wondering, why did Ye Hao turn into such a state? And that golden trident on his body, I&#x27;ve seen it in the ancient texts before, it seems to be the Sea God&#x27;s Trident.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Sibin&#x27;s eyes immediately thought of something, isn&#x27;t the Sea God an ancient one? Rui quickly explained to her master, those are the Old Gods. The ancient texts record that the Old God who fought the Sea God was O Thuy Ach. Because he always fought at night, he was also known as the Dark Walker. It&#x27;s said that his energy is weakened under the strong sun. Moreover, he hates storms, which is why he only fought the Sea God at dusk.</p>
<p>Hearing that, Sibin&#x27;s eyes filled with contemplation. Is that so? I thought that trident was the source of the ancient power. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be an enemy. Could it be that a conflict between the two sides arose within Ye Hao&#x27;s body, causing him to become like this? The trident is an external force, which means Ye Hao himself must have a connection with O Thuy Ach. Whether he&#x27;s a kinsman of the Dark Walker or something else, according to the hierarchy of power, Ye Hao must also be afraid of the sun and storms.</p>
<p>He then looked towards the sunset, but it was already dark now, where could he find the sun? It&#x27;s a stormy night. Rui, do you think it&#x27;s possible that what O Thuy Ach hates isn&#x27;t the gales and rainstorms, but the fierce lightning that has extreme properties similar to the scorching sun? Hearing his suggestion, she also quickly fell into thought. I&#x27;ve never thought of this. What does what Master said have to do with the person down there? Sibin then showed a confident smile, if I can&#x27;t find the sun now, I can just create a generator. While the three of them were still thinking of a way, a figure appeared in the space.</p>
<p>Bach Dieu looked at him angrily, what&#x27;s wrong, what are you looking for me for? Sibin understood that girl&#x27;s personality, so he immediately started flattering her, of course, I&#x27;m looking for the lovely, beautiful, kind, and gentle young lady to reluctantly help me with something. Hearing his words, her nose quickly pointed to the sky. You think saying that will make me help? I&#x27;m not the type who likes to hear this kind of sweet talk, it&#x27;s nauseating. I&#x27;ll help you with official business. Go on, what needs to be done? Sibin pointed forward and suggested, it&#x27;s simple, use your lightning ability to see if you can destroy that monster.</p>
<p>Bach Dieu looked over in horror, what the hell is that thing? It&#x27;s so disgusting, I feel like attacking it will contaminate my lightning. Seeing that girl being so difficult, Sibin was about to lose his temper but was stopped by Lori. Bach Dieu, we&#x27;re counting on you. We can&#x27;t touch him, we can only rely on you. Being spoken to like that, the girl was praised to the high heavens and immediately agreed.</p>
<p>Alright, fine. Seeing as you&#x27;re all so sincere, I&#x27;ll help this time. After speaking, she immediately charged straight towards Ye Hao. All of you, get out of my way. Seeing her appear, they were completely smitten.</p>
<p>Is this also a reinforcement sent by Lord Eagle Crest? She&#x27;s so cute. Bach Dieu, however, didn&#x27;t care about their gazes and quickly used her lightning ability on the monster in front of her. Receiving the baptism of lightning, Ye Hao&#x27;s entire body emitted unpleasant sounds. The other players felt a headache upon hearing his calls. But for them, this had almost no effect.</p>
<p>The most surprising one was still Bach Dieu. It seemed she wasn&#x27;t swayed by the ancient curse and continued to use her skills to attack. Just as she was about to deliver the finishing blow, she was blocked by a player&#x27;s arm. It seems they were mesmerized this time, causing them to see her as an enemy and attack. Sibin saw this scene and immediately rushed forward.</p>
<p>This is bad, after that guy&#x27;s enchanting words grew stronger, even the players can&#x27;t control themselves. It was indeed the case, they were completely unable to control their bodies, even though their consciousness remained. Luckily, Sibin appeared in time to block his blade. Then he used his flames to punish the one who dared to be disrespectful to Bach Dieu. Sibin looked around in contemplation.</p>
<p>This is troublesome. If it were just the players, it would still be fine. But now there are also a large number of warriors affected by the enchanting words. If they keep attacking like this, I&#x27;m afraid they won&#x27;t have a chance to be revived. But when he looked at Bach Dieu, who was still fiercely dealing with those who touched her, he knew he didn&#x27;t need to go over and help.</p>
<p>But now that I think about it, it seems she isn&#x27;t affected by the ancient curses. Even though Lori isn&#x27;t considered to have the ability to purify enchantments, Rui fought Ye Hao directly in single combat and wasn&#x27;t infected. Now with Bach Dieu added to the list, all of them can ignore that enchantment, which proves that awakened demi-humans have a certain resistance to these charms. And could the fact that awakened demi-humans are chosen to become vessels be related to this near-perfect resistance? He then looked at his two maids. This is well worth a try.</p>
<p>Seeing her master looking at her, Rui immediately asked, My Lord, is there something you need help with? Sibin smiled mysteriously. Rui, you take Lori and move all the warriors in the center to a place 100 meters away. Lori, use your purification art to temporarily control them on the outer circle. Remember, you must deal with them cleanly in a moment. Receiving the order, the two of them immediately left to carry it out.</p>
<p>Then he looked at Bach Dieu and ordered, stop. If you continue like this, someone will be sacrificed. I remember you have a move called Encircling Electric Field, right? Don&#x27;t hesitate, I believe you can do it. Bach Dieu was suddenly embraced by him and became dazed. Alright then, let me give it a try.</p>
<p>But what about the people blocking the way on the outside? Sibin looked at her and reassured her, don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll help. And so, he counted from one to two, and threw the girl&#x27;s entire body into the vast sky. After doing so, he looked towards Rui to ask if her side was cleared out yet. Rui replied while fighting, yes, it&#x27;s all cleared. And so, she used her legs to kick a player out of the area.</p>
<p>Sibin received the signal and immediately ordered Bach Dieu to act. And so, she quickly created an electric field that enveloped Ye Hao. A massive bolt of lightning was immediately released, striking his body. Not only that, but it also spread to the mesmerized players. Bach Dieu paid them no mind and continued to intensify her lightning.</p>
<p>It quickly spread around, roasting the very air. But it seems because her control wasn&#x27;t good, that lightning bolt was also aiming for Sibin. Seeing this, he quickly dodged. This accuracy isn&#x27;t very good, is it? Bach Dieu looked at him angrily. What did you say? That&#x27;s because the power was too great, this time it consumed a lot of my stamina and energy.</p>
<p>Knowing this girl wanted him to praise her, Sibin had no choice. Alright, beautiful and kind young lady, you&#x27;ve worked hard. Rui then approached from a distance and asked, Bach Dieu, has Ye Hao been eliminated? She nodded affirmatively. Of course, my electric field is no joke. Everyone, look at his state, there should be no doubt anymore.</p>
<p>Sibin stepped forward to inspect. It&#x27;s over. I didn&#x27;t expect the Child of Destiny to turn into a pile of ashes. Although it was a relationship of &#x27;him or me,&#x27; this guy was truly unlucky. He then quickly asked if the quest was complete, and the system also appeared to congratulate him.</p>
<p>Host has completed the first main story quest. Now presenting the first reward to the Host. Sibin looked at the crystal in his hand, very happy to receive this item. While he was still thinking about getting a few more rewards, the system warned him to leave. Hearing something was wrong in the system&#x27;s words, his whole body trembled.</p>
<p>At the same time, the surrounding space was quickly enveloped by a wave of bloodlust. It created a terrifying pressure that weighed down on the three of them. Knowing there was no time, he quickly asked the two maids beside him if they were okay. Even in this situation, Rui still knew how to joke. Everything else is fine, just that my clothes are a little torn.</p>
<p>Bach Dieu, on the other hand, was not fine at all. She cried out, I&#x27;m over here, can someone come help me? Sibin was also helpless with that girl and immediately pulled her out of the ground. Looking at her, he teased, you&#x27;re covered in mud like this. Hearing that, she looked at him sulkily, &quot;It&#x27;s all your fault that I&#x27;m not clean anymore.&quot; Really, even so, this matter could only be blamed on Ye Hao, but connecting the dots, it felt like the one taking the blame had actually come out ahead. Rui looked at the girl and reminded her, &quot;It&#x27;s okay, you can just go back and take a bath.&quot; At this moment, the system suddenly started working normally again, which made Sibin feel confused.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the host for obtaining half a piece of the mysterious crystal. Congratulations to the host for receiving special rewards. Please review. Looking at what he had obtained, he was very happy. Oh my, this thing really is...</p>
<p>The cut on this half piece of the mysterious crystal, you can tell at a glance it was forcibly broken in two. I&#x27;m not an idiot, this thing is identical to the piece I almost gave to Rui. The system took it from Ye Hao, right? Besides, it was clearly a complete crystal to begin with. This also means that the fluctuation just now was most likely two powerful forces fighting over that crystal piece, and the force behind the system ultimately only managed to snatch half. If that&#x27;s the case, once the system completely analyzes this half piece of the mysterious crystal, I should be able to summon 5,000 players.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, his gaze became more determined. The number of players might increase to 5,000, and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good thing or a disaster. But that&#x27;s a problem for later, not something I need to worry about now. Let&#x27;s continue to check the two remaining rewards. The first is an Angel Summoning skill.</p>
<p>Seeing its effect, Sibin was overjoyed. Well, well, well, this time the system&#x27;s item is quite to my liking. Even though I can only command a legendary-grade Hao Angel for half an hour, it&#x27;s enough to drag the Pope out of the royal palace and annihilate him 100 times. However, the name &quot;Hao Angel&quot; couldn&#x27;t help but remind one of Ye Hao. Thinking of that, he immediately felt a headache, to the surprise of the two maids.</p>
<p>Sibin looked towards the distant sky and pondered, &quot;Although I now have the qualifications to be reckless, I can&#x27;t be careless. After all, I still haven&#x27;t figured out the First Prince&#x27;s true identity. What if I go overboard and scare the First Prince to death? You have to know that an enemy in the open is much easier to deal with than an enemy in the dark.&quot; Bach Dieu, for some reason, came forward and disrupted his thoughts. &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m talking to you! Don&#x27;t just put your hand anywhere, my head is not a table.&quot; &quot;You definitely did that on purpose, didn&#x27;t you?&quot; Sibin looked at the girl and quickly tried to sweet-talk her. &quot;Really, really, how could I have done it on purpose?&quot; But his actions made her angry, and she zapped lightning everywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;You troublesome guy, don&#x27;t try any perverted tricks on me.&quot; The two maids saw their master getting zapped badly and came forward to ask. But with his current strength, he wasn&#x27;t worried at all. &quot;It&#x27;s just that I was thinking about how to fight the next battle, it&#x27;s a bit troublesome.&quot; Hearing this, Rui also became more serious. &quot;This is indeed a difficult problem. The situation before was clearly not bad, but after being disrupted by Ye Hao, most of the soldiers fell into a coma.</p>
<p>After the demi-humans were suppressed, only a few were left.&quot; Seeing her so pensive, Sibin immediately comforted her, &quot;Oh, forget it, thinking too much is useless. Since things have come to this, let&#x27;s just go with the flow, withdraw from the battlefield, and observe the fight for now.&quot; At this time, back in the cathedral, a bunny-eared girl was praying to the gods when she was interrupted by a panicked shout. &quot;Anna!&quot; Anna angrily looked at him. &quot;Even if you are His Holiness the Pope, interrupting a sacred prayer is completely improper.&quot; But the old man had no time and pointed straight at her, &quot;Anna, what is the situation with your awakening? Those damned rebels dared to use a scheme to attack Fire Dragon City, and that Eagle Crest Lord is also a difficult one to deal with.&quot; Hearing that, Anna frowned. &quot;I have now reached the threshold of the second stage.</p>
<p>Although I broke through the first stage using a divine relic, to break through the second stage, I need enlightenment. Enlightenment is like a foundation; without this foundation, I will fail no matter how many divine miracles there are.&quot; The Pope heard that and quickly asked, &quot;Then what must I do to help you?&quot; Hearing that, she smiled, &quot;To receive the blessing of the God of War and Red Flame, there must be a battle that shakes people&#x27;s hearts. If they want to start a war, then let those rebels come to the royal capital and start one.&quot; &quot;A true battlefield is the opportunity for my enlightenment. At that time, I will become the most perfect vessel for my master. If you know what to do, then go quickly.</p>
<p>My master and I are both waiting.&quot; At this moment, on another side, the zombies were still roaring continuously. Looking over, the people above were discussing, &quot;Your Highness the Prince, you should let Lord Bosa stop. The number of undead is increasing. What if they can&#x27;t be controlled later?&quot; But at this moment, the prince couldn&#x27;t be bothered. &quot;If they can&#x27;t be controlled, then just let them be.</p>
<p>After all, these are my best chess pieces.&quot; The other person was stunned to hear this. &quot;Your Highness, you will become fangs and claws for the undead.&quot; But this man couldn&#x27;t be bothered. &quot;So what if I was the firstborn? This empire was built on martial strength, but I was just a monster with no talent. So now that I have enough power, I can take back everything that belongs to me.&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me things like that old man wanted to protect me. It&#x27;s all lies.</p>
<p>He watched as that bastard second brother turned me into a cripple, neither man nor woman, and was driven out of the kingdom without a single word of concern.&quot; &quot;Do you know how cold the wind is at the Jade Border? They brought all of this upon themselves.&quot; As he spoke, he revealed his vampire fangs. &quot;Calang, you will always be loyal to me, right?&quot; Facing the pressure from the prince, he immediately knelt down. &quot;This subordinate understands. I pledge my unwavering loyalty to Your Highness.&quot; As for the prince, he had now gone to meet the Pope. Seeing his state, the Pope was equally surprised.</p>
<p>&quot;Your Highness the First Prince, I truly never expected that you, the one always considered a good-for-nothing, would be able to stand before me.&quot; &quot;Not only that, but you&#x27;ve also brought me such a big surprise.&quot; The First Prince looked at him angrily. &quot;You&#x27;re just a mere servant who relies on the pity of the gods. What could you possibly know?&quot; After speaking, he used his hellfire to attack the Pope directly. Sibin, on the side, watched with delight. His two maids immediately started discussing, &quot;Master, they&#x27;ve started fighting.</p>
<p>This is so exciting.&quot; &quot;The First Prince of the Colagen Empire is a vampire. Who will win in the end?&quot; The Pope&#x27;s men immediately mounted their Rocs and charged out. &quot;Destroy those who dare to blaspheme the gods.&quot; The battle between the two sides became extremely tense. They looked at the undead angrily. &quot;Get your hands off me, you unclean things!&quot; But in a moment of carelessness, he was bitten directly in the neck by the First Prince&#x27;s bats.</p>
<p>His body quickly turned into a dried husk, and his blood was absorbed by the undead. The First Prince now stood in the rain of blood, insatiably craving fresh blood energy. &quot;I will only become stronger and stronger. These petty tricks are fundamentally useless against me.&quot; &quot;Old man, where is your God Descent Art? Why don&#x27;t you use it?&quot; The Pope looked at him angrily. &quot;You will soon see my master descend upon this world.&quot; But after waiting for a long time without a response from Ye Hao, the old man became anxious.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is that guy? Why hasn&#x27;t he come out yet?&quot; But after waiting a while longer, there was still no response. The Pope immediately felt confused. &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I was tricked. If I ever see that Ye Hao again, I will definitely throw him into a pit of fire.&quot; No matter what, he had to stall for time. While he was thinking, Anna came out from inside.</p>
<p>She looked ahead with an expression full of confidence. &quot;I feel the god&#x27;s summons. The god likes this atmosphere. I will be here to receive the descent.&quot; Seeing her aura growing stronger and stronger, the Pope finally felt more at ease. The First Prince also sensed that something was wrong and immediately ordered his subordinate to advance and stop her.</p>
<p>Calang appeared beside Anna as fast as a flash of lightning. But before he could do anything, his entire body was engulfed by flames. Seeing the Pope dare to fight back like that, the First Prince was furious. &quot;You rotten old man, don&#x27;t you want to live anymore?&quot; But the Pope didn&#x27;t look at him and instead laughed like a madman. &quot;This power...</p>
<p>she has awakened! The Great Flame Dragon, the God of War and Red Flame, has finally descended!&quot; But before he could rejoice for long, Anna&#x27;s spear tip suddenly pierced through his heart. His entire body froze stiff at her betrayal. Anna looked at him and shook her head. &quot;Bada, a thief who dares to call himself War.&quot; At this moment, an undead was still wandering around. Sibin looked at it grumpily.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t stand it. Just how many undead did that idiot create? I take a moment to go out and relieve myself, and I still run into one.&quot; While he was still thinking, a body suddenly flew past him. It was the prince and the Pope, pinned tightly to the wall. Seeing them, he wondered, &quot;Why did the two of them commit suicide together in a field like this? I was only gone for a moment, did I miss some important plot point? There isn&#x27;t a third party on this battlefield, so who on earth took them both out?&quot; When he turned his head to look in that direction, he was surprised to see Anna. He never expected to meet her in this situation, but her state now was no longer the same as before.</p>
<p>The First Prince also saw Sibin&#x27;s appearance and was astonished. &quot;Eagle Crest Lord, why are you here? Weren&#x27;t you injured?&quot; Sibin appeared in front of him. &quot;Even though I was seriously injured and my soldiers were reduced to less than a tenth, unable to participate in the battle, as a subordinate, I was still very worried about the First Prince. So I took it upon myself to come in here to see if I could be of any help.&quot; Hearing this, he opened his mouth wide, &quot;If you want to focus, then I&#x27;ll give you a chance to become my blood slave.&quot; Sibin wasn&#x27;t stupid enough to do as he said. He glanced at Anna for a moment.</p>
<p>Then he thought of a way, dodged past the First Prince&#x27;s body, and threw him straight towards the tip of Anna&#x27;s spear. Her powerful spear quickly pierced through his shoulder. Sibin continued to play dumb, &quot;First Prince, are you alright? It&#x27;s all my fault for not noticing the danger sooner. If only...&quot; The First Prince, with the wound on his body, was no longer in the mood to suck Sibin&#x27;s blood. The two of them quickly separated to dodge the fierce attacks coming from Anna.</p>
<p>It seemed that after using her body as a vessel for a deity, Anna&#x27;s attacks were more ferocious than before. Facing the tip of her spear, the First Prince still held onto a sliver of hope. As long as the soul-gathering formation&#x27;s sacrifice absorbed enough soul energy, he could summon a legendary-level ghost dragon to help, even if it meant temporarily delaying the mount of the Undead Great Emperor. Sibin looked at him and wondered, &quot;Does that guy still have a way to turn the tables?&quot; The First Prince paid him no mind, but looked towards his pendant, &quot;Luckily, I set up the soul-gathering formation beforehand. Just by using the summoning stone, I can activate the sacrifice of the souls of several hundred thousand soldiers, enough to hold back the full power of this ghost dragon.&quot; It&#x27;s almost time.</p>
<p>My final trump card is finally about to be played. Power surged more and more within his body. Just as everything was successfully prepared to summon an evil dragon, his formation unexpectedly shrank pitifully. Sibin walked over to inquire, &quot;Your Highness, First Prince, why is the formation so small?&quot; This made him embarrassed. &quot;High-level undead can transform into soul form, so an overly large formation is meaningless.&quot; As he spoke, a soul appeared within that formation.</p>
<p>Seeing the light grow larger and larger, the First Prince was overjoyed. &quot;Look closely, this is...&quot; But before he could finish his sentence, he fell silent. The First Prince was abashed, &quot;Excuse me, are you the undead spirit?&quot; The summoned entity pointed straight at him and announced, &quot;You idiot, the soul-gathering formation has been sabotaged by someone else. All the gathered souls have dissipated. What are you summoning me for?&quot; Hearing that, the First Prince was confused, &quot;What? My formation has been destroyed?&quot; Seeing his highness so troubled, Sibin stepped forward to ask, &quot;Your Highness, where is the soul-gathering circle? Why don&#x27;t I, your subordinate, go and see if there&#x27;s a problem&quot; or not.</p>
<p>And after learning that the formation was at the easternmost wall, he was stunned. Because wasn&#x27;t that the place he had destroyed a few days ago? Remembering this, he immediately scratched his head, &quot;I&#x27;m truly sorry, Your Highness. When I went to relieve myself, I was attacked by an undead. While defending myself, I accidentally smashed the soul-gathering circle.&quot; The tiny ghost dragon was also at a loss, &quot;Alright then, I&#x27;m leaving. What can I do with a tiny body like this?&quot; As soon as it finished speaking, it was the first to flee.</p>
<p>Seeing all the effort he had prepared completely vanish, the First Prince was furious. So he immediately looked at Sibin, &quot;Lord of Eagle Crest, all of this is because of you!&quot; After speaking, he turned his head to look for his second subordinate, &quot;General Kalan, are you still conscious?&quot; He immediately jumped up, thinking the situation was unfavorable and wanting to retreat from this place. But that foolish prince didn&#x27;t want to and was so senseless that he let a spear appear behind his back. Kalan saw that and immediately used his body to block the attack for him. That guy didn&#x27;t even shed a single tear and turned into a gust of wind, disappearing right before Sibin&#x27;s face.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t bother with that useless guy and looked towards Anna. &quot;However, compared to that foolish First Prince, this one is clearly much more troublesome. Is this a demi-human after becoming a vessel? No, to be precise, she is no longer Anna, but the God of War who has awakened by borrowing her body.&quot; At this moment, an old man appeared in front of Anna, wanting to sacrifice himself to summon a Flame Dragon. Banthaza, inside Anna&#x27;s body, saw this and immediately became anxious, because if the Flame Dragon appeared, things would become even more troublesome. But it was too late to stop it.</p>
<p>That guy had already completed the sacrificial ritual, causing a fierce flame to appear in the sky. Banthaza saw this and, not wanting Bakda to appear, rushed forward to attack. But it was all in vain; he couldn&#x27;t touch the other guy&#x27;s body. It seems the magic shield truly held back Banthaza. He paid no mind and immediately sucked all the flames from the air into his body.</p>
<p>After that, a laugh echoed in the air, making it hard for us to hear much. Sibin sensed the situation was getting more and more unstable and moved away from the area. From within the great flame, a spatial rift appeared, and the Flame Dragon stepped out into this world. And it greeted the world with a ball of fire element synthesized within its body. His dragon&#x27;s breath, after being spewed out, was like a stream of molten lava that melted the ground.</p>
<p>Sibin had now returned to the side of his two maids. After that, he quickly led the two of them away from this place to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. But he didn&#x27;t forget to look at the evil dragon that was relentlessly destroying the surrounding scenery. According to the system&#x27;s assessment, its level is around 94. Not only that, it also opened its mouth and spoke in a human tongue, &quot;Finally, I can appear here, albeit temporarily.</p>
<p>Right now, I need a body that can withstand my power.&quot; Accompanying his words were flames that constantly erupted, melting the surrounding space. Banthaza looked over there and frowned, &quot;This power...&quot; But this was also the moment the Flame Dragon found his position and prepared to attack. While dodging the attack, Banthaza pondered, &quot;I have just awakened, my divine power is weak, I&#x27;m no match for this fire dragon. Logically, I should now be looking for artifacts that can contain the divinity of war to restore my power, but right after awakening, I had to encounter&quot; this guy. So this awakening is a complete conspiracy.</p>
<p>This fire dragon wants to change the pillar. A cuckoo occupying a magpie&#x27;s nest, seizing my foundation. But as the God of War, how could he let this happen? He immediately summoned his soldiers from the underworld to fight back. Banthaza&#x27;s power exploded, catching the Flame Dragon off guard and causing it to lose a chunk of its body. It looked at the God of War&#x27;s weapon, &quot;That spear is a divine artifact?&quot; It now became anxious, &quot;To think it tore a piece of my divinity.</p>
<p>It seems I must win this fight quickly.&quot; Now, the exchange of attacks between the two of them was like a never-ending battle. While dodging, Banthaza felt regret because he was just a little short earlier. If he could have pierced the dragon&#x27;s body just now, destroying it wouldn&#x27;t have been difficult at all. Summoning a divine artifact takes time. If this continues, I will be drained by this impostor.</p>
<p>I must think of a way to stop its attacks. But while fighting, Banthaza suddenly sensed three special people. He quickly looked in that direction, &quot;Who is over there? I didn&#x27;t expect such a high-grade energy to be here.&quot; &quot;If it&#x27;s that thing, I won&#x27;t lose to that dragon.&quot; After saying that, he immediately rushed straight in that direction. Seeing this, Sibin smiled, &quot;I was originally planning to wait for those two idiots to wear each other out before making a move. I didn&#x27;t expect both of them to force me to reveal my extraordinary identity.&quot; So he used the Hao Angel delay card.</p>
<p>This was also the moment Banthaza&#x27;s claws were getting closer and closer to his face. But from within the dark sky, a ray of light appeared, rushing straight towards Sibin&#x27;s body, a pair of beautiful wings appeared, to Banthaza&#x27;s surprise. A confident smile appeared on the corner of Sibin&#x27;s mouth. with a beautiful, pure white suit of armor. &quot;What&#x27;s this about a Hao Angel descending? I waited half a day, and it turns out it&#x27;s just myself.&quot; Is this the control the system was talking about? It&#x27;s so forced.</p>
<p>Then he smiled, looked at Lori, and shook his head, &quot;Don&#x27;t be scared, it&#x27;s me.&quot; After speaking, he even patted her head. But he didn&#x27;t know when Rui had also appeared behind him, licking his neck. But at this moment, he began to feel that something was not right. Because the condition of those two girls was completely different from normal. After checking, he found out that it was due to the ability of the Hao Angel.</p>
<p>If the duration of the transformation ability wasn&#x27;t so short, he would have wanted to use this power to play around a bit. But now was not the time for him to get carried away like that. Because he still had two opponents in front of him that he hadn&#x27;t dealt with. He now tightly gripped the lightning sword in his palm. Then he created a magic circle of light that enveloped his body.</p>
<p>Along with this, a ray of light quickly shot towards the sky, separating the two of them from each other. Banthaza looked over with a pensive gaze, &quot;What is this? That aura is... It&#x27;s just as I thought. That human has the aura of the God of Light, but why did he appear here?&quot; While they were still stunned, Sibin suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood. Seeing this, his maids became very worried, &quot;Master.&quot; Sibin showed a pained expression, &quot;This power is too strong, I can&#x27;t hold on much longer.</p>
<p>That sword is absorbing all the light around me, I can&#x27;t even find a way to hold it. System, what is this situation?&quot; It quickly reminded him, &quot;The host&#x27;s body cannot withstand the pressure of the Divine Sword of Judgment.&quot; Hearing that, Sibin was angry, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you tell me something so important&quot; from the beginning? It&#x27;s no good, I can&#x27;t control it anymore. Banthaza looked at him and smiled. &quot;I thought you were some powerful figure. Just a mere mortal body fantasizing about controlling divine power.&quot; Lori was now trying to use her recovery power to prevent her master from breaking apart.</p>
<p>The system announced at this moment, the host can purchase the Blessing of the Hao Angel, requiring the consumption of 100 million gold coins. Looking at the astronomical number, he really wanted to curse but had no other choice. In the end, he could only use the money he had to exchange for the blessing. So this was the Blessing of the Hao Angel. As expected, it was no longer as strenuous as before.</p>
<p>Thus, he easily used his power, creating a stream of golden sword qi that attacked the Flame Dragon directly, and easily took one of its arms. And after that, he easily absorbed the divinity of war. Seeing this, he was surprised. Was it because he had defeated Anna that he obtained the divinity on her? So, did I just defeat the newly awakened God of War? To still be able to jump around after being stabbed twice so powerfully, its health is truly immense. That dragon looked at him.</p>
<p>So it was you. Last time, if she hadn&#x27;t protected you, you would have been burned to ashes. You are her person, yet you don&#x27;t know who she is? That&#x27;s right, right now she is merely clinging to her last breath, perhaps only a little instinct remains. Hearing this, Sibin&#x27;s face became puzzled. Stop playing hide-and-seek with me.</p>
<p>Who is she? Speak up. The Flame Dragon looked at him teasingly. Do you really want to know who she is? But in reality, it only wanted to stall for time until his transformation state disappeared, so it continued to beat around the bush. Alright, this story begins from a faraway tale. Upon hearing this, Sibin immediately flared up and looked at it.</p>
<p>Enough. You want to play a stalling game with me? Then go to hell. I can completely feel that you don&#x27;t want to answer. Before being sent back to its world, the Flame Dragon roared in anger. Damn it, I&#x27;ll remember you.</p>
<p>But he couldn&#x27;t be bothered and continued to charge forward. Did you forget you said the exact same thing last time? After that, he flew to his two maids and held them in his arms, using his own wings to shield them from the terrifying heat emitted by the Flame Dragon. After all, this was the aftermath of a destroyed god, so it was not to be taken lightly. Afterwards, he asked his maids if they were okay. But seeing them so lively, they seemed to be perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Sibin saw that and smiled. It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re okay. It&#x27;s almost over. Suddenly, he remembered something. That&#x27;s right, the First Prince.</p>
<p>I almost forgot him. We must pull out the weeds by the roots and not leave any future trouble. If it weren&#x27;t for those two boring gods causing chaos, I would have finished him off long ago, especially since he&#x27;s already heavily injured. Oh well, I&#x27;ll just let Clement lead the Soulless Knights to eliminate him. Elsewhere, the First Prince had a face of extreme anger.</p>
<p>Damn it, as a vampire, as long as my death energy isn&#x27;t depleted, I can regenerate my body. I will definitely return. At that time, I want to drain the blood of every single one of them, whether it&#x27;s those bastards from the Church or the Eagle Crest Lord who ruined my great plan. Wait, what&#x27;s happening? Why is it snowing in this weather? A girl appeared behind him. Isn&#x27;t weather like this beautiful? You are just a petty vampire.</p>
<p>Consider this snowy scene as a farewell gift to send you on your way. Gabriel, the Holy Maiden of the Church of Light, looked at the First Prince and shook her head. Go in peace. After that, the intensity of the snowfall grew, covering the entire space here. Sibin was also captivated by such a snowfall.</p>
<p>Why is the weather so strange? Wait, this snow isn&#x27;t cold at all. This isn&#x27;t snow. Not only that, it also made him feel an immense familiarity. These snowflakes were fundamentally the purest holy light energy, but why would this kind of energy appear here? At this moment, he was immediately drawn by the sounds of battle created by Gabriel. Sibin looked over in surprise.</p>
<p>Clement and the Soulless Knights, why are they fighting someone here? Moreover, their opponent is... isn&#x27;t that the Holy Maiden of the Church of Light, Gabriel. Clement faced the woman before him, gripping the sword in his hand tightly. Gabriel, however, was completely fearless, as if she were on a stroll. Old knight, you are clearly a human, why would you want to befriend the undead? If that&#x27;s the case, then return to the embrace of death.</p>
<p>The light does not welcome you. Sibin stood to the side, looking at her, stunned. While fighting Clement, she had almost wiped out the Soulless Knights. They are both Holy Maidens, but compared to the ultimate weapon of the Church of Light, Louis is truly just a mascot. No wonder Anna was defeated.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with strength, but rather the powers they follow. Gabriel still hadn&#x27;t noticed his presence and continued to fight. Seeing the smile on Gabriel&#x27;s lips, Sibin realized his old knight was about to be overwhelmed. If this continued, his entire troop of Soulless Knights would be cleaned up by her. With no other choice, he could only reveal himself to stop this.</p>
<p>Stop your hand at once. It seemed his current appearance caused Gabriel to quickly misunderstand. Lord Hao Angel. I didn&#x27;t expect there would be someone here using the power passed down by the angels. Sibin then looked at Clement and ordered, You, stand down for now.</p>
<p>Gabriel now looked at him with a displeased expression. You were chosen by the Hao Angel, so why must you befriend the undead? Sibin, while dodging, didn&#x27;t forget to reply, Because I won them in a lottery, why else? So he brought out his powerful blades to defend himself. Gabriel now felt extremely annoyed. The Judgment Angel is the same as the Throne Angel. They hate the undead the most.</p>
<p>Saying this, the corner of her mouth curled into a smile. Even though you know this, you still want to stop me. Sibin dodged while pondering, This is so troublesome. Although I don&#x27;t want a conflict with the Church of Light, eliminating the undead is a matter of principle for them. There&#x27;s no way to communicate and resolve this peacefully with words anymore.</p>
<p>In a moment of carelessness, Gabriel created an opening for him to get close. Sibin looked at her with a cold gaze. Enough. Stop. Leave immediately, or I won&#x27;t mind sending you to meet the God of Light.</p>
<p>But he had underestimated her power. Even in a situation like this, she still easily counterattacked. Sibin retreated. Was my feeling wrong? That last sword strike was clearly several times heavier. But he didn&#x27;t know that Gabriel was currently in the state of Angelic Descent.</p>
<p>It seemed that in this state, her power made things more difficult for him, but theoretically speaking, Angelic Descent is not the same as a sacrifice. The highest-ranking Archangel is only a demigod. After the descent, the user will be slightly weakened, which is much milder than a divine descent. No wonder Gabriel always has an indifferent look; it turns out she has a trump card and is fundamentally not afraid. Gabriel looked at him and smiled.</p>
<p>Well, since you were chosen as the Holy Son of the Holy See, why would you join hands with the undead? Hearing that, even he was surprised. Chosen? What does that mean? Isn&#x27;t this a reward from the system? And what&#x27;s this about a Holy Son? Doesn&#x27;t the Church of Light only have a Holy Maiden? I don&#x27;t know what a Holy Son does either. Could it be to have a bunch of little holy children with the Holy Maiden? Holy Maiden... No, I&#x27;ve been too influenced by Lori lately. Get serious.</p>
<p>The time for the divine descent is now less than two minutes. I could collapse at any moment. Gabriel saw that he wasn&#x27;t saying anything and frowned. You don&#x27;t want to talk, do you? Sibin was not paying any attention to her at this point, but was focusing everything on his sword. If that&#x27;s the case, I have no choice but to use this move.</p>
<p>The two maids saw his state and became worried. Even the old butler was no exception. Sibin used his ultimate move and knelt down. Your Respected Highness, I have no hostility towards you. Please allow me to explain about these undead.</p>
<p>These undead knights are all my subordinates. They were unfortunately killed in a campaign, then turned into undead knights by the First Prince using a soul-gathering formation. But what I didn&#x27;t expect was that even after becoming undead, they continued to be loyal to me and fight for me. Gabriel, no matter how much I hate the undead, how could I be so heartless as to strike down such loyal servants? His heartfelt performance and words left Gabriel stunned. Sibin knew that this alone was not enough, so he signaled his two maids to help.</p>
<p>They immediately started crying and telling their sad story, making anyone who heard it feel heartbroken. But who would have thought that at this critical moment, Bai Diao would appear and ruin the mood. I&#x27;m here! What are you guys doing? Sibin knew he couldn&#x27;t let that girl speak nonsense and immediately glared at her. Cry for me, or today will be your death anniversary. Gabriel looked at him and his crying servants, and surmised that he probably wasn&#x27;t lying, so she nodded.</p>
<p>I can sympathize with your heart that cherishes loyal retainers, but the undead still need to be eliminated. I am very sorry for what happened. These warriors deserve respect, but the existence of the undead is unacceptable. Alright then, if I consume my original divine power, I can turn them into Knights of Light. Are you willing? But even so, their souls cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>Hearing that, he immediately and joyfully accepted this gift that fell from the heavens. Of course I&#x27;m willing. This is also a salvation for them. But, won&#x27;t it cause you to pay too great a price? Gabriel didn&#x27;t say much more and used her power to envelop the knights in light. No need to worry too much.</p>
<p>Under her power, the undead were quickly enveloped in light. And so the transformation process quickly took place. They quickly shed their dark cloaks. And then a dazzling light stunned everyone present. Sibin looked at his knights and almost screamed.</p>
<p>Because their new form was truly too cool, along with incredibly powerful stats. Although they have no recovery skill, their damage against the undead and demons has been greatly increased. Most importantly, I can now display this great power openly and honorably without having to hide it. At this very moment, his transformation ability also disappeared, after which he looked towards the Holy Maiden. He immediately knelt down before her, &quot;I am truly grateful for your help today.</p>
<p>If there is an opportunity next time, I hope that I can be of some assistance to the Holy Maiden.&quot; Gabriel looked at him scrutinizingly, &quot;In the end, you must remember to use the power of light carefully and not do evil deeds.&quot; He said it so coolly, but in reality, that girl immediately fainted into his arms after her transformation ended. The problem he had to worry about now was what to do with this Holy Maiden girl? Although she had lost a lot of power, it seemed Gabriel still had her own consciousness. Sibin felt that this was the perfect opportunity. He immediately used a divine rope to tie her body up. And what followed was a scene of brutal physical torture for the Holy Maiden.</p>
<p>Without a word, he applied force with his hands, weighing down on her buttocks. Because she had no strength left to resist, she could only accept her bitter end. Not only that, she was also humiliatingly hung up by him. After finishing tormenting her, he led his servants and left. Anyway, she had a protective talisman on her, so she wouldn&#x27;t die that easily.</p>
<p>The problem he needed to deal with now was to prepare for the next box. However, the treasure he was trying to find had already been discovered by Bai Diao. She gave a bewitching smile as she looked at him, which was very uh... annoying. Seeing her teasing face, he got angry and gave her a beating.</p>
<p>After dealing with her, he was also led to the location of the treasure inside the royal palace. He was imagining the scene of himself obtaining lots of gold, silver, jewels, and treasures here. And when he opened the door to the royal palace&#x27;s treasury. What Sibin witnessed immediately stunned him. Why is this not like what I imagined? Isn&#x27;t it supposed to be treasures and gold everywhere? This place is so different from what I thought.</p>
<p>The equipment hanging on wooden posts was nothing rare. The treasure in this whole room was only five or six chests of gold and silver. a branch of the World Tree, a gem from a scepter, and a hero-grade sword. This innermost room actually only contained four things. The branch of the World Tree and the gem from the Scepter of Nature were typical, extremely precious magical items.</p>
<p>It seems that despite the old king&#x27;s turmoil, there were still some rare items. He immediately gave those two items to Lori with instructions to take them to Winterfrost City to see if the divinity within them could be extracted. As for the hero-grade sword he found. Although it wasn&#x27;t a greatsword, it didn&#x27;t feel bad. It had conquest and an intelligent presence within.</p>
<p>I can be considered strong enough now. But at this moment, an old man suddenly entered to report to him. He announced, &quot;Lord, we have rescued the old duke from prison. In addition, there are a few nobles who have not yet surrendered. Currently, the king still has one prince, three princesses, and the queen alive.</p>
<p>They are demanding the return of royal power. How should we deal with these people?&quot; Sibin smiled upon hearing this, &quot;For those who don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for them, how else should we deal with them? Behead the prince and display his head throughout the country. The others will suffer the same fate.&quot; Then he looked towards the butler, Clement, &quot;Remember to arrange for people to bring these things back to Winterfrost City. Compared to the center, Dragonfire City, Eagle Crest Territory in the center of the northern continent is the forefront in the fight against demonic beasts. Moreover, at this stage, I cannot rest assured leaving Winterfrost City to be managed by demi-humans, so choosing that place as the capital is more appropriate.&quot; While he was discussing matters, a voice suddenly rang out from outside, attracting his attention.</p>
<p>The second prince, with an angry face, looked at him, &quot;I&#x27;m telling you, Lord of Eagle Crest, don&#x27;t think you can sit back and enjoy this country. My older brother Hitler is on his way here, he might have already reached Dragonfire City by now.&quot; Before he could finish speaking, another person appeared, &quot;Reporting, my Lord, a mile outside the city, an army has arrived with ill intentions. Their military strength is estimated at 20,000.&quot; At this time, Sibin&#x27;s father appeared. &quot;My good son, I&#x27;ve finally waited for you. Initially, I just wanted to stand among the ranks of the nobility, but I was unexpectedly plotted against by the Pope.&quot; &quot;Furthermore, that Hitler, in order to bewitch the Pope, even poisoned me and handed me over to the Pope as a hostage.</p>
<p>How could that bastard treat me like this? He wouldn&#x27;t even spare a little money. Son, teach him a lesson.&quot; His two maids looked at the affectionate scene between the father and son, bewildered because they looked nothing alike. Sibin smiled at his father, &quot;Are you really okay? Big brother is on his way here with his army.&quot; But he didn&#x27;t seem to care, &quot;What I say, I do. No need for any more fuss.&quot; &quot;Speaking of which, I still have to thank this eldest son of mine. If he hadn&#x27;t run off, I still wouldn&#x27;t know how many tumors were under my command.&quot; At this time, outside the kingdom, Hitler finally arrived.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t expect the magnificent Dragonfire City to be almost destroyed and the battle to have been so fierce. &quot;It&#x27;s a pity my younger brother died so early, otherwise I would have liked to see his surprised face. Today, I, Hitler, will take back this country. Terrence, take your scouts inside to investigate the situation.&quot; Hearing that, she nodded, &quot;As you command, Master.&quot; And so, they immediately infiltrated the city of Dragonfire. After a while, they returned, &quot;My Lord, there are still some of the Pope&#x27;s troops in the city, but they are exhausted.</p>
<p>It seems this battle was won, but it was a pyrrhic victory.&quot; Hitler smiled upon hearing that, &quot;Not bad. So how many troops does the Pope have left under his command?&quot; But at this moment, a subordinate looked at him and warned, &quot;My Lord, I think attacking Dragonfire City now is a bit hasty. After all, the accuracy of the second prince&#x27;s information cannot be determined. Right now, no one has come out to meet us, I&#x27;m afraid there might be an ambush.&quot; Terrence looked at him mockingly, &quot;Sir Robert, are you doubting my scouting ability?&quot; He looked at her, &quot;I don&#x27;t doubt that ability. It&#x27;s just that I feel someone who relies on selling their beauty to get information fundamentally doesn&#x27;t understand that real combat and scouting are completely different.</p>
<p>We need to consider many other factors.&quot; Seeing that they were about to argue, Hitler spoke up, &quot;Alright, all actions this time will be according to Terrence. Anyway, just standing here will only make us miss the opportunity, Robert. Attack Dragonfire City.&quot; Having no other choice, he could only lead his army and charge forward. Meanwhile, Hitler looked at that girl with affection, &quot;Don&#x27;t mind him. Even though his strength is formidable, he&#x27;s still a rigid person.&quot; Terrence looked at him and cast her enchanting spell; Hitler almost fell for it completely.</p>
<p>&quot;I just don&#x27;t know if Robert can successfully defeat the Pope&#x27;s rebel army. You must know that the Pope&#x27;s strength is at an invincible level.&quot; Terrence appeared extremely confident at this moment, &quot;Rest assured, my Lord. Even if Robert can&#x27;t defeat the rebel army, it has nothing to do with me.&quot; After saying that, she immediately sent Hitler on his way to heaven. With an extremely triumphant voice, &quot;In any case, you are going to die here, my Lord.&quot; As she spoke, her blade plunged deeper and deeper inside, causing Hitler&#x27;s wound to hemorrhage. But as a man in power, he still had some strength to fight back well.</p>
<p>Only now do we learn that Terrence was actually an imposter. &quot;You tried to assassinate me, but I managed to escape,&quot; &quot;right?&quot; Seeing that familiar face, Hitler seethed with hatred, &quot;The human, Aaron! Impossible! I clearly witnessed your death.&quot; Aaron looked at him and smiled, &quot;So, Young Master Hitler was also deceived by anger? Then why did betraying and deceiving the old duke seem so natural?&quot; &quot;You easily passed on the order that Aaron had died in exchange for Terrence&#x27;s intelligence when you had just taken over Golden Lion City. The staff was in chaos, you didn&#x27;t arrange for guards to secure the territory, instead, you were always thinking of illicit matters, making it easy for me to infiltrate.&quot; Hitler looked at him, &quot;Are the remaining soldiers and knights yours? If all of this was planned, Robert and the others who entered the city have likely met with misfortune.&quot; Surrendering won&#x27;t even get me my father&#x27;s corpse. Not to mention that bastard Sibin is surely aiming for my life already. I must quickly find an opening and seize the chance to escape.</p>
<p>But before he could do anything, Sibin and his father appeared. His father looked at Hitler and shook his head, &quot;As the eldest son of the Golden Lion family, inheriting the richest territory, why didn&#x27;t you calmly learn to rule the land, but instead were always greedy and causing trouble everywhere?&quot; &quot;Clearly, no one was competing with you. Even Sibin has never had such thoughts, choosing to take on the border territory by himself. I always turned a blind eye to you, but you have disappointed me too much. For a beast like you with no family affection or childhood, out of consideration for our father-son relationship, I will not destroy you here.</p>
<p>I will only cripple your battle qi and give you a piece of land to fend for yourself.&quot; Hitler looked on in shock, &quot;Father, I am your son! You can&#x27;t cripple my battle qi! I am a Sky Knight!&quot; But in his heart, he was full of calculations. To escape from this situation today, I can only take a hostage. Father is the easiest target, but those two are beside him, what should I do? Or perhaps that girl over there is more important in Sibin&#x27;s heart. I&#x27;ll attack the young woman first to lure him out, then kidnap the smaller girl. That&#x27;s the only way I&#x27;ll have a hope of escaping.</p>
<p>They are just two weak chickens. As long as they&#x27;re not vigilant, the advantage will be on my side. Seeing his actions, their group immediately became vigilant. Rui looked at the direction of his movement and immediately guessed that his target was her. Hitler still didn&#x27;t know the danger that was approaching and remained very focused.</p>
<p>His face filled with indignation, &quot;If you want to blame someone, blame the lecher who brings women to the battlefield.&quot; However, his attack couldn&#x27;t touch Rui at all. Not only that, but she also used her speed to get behind him. and was mercilessly beheaded by her strike. His father, sitting above, looked down at the fate of his son without saying a word. Sibin looked towards him and spoke, I&#x27;m sorry, father, but he was also very understanding, this is not a matter for which you should apologize for this unrepentant brat, it is all his own doing.</p>
<p>Especially for our Golden Lion family, keeping him would be an endless disaster. At this time, night quickly enveloped the place. Sibin looked at his system panel and smiled, the older the ginger, the spicier it gets. It would be strange if he didn&#x27;t know I intended to usurp the throne. Where is my second plot reward, system? Receiving his prompt, it quickly appeared.</p>
<p>Level 3 Barracks Redemption Card reward has been detected. Genie-level system. Please do not disturb. If urgent, please figure it out yourself. Seeing this, he quickly opened the card.</p>
<p>The system is getting more and more complicated. After upgrading, do I still need to search manually? A notification popped up. Exchange requires no villain points, nor any prerequisites. Just designate it directly. There are some notable options, such as: Wyvern&#x27;s Lair, Watchtower, Plague Tomb, Catfish Bridge, Ice Statue, Volcano Crater.</p>
<p>With so many, he wondered which one to choose. Sibin pondered, after ascending the throne, I must establish an army. The Google Regiment has been wiped out. Right now, the priority is an air force. So, he quickly chose the Wyvern&#x27;s Lair.</p>
<p>To put it simply, this is a base for creating dragons that fight in the air. At the same time, the system also successfully upgraded. Sibin was also walking around, looking for a place to put down his structure. Bubble looked at him and smiled, When did you get back, sir? I didn&#x27;t see you. Oh, right, there&#x27;s something Bubble wants to inform you about.</p>
<p>Bubble wants to ask you to find some strange objects like those statues from last time. I want to enter the second awakening stage a little sooner. Didn&#x27;t you say that as long as there are enough materials, Big Stone Head can be revived? The second, adolescent stage can also permanently transform me to have two legs. At that time, I want to go find the materials for revival. Hearing her say that, he was very surprised.</p>
<p>He originally thought Bubble had long forgotten about this, but he didn&#x27;t expect her to still remember it so clearly. It seemed she valued Big Stone Head a lot. But at this moment, he also reminded her. It&#x27;s just that divine items are not easy to find. Perhaps by the time we find enough divine items, the materials to revive Saraken might have already been collected.</p>
<p>Hearing that, Bubble was also stunned. Does that mean he can be revived sooner? Sibin nodded, That&#x27;s right, but don&#x27;t worry, once I discover any oceanic divine items, I will tell you. Hearing that, the little girl&#x27;s eyes lit up. You&#x27;d think it would start a different story, but it went back to the story from two hours ago. Knowing that if he continued to talk like this, it would drag on and on, he immediately gave a perfunctory reply and left.</p>
<p>But Bubble still called for him to wait a moment. It turned out that this time she wanted to give him an amulet she had just created. Hearing that, Sibin smiled. An amulet, right. Although it has been abandoned, Bubble is still the one who maintains the rituals of the Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>An amulet she personally made might be extremely effective. But before he could finish speaking, the shape of the amulet was rather strange. Seeing its shape, he couldn&#x27;t help but associate it with Saraken. Afterwards, he also found a suitable location to place the new barracks. Inside the mountain, a dragon quickly appeared with its eggs.</p>
<p>It immediately let out its first call to show its might. Looking at that form, Sibin was surprised. Compared to the nearby Crusader recruitment investment, the Wyvern&#x27;s architectural style is also quite crude and doesn&#x27;t fit with the surroundings. After saying that, he immediately rushed straight to the top of the mountain. and quickly called for that dragon to wake up.</p>
<p>But it completely ignored him. It seems the old wyvern is a part of the lair and won&#x27;t obey my commands. I should first exchange for a wyvern to see. So, he quickly went to meet the city guards. and requested them to inform Gude Bai to have someone bring a ton of beast meat here.</p>
<p>So, after a period of time, enough was collected. Seeing this, he was delighted. Next is this level-three magic beast crystal core. Old wyvern, I want to recruit a Poison Wyvern. Hearing this, the dragon immediately rushed up and ate all the meat.</p>
<p>With just its mouth, it quickly swallowed the pile of meat whole. After eating, it quickly returned to its lair. Then it lay down on top and took a nap. And just like that, a large dragon egg appeared. Seeing this, Sibin was extremely surprised.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t think a wyvern could actually return to its nest, incubate an egg, and produce a soldier. After a period of less than five minutes, the egg finally hatched. The large dragon quickly pushed the newly born wyvern down below. It seemed to be very scared. Sibin was the same.</p>
<p>Falling from such a height, unless the newborn little dragon had the ability to fly. But completely different from what he thought, it immediately crashed straight into the ground. This even caused its health level to drop by more than half. Sibin observed for a moment then showed his delight. It&#x27;s already level 38 just after being born.</p>
<p>Three more levels and it can enter the fourth-tier, equivalent to a human Earth Knight. Not bad. Once mass-produced, they can become an elite army. Most importantly, it has both physical damage and poison elemental damage. He quickly stepped forward and patted its head.</p>
<p>Do you understand my words? Very good. Now, can you carry me for a flight? It immediately understood and flapped its wings, carrying him off the ground. The advantages are fast speed and great strength; it can be used as a mount and for attacking. The soldiers produced by the system don&#x27;t need to be tamed; as long as they are recruited, they will be very obedient. But there is also a problem, not big, not small.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s that the wyvern doesn&#x27;t have a single hair on its body; it&#x27;s all hide. Without using battle aura for protection, the dragon riders will become bare-assed riders. It seems that in the future, when establishing the wyvern knight corps, whether for players or soldiers, a dragon saddle will need to be made for use. While flying in the sky, he suddenly looked down below and saw his maid doing something unknown late at night. After all, she is still a saintess of the demi-humans; I&#x27;m afraid there&#x27;s something she needs to do.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, she&#x27;s gone so quickly. Poison Wyvern, let&#x27;s go back. Seeing him leave, Rui quickly went to meet a mysterious person. Is it okay now? He&#x27;s gone. As for Sibin, he quickly jumped down.</p>
<p>Lori saw him and smiled. Master, you&#x27;re here. Is that master&#x27;s new mount? Then she quickly took out the things she had prepared and gave them to him to eat. Sibin tasted it and felt very satisfied with the flavor it brought. Hearing that, Lori told him a story.</p>
<p>In the past, when fleeing from place to place, demi-humans all liked to pick this fruit to eat. It&#x27;s not only sweet and refreshing but can also satisfy hunger. Now, thanks to master, we also have a decent place to live. Then she quickly pulled him onto a sofa. and massaged and cupped him.</p>
<p>Master, are you about to become king? Sibin replied, The empire has been overthrown. Even if it&#x27;s for you and the demi-humans, I will also bear this responsibility. Lori was stunned when she heard that. Master, I heard that kings don&#x27;t have demi-human servants. Hearing the worry in her words, he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>I thought you were worried about something else. Don&#x27;t worry, a king is an existence that can set the rules. If I establish a royal maid corps exclusively for me, no one would dare to have an opinion. After saying that, he immediately pulled his maid into his arms. I&#x27;ll ask you, if I become king, would you also want to become my queen? Hearing this, she hesitated.</p>
<p>Master, this... Lori was afraid she couldn&#x27;t bear the responsibility of a queen. Compared to the many citizens, Lori actually only cares about her master. I just want to be master&#x27;s little girl. That would make me very content.</p>
<p>Hearing her say that, Sibin smiled. So that&#x27;s how it is. Lori has thought it through too. Alright, it&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t want to be queen. It&#x27;s settled then.</p>
<p>Having you is enough for me. I don&#x27;t need a queen. But at this moment, a wave of energy suddenly spread through his body. Seeing him freeze, Lori asked with concern, What&#x27;s wrong, master? He stammered, I suddenly feel dizzy and so sleepy. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening.</p>
<p>I feel like my whole body has lost all its strength. As he said this, he also looked at something. Oh, right, I ate that whole plate of Starfall Fruit. Lori, you didn&#x27;t remove the toxins, did you? Hearing this, her whole body began to glow. After all, it&#x27;s something master eats, so of course Lori has to handle it well.</p>
<p>Therefore, intentionally leaving a little bit of toxin was also on purpose. Seeing her current appearance, his nose quickly started bleeding. Lori didn&#x27;t care at all and immediately pounced on him. Master, do you know that when you found Lori, according to demi-human age, I was only 16. After awakening once, I was 17, and today is my 18th birthday.</p>
<p>So today, I want a special gift. Although master doesn&#x27;t want to hurt me, Lori is not afraid. Now that I&#x27;m an adult, I&#x27;ll come and get this gift myself. It&#x27;s unknown how passionate it was inside, but outside, Rui seemed to be deep in thought. In her hand, she held a mysterious medallion, its purpose unknown.</p>
<p>The next morning, Chris looked at him and complained, Lord, really. She&#x27;s still young. Even though she was proactive, you should have been gentler. No matter what, you can&#x27;t make it so she can&#x27;t even eat breakfast. Young people these days.</p>
<p>Being told off like that, he also felt embarrassed and quickly changed the subject. Oh, right, have you seen Rui? Chris shook her head, saying she hadn&#x27;t seen her since yesterday, which surprised him. Thinking of Rui&#x27;s mysterious appearance last night, he wondered in his heart, could it be that from the time I saw her on the road yesterday until now... She still hasn&#x27;t come back? While he was pondering, he suddenly looked at Chris, stunned. then inquired, &quot;Mrs.</p>
<p>Chris, this bracelet of yours is truly special.&quot; Hearing this, she smiled, &quot;Thank you for the compliment, Young Master. This was a gift from my 21st husband when he proposed to me. Although it&#x27;s been a long time, its design is still as unique as the day I got it.&quot; Hearing this, Sibin felt something was a bit off, hoping he wouldn&#x27;t become her ex-lover. At this point, Mrs. Chris looked at him.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, Young Master. Later, have Lori take your physical measurements. Recently, the craftsmen have been working overtime to create the attire and scepter for the coronation ceremony. I believe it won&#x27;t be long before we should be calling you Your Majesty. It&#x27;s truly exciting.&quot; After he was left alone, he looked at the system panel, thinking of a way to resurrect Saraken.</p>
<p>At this moment, a screen of light appeared, showing him the necessary information. Although Saraken had sacrificed himself, his soul was still preserved, and this was also the important material for resurrection. While he was thinking, Clemon had also returned. Hearing that, he immediately assigned him the task of collecting materials. &quot;The first thing I need you to do is arrange for spies to go to different nations to gather information about pure-attribute artifacts.</p>
<p>As soon as you have any, record it. The second thing is I need a dwarf.&quot; Hearing this, he was immediately surprised, &quot;My Lord, dwarves haven&#x27;t appeared in the north for hundreds of years. If we go to the southern nations, we&#x27;ll have to cross the vast Orc Empire, and even clash with demons.&quot; Hearing this, he pondered, &quot;Alright then, just help me gather news about the dwarves first. Where are they hiding now, and where have they appeared? Also, help me purchase a batch of Soul Essence Steel. For now, there&#x27;s nothing else.</p>
<p>Help me call Allen over.&quot; Afterwards, just as instructed, he was also summoned. Seeing that he had arrived, Sibin smiled, &quot;This is to thank you for disguising yourself as a woman to get close to Hitler. Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t know how many more times my brother would have used the Pope&#x27;s name to try and eliminate me.&quot; Hearing this, Allen&#x27;s face turned completely red. &quot;Don&#x27;t mention it again. Now my habits of flirting and posing have been found out by others, and there are even strange rumors.</p>
<p>I really want to get out of here.&quot; Sibin also gave an awkward smile. &quot;Alright, then you can go out for a walk. And while you&#x27;re at it, help me with something.&quot; &quot;I want you to help me deliver this letter. The address is on it. The place is a bit far.</p>
<p>I hope you can return in time to attend my coronation ceremony.&quot; Receiving the mission, he immediately puffed out his chest and agreed, promising that he would succeed. But at this moment, another girl entered from outside. &quot;My Lord, may I ask if you are free right now? Mrs. Chris told me to come and take your body measurements.&quot; Seeing the hotness of the girl in front of them, both of them immediately froze. Seeing that they said nothing, she spoke up, &quot;My Lord, is something wrong? It&#x27;s almost time to take your body measurements.</p>
<p>Are you still working?&quot; Knowing that it wouldn&#x27;t be good for him to be here, Allen quickly left. After he left, she revealed a bewitching smile. Sibin looked her all over and inquired, &quot;Are you a new maid? Why haven&#x27;t I seen you before?&quot; She nodded, &quot;Yes, my Lord. My name is Vivian, a new maid. Please stand up for a moment.</p>
<p>The master is about to become a king, so it&#x27;s only natural to have one more person to take care of him. Let me help the future king measure his body.&quot; Feeling the fragrance on her body, Sibin didn&#x27;t let his guard down at all. But the more time passed, the more he felt something strange. &quot;Why do I always feel that this fragrance makes me dizzy?&quot; Vivian saw his condition and smiled. Then, she quickly pressed herself against his body.</p>
<p>&quot;Your Majesty, your back is so broad.&quot; Then she used her own weight to push him down onto the table and continuously made suggestive moves towards him. Along with that was a boneless tongue wrapping around his entire body. Along with extremely skillful crawling movements. Seeing that his body didn&#x27;t move, her eyes became increasingly sharp. Just as Sibin was about to enjoy this worldly delicacy, Lori appeared here, whether by accident or on purpose.</p>
<p>&quot;Master, are you thirsty? I&#x27;ve brought you a drink.&quot; As she said this, her face froze. Then, feeling extremely disappointed, she left the place. Sibin immediately regained his senses and pushed Vivian away. &quot;What are you doing? Weren&#x27;t you supposed to be taking my body measurements? Why has it turned into this?&quot; With that, he left the girl behind and quickly chased after his little girl. Vivian looked in that direction, furious.</p>
<p>&quot;Careless. I didn&#x27;t expect him to wake up from my charm incense. I really underestimated him, but there absolutely won&#x27;t be a second time.&quot; Sibin was completely unaware of this, only focused on quickly chasing after Lori. After catching up to her, he really wanted to explain and clear up this incident. But it seemed Lori was very sulky this time, turning her head to say to him, &quot;I&#x27;ve said it before, I have no right to interfere in whatever the master wants to do with other people.&quot; &quot;Here are the tea and pastries, please help yourself, Master.</p>
<p>Lori will be leaving now.&quot; Seeing her attitude, he sighed, &quot;My little maid is angry and stubborn. I can&#x27;t explain it clearly at the moment.&quot; &quot;Speaking of which, who was that woman who came to me? &quot; It was only then that he noticed there were many new maids around him. The kids swirled around him, making a lot of noise. Seeing this, he was helpless. &quot;Alright, this is for you all.</p>
<p>Be careful not to drink too much and get a stomachache. Don&#x27;t fight, share it amongst yourselves.&quot; The others saw Nana getting her head patted and quickly started crying, wanting to be patted too. Having no other choice, he could only use both his arms to pat them one by one. Seeing such lively little girls, he smiled, &quot;They&#x27;re really just like Lori when she first arrived.&quot; But at this moment, Nina appeared behind them. &quot;You kids, I was wondering where you went when your work was only half-done.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t stand here and bother the Lord.&quot; After shooing the kids away, Nina came before him. &quot;I&#x27;m very sorry, my Lord. They&#x27;ve been missing you a lot lately.&quot; This wasn&#x27;t what he was concerned about. He asked back, &quot;That&#x27;s right, Nina. Since the last enlightenment, have you felt any particular strange phenomena?&quot; Hearing this, she became very flustered.</p>
<p>&quot;That... I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; At this point, because she was too ashamed, she shouted, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry! I&#x27;ve always been unable to successfully awaken. Tinh Hai, who went with me, only had two enlightenments and has already awakened, and has already gone to the battlefield with you, my Lord. Only I am still stuck in the same place. Now that you, my Lord, have to ask me yourself, I&#x27;m such a failure, aren&#x27;t I?&quot; Seeing her reaction, he smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s no need to be so discouraged. Awakening requires studying fate. A little earlier or a little later really doesn&#x27;t matter. Calm down.&quot; Encouraged by him, the little girl happily shouted, &quot;Yes! I will definitely not fail to live up to your expectations!&quot; After speaking, he immediately took out the Source of the Wild. &quot;No more wasting words.</p>
<p>This time, let&#x27;s grasp your third enlightenment.&quot; &quot;I wonder what effect it will have on her.&quot; After speaking, he placed his hand on her head. A torrent of mighty golden power continuously enveloped Nina&#x27;s entire body. Her entire body quickly erupted with an incomprehensible power that enveloped the area. Along with that were images of stone statues continuously appearing in her mind. The system panel appeared, displaying her basic stats.</p>
<p>Seeing what the system evaluated, even Sibin was stunned. &quot;This is truly...&quot; If you were to ask what a miracle is, then this is a miracle. It&#x27;s just a pity the system is upgrading. I can&#x27;t see the details of Nina&#x27;s divine skill clearly, but just looking at the skills, I know it&#x27;s extremely formidable. And as if it were a matter of course, she could finally awaken after her third enlightenment.</p>
<p>Sibin also praised her, &quot;Nina, you&#x27;re very good, truly formidable. Can you feel what abilities you&#x27;ve awakened? Tell me the details of their effects.&quot; At this, she immediately sensed her power. &quot;My Lord, I have awakened a total of six skills. They are Mineral Collection, Mineral Transformation, Mineral Blessing Art, Mineral Fusion, Stone Skin, and Summon Rock Golem. Mineral Collection is to find unlocked minerals.</p>
<p>Mineral Blessing Art can increase its production, but currently, I can only bless one. I can&#x27;t feel how much it increases, I still need to test it more. Fusion is to consume energy to fuse two types of materials together to form a new composite material. It seems like it&#x27;s not very useful. Stone Skin is a defensive skill that makes my own skin as strong as stone.</p>
<p>It can also be blessed on your body, but it&#x27;s not as hard as your armor. As for Summon Rock Golem, it&#x27;s just as the name implies, of course not as good as the heroic spirit brothers. I&#x27;m sorry, my Lord. Nina is so useless. I only have one combat skill, the other skills are all related to breaking rocks.&quot; But contrary to her thoughts, he was completely satisfied.</p>
<p>&quot;How can such a ridiculously powerful skill not be useful? If Nina were to go to the Dwarf Kingdom, she would probably be directly revered and worshipped by them as a queen.&quot; So he spoke up to correct her. &quot;It&#x27;s absolutely not what you think. In fact, your skills are extremely useful and can bring us a lot of help. Although I am a lord, I was previously a righteous knight who never lies. But you still don&#x27;t fully understand your own abilities.</p>
<p>I think we should do some tests.&quot; So they quickly went to the shipyard. The others saw them and immediately cheered and said hello. Sibin looked ahead and reminded them, &quot;I have no mission today. I&#x27;m here to find someone.&quot; The others heard this and began to buzz with discussion. And the person he was looking for looked over in confusion.</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord, you came to find me?&quot; Sibin looked at him and inquired, &quot;You are the Doesn&#x27;t-Work Person.&quot; The young man with that strange name looked at him and immediately nodded, &quot;That&#x27;s me.&quot; Because of the name that person had given him in this world, the atmosphere between the two became a little silent. Then Sibin still spoke up, &quot;I heard you created a strange artifact called cement. I heard it can be used to build rooms, repair city walls, and can make the bricks on the city walls into a single, incredibly solid block. Is this true?&quot; The Doesn&#x27;t-Work Person was surprised to hear this. &quot;My Lord, where did you hear this information?&quot; Sibin chuckled to himself, &quot;Actually, the information wasn&#x27;t that detailed, but it&#x27;s just because I know what cement is.&quot; At this time, he continued, &quot;So, my lord, cement really does have such a great effect, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not having much success right now.</p>
<p>The key to making cement is the three stages of grinding, burning, and mixing. Although I&#x27;ve found a decent main ingredient, I&#x27;m still missing many important materials.&quot; Hearing that, he brought Nina here. So that&#x27;s how it is. &quot;Let me introduce you, this is the maid Nina from Winter Castle. She has an ability that can transform minerals, I wonder if she can be of any help to you.&quot; Hearing that, Doesn&#x27;t-Work Person was surprised.</p>
<p>What kind of perverse skill is this? To directly change the chemical composition and physical properties of a substance, this is equivalent to changing the very nature of the world. He immediately spoke up, &quot;My lord, these are two stone samples from my collection that can be made into lime. The one on the left is Hoi Dien Thach, which is quite abundant in the opposite mountain range. The one on the right, I&#x27;ve named Mac. Its quantity is extremely rare.</p>
<p>If she can transform Hoi Dien Thach into Mac, then the cement problem will be solved.&quot; Sibin, standing beside them, immediately encouraged the maid. Receiving his blessing, she also gained more confidence. She placed the two stones on the ground and used her ability. A golden light quickly appeared, enveloping both of them. Finally, a miracle truly appeared before everyone&#x27;s eyes, because it had succeeded.</p>
<p>Although the size was reduced by half, it wasn&#x27;t a problem at all, as quantity could be used to make up for the quality. Nina looked at the two of them and smiled, &quot;It&#x27;s done, take a look.&quot; Doesn&#x27;t-Work Person almost wanted to jump up and hug her tightly. It&#x27;s truly miraculous. His action scared Nina, causing her to retreat behind him. Realizing he might have been too over-the-top, Doesn&#x27;t-Work Person adjusted his attitude.</p>
<p>&quot;My lord, if Nina can transform a large quantity of Mac, then cement can be successfully produced.&quot; Hearing that, Sibin asked if she could transform it more times. And based on her estimation, she could perform the transformation a maximum of ten thousand times a day. This astronomical number left the other two speechless. Doesn&#x27;t-Work Person pondered, she can transform 20 tons of stone at once, based on the depreciation rate, it would probably require 40 tons of Hoi Dien Thach. Such a production volume is too terrifying.</p>
<p>Sibin thought even further. With such a terrifying production volume of cement raw material, what if it could be used to transform into gold. No sooner said than done, he immediately asked her to try turning stone into gold. She then immediately used her ability once more. The stone quickly shrank, but gradually its size completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Sibin wondered, &quot;It&#x27;s only as small as a grain of rice? The loss rate is that high?&quot; But even so, it&#x27;s still very powerful. The Can Continent has no shortage of stone, so much rock can be transformed into a lot of gold. Nina looked at him and reminded him, &quot;My lord, I&#x27;m quite tired. It seems to be because the material difference between these two types of minerals is too great. The energy consumed for the transformation is also very high, that last one consumed 1/5 of my energy.</p>
<p>If I use up all my energy, it will take a full day to recover.&quot; Knowing that, he gave up his dream of turning stone into gold. &quot;Forget it, it&#x27;s better to have Nina transform stone into Mac, to make cement with you. But right now, I have to go test her other abilities, so we&#x27;ll do this next time.&quot; So they turned to another inn. The owner looked at the girl before him, &quot;My lord, you say this little demi-human girl can easily fuse two elemental metals together without smelting? In my whole life working with metals, this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of such a thing.&quot; Sibin used his name to guarantee it. Hearing that, the owner had no choice.</p>
<p>&quot;If the lord says so, then I won&#x27;t be polite. Look at this, this piece of Black Magic Iron was a gift from my master, a dwarf grandmaster blacksmith. It&#x27;s a treasure, but unfortunately, my talent is limited, and in a lifetime of forging, the most I can make is master-grade equipment. My lord, could you let her try to fuse it with magic into Black Magic Steel?&quot; After he spoke, she immediately used her fusion ability on the two pieces before her. A miraculous transformation process appeared before the blacksmith&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>Holding the stone in his hand, he was stunned. &quot;How is this possible? To be able to achieve such perfect quality with bare hands, a complete fusion. How did you do it?&quot; Sibin reminded him, &quot;Don&#x27;t scare the girl, demi-humans are still afraid of humans right now.&quot; So he adjusted his state, &quot;My apologies, my lord, that event truly astonished me. This is a perfect piece of Black Magic Steel. This hardness, I think even a top-tier dwarf blacksmith couldn&#x27;t forge it.&quot; Knowing that, Sibin appeared extremely pleased.</p>
<p>Afterward, he asked about the energy consumption. She thought for a moment then replied that it seemed she could do it 10 more times. After having basically checked her attributes, he also let her go back to rest. At this moment, he unexpectedly spotted Rui in the crowd. Without hesitation, he quickly rushed forward and grabbed her by the shoulders.</p>
<p>and asked, &quot;Where did you go last night? You didn&#x27;t come back.&quot; Hearing this, the person turned around with an admiring expression, &quot;It&#x27;s the Eagle Crest Lord.&quot; &quot;So you&#x27;ve been looking for me? Actually, I&#x27;ve been looking for you too.&quot; Seeing her clinging to him relentlessly, he immediately stepped back, &quot;Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.&quot; But the woman was as persistent as a leech, &quot;Mistaken identity? No way. Last night I was willing to be with you all night, and tonight will be the same.&quot; And just because of a case of mistaken identity, a whole crowd of demi-humans immediately ran over to surround him. Nina was also surprised by this situation, &quot;My lord is truly well-loved.&quot; As for the person he was looking for, she was preparing for some kind of ritual. Another person appeared behind her, &quot;Your Highness, the Saintess, don&#x27;t be too nervous. I am Ivan, the Pontiff of the Time Holy Temple.</p>
<p>This is just a mandatory process before your awakening.&quot; Hearing this made her quite surprised. The two men gave a demonic smile, looking at her as if wanting to remind her of that night. She had already affirmed that she would not leave this place; to her, this was home, and she didn&#x27;t care much about the Time Holy Temple. But the man was firm, creating a magic orb and saying that if she didn&#x27;t leave, this whole place would be destroyed. A clock appeared before her, allowing her to see the future, it seemed.</p>
<p>The scene of everyone else being annihilated appeared in her mind with extreme realism. Even her own lord was captured, bound, and about to be executed. Seeing that, she fell into extreme fear. That is why she now decided to come here to become their Saintess. Knowing there was no turning back, she sighed, &quot;If I awaken my divinity, what will happen?&quot; The man quickly replied, &quot;Of course, you will receive more power and be able to save more people.&quot; Ivan appeared, whispering sweet words into her ear, &quot;You have already seen the outcome.</p>
<p>If you do not resurrect the will of the Goddess of Time within your body, your beloved demi-human race and the friends you love will depart from this world. Do you really want them to be sacrificed like that?&quot; Rui shook her head, showing her resolve, &quot;No, of course I will not let this happen. Whether it&#x27;s everyone in the demi-human tribe or my lord, I will protect them all.&quot; Ivan was quite pleased to hear that, &quot;Your position is truly admirable, and because of it, the power of the Goddess of Time will be even stronger. For the sake of those you hold dear, please obediently accept your fate, Your Highness, the Saintess.&quot; But she didn&#x27;t know that Sibin had already arrived in front of the Time Holy Temple. &quot;Is this the place?&quot; He always felt the angel sculpture looked a bit familiar.</p>
<p>However, his presence had attracted the attention of the guards here. But he didn&#x27;t bother with them and immediately grabbed them by the collar. With a cold gaze, he interrogated, &quot;You are people of the Time Holy Temple.&quot; After receiving confirmation, he immediately created a golden aura that scared them into retreating. and quickly rushed straight towards the most majestic part of this place, creating a blade that pierced straight towards the front. A huge tremor occurred, attracting the attention of those inside.</p>
<p>Hearing the noise from outside, Rui knew her lord had arrived. Ivan angrily looked at his subordinates and asked, &quot;What&#x27;s going on at such a crucial moment?&quot; They trembled, &quot;Reporting to the Pontiff, the neighboring Church of Light was blown up by someone.&quot; Hearing that, he didn&#x27;t pay it any mind and continued the ritual. Returning to Sibin, he was now surprised to find he had attacked the wrong place. The Pontiff of the Church of Light appeared, &quot;Who dislikes our Church of Light, are you not afraid of being punished by God?&quot; However, after recognizing his identity, he bowed his head, &quot;It is you, my lord. Bishop Vincent of the Second Cathedral greets you.</p>
<p>Why have you come here today? Ah, that&#x27;s right, you must have been startled by the commotion and came to check, is that it? As you have just seen, my lord, some damn bastard launched such a terrifying attack on our Church of Light. Fortunately, there were no casualties, but as you can see, the church roof has been destroyed. The repairs will cost hundreds of thousands of gold coins.&quot; Knowing that he couldn&#x27;t continue to act recklessly in this situation, he changed the subject, &quot;It must have been those damn heretics.&quot; The others looked in that direction and immediately started discussing animatedly. But Vincent immediately spoke up and asked, &quot;The power of molten flame is mostly related to demons, it seems they have appeared here. My lord, did you see who attacked our cathedral?&quot; Sibin was also very shameless and shook his head, &quot;I didn&#x27;t attack, ah, no, I mean I didn&#x27;t see anyone attack the cathedral, I only saw a flash of red light carrying a molten breath.&quot; After speaking, he quickly looked towards the guards and ordered them not to reveal anything.</p>
<p>Vincent, unaware of this, just sighed, &quot;Regardless, you have provided us with enough information. I will order a thorough investigation and absolutely will not let any demon wreak havoc in the royal capital.&quot; Sibin gave an awkward smile, &quot;Very good, I trust that you can definitely eliminate all of those brutal demons.&quot; &quot;But now I want to ask, where is the Time Holy Temple?&quot; Hearing this, the pontiff pointed towards the opposite side. Our Church of Light and the Time Holy Temple are on good terms. The gods we both worship are benevolent, so our churches were built together in this square. Hearing this, Sibin couldn&#x27;t believe he could have chosen the wrong one when they were so close.</p>
<p>No wonder he met a priest from the Time Holy Temple here. What a mess. Their churches were all in the same place. I&#x27;m not taking the fall for this. My mistake in attacking has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>Who told them to build their churches next to each other? He then inquired, &quot;Since the two sides are so close, I want to see if this place has been affected in any way, but are you sure there are people here?&quot; The Bishop nodded. &quot;Although the Time Holy Saintess is a powerful high god, she has never appeared on the material plane, so she has very few followers.&quot; &quot;This leads to a lack of money, and due to the lack of funds, they can&#x27;t repair the holy temple. The Church of Light helped fund the construction of this whole place.&quot; After confirming his target, Sibin immediately smiled. &quot;Thank you for answering my questions, Vincent. If demons have arrived, the surrounding believers and priests might be bewitched into saying strange things.</p>
<p>I think you shouldn&#x27;t believe anything from the outside.&quot; Hearing that, he flared up. &quot;Of course! Demons are best at bewitching people&#x27;s hearts. I will personally investigate.&quot; Sibin looked at him with satisfaction. &quot;Very good. Then please, Bishop, go back and investigate.</p>
<p>I will check on the condition of the Time Holy Saintess.&quot; And so, he quickly walked to the side, but was stopped by the priests. &quot;This is the Time Holy Temple. If you wish to go to the Church of Light, you&#x27;ve gone the wrong way. The Church of Light is on the opposite side.&quot; Sibin looked at them and shook his head. &quot;I am looking for the Time Holy Temple.</p>
<p>You should know this.&quot; Hearing this, they were half-believing, half-doubting. &quot;So you are a guest of the Pontiff. But the Pontiff is performing a ritual and is not receiving guests.&quot; Sibin knew they would try to stop him anyway, so he just gave a smug smile. &quot;It&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m used to it.&quot; Just as the ritual inside was about to reach its final part, Sibin kicked down their dilapidated door and entered.</p>
<p>So much for stopping me. Sibin entered the holy temple. The temple was quite chaotic at this moment. Rui saw him enter and called out, &quot;Lord Haivi.&quot; The nun beside her also cried out, &quot;How could you...&quot; Sibin waved his hand, signaling for her to run to his side. &quot;Roy, what are you doing over there? Get over here, now.&quot; She replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; As she was about to cross, the nun stopped her.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop. The ritual is not yet finished. You cannot leave.&quot; The nun continued, &quot;Lord, Roy voluntarily became the Time Holy Saintess. Please return.&quot; He laughed loudly. &quot;Voluntarily? Are you kidding me?&quot; The nun replied, &quot;What?&quot; He continued, &quot;Didn&#x27;t Roy tell you she&#x27;s my maid? This is the price for me saving all the demi-humans.&quot; &quot;My maid belongs to me.</p>
<p>You took her away on your own accord. Did you get my permission?&quot; The nun stood there, stunned. &quot;How disrespectful! To dare to speak to the Time Holy Saintess like that.&quot; He retorted, &quot;Taking my maid from my territory.&quot; Then Sibin drew his sword, which was enveloped in a golden light. Next, he slashed a straight line across the statue with his sword. &quot;And you dare call me disrespectful.&quot; The statue, impacted by his sword, began to crack.</p>
<p>&quot;Pontiff, run! The holy temple is about to collapse.&quot; At this moment, Sibin had rescued Rui. The holy temple collapsed. He carried her and escaped from it. &quot;Do you have any self-awareness that you&#x27;re my person?&quot; she replied shyly, &quot;Ah...&quot; The nun shouted angrily, &quot;Do you know what you&#x27;ve done? You dared to disrupt the ritual and destroy the Time Holy Temple!&quot; He replied, &quot;I have something to say to you.&quot; He said with an angry expression, &quot;Roy is Roy, not the Saintess of the Time Holy Temple, and certainly not a vessel for the Time Goddess. If you come to Eagle Crest Territory to find her again, to make her accept the will of some Time Goddess, I guarantee that the fate of everyone connected to the Time Holy Temple will be the same as this Time Holy Temple.&quot; At this moment, the nun was quite frightened by his words.</p>
<p>&quot;This was her destiny. The awakening of the Time Goddess is for the entire continent of Can, to fight against terrifying existences.&quot; He said to the nun, &quot;Before you say those words, how about changing the goddess&#x27;s ambitious destiny?&quot; Images of his past experiences flashed through his mind. He had been hung on a pillar, seen Ye Hao stabbed in the chest. He could even change the fate of players. &quot;This protagonist, Ye Hao, is already dead.</p>
<p>On what grounds should I continue to believe in destiny? If this is destiny, then I will slash destiny.&quot; Rui was stunned when Sibin took her hand. The nun, still quite angry, said, &quot;You are indeed very strong, but your selfishness will bring disaster to Can. You simply don&#x27;t understand the power of the old days.&quot; He turned and said, &quot;Before talking about salvation, have you ever thought about the one being sacrificed? If a world needs an unfortunate girl to be sacrificed for demi-humans to be saved, then it will collapse sooner or later.&quot; He walked away before the eyes of the people from the holy temple. Before leaving, he added, &quot;As for the old days, I will face them myself. I have my own convictions.&quot; Rui turned to look at him.</p>
<p>Seeing him sigh, she asked, &quot;Lord Haivi, isn&#x27;t it a bit bad for us to leave just like that?&quot; He answered her, &quot;It&#x27;s more than good. The Church of Light has money; the entrance fee is 10 gold coins. As for the Time Holy Temple, whether they have a holy temple or not doesn&#x27;t really make a big difference.&quot; He pinched her cat ear. &quot;You actually wanted to become the Time Holy Saintess? Don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s absurd?&quot; She replied, &quot;Of course not.&quot; She turned and asked him again, &quot;Right, how did you know I was at the Time Holy Temple?&quot; After hearing Rui&#x27;s question, he stood stunned for a few seconds then replied, &quot;Well...&quot; Then he thought, &quot;It&#x27;s because the loli was sulking and ignoring me. It was only when Mrs.</p>
<p>Chris came to serve me that I realized the loli hadn&#x27;t returned for a long time. I can&#x27;t possibly say that.&quot; After thinking, he turned and said to her, &quot;Because you didn&#x27;t return to the city for a long time and left no message, I went to your room to check. Then I found your diary and the clock necklace by your bed. It said you were being followed by a mysterious person. Based on the keepsake, I guessed it was a scheme by the Time Holy Temple.&quot; She was horrified when she heard him say he had read her diary.</p>
<p>Rui&#x27;s face turned red. She said, &quot;Wait, you said you... read my diary? You read it?&quot; Her face grew redder as she stammered, &quot;How much did you read?&quot; He began to recount, &quot;After the wedding, I will lift your skirt.&quot; She grabbed his collar, embarrassed, and said, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t that mean you read everything?&quot; He continued to recount, &quot;I went to Shenguang Town, I still have an impression of that. Little fox, you can&#x27;t escape.&quot; Did I really say that at the time? &quot;Don&#x27;t even think about running. She&#x27;s mine.&quot; When did that happen? He felt embarrassed as he read her diary.</p>
<p>This shouldn&#x27;t be called a diary; it should be called fanfiction. After she found out he read her diary, he grabbed her chin and pulled her face close to his as if to kiss her, making her very shy. &quot;Is it okay? It&#x27;s just a preview version of the diary.&quot; Overcome with embarrassment, she vanished before he could react. She hid in a bush. &quot;Go back by yourself! Just say I&#x27;m dead! And remember to burn my diary to ashes!&quot; He immediately grabbed her tail, causing her great pain.</p>
<p>&quot;Come out. Be a good girl and come back with me.&quot; He slung her over his shoulder. &quot;If you dare to run away from home again, I&#x27;ll print it into a book and distribute it nationwide.&quot; She cried and wailed, &quot;Don&#x27;t!&quot; Scene change. Gabriel was praying when her face grew increasingly upset. Then she smashed something white on the ground, frightening everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;That hateful man! He actually spanked my butt, and after spanking me, he hung me on the wall.&quot; The people around her shouted, &quot;Lady Gabriel!&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s nothing. You all continue praying. This is why I specially returned to the main hall to bathe in the holy light, to wash away the sins in my heart and the filth on my body.&quot; She was so angry her face was a little red, but her heart was still restless and couldn&#x27;t calm down. A servant spoke up, &quot;My lady, the Pope of Light, Morgan, knows you have returned and wishes to see you.&quot; She replied, &quot;The Pope is looking for me.&quot; She gently stroked her blue hair and said to those around her, &quot;I understand. You may leave first.&quot; He replied, &quot;Yes, my lady.&quot; She walked away in front of the servants.</p>
<p>After bathing in the holy light, my body and spirit have finally become much purer. I cannot show any impropriety before His Holiness the Pope. She said, &quot;May the light protect you, Your Holiness.&quot; His Holiness the Pope here was an old man. He turned around and said, &quot;Welcome back, Gabriel.&quot; The Pope of Light, Morgan, spoke up and asked, &quot;What is the matter with the necromantic aura in the Colone Empire that you went to investigate?&quot; Gabriel replied, &quot;Someone set up a soul-gathering formation.&quot; She tilted her head, thinking of a demon that thousands feared. Then Gabriel continued, &quot;There was a civil war in the Colone Empire.</p>
<p>The pontiff usurped the throne, and the great prince had long been transformed into a vampire prince. He intended to use the soul-gathering formation to turn the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who died on the battlefield into a sea of undead, to dismantle our undead desert defense line from within.&quot; Gabriel said nonchalantly, &quot;But it has been resolved now, although it wasn&#x27;t me who resolved it.&quot; Hearing this, the Pope of Light, Morgan, was delighted and asked eagerly, &quot;There&#x27;s someone in the Colone Empire who can solve such a difficult problem? Which prince was it?&quot; Gabriel&#x27;s face flushed red as she replied, &quot;Not a prince, but a lord.&quot; She recalled the handsome young man with angel wings and continued, &quot;He has been acknowledged by our angel. When I went there, he was in a state of divine descent. Moreover, the angel who acknowledged him was Liwister.&quot; He asked in surprise, &quot;Liwister? This is a strange matter. I didn&#x27;t expect that the thorny angel of the God of Light&#x27;s temple would also find a suitable person.&quot; The Pope of Light, Morgan, thought for a moment and then judged, &quot;In that case, he is probably the new king of the Colone Empire now.&quot; Gabriel agreed, &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s probably called the Winter Empire now.</p>
<p>He just hasn&#x27;t been crowned yet. The coronation ceremony will be held in three days.&quot; Hearing this, he laughed loudly and instructed, &quot;Since he is a partner of the Light, then I&#x27;ll have you write a letter in my name. Just say that a legendary-level Holy Son of our Church of Light is dealing with the undead invasion in the Colone Empire and is managing that nation with the authority of a king. I hope they won&#x27;t panic.&quot; Gabriel obeyed, &quot;Yes.&quot; The Pope of Light suddenly frowned in thought. &quot;But this letter of mine only serves as a warning.</p>
<p>After all, he is not a true legendary-level.&quot; Then he turned and gave Gabriel further instructions. The spirits of the forgotten land haven&#x27;t been able to choose their own successor for thousands of years. His selection must have been a coincidence. For safety, you go help him, don&#x27;t let him die in the war. Although she didn&#x27;t want to, she reluctantly agreed, &quot;I understand.</p>
<p>Then I will take my leave.&quot; Later, as Gabriel was stepping out the door, she met a maidservant fumbling with a box. She looked up and said, &quot;Your Highness the Saintess, you&#x27;ve returned. I&#x27;ve received the notice and am helping you prepare your luggage.&quot; She was in no mood to listen to the maidservant, feeling extremely displeased. &quot;His Holiness the Pope actually told me to protect that bastard,&quot; then angrily punched the mirror hard, startling the maidservant into a scream. Gabriel tried to restrain herself and said, &quot;It&#x27;s nothing, go about your business.&quot; The maidservant, not daring to disobey, stammered, &quot;Yes, yes.&quot; Gabriel clenched her fists until they trembled.</p>
<p>&quot;The more I think, the angrier I get. Riding a horse, afraid to take a carriage? Going this slowly, I can delay seeing that detestable face a little longer.&quot; Then she seemed to remember something, &quot;That&#x27;s right, bring that along too.&quot; Gabriel immediately ran to a cabinet and pulled out a coil of rope, gleefully thinking to herself, &quot;As long as I have this.&quot; After that, she wrapped the rope around her waist and said smugly, &quot;I can more or less look forward to our next meeting.&quot; Then Gabriel remembered Pope Morgano&#x27;s instructions. &quot;That&#x27;s right, the Pope also had me send a message to the surrounding kings. Announce the news of the Winter Empire&#x27;s king ascending the throne. Although I don&#x27;t want to, there&#x27;s no other way.&quot; She raised her hand to summon a magic circle and began to speak, &quot;Message from the Church of Light: the Holy Son has descended, taking over the Winter Empire.</p>
<p>We hope the kings will coexist peacefully.&quot; Once done, Gabriel sent the message everywhere, thinking to herself, &quot;To put it simply, the new king of the Winter Empire is the Holy Son of the Church of Light. You kings better not cause trouble. That should be clear enough, right?&quot; The messenger sword flew through the ceiling and embedded itself in the ground, causing the surrounding soldiers to exclaim in panic, &quot;What? The throne is...&quot; They asked each other in confusion, &quot;An enemy attack? No, look closely, this is a messenger holy sword from the Church of Light.&quot; The Naga who was threatening the king saw the commotion, stopped, and asked, &quot;What is this? What&#x27;s going on?&quot; The subordinates immediately replied, &quot;Your Majesty the Queen, these humans say it&#x27;s a messenger holy sword from the Church of Light.&quot; Hearing this, she was a bit puzzled, &quot;The Church of Light?&quot; The Naga shivered slightly and thought, &quot;Terrifying power. It seems I really can&#x27;t stay on this continent for too long.&quot; She quickly used her hair to wrap tightly around the king, making him scream in agony. The Naga threatened loudly, &quot;Hand over the trident, or you will see a tidal wave submerge your country.&quot; He cried out in fear, &quot;Your Majesty the Queen, it&#x27;s not that I won&#x27;t hand it over, but I really don&#x27;t have the Sea God&#x27;s Trident.&quot; Then he turned back to look at the artist who had a sword to his neck and continued, &quot;There is no one in my domain who looks like the person in the drawing.</p>
<p>Killing me is useless.&quot; The Naga didn&#x27;t care much about the king&#x27;s fear, only thinking maliciously and smugly, &quot;Of course I know you can&#x27;t hand it over. The reason I beat you up is because I, the Naga Queen, cannot stay on land for too long. I can only choose you to help me find the trident. How could I be at ease letting someone else do it?&quot; She recalled some old matters and frowned in annoyance, &quot;If that incident hadn&#x27;t happened, I wouldn&#x27;t want to set foot on this filthy land either.&quot; It turned out that before, the Sea God, having lost his treasure, flew into a rage and roared, &quot;Who is it that makes other creatures tremble in fear?&quot; He questioned loudly, &quot;Who took my clan&#x27;s sacred artifact? The trident?&quot; Suddenly, a voice rang out, cutting off the Naga&#x27;s train of thought, &quot;Your Majesty the Queen, please calm your anger.&quot; A subordinate came forward to report, &quot;The Koran Witch has recalled the scene from that time. In the memory crystal...&quot; She immediately ordered, &quot;Bring it up.&quot; He then held up a crystal stone with both hands.</p>
<p>The Naga took one look and immediately scolded in displeasure, &quot;Your fingernails are too long.&quot; The subordinate exclaimed in alarm, &quot;What?&quot; The angrier she got, the tighter she squeezed her hair, injuring the king. The Naga looked into the spirit stone fragment and saw an unfamiliar face appear. &quot;A human.&quot; She cursed indignantly, &quot;Good, very good. In recent years, my Naga clan has been fighting demons and the storm sea region, resisting the invasion of old servants, only to let you humans exploit an opening.&quot; The Naga then shattered the spirit stone fragment and decided, &quot;If that&#x27;s the case, then it&#x27;s time to invade the mainland again.&quot; She immediately ordered her subordinates, &quot;Assemble the soldiers, counterattack the mainland. Find him for me.</p>
<p>Find this person with golden hair and armor, carrying a greatsword on his back, who stole my sea clan&#x27;s sacred artifact. I want to tear him to pieces, grind him to dust and ashes.&quot; After that, the Naga forcefully threw the portrait at the king&#x27;s face and threatened, &quot;If you don&#x27;t have the trident, then you go find him for me. If you can&#x27;t find him, I will still turn your country into a sea of water.&quot; She turned and reminded him, &quot;I&#x27;m only giving you half a year. Don&#x27;t doubt my abilities. Remember, the deep sea is watching you.&quot; He replied, trembling, &quot;Yes.&quot; After the Naga left, the king picked up the terribly drawn portrait and looked at it.</p>
<p>His face red with anger, he tore what was in his hands to shreds and roared, &quot;Damn it! A drawing that looks like shit, what am I supposed to use to find him? These Nagas are crazy. They&#x27;re looking for an excuse to start a war.&quot; The subordinates behind him quickly spoke up to advise, &quot;Your Majesty the King, please calm down.&quot; He threw the portrait to the person beside him and ordered, &quot;Send a letter to King Kela and ask if he agrees to form an alliance. Also ask the newly established Winter Empire, and the Beastman Royal Court too. Go to all of them.&quot; Suddenly, someone interjected, &quot;Your Majesty the King, please wait.&quot; He said, &quot;We are still at war with the beastmen next to us.&quot; The king interrupted in displeasure, &quot;At war? Isn&#x27;t it just raiding for supplies to get through the winter?&quot; He seemed to have his reason completely overwhelmed by fear and snapped, &quot;Whatever these beastmen want, I&#x27;ll give it to them, as long as they agree to resist the Naga with me. I want to make that woman pay a heavy price.&quot; The subordinate still tried to advise, &quot;But, Your Majesty, our food supplies are only just enough.&quot; Finally, he felt that saying more would be unwise and gave up, &quot;Your subordinate understands.&quot; The king suddenly held up the portrait again and ordered, &quot;Wait.</p>
<p>Find this person for me too. Search in our country, search in other countries, release the spy snakes. If you find him, capture him and bring him to the royal palace. I want to grind him to ashes.&quot; Knocking sounds echoed in the quiet night. &quot;Knock, knock, knock.&quot; Sibin, sitting in his study, answered, &quot;Come in.&quot; Seeing this, Goodbye opened the door a crack and whispered, &quot;My Lord, sorry to disturb you.&quot; After saying that, he peeked around to see if there were any beautiful women here.</p>
<p>Seeing his snooping expression, Sibin said with annoyed disgust, &quot;That&#x27;s enough, hurry up and come in.&quot; Then Goodbye entered the room with a stack of documents as high as his face and replied, &quot;Yes, my Lord. These are all the documents you need.&quot; Seeing this, he was startled and wondered, &quot;Why are there so many?&quot; Goodbye explained, &quot;Some of these are archival records from Winter City, and there are also books related to the divine realm, elves, demi-humans, and the Pope&#x27;s letter transported from Fire Dragon City.&quot; Then he added, &quot;This is only a small portion of it. There&#x27;s another part that hasn&#x27;t been transported over yet.&quot; Hearing those words and seeing the stack of papers he placed on the table made him feel daunted. &quot;I originally wanted to investigate the relationship between gods and demi-humans, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be such a huge undertaking.&quot; Sibin felt a headache coming on from this pile. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and ordered, &quot;Go inform the kitchen to prepare some coffee for me.</p>
<p>I might be sleeping very late tonight.&quot; Goodbye respectfully placed a hand on his chest, bowed his head, and replied, &quot;Your command shall be obeyed.&quot; As he stepped out, Sibin began to arrange the pile of papers into different stacks, comforting himself as he worked, &quot;No choice. If I want to be a king, I have to understand these things.&quot; Sibin picked up a book with a yellow cover and began to read, wondering, &quot;The End of the Gods? This records the history of the twilight of the gods. Let&#x27;s see if I can find any trace of the origin of demi-humans.&quot; After that, the pages of the book continuously appeared, along with a story that began with the image of a black dragon. Legend has it that the Can continent initially had no intelligent creatures, only monsters, until the creator dragon Ononun came here. She was very fond of this new world.</p>
<p>To make the new world more colorful, she created a dragon that looked exactly like herself and, based on her own power, created the Gray Lightning Titan. But the world didn&#x27;t just have two types of creatures. That was too monotonous. So Ononun continued to create the World Tree, the God of Death, and the God of Light. And she ordered them to create their own subordinate races so that this world could function normally.</p>
<p>After that, Ononun was exhausted and entered the Can continent to fall into a deep sleep. The story was so good that Sibin became immersed in it and continued his line of imagination, picturing two fairies playing on a tree. The elegant World Tree inherited half of Ononun&#x27;s divine power. She created the beautiful and noble tree spirits and high elves. In contrast, the God of Death used the heat of death entwined with fire and destruction.</p>
<p>He created demons and the undead. As for the other one, the supreme, highest, great God of Light, he was very fond of wisdom and balance. Therefore, he created humankind with infinite talent, ferocious beastmen, and brave and skilled dwarves. Under his wise leadership, these three races balanced each other and developed together. Different kinds of people together created novelty; it was a brilliant age of light.</p>
<p>Countless gods were born, their divine kingdoms filling the starry sky of Can. Until one day, a host of twisted wills invaded this world. They were both bizarre and powerful; just their soft whispers could drive weak gods to madness. Phantom-like figures with golden eyes, shaped like octopuses, appeared. They called themselves the Old Ones, the gods called them the Elder Gods.</p>
<p>But everyone... do not be afraid. The familiar image of Vincent appeared, smiling and inviting. &quot;Let us join the Church of Light together, become believers of the light. No matter how many dangers the future holds, we can face them calmly.&quot; The closing line of the book was truly remarkable: &quot;The entrance fee to the church is only 10 gold coins.&quot; Reading up to this point, Sibin slumped onto the table in frustration and could only sigh, &quot;So this book was published by the Church of Light?&quot; But then he sat up, resting his forehead on his hand in confusion, and admitted, &quot;The way the Church of Light advertises now is very trendy.&quot; However, he was helpless, &quot;But like this, I can only believe half of the content about the God of Light.&quot; Then Sibin closed the book, placed it on the table, and leaned back, lost in thought, based on his preliminary understanding of the Can continent.</p>
<p>The content in this &quot;The End of the Gods&quot; book, although it can&#x27;t be said to be entirely true, is at least 70% accurate. It&#x27;s completely consistent with some of the things I learned at the Knight Academy, but there&#x27;s no information about demi-humans in it. The book fell. He questioned helplessly, &quot;Why are records related to them so hard to find...&quot; So? Then Sibin analyzed further, if both Winter City and the Fire Dragon were not options, but suddenly something flashed on the table, interrupting his train of thought, hmm. Sibin reached a trembling hand toward the book in doubt.</p>
<p>What, A Wild History of the Elves, is this book for real? Although the cover was a bit illustrative and suggestive, Sibin still forced himself to open it. He closed his eyes and exhaled in denial, no, no. Knowledge is limitless, only a dirty heart sees dirt in everything. One must have a spirit of inquiry and learning. The first few pages of the book were suggestive images of four elves that made him feel ecstatic, oh.</p>
<p>Wow. After the Twilight of the Gods, due to the loss of the gods&#x27; restraint, the wars between the intelligent races on the main material plane became increasingly unscrupulous. Although humanity was weak with short lifespans, they had a very strong learning ability and talent. After 500 years, humanity&#x27;s strength had expanded to an unprecedented level. But for the other immortal races, 500 years was just a few short naps.</p>
<p>When they woke up, they discovered that human armies had already sealed off their lairs. At that time, a human king appeared and declared, you are not worthy of these fertile lands. This continent belongs to humanity. A generation of royalty loudly swore an oath, opening a fierce battle. Reading up to this point, Sibin sat up straight and thought seriously, what the heck, this book is completely different from its illustrations, the content is too serious.</p>
<p>Could it be trying to trick people into opening and reading it? The book&#x27;s content stated that humanity first drove the beastmen to the far western part of the endless desert. After that, they attacked the Elf King and then chased the elves into the Jade Forest. Because the living space for the elves in the Jade Forest was too narrow, a portion of the elves chose to enter the sea to live. They gradually became the Naga sea tribe as they are now. They are brave and skilled fighters in the Stormy Sea region and do not see eye to eye with the demons near the Abyss&#x27;s Eye, leading to constant friction.</p>
<p>A portion of the elves who were too weak were considered a burden and expelled from the Jade Forest. These elves established a small kingdom between the humans and beastmen, relying on the treacherous mountainous terrain to survive. Reading this part, he was surprised and pondered, an elf kingdom between humans and beastmen. Isn&#x27;t that the Demi-human Kingdom? A fertile land suddenly appeared in his mind as he thought of this. Sibin gradually analyzed, so the demi-humans were originally elves like this.</p>
<p>The World Tree created a total of two types of elves. Apart from the later mutated Naga, the ones now living in the Elf Kingdom are clearly Tree Elves. So that means the demi-humans are actually Noble Elves. Thinking of this, he closed the book he was reading and found the book A Brief History of the Elves to continue. I remember this book seems to have written about it.</p>
<p>The World Tree inherited half of the Creation Dragon&#x27;s divine power. That power has infinite potential and also gave this characteristic to the Noble Elves. However, to maintain the balance between the Noble Elves and the Tree Elves, and to not abuse the Creation Dragon&#x27;s divine power, the World Tree ultimately restricted the bloodline development of the Noble Elves. Only a few Noble Elves have enough power in their bloodline to awaken their divinity. Based on the two books he had read, Sibin seemed to have realized, so that&#x27;s how it is.</p>
<p>Now it can be explained why the demi-humans&#x27; awakened abilities are so diverse. Moreover, they are also like divine skills. However, he was still a bit confused, but how to explain the Vessel? Is it just because of the similar divinity? Saying that, Sibin sank back into his thoughts. Similar divinity is definitely one of the reasons. But there are many things with similar divinity, why must it be demi-humans who can create the Vessel? Suddenly, there was a knock on his room door.</p>
<p>Sibin quickly snapped out of his thoughts and said, Come in. Lori gently pushed the door open, holding a tray of coffee, and called out softly, Master, your coffee is here. She slowly approached and saw the messy pile of papers on his desk. She asked curiously, Master, it&#x27;s so late, you&#x27;re still not resting? Sibin lazily stretched and replied, hmm, almost done. Lori placed the coffee tray on his desk and asked again, the war just ended, what is it that&#x27;s keeping you busy so late? Sibin directly grabbed her hand and scooped her right into his arms, causing Lori to jump in surprise.</p>
<p>He explained, I&#x27;m investigating the matter of the demi-humans. Lori, did you know that your people, the demi-humans, were actually a branch of the ancient elves a very, very long time ago, also called the Noble Elves. Lori became excited upon hearing this, Noble Elves, Master knows this name too. He was a little surprised and asked back, Lori, you&#x27;ve heard of Noble Elves before? Lori recalled the image of a pink-haired elf girl. Hmm, I heard it before from the mouth of the elf slave girl, Acelia.</p>
<p>She said I was a Noble Elf and also said some strange things to me. Sibin sympathized, so that&#x27;s how it is. No wonder you saw that scene of the Noble Elves being driven out of the Jade Forest. That truly is a bloody and unforgettable memory. He continued to ask, so do you know about the Vessel? Did Acelia ever tell you? Lori wagged her tail, hugged him, and answered honestly.</p>
<p>Lori doesn&#x27;t know anything about a Vessel. Acelia only said the Elf Queen is about to fall, and hoped Lori and the other demi-humans who can awaken would go help them. Sibin laughed out loud and assessed, I think she&#x27;s just daydreaming. He already had his own calculations in mind. Although abandoning the burden was a wise choice in that harsh living environment, what goes around comes around.</p>
<p>Now, wanting to ask the exiled Noble Elves to return and help is simply daydreaming. On the surface, Sibin dotingly patted Lori&#x27;s head and said, don&#x27;t worry, the Elf Queen won&#x27;t collapse that easily. But in his heart, he thought, the key point is that it&#x27;s an invitation for Noble Elves, not including the demi-humans who cannot awaken. He affectionately hugged Lori and continued, the Jade Border was originally the allied forces and the Gia Empire. Now that the Kolon Empire&#x27;s army has withdrawn, only the allied forces of the two empires are blocked there.</p>
<p>The pressure on the Elf Queen has lessened a lot. Lori snuggled into his chest, pouting, Lori is just Master&#x27;s little maid, not some Noble Elf. He could only helplessly pat her, alright, my little maid is so good. Sibin recalled Rui&#x27;s image and silently grumbled, she should really learn from my Lori&#x27;s perceptiveness, not just run away from home at the drop of a hat. The male lead hugged Lori tightly, who couldn&#x27;t help but feel shy, Master, you&#x27;re terrible, it&#x27;s still working hours.</p>
<p>He looked at her with a pitiful expression, I&#x27;ve been criticized. Lori couldn&#x27;t resist his charm and shouted, ah, really. After saying that, she jumped off Sibin&#x27;s lap, her tone carrying a hint of scolding, during working hours, you should work seriously. As for him, he was just mesmerized by her previous action, silently delighted. Wow, just like a squirrel.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Sibin remembered something important and seriously gave an order, that&#x27;s right, go call Acelia over. I have something to ask her. Lori misunderstood a little and stammered, asking back, Be-because I said we can&#x27;t during working hours, Master is changing to someone else to serve you? Hearing this, Sibin couldn&#x27;t help but freeze up. I want to ask her about the Noble Elves, you should listen in too. Because of Lori&#x27;s sentence, he couldn&#x27;t help but doubt himself.</p>
<p>Am I that untrustworthy? Lori ran off in embarrassment, her face as red as a tomato. I know, I&#x27;ll go get her right away. After a moment, Lori opened the door and said respectfully, Master, I&#x27;ve brought her. Sibin replied happily, hmm, come in. The moment Acelia stepped in, he immediately noticed her hot figure.</p>
<p>She bowed politely to greet him and asked, Lord, I heard you have something to ask me. Under Sibin&#x27;s lecherous gaze, Lori immediately turned to look at him with a warning. Sibin sidestepped and explained, I was looking at her elf signal. Sibin adjusted his demeanor and got to the main point, that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s related to you elves. Do you elves have any records related to the Divine Vessel, especially related to the Noble Elves? Acelia hesitated a bit and replied, I don&#x27;t have any about a Vessel related to Noble Elves, but I know a little about a Divine Vessel.</p>
<p>I can tell you, but you have to agree to one condition of mine. Hearing this, he laughed nonstop, ha ah, you can choose not to tell me, but I will throw you off the terrace. She replied in astonishment, how could you. Sibin&#x27;s voice was full of challenge, so, do you want to try? Through this matter, he also silently concluded, I used to think this elf was very ungrateful, but after seeing the materials I found today, the Tree Elf clan probably hates humans very much. Perhaps this issue is no different from the one between me and the First Prince.</p>
<p>If being nice to her is useless, I&#x27;m too lazy to waste my effort. At this point, Acelia had to concede, alright, alright, I know. She began to recount, I once saw a passage like this in a book. Before the World Tree fell into silence, it divided its divine power and will into countless parts and poured them into many wise ancient trees that had gained sentience. These wise ancient trees would become vessels for the awakening of the World Tree.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Sibin asked, so have you succeeded in reviving the World Tree yet? Acelia shook her head and replied, if Her Majesty the World Tree had been revived, we wouldn&#x27;t be trapped in the Jade Forest. She continued to explain, after Her Majesty the World Tree fell, many things disappeared. We only need to find enough items with divinity related to Her Majesty the World Tree. For example, branches of the World Tree, for example, the lost Scepter of Life, only then can we increase the speed of Her Majesty the World Tree&#x27;s revival. After hearing the whole story, Sibin rested his chin on his hand and pondered, so that&#x27;s how it is.</p>
<p>No wonder the human allied forces want to pursue and besiege the Elven Royal Court in the Jade Forest. The revival of the World Tree, although a good thing for Can, is a disaster for the human empire. When it was over, he waved his hand, ordering Acelia to leave. Alright, you may leave for now. I&#x27;ll call you again if I need you.</p>
<p>Acelia replied with some regret, yes. Sibin began to sink into thought again. So, the second stage of a demi-human&#x27;s awakening requires finding relics with divinity, but after awakening, it will make them more suitable to become vessels for the gods. But if they don&#x27;t awaken, sooner or later the will of those silent gods will find a way to find them. This is a death loop, there must be some way to break it.</p>
<p>He sighed wearily and continued to think. The silent gods are very weak. If the will and power of an awakened demi-human are strong enough, can they compete against them? Searching for divine relics to accelerate the demi-humans&#x27; awakening, enough for them to become strong enough, preparing in advance to deal with the gods is probably the best solution. Lori worriedly knelt right beside him, massaging his shoulders and asking, &quot;Master, is something troubling you?&quot; Sibin said dotingly, &quot;It&#x27;s not really a trouble, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s very likely your master will have no choice but to turn the entire continent of Can upside down.&quot; Looking at the cute cat girl in his arms, he felt a secret happiness, so that you all can continue to live happily. Arriving back at his room, Sibin quickly opened the system panel: &quot;Hello, system.&quot; The only reply was a mechanical voice: &quot;System is updating.</p>
<p>Please figure it out yourself if you have any requests.&quot; Seeing this, he sighed in frustration: &quot;Still not done updating. The system update time is so long this time. Forget it, I should go check on the coronation ceremony preparations.&quot; how things were going. &quot; out in the main hall, the maids were bustling with work when suddenly a maid in a purple dress recognized Sibin: &quot; Oh my, Lord. Hearing this, the other maids also began to clamor: &quot; Hey, it&#x27;s the Lord.</p>
<p>Good morning, Lord. Faced with such an enthusiastic welcome, Sibin beamed with delight and replied:. Hello, good morning. He asked the personal attendant beside him:. Mrs.</p>
<p>Chris, who are these people? She covered her mouth and said with a smile:. The coronation ceremony will be held in two days. The winter castle&#x27;s manpower was a bit insufficient, so we hired some new maids. We are now teaching them etiquette and rules. The new maids continuously surrounded him, causing his face to flush red:.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s how it is. You&#x27;ve worked hard, Mrs. Chris. Chris smiled with satisfaction:. I am willing to dedicate myself to you.</p>
<p>Sibin sat on the throne with the sweet young maids surrounding and serving him, and he exclaimed in delight:. So this is it. Is this the blissful joy of a monarch? Although it&#x27;s not like one can just enjoy this pleasure without doing anything. The maid beside him, seeing his sudden change in attitude, asked in confusion:. My Lord.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he called out loudly:. Is everything ready, Clemont? The old butler respectfully reported:. Yes. The great nobles and lords of the Colon Empire have all arrived and are waiting in the conference room. &quot; Sibin&#x27;s face gradually grew grim:.</p>
<p>Very well, let&#x27;s go over there. In the conference room, the officials were buzzing with discussion:. I heard the new king has abolished the Bada Church. I wonder what new church will appear. Another official said:.</p>
<p>He hasn&#x27;t even been coronated yet and he&#x27;s already summoned us. Of course, he must want to win us over, right? &quot; &quot; It doesn&#x27;t matter. We just need to see the sincerity of this new king. Sibin slowly entered with Clemont following behind. He said in a clear voice: &quot; Everyone.</p>
<p>I believe you all know the reason for convening this meeting, so I will be brief. Please read the distributed draft carefully first. After he finished speaking, Clemont distributed the documents to the officials one by one at the table. After reading the draft, they were in an uproar again: &quot; What is this? The Winter Code draft? Weren&#x27;t we supposed to talk about the coronation and the church? &quot; Sibin sat down solemnly and continued to explain: &quot; Right now, all territories in the Winter Empire lack managers, and riots have even occurred. This is a code I have drafted to help everyone manage their territories better.</p>
<p>There are many detailed clauses, but they are mainly divided into three major sections. One, abolish all taxes except those set by the king. Two, abolish the slave system and implement free contracts. Three, change the hereditary succession system; all descendants of nobles can no longer inherit their family&#x27;s fiefdoms and must pass the empire&#x27;s examination. Suddenly, an official in a purple robe stood up abruptly, slammed the table, and objected: &quot; Your Highness, this decree is unreasonable.</p>
<p>This is fundamentally cutting off the foundation of the empire&#x27;s strength. Doing so will only make the empire weaker and weaker. No one will follow you, Your Highness. &quot; Sibin didn&#x27;t say much and directly gave an order:. Drag this man out and hang him.</p>
<p>The guards immediately complied and dragged him out: &quot; Yes, young master. The official&#x27;s face turned pale with fear, and he stammered, begging: &quot; Wh-what? Wait, wait, Your Highness, I was wrong. I am willing to follow your orders, Your Majesty. Sibin, lounging on his chair, said with satisfaction:. Are there any other opinions? None? If there are none, this code will be implemented starting now.</p>
<p>A hand was raised, attracting Sibin&#x27;s attention:. Your Majesty the King. Another blond lord stood up, smiling as he spoke:. We are very willing to cooperate with you and implement this code. As soon as he finished, he cunningly asked further:.</p>
<p>But implementing the code requires a lot of money, time, and manpower. I just wonder if Your Majesty the King can give us enough support? Hearing this, Sibin also narrowed his eyes and replied with a smile:. No need to worry. Then he cursed inwardly:. If I hadn&#x27;t been unable to find talented people to manage the territories for the time being, and the reforms had to be carried out step by step, I would have removed these tumors long ago.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your cooperation. The Winter Empire is in a difficult situation. To make it more convenient for you to promulgate the law, I will dispatch a wyvern knight to help each of you. Under the indescribable gaze of his own butler, Sibin, with an unchanged smiling face, faced the people there:. A banquet has been prepared.</p>
<p>Everyone can go to the banquet to celebrate. As for which fiefdoms you will be assigned, you can find out directly from Clemont. With that, he turned and walked away, instructing:. Clemont, help me take good care of the nobles and lords. &quot; &quot; As you command, my lord.</p>
<p>A moment after Sibin left the conference room, Goodbye rushed over from a distance with a panicked look: &quot; This is bad, my Lord. Seeing who it was, Sibin couldn&#x27;t help but sigh: &quot; Why is it that every time I see you, you start with that line? Hearing this, Goodbye was on the verge of tears, a tear rolling down the corner of his eye:. You&#x27;re right. &quot; Without wasting time, Sibin calmly asked: &quot; Alright, what&#x27;s got you so panicked? Goodbye quickly replied:. Actually.</p>
<p>&quot; Seemingly hearing some unexpected information, he was a little surprised:. What? &quot; Sibin asked as he walked briskly, inquiring: &quot; You&#x27;re saying a thief broke into the royal palace, under your strict guard, and took the crown without a sound. Seeing the truly empty crown box before him, Goodbye was somewhat devastated, crying and admitting his guilt. My Lord. We were truly patrolling very carefully but didn&#x27;t see anyone enter.</p>
<p>The coronation ceremony is about to be held, none of the brothers dared to let their guard down. Hearing this, Sibin held the piece of paper left in the case, which still had a trace of miasma, and replied:. I know. &quot; A moment later, the small trace of miasma from the paper quickly clung to his hand. As if discovering something, his beautiful blue eyes couldn&#x27;t help but show a look of surprise.</p>
<p>There was something under the cloth. Goodbye, beside him, seemed to realize it too and immediately drew his sword, rushing forward:. My Lord. On the other side, Saintess Rui and Lory also noticed something was not right and shouted loudly:. Master, be careful.</p>
<p>Just as Lory finished speaking, Saintess Rui rushed forward, kicking at the cloth and quickly pushing Sibin back. Then she looked at Sibin&#x27;s arm with some concern: &quot; Sibin, your arm. He calmly reassured her:. It&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s just a bit of miasma that was attached to the object. &quot; With that, he smiled and waved his hand innocently, but Lory was now hugging his arm, crying with heartache:.</p>
<p>Master, it must hurt a lot. Saintess Rui also angrily scolded:. How is this fine? You really are... Faced with the concern from the two people before him, Sibin spoke up: &quot; With Lory here, it&#x27;s a small matter, don&#x27;t worry. Hearing this, little Lory immediately used her healing arts:.</p>
<p>I know. Lory will heal your arm right away. Sibin was now looking grimly at the lingering miasma on the items in the room, thinking nonstop: &quot; The problem is that the treasures here are all tainted with miasma. It seems someone doesn&#x27;t want me to ascend the throne smoothly. As his train of thought ended, he opened his mouth to give an order:.</p>
<p>Seal the scene. No one is to touch anything in here. Yes. &quot; &quot; As for the one who refused a toast, let him taste the forfeit. Inside the conference room, everyone had joined the party, chatting animatedly.</p>
<p>The atmosphere became extremely lively. The man who had voiced his opinion to Sibin earlier held a glass of red wine and sneered:. Being able to issue a law is nothing. Being able to actually implement it is what truly matters. The soldiers seemed to hear a commotion.</p>
<p>This means that the Count has a way to deal with this new king. Edward smiled calmly, naturally believing that it wouldn&#x27;t be long before he would be on his knees begging me. The soldiers grabbed him:. Wh-what? &quot; Suddenly, Clemont approached:. Count Edward.</p>
<p>&quot; He said with a serious expression:. Please come with me. Our Lord has invited you. &quot; The blond man panicked:. Wait, wait a minute, there must be some misunderstanding.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s best to follow His Majesty the King&#x27;s will. It should be so. &quot; &quot; Hmph, ugh, ahh. Edward was thrown outside brutally. He shouted resentfully:.</p>
<p>What are you doing, you people? I am... Suddenly, Edward seemed to have bumped into someone. He looked up and saw him, surprised:. Vivian. &quot; Sibin smirked:.</p>
<p>As expected. You sent this succubus to seduce me, didn&#x27;t you? Edward stammered:. Y-Your Majesty. &quot; Sibin replied:. Unfortunately, such a shameless trick has no effect on a righteous and powerful knight like me.</p>
<p>Is the theft of the crown also related to you? Edward pleaded: &quot; Your Majesty, please see clearly. It really wasn&#x27;t me. I didn&#x27;t steal your crown. You have no evidence to prove I did this. Sibin laughed coldly:.</p>
<p>You tried to use a honey trap to seduce me, and in turn, you ask me for evidence? Ridiculous. Lory immediately thought:. A succubus. No wonder Master was so entranced back then. I misunderstood him.</p>
<p>The blond man&#x27;s face turned pale. How did you know the plan, unless you were monitoring us all along? That&#x27;s right. Sibin explained with a wicked smile, At first, I discovered someone was watching me in Winter City, so I had Allen go to various countries to plant spies under the guise of delivering letters. Well now, do you have any last words? Edward knelt down. I beg you to spare me.</p>
<p>From now on, I will definitely follow your orders and honestly implement the law. I beg you to give me a chance. Sibin asked gently, Count Edward, do you know why I can be king? He could only stammer, Wh-why? Sibin replied, Because as a villain, I never give people a second chance. Sibin then called the soldiers, Men, drag him away to be dragon food. Edward then spoke defiantly, You, you think anyone will obey that law? Without my support, your rule will surely be overthrown.</p>
<p>Sibin smiled lightly with confidence, You think too highly of yourself. Lori then asked, Master, did he really not steal the crown? Sibin then said, No. Stealing the crown can&#x27;t completely stop my coronation. This is more like a prank. Lori asked seriously, But now without the crown, what about the coronation ceremony tomorrow? Sibin continued, Then we can only have someone make another crown.</p>
<p>He called out, Nina, let&#x27;s go to the forge. Yes. Loli, you stay here with the priest and help me deal with the miasma in the treasury room. Arriving at the forge, the master blacksmith looked surprised. What? Forge a new crown within a day? Lord, you must be joking, right? Sibin smiled, thinking, Actually, it&#x27;s half a joke, hehe.</p>
<p>He said, Hmm, so it really can&#x27;t be done, right? The shop owner replied, A normal crown is made of rare metals. The raw materials are scarce. Even if we had enough materials, under these circumstances, it would be very difficult to complete, unless we can find a master dwarf who is skilled in weapon forging. Sibin was bewildered, A dwarf? The craftsman then waved his hand, saying, You probably know that in terms of weapon forging, humans are far from being on par with dwarves. Besides, I don&#x27;t have any rare metals here.</p>
<p>at all. Sibin thought to himself, that&#x27;s true, if human craftsmen could casually reach the same level as dwarves, then reviving Saracen wouldn&#x27;t be so difficult. Suddenly, Nina&#x27;s eyes lit up and she said, Lord Commander, if you want to find a rare metal vein, I think I can sense it. Lori said, Nina. Sibin suddenly asked, Really? Where? Nina replied, Go 8 kilometers in that direction.</p>
<p>The craftsman then said, 8 kilometers away is the Frozen Lake. Sibin then said, It seems we have to take a trip to the Frozen Lake. Then, does the blacksmith here have any horses? The blacksmith replied, We do, but only two. Sibin smiled and said, It&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s fine, that&#x27;s a small problem. As they were walking through the forest, Nina said, Once we pass through this forest, we&#x27;re almost there.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Nina cried out in alarm, Lord Commander, it&#x27;s over there. Oh. Lori smiled and said, Actually, the Frozen Lake wasn&#x27;t called the Frozen Lake before. When the demi-human kingdom still existed, we called it the Angel&#x27;s Eye. It&#x27;s beautiful, isn&#x27;t it? Sibin nodded in agreement, It is indeed very beautiful.</p>
<p>Lori continued, Haivy, do you know why it&#x27;s called the Angel&#x27;s Eye? Sibin asked back, Why? Lori then recounted, Legend has it, there was no lake here before. Then one day, a large star, trailing a pale flame, crashed down here. It took hundreds of years for a lake like this to gradually form. The previous demi-human saintess told me that what fell was not a star at all, but the eye of an angel. Sibin asked in astonishment, What do you mean, the eye of an angel? This previous saintess was either talking nonsense or was overly romantic.</p>
<p>He continued, The supreme existence in the world of Can is the Creation Dragon On Nong, where would an angel come from? The so-called eye of an angel, I think it&#x27;s just a meteorite that fell, albeit a rather large one. But, if it was a meteorite that fell, then there&#x27;s an 80 to 90 percent chance that the rare metal vein is real. Suddenly, an explosion sounded from a distance. Hmm. Nina looked bewildered.</p>
<p>Sibin said, Why was there an explosion over there? Let&#x27;s go take a look. Nina replied, Okay, but that&#x27;s a gravel beach over there. We should get off our horses and walk over. As they got closer, they came across a dwarf with a furious, red-eyed expression. By the Stone Head above.</p>
<p>The angry dwarf stomped his foot hard on the ground and roared. Damn it, I&#x27;ll definitely skin that rotten brat. What did he add to the gunpowder? If I hadn&#x27;t run fast, my beard would have been gone. Sibin thought happily to himself, It&#x27;s actually a dwarf, and a level 60 one at that. An effortless find.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the dwarf turned his head to look. Hmm, who&#x27;s hiding there? Lori shouted, Danger! The dwarf slammed his fist on a large rock, forcing the three of them to jump back to avoid it. Sibin then said, Lori, wait, I want to recruit this dwarf, don&#x27;t use force. Nina replied, Huh, but he looks very hostile towards us. Sibin smiled and replied, I know that.</p>
<p>Just the fact that he hates humans is troublesome enough. The key is that I still don&#x27;t know why. Could it be that his tribe was once attacked by humans? Landing on the ground, Sibin continued, In this situation, we can only force a conversation. The dwarf looked at them and said angrily, Humans and a demi-human. With a furious glare, he slammed his fist on the ground.</p>
<p>The dwarf shouted, Human, back off! Leave this place, or I won&#x27;t mind turning you into minced meat. So annoying. We came all the way from the southern continent to the northern continent, thinking we could rest for a few days. Who knew that a prince from the Colon Empire would suddenly appear and steal more than ten of our King of the Hill siege cannons. Despicable humans.</p>
<p>Sibin stepped forward, smiling cheerfully, Hello, esteemed Dwarf Master, it&#x27;s a pleasure to meet you. I heard a commotion over here and came over out of curiosity. If I&#x27;ve disturbed you, I apologize. Sibin had an idea. From what he knew about dwarves, besides their strong personalities and love for forging, they had two other traits: they loved to drink and to be flattered.</p>
<p>For better or worse, I have to give it a try. The master was now staring at the three people standing opposite him. He said, flustered, Human, you&#x27;re quite the smooth talker. I&#x27;m looking for a mineral vein here. Don&#x27;t bother me, and I can pretend you were never here.</p>
<p>Sibin looked at the master in alarm, Looking for a mineral vein? But this is Lord Haivy&#x27;s territory, sir. The master&#x27;s face darkened. Lord Commander. Sibin smiled and said, That&#x27;s right, but Lori, it&#x27;s okay. He flashed a bright smile and said, After all, for a respected Dwarf Master to search for a mineral vein in my territory is my honor, Master.</p>
<p>As you can see, I am the Lord Commander of this generation, and I am also currently looking for a mineral vein. Have you found the vein you&#x27;re looking for? Perhaps I can help you. The master looked at him and said, You? Looking for ore? Then he shook his head and looked at the two girls with Sibin. He sighed to himself, One man and two women, no matter how you look at it, it seems like they&#x27;re on a picnic. What kind of ore are they looking for? Then he continued, I haven&#x27;t found the vein yet.</p>
<p>But your attitude as a human isn&#x27;t bad. Out of respect for you being the Lord Commander of this place, I can help you look. But after we find it, if it contains the vein I need, you must give it to me unconditionally. Sibin gave a friendly smile, Esteemed Dwarf Master, this maid of mine can find mineral veins extremely quickly. Perhaps I can really help you.</p>
<p>The master was astonished, A maid? Are you insulting me? He continued, Please don&#x27;t be angry, I have no intention of insulting you. He was quite angry, and blue sparks emanated from around him. A little maid helping me find a mineral vein? If this isn&#x27;t an insult, what is? Is finding a mineral vein some kind of lowly job? Sibin&#x27;s face showed great satisfaction with the dwarf&#x27;s reaction. He took the bait, as expected. He continued, Although this sounds absurd, it is indeed true.</p>
<p>How about this, why don&#x27;t we make a bet? If you find the mineral vein before my maid, I will give you this entire vein. If my maid finds it first, you will work for me. But you can still take whatever minerals you want from the ore. How about it? He was silent for a moment, then said, Human Lord Commander, this was your ultimate goal, wasn&#x27;t it? But I cannot work for a human. Whether your maid can find a mineral vein or not has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>But even so, I will still bet with you, for the glory of the dwarven race. If you lose, then banish your ignorance from my sight. If you win, I can forge a hero-grade weapon for you for free. I&#x27;ll provide the materials. Sibin looked at Nina and said, It&#x27;s a deal.</p>
<p>Nina, it&#x27;s all up to you. She replied to him, Yes, Lord Commander. She placed both her hands on the ground. At that moment, a golden light, mixed with a bit of red and orange, radiated from her. After she finished, the master looked very smug.</p>
<p>Little girl, I don&#x27;t want to make things difficult for you. If you want to blame someone, blame your master. Just then, Nina exclaimed excitedly, Lord Commander, I found it! Sibin gave her a thumbs-up, signaling she did a great job. Hearing her words, the master couldn&#x27;t believe his eyes. How can it be so fast? Little girl, you&#x27;re trying to trick me, aren&#x27;t you? Nina replied, No, I really found it.</p>
<p>There are two locations in total, one underwater and one by the lake. The one by the lake is under that rock wall. Everyone looked towards the rock wall. He laughed contemptuously and said, Little girl, you&#x27;ve slipped up, haven&#x27;t you? I&#x27;ve already searched this place. See this black mark? I blew that up, so there can&#x27;t be a mineral vein here.</p>
<p>She said while pointing to her head, The ore. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not deep enough. At this moment, a golden light similar to when she was searching for the vein appeared. This vein is not an exposed or surface vein, but is at a depth of 16 meters. The master stepped on a rock and said, 16 meters? Impossible.</p>
<p>After blasting the surface layer, I observed the structure of the geological rocks here. They are very tightly connected and belong to the same type of rock, clearly layered and with no signs of patching or fractures. This indicates that the rock masses here were formed in the same period, so even if it&#x27;s a dozen meters deeper, it will still be the same rock layer. There can&#x27;t be a mineral vein. Sibin thought to himself, Could it be that this rock wasn&#x27;t formed naturally, but is the meteorite that Lori mentioned? After all, the dwarf came through the Death Desert from the southern continent, so of course he wouldn&#x27;t know the story of the Frozen Lake.</p>
<p>Then he reassured the dwarf, Master, no need to rush. Whether it&#x27;s true or false, we&#x27;ll know by digging down 16 meters to check. We just need to do this. Sibin slammed his weapon on the ground, creating a light that surrounded him, and rocks flew out from the ground. This human&#x27;s strength is terrifying.</p>
<p>The master was now astonished, not believing what was in front of him. No, it can&#x27;t be. This light... it&#x27;s actually Thunder Gold Ore. The master was very surprised to see the mineral vein.</p>
<p>There really is a mineral vein. How did you do it? Sibin maintained his cheerful smile and said to the master, Well, Master, we didn&#x27;t lie to you, did we? He replied to him, flustered, Stone Head in the sky, this... this is too absurd. How is this possible? Sibin replied to him, It seems you also admit that we&#x27;ve won. Then please forge a hero-grade equipment for me.</p>
<p>The master stroked his beard and said, Of... of course, a dwarf&#x27;s word is his bond. What is said must be done. It&#x27;s just that my forge isn&#x27;t here. If you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;ll go move it now.</p>
<p>Sibin replied, Aren&#x27;t you considering coming to my territory? Not to mention, you can use all of this freely. My maid also knows many skills besides finding mineral veins. For example, transmuting one ore into another, or perfectly fusing two ores together. Then Sibin handed him something that looked like a stone. The thing he handed over had golden veins, sometimes with a bit of reddish-brown, on a purple background.</p>
<p>The master was shocked when he received what he was given. Transmuting ore, fusing ore... this... two types of materials can actually be perfectly fused together without a single flaw. The respective properties of the materials are fully brought out, even enhanced beyond their original base.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve lived for 308 years, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen Black Demon Steel. This is a divine miracle. He said to Sibin, Human, you possess a supreme treasure. This is not just wealth, but also formidable military strength. He still wore a friendly smile and said, Thank you for the high praise.</p>
<p>Two small flames appeared in his eyes. No, you don&#x27;t understand. The rare materials on the continent of Can are limited. This leads to extremely few high-end pieces of equipment. But now, your maid can break this rule.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not afraid of you laughing, but the entire Warhammer tribe has a total of only 20 King of the Hill siege cannons, precisely because we lack the key materials to craft the integrated components. The master now seemed quite irritated. But now we don&#x27;t have many left. it was stolen by a human prince. My injuries back then were even worse than now, and my clansmen had no strength to resist.</p>
<p>Everyone around looked at him with a puzzled expression. Sibin turned to Rui and asked quietly, The King of the Hill siege cannons, could it be? She replied, It was that first prince. I remember that First Prince Hình bought the siege cannons from the dwarf clan, but it turns out he stole them. Then these dwarves are too pitiful, invaded in the southern continent, and robbed after fleeing to the northern continent. The master held two hammers in his hands and said, That&#x27;s right, it was that First Prince Colon something.</p>
<p>Damn it, do you know him, do you know where he is? If I ever meet him, I will definitely use my Eternal Hammer to thrust it into his backside, to let him know the consequences of angering the dwarves. This is a long story, so that&#x27;s how it was, that damn guy. At this moment, flames of anger appeared around the master. A good death, the only regret is that I wasn&#x27;t the one to personally thrust the Eternal Hammer into his backside. Sibin stared at him blankly, your tastes are quite heavy.</p>
<p>The master continued, Therefore, you are now actually the king of this country. He replied to the master, I haven&#x27;t been coronated yet, so I&#x27;m still the lord. The master thought for a moment then turned and pointed at him, But even so, I still won&#x27;t work for you, but I can go to your territory. I&#x27;ll forge the hero-grade equipment you need, I can even stay there, but I might, might sometimes need your maid, to help me synthesize some ores. Of course, I will pay, or I can trade for it with crafted equipment.</p>
<p>So, how is this different from working for me? As long as Nina acts as the mediator, Sibin thought to himself. Well then, that&#x27;s fine, here&#x27;s to our happy cooperation. The master shook hands with him and said, You humans are still considered reasonable. Sibin thought to himself, Once you&#x27;re in my territory, I&#x27;ll naturally have a hundred ways to make you stay willingly. Then we can&#x27;t delay, you wait here for a moment, I&#x27;ll immediately go back to the tribe to handle some matters, I&#x27;ll definitely bring my tools back before noon.</p>
<p>The master said to Sibin, I swear by the great Stone Head and Moradin that I will return on time, a dwarf&#x27;s promise is as good as gold. She said to him, Haivy, will he really come back? He replied, Based on the dwarves&#x27; passion for forging, he will definitely come back, as long as Nina is here. He turned around but couldn&#x27;t see Nina anywhere. Then suddenly Nina shouted, Lord! He turned to see her leading two people behind her, Ah, we found the lord, shouldn&#x27;t we be calling you Your Majesty the King? Both of them greeted Sibin, Hello, Your Majesty the King. Sibin was surprised, Miroto, Biat, why are you two here? Sibin patted the two girls&#x27; heads and said gently, It&#x27;s not safe to run so far away.</p>
<p>Reminded by Sibin, the brown cat-girl replied cheerfully, It&#x27;s okay. The white cat-girl also said, Your Majesty, please don&#x27;t worry, my big brother came too, he came with the fat chef uncle to buy fish for you. Hearing this, Sibin thought, Biat&#x27;s big brother seems to be the werewolf Otto, with him by their side, there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. The white cat-girl struck a charming pose and said, That&#x27;s right, Your Majesty the King, I have something I want to give you, this is the most beautiful stone we found. Sibin smiled gently, accepted the stone from the cat-girl, and replied, Thank you.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the stone made a ding sound. An eye appeared in the middle of the stone, with a line of text, Received divine artifact: Dark Night Cat&#x27;s Eye Stone. Seeing this, Sibin felt surprised and confused. After giving Sibin the gift, the two girls said goodbye to him, Your Majesty the King, we&#x27;ll be heading back now. We&#x27;ve been gone for more than ten minutes, if we don&#x27;t go back, big brother will be worried.</p>
<p>He also replied coolly, Mm, okay, goodbye. After the two girls left, he thought to himself, Are you kidding me, I randomly run into the little carrots while out for a stroll, and the stone they casually picked up to give me is actually a divine artifact. Sibin narcissistically said, Just forget about giving me the title of Son of Destiny, Jun Yehao is truly weak now. Rui, standing beside him, was confused. Suddenly, a voice called out to Sibin from a distance.</p>
<p>Human King, hearing someone call him, he turned and replied, Hmm. The person who arrived was the master. He walked over and said, I&#x27;m back. You&#x27;ve waited long, let&#x27;s go to your territory now. Sibin replied, Okay.</p>
<p>Seeing the master carrying more heavy things than his own body, Sibin thought to himself, I kind of understand how the dwarves could carry so many King of the Hill siege cannons across the desert. Just by disassembling them into components, and relying on the dwarves&#x27; monstrous strength, moving these heavy mechanisms is easier than playing, right? Snapping out of his thoughts, Sibin exclaimed, That&#x27;s right, there&#x27;s something I need to trouble you with right away. Hearing this, the master asked, Hmm. Back at the kingdom. The master was forging something for Sibin.</p>
<p>As he forged, he said, Watch carefully, human, for a Groin clan forging master that is. After finishing the forging, he held up a crown with a sparkling red gem in the center and continued, this is as simple as making a toy for a child. Sibin, standing beside him, saw the crown the master made and clapped in praise, It&#x27;s magnificent. To express his gratitude, Sibin brought out wine for the master, Although it&#x27;s a trivial job for a dwarf master. But this is an important item I need to become the human king.</p>
<p>After Sibin opened the wine bottle, he said, To express my thanks, I&#x27;m giving you a gift. When Sibin opened the wine bottle, its aroma seduced the master, making him drool and ask covetously, This scent is. Sibin explained to the master, This is the fine royal wine of the Winter Empire, only Winter City has it, and it&#x27;s rarely sold to outsiders. I know dwarves love to drink, so I brought a bottle for you to enjoy. The master sniffed the wine&#x27;s aroma and said, By the Stone Head above, although humans are poor at forging, they can brew such fine wine.</p>
<p>I swear on my honor as a dwarf, no dwarf can refuse the allure of this fine wine, none. Hearing this, Sibin rejoiced inwardly, this is the effect I wanted, if dwarves could refuse this kind of fine wine, why would I have bothered to dig it out of the national treasury? He immediately made a proposal, Therefore, don&#x27;t you think that dwarves and humans living together can get what they each need? As long as you agree to bring your tribe to work in Winter City. I can promise you, one bottle of wine like this every day, plus I am the king, I can guarantee everyone&#x27;s wages, and you are free to come and go. When Sibin told the master about the benefits of working for him, he was deeply shocked and exclaimed, This is the temptation of a demon, dwarves will absolutely not submit to humans. The master continued to think as he drank, But our tribe needs a safe place to live.</p>
<p>This place not only has rare ore veins, but also a demi-human little girl who can find ore veins in a short time. She can also perfectly fuse ore veins, this king is very friendly to dwarves, he can guarantee wages and fine wine. After careful consideration, the master shook Sibin&#x27;s hand, Deal. As he shook hands, he thought to himself, Damn it, my hand has lost control, the benefits this human king is offering are just too much. After the master agreed, Sibin said joyfully, That&#x27;s great, to celebrate the friendship between our two races, let&#x27;s open 10 bottles tonight.</p>
<p>Hearing this, the master also danced joyfully with Sibin. While dancing, he replied, What, so generous, Your Majesty the King, from now on you are the brother of me, Groin Sanderson. Wait a moment, ah, hic, I&#x27;ll forge you a divine artifact, hic. At that time, hic, you can go kill gods directly, hic, do you need the Eternal Hammer, hic, it&#x27;s yours. Hearing this, Sibin said awkwardly, You should probably keep that.</p>
<p>Returning to his room, Sibin let out a sigh of relief and said, The dwarves&#x27; drinking capacity is truly limitless, but at least I got him to agree. Suddenly, Sibin was pulled into a room by an arm, surprising him, Mmm. It turned out to be Rui, who was in that room and pulled him in. He asked in surprise, Rui. She replied, Haivy, I have a gift I want to give you.</p>
<p>Sibin seemed mesmerized, a look of affection shining in his eyes. He looked at Rui gently, his voice stuttering as he asked, A g-gift? She looked up at him seductively and replied, Mmm. That was all Sibin needed to hear. He placed his hands on Rui&#x27;s shoulders, his eagerness and desire so apparent that he was drooling. Then he glanced around nervously, Th-this isn&#x27;t right, somewhere other than the bedroom.</p>
<p>He was about to say more but stopped himself, Forget it, someone might barge into the bedroom anyway, it&#x27;s all the same. One of her fingers touched his forehead, causing him to stop looking around and become calmer, but his eyes still sparkled shyly as he said, Then I&#x27;ll accept. Suddenly, Rui spoke up, The coronation ceremony is tomorrow morning, what are you thinking about? Then, she stepped out of his embrace and walked forward, saying, The gift I was talking about is this. In front of him, Rui stood beside a magnificent red cloak that exuded nobility, and then she introduced it. I personally sewed this cloak, perhaps it will be of use at tomorrow&#x27;s coronation ceremony.</p>
<p>The scene shifted to a vast sky, dotted with small, colorful pieces of paper, accompanied by the sound of trumpets, making the atmosphere here incredibly lively. The voice of the announcer began the introduction, It stretches from the Sorundo Mountains in the south to the cold Notland region in the north. Bordering the Andora Empire and the Meton Duchy to the east and west, it has formed the nation where we stand, this lush and fertile land. The subjects gathered here stood parted on two sides, discussing animatedly among themselves. They all faced the path in the middle and shouted, Your Majesty.</p>
<p>The opening words began, Today, this country will welcome its new master. At the same time, a procession appeared from the sky. In the middle was a carriage pulled by three flying beasts, with guards behind it. Seeing this, the people here cheered joyfully in welcome. The announcer&#x27;s voice introduced the leader, That is our one and only leader, His Majesty Haivy Golden Lion.</p>
<p>Sibin stood tall and landed amidst a cloud of smoke, accompanied by resounding cheers, His Majesty Haivy. He stepped down from the carriage. Grimon drew his sword and commanded, Crusader Legion, attention. On both sides, soldiers stood in two neat rows, drew their swords, pointed them to the sky, and shouted in unison. Hail the King, present for His Majesty the King.</p>
<p>Then followed a chorus of welcomes, The entire Ti Phong Legion expresses its highest respect to Your Highness. City Guard, we salute you, Cavalry Division, we salute you. The unison shouts ended as Sibin stepped onto the stage. He introduced himself, I, Haivy, Golden Lion, swear to all the people of the kingdom. Sibin turned to the crowd, joyfully spreading his arms wide and said majestically, I will rule a nation more powerful than any in history.</p>
<p>Everyone will witness a new nation rise from here and will be proud to be a citizen of this place, to protect it, to develop it, to explore it, and will plant its flag all over the Can continent. Then he announced the name of this nation, It is called the Winter Empire. Then he added, and I am called the Winter King. the people below cheered joyfully, raising both hands high and shouting in unison, &quot;Long live the Winter King, long live, long live!&quot; Along with that, the sound of a bell signaling a new beginning also rang out. As the bell rang, it was also the moment Rui, Lori, and the children stepped forward.</p>
<p>The two girls walked ahead, carrying a crown and a cloak. It represented the royal robe. Following them were children holding wine glasses, laughing happily as they followed in the two&#x27;s footsteps. They stepped onto the platform and said in unison, &quot;Long live Your Majesty the King, please accept our blessings.&quot; Seeing this, Sibin knelt down, placing his hand on his chest solemnly. Rui came and draped the sparkling, noble red cloak over him.</p>
<p>The people behind cheered, &quot;Long live Your Majesty.&quot; Then Lori stepped forward, smiling brightly as she held up the golden crown, and said gently, &quot;Long live Your Majesty.&quot; The cheers continued to ring out one after another, &quot;Your Majesty.&quot; Amidst that joyful celebratory atmosphere, a notification sound suddenly rang out, &quot;Ding.&quot; That &quot;ding&quot; sound made Sibin, who was holding the crown, freeze. After that came the announcement, &quot;System update successful. The host&#x27;s death ending has been changed. Beep beep, a new Child of Destiny has descended.&quot; The new announcement, with its final words, left a big question in Sibin&#x27;s mind: a new Child of Destiny. So, the villainous lord, the player, and the main character all want to kill me.</p>
<p>The story ends here.</p>
