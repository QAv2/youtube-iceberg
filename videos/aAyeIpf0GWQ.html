            <p>I got this letter out of the blue. It said, &quot;Look up towns and brown.&quot; And I did. He is another overlooked inventor. His work was disputed by physics. Physics said it was impossible, but they classified it anyway.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll see his work in air filters that the Sharper Image sold. Or if you go out to the desert at night, you&#x27;ll see a bluish haze flying over the desert and his work is in that. You&#x27;re talking about towns and brown.</p>
