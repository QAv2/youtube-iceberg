            <p>[Music] have you ever heard of D glocca I am talking about the powerful top secret time machine that was allegedly created by the German Nazis toward the end of the Second World War this some say was the wound of otha the Wonder weapon a weapon so powerful so exotic then even in the last minutes of the war as the Soviet Army closed in on Poland could have changed the whole course D glocca Nazi secret space program few people were aware of it since they&#x27;ve remained a secret for many years it was an anti-gravity UFO like saucer craft that many believed could travel across time this mysterious Nazi Bell is known to have serves several purposes including helping the Third Reich reach space visit the Moon and Mars and even distant star systems this is purportedly possible through the unexplainable UFO like gravity defying propulsion system a cutting-edge technology not available to the masses [Music] the development of this technology was ordered by Adolf Hitler and would play as an essential part in the secret space program initiated by the Nazis when Hitler noticed that the walls were starting to close on him he pumped even more resources and manpower into his von der waffle or wonder weapons to accelerate the process there&#x27;s a great deal of evidence that suggests that the scientists including Hermann Oberth and Wernher von Braun and others were working on a bell-shaped craft that was electromagnetic and his propulsion system this was all in an attempt to radically change the course of the war this weapon is the de glocca the Bell and was part of the long list of under of often that the Nazis developed towards the end of World War two after more than 15 years of researching archives in different countries igor witkowski a Polish journalist and author specializing in the military technology and history of world war ii published prada Oh of under Vava a book that discussed de glocca at length Prada Evander Vava would later become a huge success after British military journalist and author Nick cook quoted him in his own book the hunt for zero-point inside the classified world of anti-gravity technology the Germans worked on the various I would say unconventional aerial systems or weapons to build some objects that were more or less circular the ski cone takeoff and landing crafts for example it has has been reviewed by lots of riders and researchers in fact other riders like Joseph P Farrell later associated it with Nazi occultism anti-gravity and free energy research so what did Eater Witkowski Nick cook Joseph P Farrell and many other writers and researchers discovered of a discovery of D glocca through some transcripts from the Polish archives he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to access this document without one of his polish intelligence contacts although he was not allowed to make copies of these documents he was allowed to transcribe them what he found in these transcripts shocked him it was from an interrogation of a captured former Nazi SS officer jakob sporrenberg Witkowski relates in his book the presence of a strange Bell that measured four and a half meters in height by two and a half wide its shape is similar to that of a large Bell that is also where it got its name the external appearance of the Bell was such that it was a ceramic cover perfect which has a kind of a core or axis around which rotated 15 degrees around the same axis in opposite directions according to his description it was made of an extremely durable metal alloy covered with ceramic and on the inside it has two counter-rotating cylinders that contained a violet liquid with a consistency similar to that of mercury the journalist identified this liquid as serum 525 and it was also stored in a 1 meter long thermos capsule coated in lead other researchers added components such as light metals like menthol thorium and beryllium peroxides elements commonly used as fuel in nuclear reactors from Kooks description D glocca was revealed as a strong radiation emitting craft the radiation is released upon activation and the effect a bell-shaped machine capable of potentially destroying everything and everyone close to it after all it was designed to be able to pierce time and space scientists were reported to have suffered from a very terrible case of vertigo they would later die because the levels of radiation that the Bell emitted when it was activated were just dangerously high [Music] everything suggests mathematical calculations for example that it could have been effective way to master gravity there are some ruins of a metal framework close to the wind seselis mind many have dismissed it as just a conventional industrial cooling tower however Witkowski maintains that this structure is in fact used as a test rig for an anti-gravity propulsion experiment conducted using de glocca the henge itself stands in a pool of water and the pool itself wasn&#x27;t covered with the ceramic tiles near the Czech border in Ludovico visa was a mine in which the Nazis built in secret of revolutionary model with anti-gravitational properties the Bell was the first experiment of anti-gravity engine prototype one of the most striking things was that this project had been developed with the names of Kronos time and Lantern draaga light-bearer having references in the top-secret documents as Gate of time Adolf Hitler commissioned the device that was capable of traveling through time and had anti-gravity capabilities that kind of knowledge so quickly one of the possible reasons is at the an inner bay with their researchers had actually discovered technology through some of their expeditions to find ancient records in command of this project was ss general Hans Kammler a scientific engineer who had also participated in the development of multiple projects such as v2 missiles jet aircraft wings Nazi UFOs and underground constructions a multicolored orb of light was seen in the sky in 1937 in southwestern : by all accounts this was a UFO sighting but it&#x27;s a lot more than that by the time the Second World War ended neither the bell nor its team of scientists and developers resurfaced they all simply disappear ss general Hans Kammler who was the one in charge of the Third Reich secret projects didn&#x27;t resurface since we actually don&#x27;t know what happened to the house combat at the end of the war he has just disappeared that nobody has been found and there is more to this it boggles the mind to try to grasp what these guys were thinking because it is so totally alien and that allowed them to go into areas that are completely beyond the Western paradigm beyond what Western science says when the Second World War ended a lot of former Nazis were tried at war crime tribunals they were charged of crimes against humanity and violations of human rights among the defendants was a former Nazi SS obergruppenfuehrer one of the highest commissioned Nazi SS ranks his name was jakob sporrenberg while the Allied army was on its way to the village of Ludwick&#x27;s Dorf now called Ljubica Vichy the officer of the waffen-ss karl sporrenberg by direct order of hitler had carried out the execution of 62 nazi scientists engineers and technicians who had worked on the project dig Locka entrances to the tunnels were grown up and all the prisoners of the concentration camps which knew something anything about the production of the purpose was closed in sight and so the mystery of this of this undertaking was was sealed off effectively the idea was to keep everything about the technology a secret from the outside world it was sporrenberg affidavit that would later give us the clue to how this highly advanced technology sounded according to sporran Borg&#x27;s affidavit the Bell was a highly advanced device that produced a hissing or buzzing sound when operational he noted that because of the sound his fellow Germans referred to the bell as Durban in shock the German word for beehive paintings of Charles a a del Chou the late 19th century artist would later add additional evidence of the bells existence these highly detailed images of the bell as painted by Del Chou indicate that there are German engineers who knew about the Bell before it was deployed during the Second World War del Chou was a member of the German Sonora Aero Club collective a cryptic group known for their construction of exploratory aircraft designs this would later raise suspicions that del Chou might have been in contact with some pro-nazi hyper-intelligent extraterrestrials how else could he have painted hundreds of aircraft all looking strikingly similar to the Bell but why did they create this contraption in the book what coughs key explains that the goal of the campaign was to generate anti-gravity propulsion which is why they found it fastened to the ground with large chains in addition his theory maintains that this weapon was lethal for any living being that was in a radius of 200 metres after activation in the writings he talks about his creation process loaded with tragedy five of the seven members of the team led by physicist Walter Gerlach during the tests part of their job was to literally go all over the world looking for special cults artifacts things like the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail and the Polish secret agent military who provided the documents to the journalist from home he could only take a few notes so there is no material evidence of the existence of this Nazi campaign there are also those who believe that the Bell was moved to the Arctic Circle and or South America after their top scientists were executed some also believe that work was continued on the Bell after the Second World War after the Nazi leaders develop UFO technologies that allowed them to communicate with pro-nazi extraterrestrial beings conspiracy theories about Nazi time and interdimensional travel have resurfaced before the release of the third season of the successful American television series created and produced by Amazon Studios man in the high castle more and more reports are surfacing as it continues to gain fresh awareness historians say that there is probably no weapon of time-travel such as de glocca and this is due to unverified conspiracy theories and of course scientists still believe that traveling through time is impossible yet every day we see signs that there are so many secret works deliberately hidden from the public this is a story not suitable for skeptics that undoubtedly brings us closer to a dark age not only because of what happened but also because of all that remains to be discovered about what really happened [Music] from what we&#x27;re able to glean today non-si technology at the end of World War two was so advanced that they had things that are still science fiction today anti-gravity beam weapons flying saucers flying trying things that are still kept secret today [Music] you</p>
