            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>So, we we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve been digging into this anti-gravity stuff as long if not longer than Jeffrey Epstein was. I didn&#x27;t, you know, hire a lot of these people to come to my private island because I don&#x27;t have one. But we did set up a conference, our own conference after the SDS Park conference. Um it&#x27;s run by Jim Woodward and uh who&#x27;s the Woodward effect, the M also called the Mach effect. And um but that&#x27;s again a whole another story.</p>
<p>there&#x27;s all these different scientists that have uh you know come out over the years. He used to they used to actually run this uh STA conference which was the original DARPA conferences where all the propulsion stuff would be discussed and and all the all the papers would be presented and and picked up by DARPA projects and stuff like that back in like the 80s and 90s. So I haven&#x27;t I&#x27;ve known I knew the guys that were doing this like when I was just a baby, you know what I mean? And and I talked to interviewed all them got all their all their best info and all their best intel. If someone figured out anti-gravity in 1954, like Steven Greer came and sat in this chair and and and and told you that we know about it. We&#x27;d have it.</p>
<p>And his his &gt;&gt; Well, don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s what all the Tic Tac stuff is? You think that&#x27;s like Do you think I think that&#x27;s our stuff, our our own anti-gravity stuff? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s I They probably la they probably launch it out of submarines. &gt;&gt; Is that Is that true though? I don&#x27;t have the evidence for that or is that Nobody does. This is all This is all they want us to believe. I wonder if that&#x27;s just a scup they want us to believe because you look at you look at right now right now you got Ross Cohart saying that he swears the Tic Tac is a Loheed Martin and that he&#x27;s seen something that no one else has seen and I know for a fact that Steven Greer showed him something that was given to him by Michael Strat who&#x27;s my you know one of my good friends and and &gt;&gt; Michael Schat. &gt;&gt; Michael Schat um &gt;&gt; that name sounds so familiar.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Michael Shrat is a UFO archivist and and a researcher. Um he&#x27;s got a huge collection of UFO documents. He he&#x27;s c every every UFO library in the world. He has he has an a full copy of their entire library. He has he has more he has all the broadic blue book files and and plus more.</p>
<p>Um this guy&#x27;s got everything and uh he&#x27;s got every single Area 51 patch that was ever issued on a on like four like he&#x27;s got like five boards full of all the patches, man. This guy&#x27;s got like every like the authentic real patches that that were given to people at Area 51 for every special project that ever happened out there and he can tell you every single one and and and and details about it. Bro, the guy&#x27;s the guy is a um the guy&#x27;s great. I mean, he&#x27;s one of he&#x27;s he&#x27;s one of my best uh friends and researchers in the in the UFO community um around around that issue. And uh I know for a fact that he&#x27;s the one that dug up that 196 uh it was a 1967.</p>
<p>When was the YC comb? It&#x27;s it&#x27;s WCOM. It&#x27;s like YCOM with a B C O M B. &gt;&gt; Um Pennsylvania sighting cuz he&#x27;s got a tic tac sighting from &gt;&gt; Oh, really? from 1967. &gt;&gt; Oh, 67. &gt;&gt; Bro, this thing was &gt;&gt; So you you don&#x27;t think you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t think the Tic Tacs were were our stuff? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. Um, what&#x27;s your guess? What&#x27;s your best guess? &gt;&gt; If it could have been, you know, because aerogels go back a hundred years, right? So, you have super lightweight things. Then you have these surfaces which are, you know, you can get propulsion effects of ion propulsion off a surface with these propulsion effects. You could build a large aerogel aerostat craft with this these propulsive surfaces on it that could, you know, accelerate at ridiculous speeds because F= MA. If you put your m really small, a tiny bit of force gives you a huge A, right? That&#x27;s a huge acceleration.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s phys basic physics, right? So, you can go really really fast on a small amount of force if you weigh nothing, right? If you weigh as light as a feather and these aerrow gels weigh lighter than a feather, they&#x27;re lighter than they&#x27;re lighter than than water and stuff. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Talking about &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the one. It&#x27;s the boiler the boiler uh ship UFO. It looks like it looks like a tic tac with the same kind of appendages hanging off of it.</p>
<p>the same little antenna appendages um &gt;&gt; in Womei, Pennsylvania, &gt;&gt; which is it&#x27;s just weird, right? Because uh &gt;&gt; and this thing was described as flying. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it flew right out of a lake and over a lake. Um I don&#x27;t know if it came out of the water and took off. That&#x27;s um &gt;&gt; I I think that&#x27;s what I thought. I think it came out of the water and took off.</p>
<p>Um so something interesting there. Again, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s hard to say what uh what they have without definite proof because they they&#x27;ve they kept the they kept certain projects secret for for for a very long time, you know, and then it&#x27;s hard to say, man. It it really is. But I I I I feel like a lot of it just from a standpoint of being involved in it and seeing so much overhype and and underd delivery, I feel like a lot of this stuff is scops to make people think, you know, it&#x27;s like to make our enemies think we have a lot better stuff than we actually do. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what I feel like some of it is, you know, but then again, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like where&#x27;s the you know, it&#x27;s again, where&#x27;s the proof? You need you need definite proof before I can say that uh we have the ability to teleport a plane for example.</p>
<p>I have to show that I can teleport u a toothpick first right I have to show that experimentally that I can make a toothpick disappear and reappear over there and then I can teleport it with technology before before I&#x27;ll believe that you can do it with an airplane or a person or anything else. Right? You have to show this physically. So there again, we&#x27;ve been we&#x27;ve had a lab. We&#x27;ve had um we&#x27;ve gotten tons of people working on this from all over the world. There&#x27;s there&#x27;s a massive team of like 30 or 40 people all working on different anti-gravity experiments around the clock.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;ve been working on this for five like five years with fun with private funding and we haven&#x27;t been able to crack this or figure it out. You know, like we&#x27;ve gotten the Bifel Brown effect to work in the in the in the in the vacuum video. Remember the bub the bell jar with the the the uh in fact when Jesse Michaels was on Joe Rogan they were searching you know the bifel brown in a vacuum and that that came up. That&#x27;s our video. &gt;&gt; Oh, is it really? Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s pull it up. &gt;&gt; How do we find it? &gt;&gt; Uh look up Bifel Brown effect in a vacuum. That&#x27;s the &gt;&gt; And you guys did this in your lab. &gt;&gt; Mark did this down at his lab with a 15inch bell jar down in um in uh in New Jersey at the Falcon Space Lab in New Jersey. So, and we did this be and um because Jesse Michaels had put together this video on Brown &gt;&gt; for a little bit &gt;&gt; and in the and in in just &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>His documentary on Buffield Brown was [ __ ] amazing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was great. And in the end, he said he offered a $50,000 prize to anyone who could, you know, show and demonstrate provably that this effect works in a vacuum. Right. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And so we said, &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll take that challenge.&quot; &gt;&gt; And did you do it? &gt;&gt; Well, here it is, man. I haven&#x27;t seen that 50 grand. What? I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s happening here. &gt;&gt; It looks like it&#x27;s moving. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s it&#x27;s on a torsional balance.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to rotate when when the force is applied, you know. So, this is a this is a hard vacuum. This is negative 6 to Okay. It&#x27;s hard vacuum. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Explain. You got you got to break this down for for a 5-year-old. &gt;&gt; So, if this is ion wind, so if Brown is purely ion wind, like you know, Martin Tajar of the ESA and and all the uh official authorities on on this say, right? If it&#x27;s purely ion wind, then it shouldn&#x27;t work in a vacuum. But it does. Why? &gt;&gt; So, you&#x27;re saying that this thing in the middle is spinning, right? Or is moving &gt;&gt; because of the biffel brown effect? &gt;&gt; Those are little bifeld brown effect thrusters in there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Those little things, &gt;&gt; those little tiny things. Those are little bifel brown thrusters. &gt;&gt; And how do they work? &gt;&gt; Well, they were made a specifically according to um Dr. Charles Buer&#x27;s research who worked for NASA for like 30 years on electrostatics and he was an expert on the Bifel Brown effect. He did all he did all the Bifel Brown research for NASA on this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. and he came forward um in 20 23 at the end of 2023 on my podcast to um you know basically show the world that hey you know I&#x27;ve been working on all this stuff for 30 years and um they finally cleared me to be able to talk and talk about it and tell you all about it and uh he&#x27;s was very uh adamant that this you know this stuff actually is it&#x27;s something it&#x27;s some it&#x27;s New physics. There&#x27;s new physics here. &gt;&gt; Why is it going back and forth like that? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s on a torsional balance. So So it&#x27;s um it&#x27;s uh &gt;&gt; And why so slow? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh it takes a very small amount.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s producing a very small amount of thrust, but it is producing some. But this but if it produces any amount of thrust in a vacuum, it means it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not pushing off air, right? And Nam Tran is is uh the name of um he&#x27;s the person that built those thrusters. He&#x27;s a he&#x27;s a a physicist, an experimental researcher from our group. He lives in Vietnam. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So yeah, this is uh this is all this is all new physics here, man. There&#x27;s something there&#x27;s something weird going on. And Biffield Brown working in a vacuum. It shouldn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s no mainstream explanation for why this is happening or what&#x27;s going on there.</p>
<p>And Epstein, of course, would probably have been interested in this. I don&#x27;t know what he what he was I don&#x27;t know how far he got or who else he was involved with with the groups. I mean, we have a list of the names of the scientists that were going to the you know, the island and stuff. And we have the fact that, you know, he&#x27;s trying to get infiltrate other groups and other theoretical groups and stuff. what the reasons are all behind those.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure. You know, Eric Weinstein seems to think that he was specifically targeted because of his his his research that he was doing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Weinstein explained being invited to his house, right, and going there and like waiting in the lobby and then being like really [ __ ] creepy and he thought that &gt;&gt; he explains that he think Epstein was like playing a character. &gt;&gt; He didn&#x27;t think he was like a real finance guy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Like he wasn&#x27;t he wasn&#x27;t a real &gt;&gt; investor, right? He was like uh someone that was playing a character who obviously had a ton of money, but he got most of his money from Leslie Wexner. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Les Wexner. Yeah.</p>
