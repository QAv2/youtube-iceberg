            <p>a lot of energy inside and can uh to some extent uh interact with uh normal solid bodies and the theory of uh Z Point fluctuations of vacuum was created by American scientist uh Harold POF uh Bernie H and Dr Reda and this theory is a very interesting one uh there are a lot of debates about it but it&#x27;s the only theory that is able uh to explain uh the mechanism of gravity the mechanism of energy and practically how the whole universe was created it&#x27;s a new approach the idea of ether uh is a not a new one it was it existed through centuries but now it got uh a very good expression in this Theory with good mathematical formulas and uh in my work I try to use uh this Theory so I very grateful to uh Harold POF and I&#x27;m also grateful to ja sarfati who is a kind of his opponent in the scientific world but uh with different approaches to the same subjects we we can have really the solution of the problem also most uh of uh the theoretical work which is behind my experiments uh most of this work was done by uh Dr jaavan modza uh who is one of the leading European theoreticians in the U field of U Gravity Research and uh it&#x27;s enough to say that he made his pH D um in Germany and uh his um research was in the field of general relativity and special relativity of Einstein so we don&#x27;t break any laws when we&#x27;re working with superconductors or experimental uh gravity installations we&#x27;re just trying to follow all the rules but sometimes we observe the um phenomena which are unusual we call them animal uh and we report honestly what we find and uh we would like of course uh to attract the attention of the scientific world to all these problems and U to organize uh a deeper research in this field because it will definitely improve our understanding of the universe of the creation process of the gravity forces or gravity field and it will allow us to use uh all um uh this mechanism for the benefits of humanity and of course you mention it if a dis spins faster I guess you get more of a field around it if you were to say have a disc made out of that material and if it were possible to spin it would you I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to phrase this um and if you were to say spin it that I just just say 6,000 RPMs at this maybe say 3T would it actually be able to levitate more objects or or more weight or is it something else that work here well uh first of all if we rotate such big disc at uh terrible speeds it will fall apart because the materials can stand uh this load but uh to be absolutely honest now after 12 or 15 already years of research in this field uh we came to a conclusion that it is not necessary to use superconducting materials in order to modify uh the gravity field we can use rotating magnetic fields and we can turn to normal conductors which is much easier much easier and uh this method has a lot of advantages so we use superconductors just as model materials because we can put different magnetic fields inside and we can freeze magnetic fields inside the materials so this is just the unique properties of the superconductors that we used so it&#x27;s possible still uh to base the research on superconductors but we can go further and in in order to create flying vehicles or impulse gravity generators we can use normal materials I was reading something about NASA they&#x27;ve got an experiment that they evidently released um at least weeks ago um they haven&#x27;t released it or somehow got into on the internet that I read about it but they have something that&#x27;s 20 in wide by 48 in tall and I guess it&#x27;s like a tube from the description of it um if you were to stack those discs would you get more power uh say able to I I I guess what I&#x27;m trying to get at is could you lift heavy objects like I don&#x27;t know bricks or you know well if we put uh uh one disc over another and they can&#x27;t be put just like this we use different cryostats and we can rotate the disc even in opposite directions yes there is some uh gain in the weight loss so it&#x27;s possible the experiments that were made uh in NASA according to my knowledge uh they used the principles that uh I published in uh physic C in 1992 then uh we modified the experiment and used uh bigger discs so I consulted people from Marshall space flight center uh on this topic and they got some unusual results but unfortunately the whole um uh the whole project which was called uh breakthrough propulsion uh system uh it lost practically all the funding and uh uh the research was stopped at the final U Point uh they made a cry start uh they made the discs uh very close to the requirements that we supplied and uh we were ready for the tests but the program was stopped unfortunately and that is quite understandable because uh This research is entirely new and uh by the way doesn&#x27;t require much money and usual approach to gravity problems to Rockets to shuttle programs all these things take lots of money and uh that also means that a lot of people are involved they have working places uh and the companies gets Millions from this uh but finally what we get as a result is a shuttle which is not a reliable construction at all and it was good for the 20th century but it is not good for the 21st we have better proposals we have cheaper variant and we have more efficient solutions for the exploration of space so I was always hoping uh to be able to organize the institute for the Gravity Research uh based on the best physicist of the world it might be under the guidance of NASA or European space ageny Russian space agency or British airspace whatever it is but it should be International because the problem is too complicated to solved it only in the United States or in France or in Russia if you were to uh the smoke that you that the your colleague blew over that is it possible to see the actual rings that go around is there some way looking at that no no it&#x27;s uh the smoke simply approach this area and then it goes up and that&#x27;s all and uh my poor colleague I usually I I can&#x27;t even tell his name because unfortunately and everybody knows it it is not allowed to smoke in the lab but it was evening time and he was uh exhausted and he was going home and he was just curious what we were doing so late that&#x27;s why he so I&#x27;m always asked do you know that it is not allowed to smoke in the lab yes I know it very well we Never Smoke we usually don&#x27;t break any laws administrative or physical we&#x27;re just very intelligent people I didn&#x27;t know that so I don&#x27;t want to get you in trouble okay okay so what happen okay here&#x27;s something I I I was wondering have you ever I don&#x27;t know how you get the disc to to a spin maybe you got electric motor under it or something but if you were to put a pan of water maybe 2 in thick maybe 2 ft by 2 ft would it have any effect on the water would would the water I mean could it could could it possibly bring water up is that possible uh well what will happen that uh all water that is put over the disc will lose some part of its weight so if we put one liter of water it will um weigh not 1 kilo but uh 2% less or 1% less that&#x27;s all we can&#x27;t uh use this uh method for the uh turbines or for the production of energy at present but I&#x27;m sure that based on this principle we can uh later construct the installations which will be able to provide us not with entirely free energy but with the energy which is very cheap and very efficient if we speak about free energy again I don&#x27;t want to break the second law of thermodynamics but the second law of Thermodynamics is valid only for closed systems and it is well known to every physicist but they always forget that we deal with physical vacuum that means the subatomic particles that are present everywhere in the air inside this body inside human tissues and we can take the energy from this field of physical vacuum and we can use this energy but how to organize the interaction uh with this physical vacuum it&#x27;s another question so there are various approaches and uh there is there are pages on the net which are called American anti-gravity and it&#x27;s a very big work by team Ventura and I have a small abstract there and there are different ways uh to polarize space and to have the interaction with physical vacuum we can uh create high magnetic fields we can create high electric Fields like bifield brown effect we can also uh have extra low frequencies uh and uh here it&#x27;s necessary to mention uh The Works of Professor FR quo from Brazil and it&#x27;s also possible to use um rotating magnetic fields based on the works of Professor surl from Great Britain we can also uh rotate uh normal uh gyroscopes and uh I&#x27;m always thankful to Professor lewe who slightly Disturbed the traditions of the science in Britain but still proved that we can create gravity forces use uh special gravity forces us using usual geros Scopes and we can also use special grids very thin geds uh and topological effects in order to polarize space and we can of course use um super conducting materials and the properties of BOS Einstein condensate and there are also some other methods uh we know some of them and we know and maybe we don&#x27;t know all of them but uh there is a big field of unstudied material in front of us but we can also use the combination of all these methods and this will definitely give the best results so we&#x27;re slowly moving in these directions using the knowledge of different scientists uh from other countries using theoretical material that is uh that exists in this area but uh also using intuition because we&#x27;re pioneering U this work and this task is extremely difficult because modern science it&#x27;s like whole Inquisition we can&#x27;t say we invented or we made anti-gravity by the way we never use the term an gravity in our laboratory we use gravity forces which can be attractive and which can be also repulsive and by the way if uh and superconducting material um can demonstrate uh both repulsive and detractive forces for example if we have a superconductor and we have a magnet and we put the magnet over the superconductor and</p>
