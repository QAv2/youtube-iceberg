            <p>foreign [Music] the foundation of innovative thinkers and inventors like Tesla and Moray the Modern Age of free energy research began in the 1950s as waves of flying saucer sightings occurred throughout the United States and while an infant space program was trying to catch up with the Russian&#x27;s launch of Sputnik a man named T Townsend Brown was busy on experiments that defined conventional understanding about electricity gravitation and propulsion along with doctors Paul Byfield and Agnew bonson Brown took high voltage to the next extreme in this rare home movie the earliest experiments in electrogravidics are recorded [Music] by using High voltages over twenty thousand and up to two hundred thousand volts Brown discovered that highly charged capacitors would exhibit a noticeable thrust in One Direction although awarded a patent for his electrokinetic generator no one has ever reproduced his experiment until recently Larry Davenport shown here demonstrating his replication of Brown&#x27;s electrokinetic apparatus Expo begin to read brown stuff I didn&#x27;t quite understand the difference between the ion wind devices which there&#x27;s a lot of them out there and some of them are are very efficient as far as producing eye on wind and his particular apparatus I finally decided to do Brown&#x27;s work and and 1994 I looked at his device that I&#x27;d tried several different things and they hadn&#x27;t worked I thought well Brown is supposed to be the pioneer of this or so the people that make the claims in there that get the patents they always refer to his name so I thought I&#x27;ll go back and I&#x27;ll try to do this getting it balanced was real important his method of propulsion specifically was using the charge separation high voltage charge Separation on a vehicle he found that circular craft were better for that application than wingcraft however recently we found through Dr Paula Violet&#x27;s research that the B2 bomber actually seems to qualify as an electroborvita craft and the military has admitted that it electrically charges the forward Leading Edge of the Wings there&#x27;s also a very high dielectric being used depleted uranium is used on the forward edge of the Wings and whether or not there are other applications for that technology in that design we&#x27;re recognizing that because the exhaust gas is also negatively ionized that all of a sudden we have the high voltage charge separation that&#x27;s necessary to provide an extra propulsive Force especially at high velocities so electrogravity in that aspect has a very simple process but does provide a good amount of force for a very small amount of energy input as with many other promising inventions developed during the Cold War years the national secrecy act prevented scientists like t-towns and Brown from commercializing or even publicizing any technology which could potentially be interpreted as having a military application foreign</p>
