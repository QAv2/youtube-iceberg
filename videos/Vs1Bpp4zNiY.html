            <p>A severely crippling assumption made for good reason by Albert Einstein on general relativity and the irony of all ironies for the rest of his life. Einstein was in a vain and desperate search trying to find out how in the world to get electromagnetics back in there and he never succeeded. not realizing that that little bitty assumption meant you could never do it. If he had changed that one single assumption, he had it all. And if he had studied Maxwell&#x27;s original quatronian theory, he would probably have not made the assumption.</p>
