            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Dr ning Lee a brilliant physicist was known for her work on anti-gravity theory in a series of research papers co-authored with a fellow physicist Douglas tour between 1991 and 1993 she claimed to have discovered a way to manipulate gravity using superconductors she claimed that an anti-gravity effect could be produced by rotating ions creating a gravito magnetic field perpendicular to their spin axis in 1999 she left the University of Alabama to start her own company interestingly her company named AC gravity LLC was awarded a grant of close to half a million dollars from the government in 2001 to continue anti-gravity research the grant period ended in 2002 but no results from this research were ever made public Dr Lee continued to work on her research in secrecy every day until 2014 when she was struck by a vehicle while crossing the street causing permanent brain damage she sadly passed away in 2021 at the age of 78.</p>
