            <p>we have the picture of the chandelier UFO as it&#x27;s being called but where&#x27;s the video I will say this is that there is more footage so some people got to see portions of it within the intelligence Community there is a bigger story to tell the object did go into the water for 17 minutes and then it did come out and shoot off at an extraordinary speed wait are you talking about the jellyfish UFO or the chandelier UFO let&#x27;s separate the two for your audience so what we are calling the jellyfish UFO is a strange morphology I mean looks like a jellyfish and because it went in the water we dubbed it that some people called it the spaghetti monster and that&#x27;s awesome but the other one that the chandelier it&#x27;s because if you look at it from the bottom it looks like a chandelier they&#x27;re two separate events military filmed footage of designated UAP by our intelligence agency so I&#x27;m talking about the jellyfish UFO is the one that actually showed trans medium capability it did go into the water for 17 minutes did come up and shoot off at an extraordinary speed</p>
