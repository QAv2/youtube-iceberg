            <p>) &gt;&gt;&gt; FORMER SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID THINKS IT IS TIME FOR THE PENTAGON TO OPEN UP ITS SECRET UFO FILES.  ((DENISE VALDEZ))  &gt;&gt; THE LONGTIME NEVADA LAWMAKER ADMITS HE SPONSORED A SECRET STUDY THAT WAS  COORDINATED BY A LAS VEGAS CONTRACTOR.  BUT VERY LITTLE OF WHAT WAS  PRODUCED BY THE STUDY HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC. ((BRIAN LOFTUS)) &gt;&gt; SO, WHAT&#x27;S HIDING IN THOSE  FILES AND WHEN DO WE GET TO SEE  THEM?  GEORGE KNAPP IS HERE WITH A  PREVIEW OF HIS REPORT. ((GEORGE KNAPP)) FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, THE PUBLIC HAS HEARD ABOUT THE SECRET STUDY INITIATED BY SENATOR HARRY REID  AND OTHER LAWMAKERS.</p>
<p>THE  STUDY CONTINUED FOR YEARS, BUT WHATEVER FILES OR REPORTS IT CREATED, VERY LITTLE OF THE  MATERIAL HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC. AS THE I-TEAM FIRST REPORTED,  THE COMPANY WHICH LANDED THE CONTRACT FOR THE PROGRAM WAS A SUBSIDIARY OF BIGELOW AEROSPACE  BASED HERE.  THE PENTAGON AND THE DEFENCE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY HAVE CONFIRMED THE PROGRAM WAS REAL,  AND WE KNOW IT STUDIED ANOMALOUS AERIAL ENCOUNTERS, SUCH AS THE NOW-FAMOUS TIC TAC INCIDENT FROM 2004, BUT THE  DEFENSE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID IT KNOWS OF ONLY 38 UNCLASSIFIED REPORTS THAT WERE PRODUCED...38 PAPERS TOTAL THE I-TEAM HAS CONFIRMED, BEYOND ANY QUESTION, THAT THE STUDY PUT TOGETHER A HUGE UFO DATA BASE  WITH MATERIALS AND EVIDENCE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.  SO WHAT ELSE IS IN THE FILES?  ((GEORGE KNAPP:  THE PENTAGON HAS FILES. MORE FILES, COMPILED IN YOUR STUDY.</p>
<p>DID YOU READ IT? ARE YOU AWARE OF HOW DEEP IT GOES AND WHAT&#x27;S IN IT? HARRY REID-FORMER  SENATOR: I DIDN;T READ ALL OF  IT.  MY STAFF DID AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH MY STAFF GOING OVER THAT. IT WAS QUITE A LOT OF  MATERIAL, SO FOR ME TO TELL YOU  I READ EVERY WORD OF IT, IF  SOMEBODY SAW THAT STACK OF PAPER, WELL I&#x27;M NOT SURE HE&#x27;S  GOING TO LINK  THROUGH IT, SO TRUTHFULLY I HAD  TWO  STAFF PEOPLE WHO WORKED THIS ISSUE AL OT  AND WE SPEJNT A LOT OF TIME  TOGETHER.  GEORGE KNAPP: WHAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU? IS THERE SUBSTANTIAL  DOCUMENTATION? REID: IN MY OPINION, THIS  IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE  STUDYING AND AS I  SAID, THIS IS A WORLDWIDE  PHENOMENON.  IT&#x27;S NOT JUST HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p> )) ((GEORGE KNAPP)) ONE FOCUS OF THE STUDY, REID SAYS, WAS A RANCH IN UTAH KNOWN  AS THE SITE OF UNUSUAL ACTIVITY FOR MANY YEARS.  ANOTHER FOCUS WAS THE  APPEARNACE OF UNKNOWN AIRCRAFT OVER NUCLEAR MISSILE BASES AND OTHER CLASSIFIED MILITARY  LOCATIONS AND UNITS. ((GEORGE KNAPP)) TONIGHT AT 11 PM, THE  SENATOR--AND OTHERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM--WILL  GIVE A BROADER VIEW OF WHAT ELSE WAS STUDIED. AND WE WILL HEAR OPINIONS ABOUT  WHETHER THIS MATERIAL IS EVER  GOING TO BE RELEASED TO THE  PUBLIC.  ((DENISE VALDEZ))  &gt;&gt;&gt; STILL AHEAD ON THE VALLEY&#x27;S NEWS LEADER...</p>
