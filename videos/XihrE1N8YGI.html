            <p>hello everyone is Jamal Thomas welcome to the progressive soapbox so let&#x27;s settle for 20 I&#x27;m getting slightly tired so I want to have this now my while I&#x27;m still conscious as I still have to be able to do a show whether or not let&#x27;s turn up so blaze what have you done and allow yourself for the moment to exist in that space where nothing is real everything is true nothing is true and everything is real vice versa just ambigú ambiguity this thing of not knowing that being certain of what&#x27;s real what&#x27;s true and I mean exists in that space it&#x27;s uncomfortable it&#x27;s not necessarily the easiest thing to do there just kind of go in just think of I actually don&#x27;t know X or Y but it&#x27;s the most honest place that you could be particularly you&#x27;re dealing with stuff like this like the UFO stuff this video it&#x27;s going to be somewhat of a distillation of new information that&#x27;s going to be coming out in 2018 what they already know up to this point and more information on the palette who&#x27;s flying that plane meaning the video that people see the people keep saying like oh dude that&#x27;s just the video I miss it&#x27;s not that that important I&#x27;m gonna have the physicist who&#x27;s working on the campaign on Mac campaign who&#x27;s working with Tom DeLonge how put off how put off is just [ __ ] amazing in and of himself explain why that video is so [ __ ] up it and beyond their video being really [ __ ] epic cuz they have radar coverage and everything else associated with it whether things one side and then and split second it&#x27;s somewhere else on the radar like oh my god had [ __ ] there to do that but beyond the picture by on the awesomeness of that particular thing the palette who was out there meaning the person who was actually in the jet that was going out to meet that particular plane or that particular craft if the pilot was flying against now for those who don&#x27;t know just to do a little quick run through the surrogates lo all over the places ish rock star Tom DeLonge from the blue singer of blink-182 had a UFO fetish and being somewhat of a rock star being have a certain amount of popularity he ingratiated himself to all of these people who had anything to do or potentially with your thoughts meaning one contact after the next leads them to one military official at the next did John Podesta to people who are in government people thought Tom DeLonge was full of it if that was full of it come to find out after WikiLeaks released all the information you found that at Tom DeLonge was actually dealing with these people for real maybe the emails had Tom DeLonge on it sitting right beside John Podesta sitting right beside Edgar Mitchell he actually had the contacts that he said he had Tom DeLonge comes out and says we&#x27;re gonna be releasing certain amount of information it took a few years but Tom DeLonge actually got that information released and on the front page of the New York Times they&#x27;re showing that the United States to Pentagon was working on a black budget project the track unidentified aerial phenomena UFOs we don&#x27;t know what those aircraft are we want to know what those aircraft are and not just know what they are we want to be able to replicate the technology that we&#x27;re saying meaning confirming a that it exists and be after the confirmation that it exists it&#x27;s well wait a minute how do they do what they do what are we missing in our understanding of the world in physics in reality that allows them to do that when we can&#x27;t understand how they pull that off it opens up a new area in the dimension of questions I mean this is [ __ ] amazing topic so this is out New York Times political washington post&#x27;s owen networks i myslexia and MSNBC all of the people who are associated with out front center and it&#x27;s confirming to the audience that yes this is what took place now they made it as if this was just kind of spur the moment none of this soft spur of the moment itself had been planned for like a year before they released the information people who were affiliated with it or who had contacts that was associated with it knew this information was coming up he knew it was coming up but whatever the guy who was running the pressure Alejandro Alejandro quit his job and when he quit his job he came on he gave interview saying yes based on the scientific data based on the instruments based on scientific method I believe that we were being visited by something else now Lou Alejandro would only give so much information because lil Hendra didn&#x27;t want to go to prison for breaking some kind of security clearance but that being said he quit his job and went to work for Tom DeLonge the rock star from blink 182 that was instrumental in getting this information out in the first place somehow they secured the release of that video meaning actual video footage showing what this guy&#x27;s name in the radar showing the plane and showing the pallet himself and giving actual testimony so it&#x27;s one thing to say oh do that video I mean that&#x27;s not enough for me it&#x27;s another thing to have a conversation with a pallet what are you gonna say the pallet is also lying what would be his motivation will be his motivation and my knee this is not the only person when Britain opened their files or when France opened their files there were pallets who are talking just like this guy having similar conversations of being diverted is to go to these crafts that they had no idea what these things were doing didn&#x27;t understand phenomena they knew there was something in the sky it&#x27;s not us and we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the capability of people in other countries so imma listen to this guy i&#x27;ma play this guy&#x27;s testimony the pallet himself listen what he&#x27;s saying now the reporter who&#x27;s asking them questions on this they&#x27;ve been somewhat flabbergasted he they&#x27;re the most unimaginative people then I think I&#x27;ve ever gone across in my life like think of the level of unimaginative a topic and you&#x27;re like oh aliens I mean you&#x27;re acting as if we&#x27;re like a ball hurling through space and that we exists on a particular planet I mean you&#x27;re acting cos of things can exist on other planets I mean how crazy is that that&#x27;s crazy believes that that can be life on other planets just like there&#x27;s life on this plate the question is always can they get here and the government has assiduously done two things lied about it and leaked information about it that&#x27;s weird too step of here&#x27;s certain documents here certain releases here certain files here&#x27;s working with certain agencies or certain certain organizations like for movies and print and so forth to get certain stories out certain information into the public consciousness now I I I subscribe to that belief because it does seem like there was this kind of saturation with this stuff into the public or this feeling of the public will lose its mind if you release this information at once you need to acclimate the public to what&#x27;s going on so Tom DeLonge Rockstar UFO enthusiasts secure the release of this stuff has a company called to the Stars Academy they do it&#x27;s like films print media aerospace and science they have another guy with Bob Bigelow Bigelow was the company that was working with Harry Reid with this particular project looking at this particular aircraft the phenomena that they were experiencing trying to replicate the technology now Bigelow is also a UFO guy on the on the front of his company there&#x27;s like a picture of a grey alien so all of these people have those iasts all these people in the fields all these people are successful within our own context and they have pushed and bitched and tugged and finally got this information out into the public in a way that you&#x27;re forced to deal with and deal with it in a legit way not the cartoonish way that these guys sometimes do in a legit way this is a military thing where the Pentagon has didn&#x27;t officially release it but this is a Pentagon video a security yeah I want him to talk about this but I also want he&#x27;ll put off to explain why this video is [ __ ] amazing and why this video matters and why this is one of the most like smoking gun cases that you would see up to this point never watch the UFO thing where you can say this is official we have a track record of this particular video we know this video came from we had people who can witness X Y Z so a cig listen to this palette explain what it was like to be in the sky given the order to divert to actually go and track this thing down he&#x27;s amazingly outmatched out front tonight a stunning claim for the man who ran the Defense Department&#x27;s multi-million dollar UFO program a top-secret operation that was for years dedicated to yes investigating UFO sightings Aaron spoke to him and when asked does he believe there is alien life out there this was his response my personal belief is that there is very compelling evidence so that we we may not be alone now this video you are seeing here is presented as possible evidence it was captured by a US Navy fighter jet in 2004 off the coast of California if you look closely it appears to show a widest Riteish oval object about the size of a commercial airplane hovering over the ocean what is it exactly OUTFRONT now the man who witnessed this object he&#x27;s a retired US Navy pilot commander David flavor thanks very much for joining us tonight thanks Jim thanks for having me commander you were in the cockpit there explained to us exactly wait a minute if they&#x27;re trying to pull a fast one this guy looks like a robot he&#x27;s just I don&#x27;t be the Joker he&#x27;s like come on calm relax relax I understand you had a stressful job you&#x27;re chasing aliens but relax you&#x27;re okay let&#x27;s see if he calms down just have a chip at em is it so wrong see what you saw yeah when we there was two of us two airplanes four people we had f-18s we had got vectored out to the west after they terminated a training exercise to investigate an object the way notice the blue on this this is heat coming off of the object the object is radiating something it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s producing some kind of field or something that&#x27;s being radiated that&#x27;s showing up this is kind of hue or blow around the object itself when we arrived the the cruiser with the aegis system call told us it was merged plot which means they couldn&#x27;t break us out from the blip we started looking around as we both looked at the right side of our airplane we saw a disturbance in the water ie like a sea mount where the waves are breaking over the top so white water and a white object oblong pointing north moving radically left-right north-south up down all around as we started a clockwise flow around the disturbance watching it I decided that I would go lower and the other jet stayed high to observe both of us as I got to about the 12 o&#x27;clock position the object started to myris so now we&#x27;re both in a clockwise flow opposite circles the object is lower than me I&#x27;m above him and I&#x27;m looking at him with my eyes we get all the way around the circle as I&#x27;m descending so now there&#x27;s probably about maybe a two to three thousand foot difference between us in vertical and I&#x27;m at about the eight o&#x27;clock position and the other and the tic-tac is at about two I cut across the circle so across the middle and as I got close to it probably within a mile to a half mile it rapidly rapidly accelerated to the south and disappeared in less than two seconds so then we turn back around go ahead go go ahead it&#x27;s I guess you&#x27;re an experienced pilot you&#x27;ve been up in the air a lot I&#x27;m imagine you&#x27;ve seen a lot of things in the sky what was it about the movement of this or the appearance of this that made you believe it wasn&#x27;t from this world as opposed to something else well the first thing is it had no wings so you think something else like what something else like what mate what do you think it&#x27;s a bird I mean come on what do you see what the [ __ ] else will be up there like this is such an insane perspective of us what do you think that these pallets who are trained Fowler&#x27;s who&#x27;ve been doing the spheres they observe an object it&#x27;s not a bird it&#x27;s not a pterodactyl it&#x27;s not an asteroid it&#x27;s something that is moving pretty much in every direction the way he described this up-down left-right verda well all over the place and in an instant mirroring their position for one thing meaning intelligent control in the way that the thing was going and it takes off in an instant his plane was massively outmatched in every situation then think and move anyway it wanted to did he have wings the vein could go up down left right it free roam of space apparently the accelerations that would have normally killed a human being in no way affected them for whatever their means of propulsion they weren&#x27;t using you know air currents so the plane was completely outmatched he&#x27;s saying this thing Miriam as if there&#x27;s another intelligence that&#x27;s actually doing the same thing that he&#x27;s doing this kind of communication between you know whoever&#x27;s in those things and it Jets off that&#x27;s a journalist that&#x27;s a TV journalists too talking it does he believe that that was a bird does he believe that the palette in this particular jet couldn&#x27;t make a distinction between a pterodactyl and another craft that is outperforming his craft I&#x27;m sorry I am giving this guy a hard time but this is just a dumbass question I mean do you really think it was me I asked this guy what else is up there give me another suggestion on what it could be and I I think you will quickly come to some suggestion either it&#x27;s us or it&#x27;s an animal and we are animals but I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s us or some other animal I don&#x27;t know what animal is doing those type of maneuvers I don&#x27;t know what other animal has some ability to go that fast I don&#x27;t know what other country has aircraft or military tech to be that degree like this is something that&#x27;s beyond us now I&#x27;m not saying that the military doesn&#x27;t have some black budget project where they&#x27;ve been experimenting with you know anti-gravity or some kind of magnetic flight pattern or whatever some kind of fantastic ship that they&#x27;ve been experimenting with I don&#x27;t doubt that at the end of the day though regardless there are some other intelligence be it black ops in some way or something else and that thing is mirroring and speeding off in ways that we could not comprehend and I understand what I&#x27;m saying when I&#x27;m trying to put the gravity on that cannot comprehend the speed that the thing went would have killed any normal person let&#x27;s keep going I mean it&#x27;s so far beyond anything that we&#x27;re doing they&#x27;re not even using air currents in the way that they&#x27;re flying we use a trick of technology in order for our planes still go what if you&#x27;re not using air what if you&#x27;re you don&#x27;t care what the air currents I mean you don&#x27;t need to create a plane that has a wingspan and all this other stuff what if you&#x27;re using some other force that allows you to propel your ship either you know and the speeds that they&#x27;re going maybe it&#x27;s not really speed that they&#x27;re going maybe they&#x27;re jumping like phasing in some way like popping from one spot to the next maybe do some other intermediary the reason why the ships may go that way is problem I mean there&#x27;s also some reasons why they should go that way I&#x27;m just saying the technology that they&#x27;re using in that ship far out surpasses anything that we have currently at least anything that&#x27;s known this Navy pal that is giving that testimony either this guy this TV journalist talking it if he believes that this guy is completely incompetent and he doesn&#x27;t necessarily can&#x27;t make a distinction between what he believes is us versus something else that&#x27;s not us meaning of this world and again I ask the question if it&#x27;s not another craft what the [ __ ] this is the journalists think it is you may suggestion otherwise this sounds like a ridiculous question I&#x27;m putting too much emphasis on this I don&#x27;t like the UM I don&#x27;t like the spin that he&#x27;s putting on that question if that makes sense though or the they call it the English like if you&#x27;re playing pool looks like you putting English on the bar feel like he&#x27;s putting a bit of English on the way that he&#x27;s doing that question I I don&#x27;t particularly like and I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s annoying me about it it&#x27;s he&#x27;s like incredulous like I&#x27;m sure there was like the [ __ ] else do you think it is it&#x27;s not a satellite it&#x27;s not a satellite the what else do you think is up there I don&#x27;t know all of the things that this guy believes are enough skies so let&#x27;s keep going this is almost finished Hank okay it&#x27;s a helicopter well there&#x27;s no rotor wash in the water there&#x27;s no rotors and when helicopters move to us side to side they kind of slow and then they pick up speed going the other way this was extremely abrupt like a ping-pong ball bouncing off a wall it would hit and go the other way and change directions at will and then the the ability to hover over the water and then start a vertical climb from basically zero up towards about 12,000 feet and then accelerate in less than two seconds and disappear is something I had never seen in my life then Alice I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve spoken to people you told the story to some people who react with with skepticism shake their heads a bit what do you say to people who but it means skepticism what do you mean skeptic like I&#x27;m always blown away at skeptics like there&#x27;s some people who they could see a UFO themselves and they would say yeah I&#x27;m hallucinating it&#x27;s like my worldview is so limited and so tiny this is my little box and I have no way any capacity whatsoever to understand the things outside of my little tiny little my intellectual box we&#x27;re at ball floating through [ __ ] space yes it is very possible to believe that there are other beings out there that could surpass us in technology I don&#x27;t understand why we have this human centric view of the universe as if you know we&#x27;re the only one every degree that we&#x27;ve had any change in our perception of us versus the world meaning earth is everything revolves around Earth then oh we revolve around the Sun then oh that&#x27;s part of another larger galaxy it&#x27;s the diminishing of the human being as we learn more about our natural world this will be no different of course if you had other races that function in other ways there&#x27;s gonna be some percentage somewhere in this vastness of the universe that masters certain abilities and those abilities will look at magic to us just from the degree of technological difference now in this case this is not magic this is technology you have a ship that ship is just doing fantastic [ __ ] things they&#x27;re just using some propulsion system then we don&#x27;t particularly understand and don&#x27;t know but how can you be skeptical how like like this guy is telling you I myself was in that jet observing this particular object as this object did magnificent [ __ ] things and there was another pallet who is in that jet ASUS object big magnificent [ __ ] things and the radar tech observed this object as a dig medic magnificent [ __ ] things where&#x27;s the skepticism and I gotta be honest if at that point you&#x27;re still skeptical that you just don&#x27;t want to believe like that that goes to this level of you just are so against a particular point of view the evidence itself there&#x27;s no weight of evidence that could ever sway somebody&#x27;s opinion this is somebody first person contact coming from the United States military saying yes that was me in that jet observing that particular thing with my own eyes and a thing did fantastic things I&#x27;m annoyed by this guy&#x27;s questions I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t like this guy and I understand that for how many other years this topic had been looked at with a certain amount of ridicule and so there&#x27;s that Englishness associated with it but but [ __ ] the ridicule I mean these people have been screaming that this stuff was real and existed for 50 60 70 years and yeah there was somewhat of a campaign to rid of you those people as they were saying that this stuff existed and this stuff was going on this guy asking questions like oh what about the skeptics I mean what are the skeptics gonna say this is not Bob tow Tom that John you know talked to sue this is I myself with video footage to show what I myself was doing in my myself was interacting with her paper trail going back to the u.s. Pentagon saying that this video is legitimate in this video Darrell where&#x27;s the skeptics explain to me your skepticism explain now you could say this is an American jet you could say that this is some other technology fair enough but at the very least let&#x27;s acknowledge that there was something up there doing magnificent [ __ ] things that did not belong to us and that that pallets saw so if you&#x27;re looking for confirmation you&#x27;ve just had confirmation well I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s easy to doubt what we can&#x27;t explain but when you actually see things and this is not the first account of someone seeing a UFO but in this situation you&#x27;re talking about four people although all eyeballs on ranging an experience from relatively new and a fleet squadron which is vfa 41 to myself we had over 16 years of flying and well over 3,500 hours non-stop so I would argue that it wasn&#x27;t a weather balloon it wasn&#x27;t a flare it was it was an actual object that we tracked we&#x27;ve looked at for somewhere around five minutes before it rapidly accelerated now the Defense Department analyzed this video did they take it seriously did they come to any conclusion well you can&#x27;t really discern what it is until there&#x27;s a couple of shots when you when it gets close there&#x27;s a couple of objects coming out of the bottom but you can estimate on how fast it leaves the side of that screen and the width and and you know you&#x27;d have to ask exactly based on the field of view what they would estimate that is but when it leaves a screen on a video it&#x27;s moving pretty fast commander framework from the stand still that&#x27;s another guy who&#x27;s come out saying yes we&#x27;re being visited based on scientific data and [ __ ] that that&#x27;s not even sighs that&#x27;s him looking at the [ __ ] object I&#x27;m seeing an object in the sky is I&#x27;m flying through the sky in this military jet that they&#x27;ve invested X number of 16 years into my training and everything else him with my experience yes we were flying with something that we&#x27;re completely outmatched we have no idea how they did what they did with that particular object how put off is one of the physicists EDM&#x27;s working with Tom DeLonge put off is a magnificent [ __ ] guy put off as one of those guys as soon as God mr. like consciousness research going with the thing of remote viewing one of the things that he was working on with Ingo Swann Engels [ __ ] man that&#x27;s a whole show by itself remote viewing it so one of the other things as skeptics get wrong on this is is how reality is structured now what I mean by that is you could have like the double slit experiment where particle versus wave duality where this thing exhibits attributes of a particle versus a wave depending upon whether Nath person is looking at which item that the proton for the electron goes through what the experiment kind of shows or what the experiment gets across is that there&#x27;s this decision that&#x27;s made at some point but that stuff becomes what we consider to be physical matter reality is it there before you look at it meaning is the screen render if I leave my house and there&#x27;s nobody observing my house is my house actually there or is my house only there when I observe my house is being there this kind of interesting thing that reality or the way were structured meaning this isn&#x27;t necessarily as physical as people like to make this is gonna be even though that is the way you would perceive our particular reality how put off and some of these other experiments the SCI research experiments which show consciousness interacting with physical matter using kind of statistical models and stuff like that but some of the stuff videos long [ __ ] fantastic the US military came to how put off because the Soviets were investing a lot of mine into SCI research the united states government wanted to know is there anything to this like like these guys are dumping a bunch of money the soviets don&#x27;t but a bunch of money into the psychic stuff is there anything to this we need you to study an experiment with this you had a little bit of experience in one of the other projects that you did we liked that project that you did so yeah we want you to experiment with us Ingle swine being the test subject and the united states military came up with remote viewing they will put a guy in a room that particular person in a room comes up with information pertaining to a particular target even though they don&#x27;t even tell you what the target is they might give him four numbers five six eight nine two and that number will correspond to something else somewhere else file somewhere maybe what thing under truck but what they found was that the person is somehow still connected to everything else around him and when that person clears his mind and that person kind of taps into something he has access he gets fleeting glimpses of what those things are even those own physical senses you experience your world through your physical senses so the only way you would be able to process the world is still your physical senses even if you&#x27;re getting information that&#x27;s not coming from me and physical senses you still experiences as if they were coming from you said if that makes sense so remote viewing for example i um i like to try this stuff cuz this one thing to believe is another thing to see if it works or not i spent several months doing the remote viewing stuff i honestly just wanted to see does this [ __ ] work are they bushing are you [ __ ] around I mean they were doing this stuff for 30-40 years so they had that program going it works I&#x27;m gonna show in a mine so one of the RV sessions that I did a while back there&#x27;s this thing called cold monkey that would give you numbers and after you do the the particular thing you do your session and after your session you can see what it was you know so it&#x27;s like five six eight nine - you do your session and then you go to code monkey you hit the button and it shows a picture of something and maybe you know Niagara Falls you maybe satellite B whatever but you don&#x27;t know what it is in events you only know what it is after the fact that&#x27;s the important part you get a number the only thing you have is that number and you come up with information now this takes a bit of meditation and all this other stuff but ultimately once you get yourself in this kind of Zen state and you hurt you start getting sensations in my case this was my target so this is a picture yeah I don&#x27;t know what this material is in advance but this is a picture the session that I got was image of a wall dirty white stucco protrusions the regular shape peaks and valleys and the walls of materials light emitting object oh yeah I had this impression of thinking it&#x27;s like a color trying to get a color across Hamo sounds like a machine let&#x27;s see now the wild part about this is yeah that does it is uneven it is valleys it is this kind of stucco material I couldn&#x27;t say this is Nagre Falls what I can do is describe what that thing actually is what it sounds like and those that were you&#x27;re processing the experiences yeah this one was actually pretty decent but I didn&#x27;t get the impression of like a waterfall or falling water or anything like that the thing for me was when I didn&#x27;t do multiple sessions like you&#x27;re supposed to do like multiple sessions throughout the course of the day and because I am impatient I kind of cut corners but that being said that I wasn&#x27;t necessarily trying to be from overview my goal and this will see if it worked and yeah that&#x27;s pretty damn accurate it&#x27;s pretty damn close for somebody who&#x27;s only been doing it for several months so yes there are people out there who can do this an amazing way which to train but you didn&#x27;t think this government to do it and who to this day still do sessions now how put off is one of the guys who was helping Engle swine and come up with the scientific like the protocols for the remote viewing thing I&#x27;m gonna let him talk about what the military pilot just said he gives a little bit more information as to why this case was [ __ ] awesome now I would argue the case is [ __ ] awesome just from the standpoint of even just what the palette said if you had nothing else he had a navy palette saying yeah I was in dolphin it wasn&#x27;t a dogfight but I was up there I was looking at a lien in his eyes or whoever was in a craft in their eyes and I was flying it we observe the object five minutes that by itself is a bombshell in this case you have the video and you have multiple people who witness this particular thing meaning if it&#x27;s a cover-up you have a lot of people who are lying all at the exact same time for unknown reasons this output off this is coast to coast one of my subscribers sent this good lookin out appreciate it since in an email this is what George Knapp help with all fray he is going to talk about what&#x27;s upcoming in regards to the information that&#x27;s being released by Tom DeLonge in addition to talking about this particular case the Nimitz case the the case that I just showed with these pallets flying with the object that case is not contested meaning some people have the raised issues with the first or with one of the other videos but this video is uncontested what the guys saying is accurate what the guys saying is true this is literal confirmation of a pallet engaging something that it&#x27;s not of this planet when they say something or the word release is not within our know-how and say that way not with our knowledge base Matt with the common knowledge space let&#x27;s say that way because there is a chance that there&#x27;s some black budget project somewhere they had some kind of craft that&#x27;s doing amazing [ __ ] things that&#x27;s fair enough that is possible that is possible I gotta be honest I&#x27;m biased towards the ileum no so let&#x27;s listen to help put off you&#x27;re welcome happen to be here alright and coming up next dr. Hal put off from the Institute of Advanced Studies we&#x27;re gonna drill down a little bit into the USS nimitz video that so many people have seen and other aspects of the pentagon UFO study much more to come here on coast to coast am you know back in October the world was sort of stunned to see these two UFO videos recorded by the Pentagon or it came out of the Pentagon whether it&#x27;s an official release or not is somewhat in question it certainly is official video and that it was recorded by the US military one of those UFO videos the so-called tick-tack UFO was recorded by warplanes attached to the USS nimitz group off the coast of southern california the other UFO video the so called gimbal video is of unknown origin I think a lot of people have assumed it had something to do with the USS nimitz and was recorded by the same outfit it was not in this hour we&#x27;re going to get down to the bottom line on those two videos with someone who has analyzed them who has seen them in and out and who knows what they mean and what they don&#x27;t mean his name is dr. Hal put off the director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Austin his research interests range from theoretical studies of gravitation cosmology energy research he was with Stanford Research International has worked for the National Security Agency as a consultant the CIA and studying remote viewing works with NASA and it&#x27;s breakthrough propulsion Physics Initiative as I mentioned in the first hour he was also involved with the National Institute for discovery science and with bass and was a consultant to the atyp Pentagon UFO study he is now with the to the stars Academy that was founded by Tom DeLonge and dr.</p>
<p>put-off joins us in just a moment stick around well I&#x27;ve been waiting for this for a long time doctor help would&#x27;ve well welcome to coast-to-coast George it&#x27;s a pleasure to be here you know I read off just a little synopsis of your background you are you know you have such solid scientific credentials you&#x27;re considered a brilliant guy by colleagues all over the world you published all these papers I think you&#x27;ve been nominated for a Nobel Prize at least twice and yet you you sort of risk it all in the pursuit of what some would call fringe topics crazy subjects give me some kind of an idea about how you got to this point that you would be associated with folks chasing UFOs well certainly it was kind of a squirrely path to get from there to here but anyway as part of my work at Stanford I worked on lasers and quantum electronics and so on even co-authored a textbook that was published in English Russian and French and Chinese so I here I&#x27;d launched my really terrific career in lasers and quantum electronics but it turned out that as part of my graduate school I had a stint as a naval secured as a naval intelligence officer with the National Security Agency and so it turns out that plays a key hero later and so eventually when I left Stanford University and with the SRR international to do laser research and so on it turned out that just on a lark I ended up doing a little ESP or PK experiment with English wands a very talented kind of guy and I distributed that around and pretty soon the CIA landed on my doorstep and turned out that they were concerned that the Russians were putting millions of dollars for over a decade into the area of ESP research those scientists in America even thought there was such a thing and they looked into my background so I had all these security clearance at NSA I was at SR I that had lots of black programs anyway and I was a hard scientists physicists and that&#x27;s what they thought they needed would I mind taking a look to see if there&#x27;s anything to this stuff and actually the truth of matter is they were hoping that I would basically find out it&#x27;s all nonsense so they didn&#x27;t have to worry about it and they could close the books well as your listeners would know that eventually turned into a twenty year twenty million dollar project program known popularly toward the end as projects could Stargate it by the way I would say looking in fact there the Stargate is somewhat unfortunate name for that but the remote viewing thing was fascinating it&#x27;s like some of the tests that they were putting out put off through the move I mean putting in eagle Swan through man who stare at goats was base to some degree loosely on what he&#x27;s talking about right here the way the military was using remote viewers for the project they&#x27;ll train him and we use them to essentially do spy it was their secret psychic spies Engle swine is [ __ ] amazing that he was just a naturally gifted psychic in general but as they were creating these scientific protocols they were coming up with these ways of testing him to figuring out what are the limits what are the things you can do Ingo Swann talks about this case where somebody some shadowy figure named axel right it&#x27;s [ __ ] amazing it probably shouldn&#x27;t do this in this video but a shadowy figure named axel Axelrod gives Ingo Swann let&#x27;s put something that&#x27;s death saying look maybe you get to the point of having like 80 or 90 percent accuracy call me or put this in your desk like write a letter on your desk and put it in your desk and we&#x27;ll find it and we&#x27;ll get back to you so English why did this now I forget how he exactly met Axelrod we met Alex right after I&#x27;ve made some impression on him some shadowy government organization Ingo Swann puts the thing in his desk and acts where I meets him again there in a store and Axelrod says hey you see that woman over there he says yeah he says you feel anything weird about that particular woman or about anybody in the store and Ingo is slightly freaked out by one of the people because actually knows who he&#x27;s talking about he&#x27;s he&#x27;s somewhat disturbed by the woman who&#x27;s there now Axelrod may point to Ingo that she&#x27;s not one of us she&#x27;s something fundamentally different and this thing that Ingo was picking up on the fact that this particular person was something different Axelrod takes Ingo Swan to someplace where they duck down he says look there&#x27;s gonna be a sighting here and sure enough Engel says there was a site and they were ducking down as the ship was there and he was like you know you know keep your mouth shut and be quiet don&#x27;t let anybody hear all this type of stuff this is cloak-and-dagger stuff one of the things that he remote viewing said there was an alien base on the moon he said there were rings around Jupiter which turned out to be true by the way the rings around Jupiter nobody knew that and he was [ __ ] amazing ankles amazing he died I think it was a couple of years ago but he wrote all of these books some of the weirdest books like that weird I don&#x27;t say they weird but he writing books on consciousness and how we interpret the way reality is like through reality boxes like how yeah you&#x27;re workable point of view of the world the way you see the world is kind of your universe your world itself that universe is going to be somewhat different than the way I see the world in which cases we&#x27;re living in two different worlds that&#x27;s your reality box yeah he had multiple books and some of those books were more difficult to read than others but engels awesome let&#x27;s let&#x27;s continue look at how put off the information one stanford research institute pear labs is another one that&#x27;s gotten to size studies Princeton pear labs is in Princeton Stanford Research Institute is of course at Stanford that&#x27;s and by the way people will say well where&#x27;s the proof where&#x27;s the proof the evidence is there for the SCI researcher stuff they just don&#x27;t look for the evidence they have a pre conceived of the way the universe works well this is physical matter reality everything is physical I mean clearly I can feel myself that&#x27;s just the way it is and it&#x27;s like no just because you perceive it in particular way doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s that way and fact is we don&#x27;t know enough about the world in the universe itself to say the consciousness doesn&#x27;t play a role in it and thus I research kind of gets across oh yeah consciousness plays a role in this question becomes what is that role what is the extent of that role what does that mean for us as human beings what does it mean for us and the way that we interact with each other in the physical world the research is interesting I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it uses statistical models to come up with like predictability and how often something should come up the remote viewing one was also interesting because I was something that they could train to multiple people so like pet price Joe McNally McNally go I&#x27;m murdering his name oh that guy&#x27;s awesome with really good yeah you have a lot of them and some of these guys actually still do the remote beyond so let&#x27;s keep on and so it was in that process of doing those experiments that I began to realize there&#x27;s a lot more to our scientific or world views and we usually easily give it credit for and I&#x27;d have to admit that even throughout that program every time I would go in to do an experiment of the remote viewing type as we called it I would ask myself what am I doing here I&#x27;m a physicist this can&#x27;t possibly work and then we get another terrific result so based on that I just got gleaned I guess you&#x27;d say by by by the situation and so even when I left the SSRI to take up being president CEO of Earth Day International with this academic harm is to transpose it Austin I was basically greens to these kinds of things and so when John Alexander for example came along and asked me to join his UFO working group I did do that and through the connection with John I ended up being on the science advisory board of Robert Bigelow&#x27;s knids National Institute for discovery science that you covered pretty thoroughly in the first hour and so of course as part of that I saw many things and the truth matter is most of them we never did get to a point that we could explain and so it was along this period that as it turns out people at DIA is analyst at DIA decided that they wanted to investigate the kind of stuff that was happening on the ranch but primarily really the the UFO aspect and so they approached Senator Reid and he thought it was a good idea and collected his other to Senator colleagues Stephens from Alaska and then anyway from ye ye and they&#x27;re there they&#x27;re all part of the special access program black money kinds of research and so I was asked because I was already known to Bob Bigelow if I would help respond to the request now a lot of a lot of people say okay well this is just some kind of sweetheart deal between read and Bigelow of both things from Nevadans and so on truth the matter is there was a broad area announcement out of DIA any Aerospace Corporation could apply for the bid for the grant but it turned out that Bigelow got it and so that&#x27;s how I suddenly ended up being immersed in what we now call the HF program they have 22 million dollars over the period of time some people say it went from 2007 to 2012 some say it&#x27;s 2008 to 2011 still in Pentagon terms it&#x27;s not a lot of money is it it&#x27;s not a lot of money and usually programs that do require a lot of money are programs that have a lot of build-out of equipment or a lot of personnel and so on but basically this is an analytical group to evaluate data to collect data and evaluate it so as primarily personnel costs that went into it although it&#x27;s also true that Bigelow was asked to put some special buildings together with high security to begin to store materials that would be coming along as part of the program so but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not a lot of money I have to admit you have so you work for the NSA for a while you&#x27;re a consultant to CIA you&#x27;re with Bob Bigelow and knids and they always whenever I read Bob Bigelow&#x27;s name and some UFO publication they had touched the word shadowy to it the shadowy Bob Bigelow then you write an RFP that goes to the deal and then back in October you&#x27;re standing on a stage with Tom DeLonge and other principles of to the stars Tom of course has taken a lot of heat and lumps and and I&#x27;m just wondering that makes you part of the Cabal doesn&#x27;t it it does sound like I&#x27;m part of the Cabal doesn&#x27;t it and certainly I can actually understand how it is that your average onlooker out there in the UFO field would come to that conclusion because after all they see suddenly this collaboration emerging for a new startup the to the stars Academy of Arts and Science and involves Luis Ando who just left as being the program director of the a tip program in the Pentagon and then you&#x27;ve got Chris Mellon former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence Jim simav an who&#x27;s a high-level is it just me happened behind some slightly weird it up by the profit-making thing built into this so what he&#x27;s saying is to the Stars Academy it&#x27;s a Tom DeLonge project and the project seeks to put out movies videos and technology and research technology he&#x27;s working in collaboration with Bob Bigelow Bob Bigelow is a person who owned that tech company that was working with Harry Reid to monitor the awful stuff it feels weird to me that we&#x27;re taking capitalism even to the degree of interacting with something else the hills [ __ ] up to be a it feels dirty it feels somewhat sleazy and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not saying that what he&#x27;s doing is wrong I&#x27;m not saying that I&#x27;m not even a appreciative but you know pushing to get this out I don&#x27;t necessarily think he&#x27;s doing this purely from some capitalistic Drive but to the Stars Academy is a money-making venture I mean the goal of this profit yes they want to disclose the stuff but disclose this stuff from the standpoint if we&#x27;re gonna make a lot of money we&#x27;re gonna be making videos and movies and we&#x27;re gonna create technology and we&#x27;re gonna have it just so you know multiplier effect on some of everything he wants to be the person who&#x27;s at the beginning of that trough when something is released or some information comes out or some video he wants to be the person who&#x27;s there now to some degree it&#x27;s his company how successful this company is gonna be I have no idea but you&#x27;ve heard how portals resume you&#x27;ve heard his resume I mean these are real all right no scientists who are doing this stuff and I&#x27;m fascinated by the fact that put off as part of this because it it acknowledges something that&#x27;s true that a lot of people miss the sad phenomena the reason why put off is part of this is because of the the consciousness aspect of the project people who interact with these things when they are having them when they&#x27;re seeing stuff we&#x27;re seeing crass there&#x27;s often a consciousness owner that comes along with it what that person is interacting with something in this kind of altered state it&#x27;s some of the stuff gets a little weird but the people themselves feel like they&#x27;re getting information it feels like they know stuff stuff gets downloaded their other psychological effects like those people have well you could say it&#x27;s like like out-of-body states now if somebody experiences themselves describe stuff that resembles out-of-body States this is [ __ ] fascinating man that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying having how put off on this acknowledge is that truth it&#x27;s not just about nuts and bolts I mean it&#x27;s not just kicking the tires and saying oh this is a nice piece of machinery they&#x27;re trying to do it all and he&#x27;s trying to cover all of the bases he wants to Science and Technology he wants to ability to be able to creat those crafts and figure out how those grants works and last but not least he wants to be able to release the videos and media given his point of view of what this phenomena is he wants to put out his lens of events so I say the rest of our help it off but he has heavy weights associated with the project follow out of the video you got Steve Justice longtime program director at the skunk works and myself with decades involvement CIA dia and as a contract and so on and so I can imagine that people look at that set up and say okay this has got to be some kind of massive conspiracy this must been in the plans for forever and it&#x27;s trying to pull the American public along in some direction and concerning belief and so on since the matter is the people on this list all have had high access of course and the point is that having that high access put us in a position one by one to recognize that the subject area was not being handled as effectively and efficiently as it could that it&#x27;s all locked up in various kinds of stove-piped situations I mean just to give you a perfectly example these videos that have come out where everyone is looking at them okay he&#x27;s using jargon so my stovepipe what he means is um think of the picture of a cell fight it discloses straight-up there&#x27;s certain people who were in the know meeting you know Bob Tom Susie he&#x27;s so forth those people are you know everybody else is outside of the know they have no idea what we were doing in this particular capacity and people is only need-to-know basis your boss may be the head of that particular division of that particular unit your boss may know nothing about the project get your work you know and dependent upon how that thing is constructed that&#x27;s keep lying I&#x27;m gonna let him explain I just want to explain what he meant back stovetop it&#x27;s this difference between something that&#x27;s shared with others or something that&#x27;s are exposed to more so a range of people as opposed to being exposed so very few people in the process of figuring out what that technology is doing that&#x27;s been analyzing them and so on I mean those videos were there in the Pentagon and what could they do to get additional help to evaluate them really wasn&#x27;t wasn&#x27;t a way to do that and so the idea that we would come together and form a public benefit corporation as we call it in order to begin to get this put some sunshine on this area and get it out to where it&#x27;s no longer subject to ridicule hopefully but rather something that people can take part in and see results being made and so I think Obama in the best sense I would say and that is we&#x27;re taking the knowledge and information and results we know and to the degree that any of it can be made public because it&#x27;s not classified and further work that can be done that&#x27;s not classified this can become part of the societal public discussion so it some degree he&#x27;s accomplished that I mean it has become somewhat of a discussion we&#x27;re having a discussion right now I have to be honest I don&#x27;t understand the ridicule part I gotta be I fundamentally don&#x27;t get it now there&#x27;s a lot of stuff I don&#x27;t quite get in regards to human behavior but this particular thing I don&#x27;t get it all somebody believes that there&#x27;s somebody else or something else out in space because that particular belief seems perfectly sane to me seeing that they&#x27;re people here when a planet Earth there are other planets yes we grew up in this particular habitable planet planet zone with billions and billions and billions of galaxies are you telling me in that that one has life and are you also telling me that they wouldn&#x27;t necessarily develop in a particular way or they could develop in a particular way that allows them a different way of being meaning safer since the race was cooperative say that races was telepathic say the race was was a Manman should has a crapshoot like it&#x27;s hard to get across this thing of the different civilization in a way that civilization will bathe and it&#x27;s also hard to get across this idea that our technology is only a hundred or so years old what does it look like in a thousand years if humanity hasn&#x27;t ended itself what does technology look like in a thousand years could the caveman figure out what his cellphone is I mean I that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a fair question if you gave a caveman all the resources at his disposal and you gave him a cellphone could he figure out what that cellphone is what that cell phone does if he had some level of communication where he would yell to the other cavemen in some way would he be able to know what their cell phone signals flying over his head and all around it that he&#x27;s completely unaware of an invisible to him yes the signals are they a note we can&#x27;t receive it he has no idea that those things are there he has no idea to those things even possible but the point I&#x27;m getting at is it is not just possible it is likely it seems more likely than that in fact that there would be something else it seems like a religious belief to me to say there&#x27;s only this my god just created this one which at that point you have to invoke God why would they don&#x27;t it just makes no sense otherwise unless there&#x27;s you know God is just as crystalline just loves her thing just keeps earth as his own thing and he&#x27;s just [ __ ] everybody else and I&#x27;m just dealing with her that&#x27;s a religious belief so the ridicule part always was strange to me it was always bizarre to me it seems like the ridicule part would it&#x27;s like the opposite I mean it looked like it would be more ridiculous to say that we&#x27;re the only thing I mean you have to invoke some level of God or something like that to get to that point otherwise you&#x27;re gonna say everybody else in this entire galaxy in this entire universe has gone extinct except for us we&#x27;re the light of consciousness in the entirety of the universe that&#x27;s a ridiculous perspective I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t get the review I don&#x27;t get the ridicule hey yes I&#x27;m a little testy with the ridicule stuff because if they&#x27;re right this was a subject where people went up they would feel weird about today they would feel like awkward talking about like you could have a conversation with somebody there&#x27;s some people who are cool and like to talk about and discuss it me of others who are freaked out by any notion of it I&#x27;m completely freaked out and again I don&#x27;t get freaked out part it&#x27;s like saying um are there people in Texas yes there are people in Texas oh my god there are people in Texas yes there are people in Texas there are people in France they&#x27;re people all over the world they may act and look differently than you okay let&#x27;s move on let&#x27;s move on I look III find it&#x27;s not fascinating I love this idea of something else something new how do you measure yourself without having something else to measure yourself against you can&#x27;t be your own standard it can&#x27;t be your standard so I even like this idea of pushing it goes what confirmation is something else another added bonus it&#x27;s one thing for your scientist to be somewhat rigid new thinking unimaginative in this in this thing of groupthink where all of them kind of line up in kind of ducks in a row it&#x27;s but but they have a certain religious belief about physics they believe that this is all there is that&#x27;s a religious belief but they claim to that religious belief despite the quantum mechanics and all this other stuff they cling to that particular original religious belief physical matter reality this is hard everything is hard forgetting the fact that all of the space between animals we perceive this a particular way that&#x27;s true whether what this is is exactly what we perceive not so much not so much III guess this particular subject and then dealing with technology in this way the moment that you confirm and said yes that palette did see something that something was moving at incredible speeds that thing was not aerodynamic in any way we cannot find any means of propulsion yet it could move at speeds that would kill the person if they were in their craft what does the scientist do with it boy what does the manufacturers the people who build products do at that moment the first thought is we&#x27;re missing something we&#x27;re missing something it induces doubt like it induces growth it&#x27;s we got something wrong clearly fundamentally we got something wrong because otherwise how are they doing what they&#x27;re doing you&#x27;ve created a puzzle you&#x27;ve created something else to judge yourself against and to push yourself against when John F Kennedy is given that to the moon speech did you notice that they jumped to the challenge the United States was not in any position to go to the moon at that point but within ten years they put a man on the goddamn moon now I&#x27;m saying that to say this big you for challenge this is brandishing of humanism and saying that we&#x27;re going to the goddamn moon and doing it setting the goal and accomplishing that particular goal what happens when the goal becomes how is that craft doing what that craft is doing why can&#x27;t aircraft do there but aircraft can how do you figure out how does this work what is the technology behind this what is the thing that we&#x27;re missing in our understanding of the universe that allows that craft to do it but not our aircraft to do the same thing whether that plane was from somewhere else whether it was one of ours meaning whether it was this kind of secret black ops thing it pushes the actual outer layer of society to grow and expand to meet the challenge that was just presented I don&#x27;t want this to be done in this kind of war footing way where you have all these generals and military guys who always terrified it scared that everything is gonna get them I don&#x27;t want those guys being part of the process that being said those guys are part of the process so I have let help but I&#x27;ll finish this it&#x27;s a challenge but it&#x27;s a good challenge I mean the fact that confirmation gives this thing of holy [ __ ] this is real there&#x27;s something out there just doing that how are they doing that we need to figure out how they&#x27;re doing that what are we missing in our science and technology that&#x27;s a good thing damn good thing it&#x27;s the opposite really of the people who would say you know some giant cabal that they worked on poor Lou Elizondo and finally pushed him out the door to be a lightning rod for all kinds of conspiracy theories now it was just the opposite these are all hard-working people all people who one way or another ran across this subject area and knew there was a lot to it actually it has been over the years and there&#x27;s been difficulty in thinking about how how to do with it why is that well in this subject area even inside the government what do you have to deal with you&#x27;ve got fear you&#x27;ve got career ISM you got incompetence you&#x27;ve even got fundamental religious views saying this is not an area that American taxpayer money should be should be spent on the set of comments came from comb Kelleher who was bob Bigelow&#x27;s basically deputy manager for the hf program and he&#x27;s right those are kind of things was always ran into so despite the fact that there was funding and work was getting done and was getting done professionally nonetheless we had to brief other groups we had to try to set up programs in other areas and we ran into all kinds of problems so I essentially weakness and incompetence and cowardice and let&#x27;s linger on the cowardice for the moment they have funding the real guys like hard-nosed scientist that&#x27;s associated with it credentialed healthy ass and they&#x27;re saying this is something that&#x27;s real and we would like to get funding for and we need to do research on it and they run into cowardice and weakness and political careers I don&#x27;t want to rock the applecart on my watch I don&#x27;t want to have to deal with this the the political consequences of coming out with something like this I don&#x27;t think Jesus Christ wants us dealing with this topic God only made us anything else is coming to our shores or demons and Devils and they&#x27;re coming to taking eat our babies yeah this is stuff you have to deal with what you&#x27;re dealing with Washington goes easier to people whom we put into Congress unimaginative [ __ ] cowards absolute cowards the biggest story in history of stories for planet Earth for us and you&#x27;re running into incompetence and cowardice that being said they pursued they pushed they got it out anyway let&#x27;s keep one I think this giant step that we took to come out from behind the curtain so to speak and set up something that public can have access to and participate in that was really a step in the right direction you know I don&#x27;t have a security clearance so I&#x27;m just basing this on what I have picked up over the years but my sense of it is the military would have these encounters with unknown aerial objects from some place else that could perform these incredible maneuvers a report is made it goes somewhere it gets stuck in a drawer that there&#x27;s no central body that analyzes this stuff it does no one any good to make too much of a big fuss over it so for example like with the USS nimitz incident that happened in 2004 those videos were recorded they went somewhere and no one did anything with it until bass and a tip and you guys came along that&#x27;s exactly that&#x27;s exactly the case and one of the nice things that we&#x27;ve arranged to do on the to the stars website we have link to something called COI community of interest and tapping on that link you can get to the videos as we&#x27;ve already seen them in say the New York Times or whatever but in addition we have all the documentation it was arranged in advance before those videos left Pentagon that they went through massive review typical of releasing previously classified information and all the chain of custody taking place as the videos were transferred out all that information is there so it&#x27;s possible to get a complete rundown so rather than just being a video that what the heck you know it might have just shown up on the internet someplace in this case you have a complete chain of custody and a lot of detail you know describe me so that&#x27;s important that&#x27;s damn important I love that there&#x27;s a chain of custody meeting yes this was a pentagon video yes was video went set in a drawer somewhere yes those videos catalog like other stuff that&#x27;s being catalogued and there is a complete chain of custody from when the video was made and how they got their hands on that video bring me your skeptics where your skeptics like if you being honest if you&#x27;re being honest and you&#x27;re taking the stuff you know everything is ambiguous excited exert at worst you have to acknowledge that the palette is not insane and Apollo was not on LSD the palette knew what he saw in addition to that palette nobody saw him the radio operator was not insane it was not on LSD the other palette was not insane it was not what LSD many of these guys was on heroin none of these guys was on coke none of these guys were hallucinating on shrooms they were doing their jobs they videotaped something there&#x27;s a chain of custody for the video tape itself meaning this video is exactly what we said this video is where are your skeptics where are your skeptics now you may say look dude that&#x27;s a u.s. plane that&#x27;s some other plane from some other foreign power or that&#x27;s some that&#x27;s one of ours just in a black budget project the United States is technology that may be several years beyond and you know what the public sees like a b-2 bomber at the point of people were like holy [ __ ] with [ __ ] is that so what does it look like now is it like 30 years ago what does that technology look like if you found the ability to gravitational proportion in some way well it may look like that UFO so yeah fair enough let it be one of us but it also may not be and it very least if you make skeptical you may not it&#x27;s at the very least you can say that yes there&#x27;s something up there that&#x27;s unidentified that is a flying [ __ ] objects thing even the Raytheon flare systems for the looking infrared radar systems used to gather the data and so I think that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a step in the right direction so is this an initial release I mean someone had to greenlight that yes it could be released that&#x27;s right I mean it was released out of the elements that Louise Ellis andö was in charge of and he was the authority there for how to deal with that information and of course as part of the long ranging agent program he archived all this material and so on but but there it was I mean there was some analysis going on in-house I mean in addition to the DoD and the Pentagon had Navy and CIA people were involved in analyses but nonetheless not as much as what really needs to be done and so that was the idea in setting up this start up to the Stars Academy of Arts and Science to set up a situation and assuming we can get the funding to be able to carry out these kind of analyses in great detail let&#x27;s talk about we&#x27;ll go to a break in about three minutes I think that might be enough time to talk about the tic-tac video the USS nimitz video what can you tell us about that you know we&#x27;ve seen amateur experts online saying it&#x27;s a bug on it&#x27;s a bug on a windshield or it&#x27;s a lens player or it&#x27;s the sound of a vacuum cleaner or a lawn mower what are you looking right now they&#x27;re talking about the video that the palette was in earlier the original video that I should the original video just scratch my mouth attract the original video of the palette um there was essentially making the point of yes that was me there was an airplane flying and the footage itself is what they&#x27;re now talking about call the pin emits video you tell us about why you were impressed by that video well primarily because it isn&#x27;t just the video I mean that&#x27;s what most people have had access to and are attempting to analyze and come up with alternatives like oh it&#x27;s just a jet in the distance because that also makes infrared spots that can be detect and so on but the full data on the Nimitz involves radar tracking these this object coming in from 60,000 feet dropping down to 50 feet in a matter of seconds then the radar records of that and then you&#x27;ve got the pilots de flavor has given interviews on this you can find it all over the internet and also on the to the Stars Academy website where he actually got into which you might almost call a dogfight with it and that is he circled around it and it circled around him and they got very close I mean this is nose to nose and so in that situation you could tell exactly the size of it about forty six feet across and so he could see the acceleration that it could could accomplish I mean in that very incident for example although they were supposed to be doing an exercise at some point they had been reroute to check this thing out and then after the thing took off the radar operator said well this thing whatever it is has gone to the place where you&#x27;re supposed to have anything well I mean it was miles and miles away and it got there in a few seconds and no sonic boom I mean so there&#x27;s so much data well beyond just the videotapes all integrated together and that&#x27;s what makes this kind of observation absolutely spectacular kind of thing well there&#x27;s also the gimbal video which we&#x27;re gonna ask you to analyze and then there are promises of other videos and I want to know if you&#x27;ve seen those as well we were talking with dr. Hal put off about the tic-tac video the gimbal video UFO studies by bass and the Pentagon and a much more to come here on coast-to-coast am dr. hal put off from the Institute for Advanced Studies in Austin we&#x27;re talking about the Pentagon&#x27;s UFOs study conducted through the auspices of a private company bass founded by the way just for a quick review I know this video is gone ridiculously long I wanted to play how put off thing and I wish it was an in person where you could actually see the guy there are there&#x27;s an interview with him that I&#x27;ve seen before with him weird but they were talking about energy when I&#x27;m talking about this um I wish I could see the guy giving him the speech because I know having a blank screen or some little dry why keep it rejecting but what he&#x27;s talking about is pretty straightforward for people were skeptics what&#x27;s your bar of evidence like if at a certain point your bar of evidence becomes just so insane and ridiculous like that there&#x27;s a story of um a bunch of people on an airplane and there&#x27;s a UFO that&#x27;s flying nearby and the people are looking like oh my god there&#x27;s a [ __ ] UFO that&#x27;s amazing and they get down the land and one of the guys who comes out of psychologists and he says did you see your focuses no I didn&#x27;t look I don&#x27;t believe the UFOs yet oh look I didn&#x27;t believe in it so what&#x27;s the point in looking at it I yeah if your burden of proof is such a degree where there&#x27;s no way to hurt all the burden of proof like it&#x27;s like I needed to land on the White House lawn then you just don&#x27;t really care you just don&#x27;t necessarily want any kind of boy but if it&#x27;s the same burden of proof that you would give to say the regular thing that you interact with in life you know I&#x27;m sitting in the chair that chair has pretty solid fair enough if there&#x27;s a crime scene and somebody points out that this guy hit that of the guy over the head well that&#x27;s testimony that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s held in court when the exact same situation happens about military guys who were trained to do this particular thing that they are now in doing and they were recounting the information based on their 15 16 years of training and they&#x27;re not telling you third-person this is I saw this with my own eyes I was there in that plane these other people were there what&#x27;s your bar of proof what&#x27;s your bar proof if you at least acknowledge that this guy&#x27;s not lying that the radar operators that lie that the other palate is not lying that the people on that boat that was looking at following this object or not if you at least agree with me on that which i think is fair I don&#x27;t know what burden of proof would be on that case but there was something up there man the only question becomes what was it that was up there which means even if you&#x27;re a skeptic you&#x27;re stuck with this thing of okay there&#x27;s something up there there&#x27;s something that&#x27;s unidentified that&#x27;s flying that&#x27;s an object that&#x27;s that this person is interacting with you can make an argument and say what that plane was ours there was something that we had there was a technology that the Paladin know about that the rest of the public doesn&#x27;t know about fair enough as long as we&#x27;re acknowledging that something was up there doing some fantastic [ __ ] things that the thing was unidentified let&#x27;s keep going yeah so making an argument on this point and maybe I am slightly maybe I&#x27;m slightly testy maybe a short man on this one where people get a little bit more testy when you&#x27;re defending something that they feel that they&#x27;re pushed against I don&#x27;t feel pushed against us that makes sense I don&#x27;t understand other people&#x27;s hesitation with dealing with it or interacting with it so don&#x27;t assume feel push I don&#x27;t even understand how other people behave on this so but I do have this thing well I do understand from an intellectual level but people get weirded out with this topic and I fully understand that they&#x27;re gonna hit people who are religious quacks with theocrats who have this thing that God put earth here for some particular reason that these demons are coming to get us and they&#x27;re trying to eat our babies and take our dogs and eat man or eat human it&#x27;s a cup book it&#x27;s a cookbook let&#x27;s let how I put off finish I&#x27;m going to Twilight Zone stuff that&#x27;s by Robert Bigelow and as you if you&#x27;ve been listening you know we&#x27;re talking about the tic-tac video big question is how does this work did we figure out how these this these objects can make these kind of leaps and fly circles around our most advanced weapon systems and platforms and what about that gimbal video that was also released by the Pentagon and will we eventually see other videos that have been released much more to come here on coast-to-coast am I&#x27;ll put off we all solve the tic-tac video the USS Nimitz battlegroup how do we know it&#x27;s not the Russians or the Chinese or us some other classified program that not everyone has been told about well we don&#x27;t absolutely rule that out the basically the the twofold nature of the threat as far as a tip program goes is specified very specifically one is is there a current threat from this phenomena could be a foreign derivation could be offworld but nonetheless it&#x27;s obviously being deployed and tested including in our country and then there&#x27;s the future threat which is really concerning and that is potential terrestrial adversaries achieving significant breakthroughs in the development of game-changing disruptive technologies based on a valuation of the UAP phenomenon from sensor data or crash retrieved materials so our best analysts and based on the intelligence information we have so far we&#x27;ve not been able to track it back to Russian or Chinese I mean is there some other terrestrial Society off the grid I mean everything is on the table because we&#x27;re strictly only going to pay attention to what we can observe and what we can prove and so basically looking at the characteristics and matching them up against what we know of our special systems and other foreign adversary systems it just doesn&#x27;t seem to match anything that we know about the disruptive technology thing is really honest I hate I hate the way this is going I hate this conversation right now something else is coming to your shores and the first conversation we&#x27;re having is we need to figure out if it&#x27;s a threat if we need to get this technology and form we need to get our hands on this technology and if it&#x27;s a foreign adversary if there&#x27;s been this kind of major leak but with a disruptive technology that now had this kind of game-changing power dynamic change like the nuclear bomb like the United States getting the nuclear bomb and the United States going to fill that around saying hey hey don&#x27;t make me use our nukes for what 10 years 50 years the United States had nuclear supremacy in regards to being the only country with the bomb meaning this country will going forever unless it&#x27;s somehow toppled from the inside out because worst come the worse we&#x27;re going to destroy the planet if we need to keep ourselves intact at that point any war is a nuclear war at least well it&#x27;s met major powers but you could imagine if another country provides this kind of leap in technology in that way think about how the unit we don&#x27;t have leaders like that anymore but think about the space race John F Kennedy was going to the moon even though he&#x27;s making the speech and coding it in language like we&#x27;re going there for humanitarian reasons we&#x27;re not going there for violence and conquests we need to get to the moon because we need to make sure that we have a preeminence in space but this is not something we&#x27;re subordinate to I mean however he coded that he coded it in a particular way as Americans we believe in freedom and justice that&#x27;s first you know propaganda angle and because we believe in freedom a justice it is important that we get the space first because those Soviets don&#x27;t believe in freedom and justice so us going to space is essentially us going as peaceful human beings I think this is Cold War language I mean it is what it is but I&#x27;m saying it he was coating it in these kind of humanitarian reasons but nevertheless it was still this challenge it was the sum [ __ ] I lost my place he was he was he was still dis language I guess I should say the way he was talking about this stuff let me help it off fish thank you now that&#x27;s not to say that we can&#x27;t make progress and trying to figure out how this works in fact the large part of my own activity in this program was to go through the physics as Eric described I remember what I was saying I hate the way this conversation is going like the John F Kennedy speech yes it was coated in humanitarian terms and yes it was this kind of militaristic endeavor because in the United States didn&#x27;t want Soviet Union gas supremacy in space there the idea of they may be weapons in space they can rain down those weapons on us they would have this game-changing advantage we can&#x27;t allow this to take place meaning the US was willing to marshal all of those resources to put a person in space for militaristic reasons but all this of the humanism was coated in it was for militaristic reasons if if the United States believes that there is a threat in this capacity what are they gonna be willing to do and not just what are they willing to do how are they willing to spin that particular angle meaning if they&#x27;re not gonna confirm him if they&#x27;re not gonna disclose but they perceive that we perceived it as a threat no we&#x27;re not gonna disclose a threat to the public because that was disclosed it&#x27;s kind of out a worldly thing we don&#x27;t want to do that that would be too disruptive how would they get money to find any kind of defense so any kind of program for something like that do you just lose five trillion dollars misplaced in the budget yes and being experienced III on this one that&#x27;s fine there&#x27;s nothing back that pilla consider risks Bruce Lee Theory I&#x27;m just making a point that it is a little disheartening to be already plunged deep in military talk when this thing is just now coming to this idea of hey there&#x27;s something else on our shores is it hostile it&#x27;s gonna kill this is gonna hurt us this is gonna get our babies it&#x27;s like if it had the capacity to get here like like what is your defense if it had the capacity to get here and if it was hostile there will be no defense there&#x27;ll be no defense so I am NOT into this evil aliens thing I&#x27;m not into this hostile aliens thing but this is the language of these guys coke to stuff in and it&#x27;s a little sergeant that&#x27;s all yes and being a peacenik trying to kill my space brother I commissioned thirty-eight papers to give us the best physics in all kinds of new areas like metallic glasses or plasma propulsion or whatever and there was a model that came to the floor that I explored in some detail which I think has some merit and that is what we call space time metric engineering and that is when you look at the effects that are associated rapid accelerations changes of direction instantly the ability to hover all these things as wild as they are the truth the matter is if you take general relativity equations and write them down one side of a piece of paper and then you write down all of the oddball observations on the other side of the piece of paper you can get a reasonable mass between them so that sounds good the problem is though what it would take in the general relativistic physics that we know and love at the present time is we just don&#x27;t have the energy densities that can possibly create those effects so that makes me from a physicist standpoint extremely skeptical that this is something that we have in the backroom or the Russians or the Chinese have so right there goddamnit right there this is exactly what I was talking about so okay we have something that&#x27;s doing magnificent things do you think is ours no we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ours why don&#x27;t you think he said oh so I don&#x27;t think think it&#x27;s Russian aid yeah it&#x27;s China whoever else and he goes into the explanation why he doesn&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case and him being a physicist goes into the physical explanation you know this kind of physics explanation how does it do the things and it does can you explain it the fact is the fact that the question exists in the first place is a testament to that thing being found if that makes sense if you if you get what I&#x27;m saying it leads a question it drives human beings forward in regards to the way this thing&#x27;s posed a challenge is presented how does it do that and the person says I don&#x27;t know how it does that but let&#x27;s figure it out the fact that it does that is proof positive that it is possible to do that let&#x27;s just figure out how we just need to complete the other part of the puzzle and this is what how put-off is doing right here he&#x27;s it&#x27;s trying to explain how does it do that and he&#x27;s talking about these gravitational effects essentially this kind of a using space-time itself in order to manipulate the vehicle like instead of using proportion you actually created some kind of gravitational wave or some kind of gravitation effect then he&#x27;s kind of localized ras-i can spritz around but his point in this is if that&#x27;s how that&#x27;s being done we in no way have any level of capacity to generate that much energy to do that particular thing meaning even though we may be able to understand how it&#x27;s being done we have no way of figuring out or the Rayleigh&#x27;s at present of generating the energy density necessary to do what they are talking about doing and maybe that&#x27;s not the way that&#x27;s being done but at the very least he&#x27;s asking the question and he&#x27;s trying to engage question and this is one of lead to testing this is one of me to you know them trying other results of things that they may want to try it in regards to experimental planes experimental proportions that is it leads and drives the question the moment there is any level of confirmation I don&#x27;t see how the question it&#x27;s not ass how did they get here if our scientist believes that it&#x27;s impossible and this [ __ ] thing is here how did it get here how did it get here and I would guarantee you that that question will be answered the moment that question is asked thought some point the question will be answered which all bets are off this is almost over you know the word threat in the a tip title has a lot of people upset these are our friendly space brothers there are no threat to us they haven&#x27;t attacked us they haven&#x27;t wiped out cities the threat that you see though is that the Russians and Chinese could be studying this and figure this out and get this technology at us when I talk to Senator Reid like late last year he had said that he thought and I&#x27;m not sure what his sources are that he thought the Russians and Chinese were studying this stuff and now we were studying it for a while and then stopped yeah there&#x27;s absolutely no doubt that they&#x27;re studying them I&#x27;ve read detailed classified documents on the Russian work the military equivalents around the world are all concerned about this for the very same reasons the Russians would be worried that we could reverse engineer if we get some technology under our fingertips so so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s definitely a major issue so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s no getting around it this is this is taken seriously it has to be considered a threat now are there any indications well it&#x27;s true that we haven&#x27;t had any obvious hostile attack on the other hand it&#x27;s also the case as Harry mentioned in an interview with you that these crafts have infiltrated our missile silos on nuclear missile silos and have an occasion taking them offline once or twice could be some kind of coincidence good good yes good they took it off good good I&#x27;m not mad at that doesn&#x27;t that matter that at all that&#x27;s sending a message but that is not hostile I&#x27;m sorry that&#x27;s not hostile that&#x27;s like the Democratic Party scream in that an attack that never happened by Russia is equivalent to some kind of actual physical attack that&#x27;s not a hostile action whatever the military was doing it sent a message it sent a message you have a bunch of trigger-happy and I got to be honest this interview is tilting for me you have a bunch of trigger-happy people who are terrified in cowardice and the first thing they do is grab their guns the first sign something comes up that is not strength that is literally cowardice that is the opposite of strength in this case you have something that&#x27;s coming to your shores and the first response these Apes with their spears looking at this guy talking about the red it&#x27;s a threat it&#x27;s a threat coming to our shores it&#x27;s [ __ ] amazing [ __ ] amazing don&#x27;t come to earth go somewhere else and I mean if this is the level that you&#x27;re gonna end up with and people are saying why don&#x27;t they land on the White House lawn it&#x27;s [ __ ] like this now how put off is not a maniac like he&#x27;s not one of these people like aliens or eating babies and they&#x27;re eating kids and all this other stuff they&#x27;re lizard people he&#x27;s not one of those guys but clearly in the conversation now put all this habit this idea of threat is consistently coming up it&#x27;s a threat it&#x27;s a threat it&#x27;s a threat either in the way they could take the technology meaning other countries take this and reverse entry into this technology and it&#x27;s a threat in the systems themselves like the ability for them to come here and the ability for them to do the things that they do in our airspace just by their very presence is considered to be a threat and becomes a military matter do you know Truman President Truman the little did a little ridiculous man that took over after FDR after that line passed away put a shoot down order when the aircraft when ufos buzzed the White House the shoot-down out apparently didn&#x27;t last all that long but the idea that he put the water up was [ __ ] amazing these eight these apes I have this picture in my head of a bunch of apes running around with Spears bunch of apes running around with spears looking up at the sky is screaming and hooting beating their chests and flailing their gonads that&#x27;s what this feels like to me that&#x27;s what it feels like to me this yes is interview is tilted I&#x27;m hating this part of the interview I mean yeah maybe if somewhat of a hippie on this but this is the most momentous thing that has ever happened to discipline its phase you&#x27;re talking about something else it doesn&#x27;t look like this that doesn&#x27;t act like us that doesn&#x27;t have our mentality and all this stuff that&#x27;s different fundamentally different it&#x27;s coming to our shores somebody is knocking on the door a neighbor comes to your house and the first thought is we need to shoot him in the face we need to shoot him in the face they&#x27;ve been disruptive and that just being disruptive our neighbors may get some ideas because they&#x27;re seeing this thing so you know this thing is a problem this thing is a threat we need you to go away it&#x27;s kind of xenophobic oddity I mean look I I understood that some degree there was gonna be some involvement regards to military and stuff like that I understood that there are a lot of trigger-happy cowardly people in this country that see something like that have no paradigm for which to process it and get freaked up I get it we have religious maniacs we have coups we have fanatics I get it people are gonna respond to this thing in different ways and some people are gonna respond to it poorly but there is something fundamentally wrong with us as a species and this contact brings it up in full glare the level of skepticism that we would take to look at this and say yeah I don&#x27;t believe it it&#x27;s breathtaking like at that point you&#x27;re not a skeptic you&#x27;re just a hack say that say this video some level of confirmation of something that&#x27;s taking place in our airspace that these guys don&#x27;t believe is us now what do you believe is us or whether you don&#x27;t believe is us something was in our airspace doing fantastic [ __ ] things the response of the government itself and seeing this stuff even though this has been around for 50 60 70 years never harmed us never posed a threat never did anything to us and at the end of the day if this was some kind of actual hostile threat we would have no recourse whatsoever to deal with this threat and why on earth wait 50 60 70 80 90 years before actually being a threat meaning before actually doing something if you were taking resources if you wanted to take over planet if you wanted to kill a bunch of people wouldn&#x27;t you do that when a technology was at its least not necessarily when the technology gets better and gets more advanced the threat thing just doesn&#x27;t make sense I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t understand this thing though these things are potentially a threat I get it from the standpoint of other nations reverse engineering the technology but again that makes me just sad at the state of us [ __ ] sad it&#x27;s immensely pathetic a bunch of apes running around with their spears hooting at the sky oh my god there&#x27;s a craft it&#x27;s a threat too dangerous but there&#x27;s a whole northern tier where this happens at base after base after base and it turns out the same thing has happened in Russia as well and so you have two ways of interpreting it one is that they&#x27;re just checking out that they know how to stop but if we get too frisky here and therefore that&#x27;d be a nice benign interpretation on the other hand if there&#x27;s some thought that eventually there will be some hostile interaction between us and they might be wanting to check that they can be sure to take out our nuclear missiles fire really really is that the interpretation I mean honestly is that the interpreted you believe they were just testing the ability to take off the nuclear silos you think that yes they were flying around in Russia and in the United States doing this and they were that I&#x27;ve even shown video where they were talking about this with the craft itself was out there the soldiers could see it the soldiers are freaking out they&#x27;re losing their [ __ ] about it they&#x27;re terrified and yeah the nuclear silos shut down multiple silos shut down these things are in different locations and yet in multiple places they were being shut down it took them weeks to get that back online this also happened in Russia he&#x27;s right they had the capacity to do this now his interpretation or the possible interpretations my interpretation is rather benign we have the capacity to do this don&#x27;t offer yourselves don&#x27;t [ __ ] up you guys are on a path that is destructive and you&#x27;re gonna kill yourselves that&#x27;s the way I interpret that I don&#x27;t interpret it as testing their weapons they&#x27;re testing in their capacity to do this so they&#x27;re showing us that they have the capacity to turn this off no I take this as stop [ __ ] up you&#x27;re gonna murder yourselves not to mention you don&#x27;t know if the fact that you were firing off nuclear weapons has consequences it&#x27;s some of the sphere again these guys assume that this is all there is physical matter reality completely ignoring there may be other aspects of reality that we don&#x27;t necessarily perceive they&#x27;re being adversely affected other things that we&#x27;re doing there&#x27;s no way to know what these guys were doing but between ideas between this idea of there&#x27;s an intelligence somewhere that decided to show off the nuclear silos they out stripe us in technology in every way they can shut these things off at whim they can shut our airplanes off at a whim we&#x27;re not a threat to them in this way from a military capacity what would be the point of doing this is this kind of showmanship of this privado that&#x27;s us why are you assuming that&#x27;s there like the message you may have nothing to do a provider the message may everything to do with you&#x27;re gonna offer yourselves good [ __ ] cure yourselves yes I&#x27;m getting annoyed at this so from the standpoint of Pentagon whereas all the other people out there can kind of speculate that it might be this might be that and they hope this and I hope it&#x27;s bad in the Pentagon and in the intelligence community you can only work to determine what actually is the facts and in the absence of data to the contrary or proof to the contrary you have to assume that there could be a threat aspect whether from the phenomen itself or as we&#x27;ve already discussed from a potential adversary making game-changing disruptive technology based on their evaluations I had heard and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s public or if it&#x27;s true but I had heard that there were multiple incidents and encounters with tic-tac type technology that the increasing frequency is sort of one of the things that convinced Lewis Elizondo to leave the Pentagon to go join to the Stars Academy and to work on this this problem that&#x27;s exactly alright though you hear that the program may have shut down in 2012 or whatever the truth of matter is tick-tack incidents off the East Coast the United States there interfered with our our air flight plans and activities I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s absolutely an unbelievable rush of that kind of phenomena happening and so even in the gimbal video even though in the gimbal video you only see a given crap when you dig down into the details but you can do if you go to the community of interest link on the to the stars academy of arts and science turns out that in the verbal transcripts that presented they see on their larger radar sites while they&#x27;re getting a nice spread picture of the gimbal with their watching that there&#x27;s a whole fleet of them I mean quite a number of them all flying around so it&#x27;s not just kind of one-off phenomena and it seems to be happening as massively these days as ever the gimbal video is not the same as the tic-tac 2004 incident it shows an tragic that seems to have a field around it you know what that field is don&#x27;t know basically on the FLIR what you&#x27;re seeing is basically the temperature distribution and so it could simply be that it&#x27;s a heat or it&#x27;s cold compared to the heat of the object so we don&#x27;t have any idea but basically what that FLIR device picks up is basically the temperature distribution so we know it has something to do with the temperature but beyond that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s no way to interpret it as say some kind of electromagnetic or or whatever Tom DeLonge and Lewis Elizondo have made public statements about other videos as many as two dozen that have already come out of the Pentagon have you seen them and do you know what the plans are for their eventual release I&#x27;ve seen one additional one that we were planning on getting out relatively soon it&#x27;s certainly an interesting video you see watching this thing and zeroed in just like in these other two videos then some point it just takes off like a shot I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s sort of unreal if you talk to the pilots about it and there are other videos that I&#x27;m told but I haven&#x27;t looked at any so what what is the eventual plan and the study is done the the bass part of the study is done people are still collected by the way they&#x27;re supposed to be several videos several reports and even some kind of materials that are supposed to be coming out in like 2000 2018 or 2019 the way they are saying it dislodges some time off confirmation or the information that&#x27;s coming out right now it&#x27;s this way of saying yes this phenomena is real this is confirmation at the phenomena is real but not this kind of splashy Donald Trump coming out saying here the two alien bodies I&#x27;m Donald Trump you know folk from so yeah so let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m citrus he&#x27;s going a little bit more detail and to the other thing the one thing that&#x27;s important though is more of these are coming up more palate testimony more testimony from people who were looking at it who were dealing with it who was interacting with it there&#x27;s more coming out including a bunch of reports and apparently the materials itself what&#x27;s some materials that have I guess interesting material properties or something like that they got their hands on that&#x27;s that&#x27;s key point thing information according to you and Eric Davis is there some more formal program underway as it&#x27;s some of this going to be funneled to to the stars to analyze and evaluate and figure out the program in the Pentagon is certainly continuing I think there&#x27;s a fair chance that it will continue at an accelerated pace and to the degree that this sort of community of interest thing can be set up to work we anticipate seeing cooperation and collaboration with possibly gone directly or with other aerospace corporations who get involved that we would be subcontractors to so there&#x27;s a lot going on behind the scenes to set up new funding organizations and so on people have complained or wires to the stars sort of not going anywhere very fast well the truth of matter is for what we want to do it needs funding and so raising the money the sort of out funding approaches works to a certain degree but to really to get a robust technical organization going because the reason I I think there are plenty of things that get across failure in regards to the way that we&#x27;ve arranged it ourselves and I laughed on this planet you&#x27;ve heard me say many a time there is no God above that forces you to be arranged in the way that you arranged this is the way that we&#x27;ve aggregated around ourselves one little change after the next after the next after the next leading so the society that we have now in this society something as momentous as a potential visitation from somebody coming from off our shores of this planet it&#x27;s dealt with through the lens of capitalism is this just a key only to me I mean if this esteemed scientist is having this conversation about dealing with materials and reports and all this other stuff and how they want to build these ships and planes that can try to mimic some of the behavior that they&#x27;re experiencing they have plenty of scientists associated with it they have an aerospace company associated with it apparently they have members of Congress some degree associated with it they need cash they need cash we need investors we need people who are gonna give us money and we&#x27;re gonna build the stuff out once people give us money corporate-controlled contact with ETS this is immensely depressing this 4:20 has tilted into something that&#x27;s pretty [ __ ] depressing let&#x27;s keep going it&#x27;s almost up I joined and the reason Steve Justice joined from the skunkworks is that we don&#x27;t want to see this just as any smart kind of thing getting information out to the public although that&#x27;s a major piece of it we also want to see and get started various technical projects and programs that take advantage of some of the information that that&#x27;s and that&#x27;s been learned a lot of the data within the bass program is is archived in Bendis amount of materials you can possibly believe Bob Bigelow had something like 46 people they&#x27;re putting all this stuff together I mean just to give you one example we looked at Clara&#x27;s island Brazil case 1977-1978 hundreds of UAVs observed by civilians in the Brazil Brazilian Air Force investigative team called Operation plate they got more than a thousand pages of documents log sketches and maps more than 500 photographs greater than 15 hours of motion film measured a lot of physiological effects and medical injuries and so put together a whole database at all of apps eventually a lot of that material this is part of the hope is to the Stars moves forward is that we will be able to arrange on a case-by-case basis a study by study basis to possibly release this material at the present time it&#x27;s a big lot of proprietary as it should be and so there will be negotiation over attempting to put some of that data out so that well a lot of people have filed requests he said its proprietor as it should be you talked yeah this is it this is capitalism I work it gets a key I&#x27;m sorry it gets disgusting to some degree you are talking about dealing with something else for my Shores and it&#x27;s infected with the economic system meaning the progress on that issue actually dealing with that issue as if you&#x27;re dealing for what one human being to another still coat it in this ego of some kind of monetary advantage we need funding we need investors what are those investors gonna get for the money that they give meaning what influence is safe for example you are successful in two things that you want to create where those things gonna go to what benefit you&#x27;re just telling me this guy&#x27;s proprietary information about all of these case studies that are taking place should that be proprietary [ __ ] that&#x27;d only be his we&#x27;re talking about something that is interacting with this particular planet it&#x27;s something that affects each and every one of us why is he hoarding information this way why is he hoarding information yeah I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;d be proprietary this is something that affects all of us and you&#x27;re you know this is mine you&#x27;re gonna have to negotiate with me you know some capitalistic way in order to get this information out sorry it&#x27;s gross it&#x27;s [ __ ] gross it&#x27;s like you can&#x27;t just hug the space brother hey you have to talk about shooting and me you have to talk about exploiting technology and did see its how can we make a buck off of it how do we make a book how can we make some cash off these elements through FOIA I&#x27;m one of them you know you mentioned the scenario where maybe the Russians are Chinese learn something based on a crash one of the most intriguing sentences in the New York Times report mentioned an exotic material of unknown origin that was at Bigelow Aerospace for a while is that from a crash do you think crashes have happened or can you say detailed proof the crashes have happened would be still highly classified piece of data well that&#x27;s an answer of sorts yeah there there have been there there has been one leaked document how it got leaked oh I&#x27;ll never know which is out there that talks about some crashes that we were able to verify what was a real document so my opinion is that there probably is there are probably at least materials now would necessarily have to be crash of an entire craft but it could be you know piece blown off and whatever by a lightning strike or a missile or whatever so so I&#x27;m not surprised to find out that there&#x27;s discussion of material being available we&#x27;ve had an opportunity to look at some unusual material and so I think that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a big area that will become more significant as time goes on I like you&#x27;re killing me how you had a chance to look at some material I did and the interesting thing about it was that I couldn&#x27;t figure out a very complex material when you talk to people that are doing this kind of research you find out you know it isn&#x27;t that you know all the elements the periodic table we know about so you&#x27;re not finding some new element that you didn&#x27;t realize was in the periodic table no it&#x27;s more like putting together layered layers of various kinds of material that you wouldn&#x27;t expect to be able to be layered and that the result at the end of the day is that it has certain unusual characteristics that you wouldn&#x27;t have predicted in advance so that that&#x27;s the kind of thing that to physicist is the most interesting you know the first time I met you we were on a flight to go meet Philip Corso it was before his book came out before the world heard from him and he was talking about something he had learned at the Pentagon about how alien technology was was engineered Adams at a time I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this material you&#x27;re talking about fits with that but it&#x27;s amazing that it&#x27;s come full circle sort of yeah that that&#x27;s that that&#x27;s the kind of thing so it will probably be some time before we really learn a lot about materials or even if we figure them out how to make them now again what&#x27;s the hurdle of evidence and hurdle the proof like what&#x27;s what&#x27;s the bar where does the skepticism just becomes somewhat of a ridiculous thing with the person who sold you&#x27;re going to as opposed to actually in giving information from people who are on the ground in dealing with the topic scientists people with credentials behind their name not some random guys screaming on an Internet channel with a hat on but actual people who are in the field doing the investigation doing the work and it&#x27;s saying yes we have people who saw it yes we have two radar data with it yes we have fowls of the Brazilian authorities pages hundreds of pages of documents and photos and everything else where&#x27;s the skeptic at which point does a skeptic just become somewhat of a religious thing and now he&#x27;s talking about materials yes I&#x27;ve reviewed some materials that have some strange properties we don&#x27;t necessarily know how these things will put together it will be a while before we see materials and it would be a while before we see how these things are figured out and even when we expose this information figuring out how to produce this is not necessarily something that we know how to do yet where&#x27;s the bar of skepticism and what&#x27;s a fair bar a skepticism to get over that&#x27;s key point very no I mean let&#x27;s face it even you know 10 years ago no one would have thought of making graphene or whatever I mean so our own science is coming up up up to speed pretty rapidly and so that means that if there are materials available then as time goes on with our increased acuity in examining materials and evaluating them you know we&#x27;ll probably learn more as time goes on if more materials become available dr. hal put off can&#x27;t thank you enough for being with us I hope you&#x27;ll come back there&#x27;s so much more to talk about and basically if we&#x27;ve learned one it&#x27;s that this deserves to be studied and if we don&#x27;t study it and figure it out someone else will right that&#x27;s it&#x27;s laughable to believe that Russia is not studying this stuff is laughably Chinese that studying this stuff all of those governments are going to be studying stuff like this whether we&#x27;re in this kind of cop fight you know this international cockfight of how can I get this technology so I can get more of a military advantage and all this other stuff China is shooting down satellites the United States is you know pushing his chest around you know essentially a failing super power failing super power falling apart on the inside while at the same token walking around with a gun steering the rest of the planet of course other countries are gonna be involved in technology particularly for something like this and yes just because those countries don&#x27;t say anything about it it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they&#x27;re not doing anything about it the United States was studying this all the way back to sister 1940s and it would continuously say well this we don&#x27;t have anything here they had a lot of stuff and as you&#x27;re finding out there was a ton of information those things were going to a file somewhere someone would have that particular document the US will pretend as if the document didn&#x27;t exist and all of a sudden the stuff is now coming out my point here in a lot of the stuff is this was planned to come out in the way that this came up it was foretold that this will come out in the way that this has come up and I love the fact that this is out and these are the conversations that people will have it it scares me a little if I&#x27;m being honest human beings are not rational creatures and there&#x27;s something coming to our shores and we&#x27;re so ensconced in this idea of this kind of capitalistic thing that we&#x27;re dragging something else into our mass delusion profits not real and yet that&#x27;s going to be the measure in the way that we interact with some other species with unreality as being made to meet here between those things it&#x27;s disheartening I have to mention that the militaristic stuff of you know we&#x27;re trying to figure out how to build crafts so we could shoot stuff down that doesn&#x27;t throw me at all it doesn&#x27;t burn room at all the other aspect of me is [ __ ] cloud down and and I try to split those aspects up because it&#x27;s a weird mixed feeling of Oh my god human beings are terrifying how are they gonna behave and yet yes this information is coming up the public at the very least start to get some level of confirmation regards say yes this is real yes the people have been studying this for all those years or actual real people who were actually studying real things and people weren&#x27;t crazy and they were maniacs when they were pointing out things that they were saying unless all of these other military people are also crazy and maniacs who are on shrooms or something else this is gone it&#x27;s sanely long I can&#x27;t believe this thing&#x27;s gone for two hours but I didn&#x27;t want to show George next video I did want to show George snaps video but take a little help put off there&#x27;s other stuff to help put all this in and maybe I&#x27;ll show him at some other time but but in fact sure now just as a quick thing back home at one of my old places that I lived in I saw this let&#x27;s come on come on my screen is too weird things there is so I see a star and I take a picture of the star now I was not paying attention in any way well I didn&#x27;t see them you guys can&#x27;t see that oh right here so this is a light this is a star now at the time I am looking up at the sky used to look at the sky all the time what this all sorts of [ __ ] goes on if we don&#x27;t really pay attention to it so I you serve have a tendency particularly during that time of my life of looking at the sky a lot I didn&#x27;t see anything when I took this picture the only thing I saw that I was taking a picture of was a star because I thought the star looked interesting I see the summer months later I look at the picture I see this I&#x27;m like what the hell is that I don&#x27;t know what that is if we go let&#x27;s see if I can go to the next one same item these pictures were taken like split seconds apart different direction the same item I took several pictures it&#x27;s kind of a quick succession and the item is all [ __ ] over the place including something up here the well part about this is I wasn&#x27;t sure what that was I wasn&#x27;t even sure if it was like a camera flare or something like that or but I dunno I didn&#x27;t see it at the time it wasn&#x27;t there it was not in my visual range and I&#x27;m looking at this picture several months later and I&#x27;m like what the [ __ ] is that what the [ __ ] is that that wasn&#x27;t out there that wasn&#x27;t out there the only thing goes out there was a star and I just had this kind of impulse to take a picture of That star people see weird [ __ ] people see work [ __ ] and not everybody&#x27;s gonna know what those things are which case those things are literally unidentified they&#x27;re literally in the air bitching they&#x27;re flying in their objects no idea what this is this could be some kind of camera flare or something else the things that the pallets were saying they were able to make a distinction with their visual eyesight to say yes this is something else that we have no idea what this is the physicists that just came on with all the credentials behind his name just said we think they&#x27;re manipulating space-time in some way but we cannot create the energy density to do that and unavailable countries can either which means we don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s from here this planet what is your bar but skepticism and you gotta be honest this this is a hell of a jump meeting it meeting whatever that bar that somebody&#x27;s putting up for skepticism it can&#x27;t be it&#x27;s it&#x27;s such a ridiculous extent that reality itself can&#x27;t cross the bar so I&#x27;m going to leave it on that this one has already gone long so I&#x27;m not gonna tarry on this I don&#x27;t know how many people even stayed for something like this but it&#x27;s to the mayflies look look from a flies yeah maybe I I didn&#x27;t see and if there was nothing out there there&#x27;s nothing out there this firmament dome I don&#x27;t know what if remember though it is it was a UFO but not a spaceship right I didn&#x27;t have a flying I was right this is something that&#x27;s flying I have no idea what this thing is is completely unidentified yeah I don&#x27;t know what it is weird cue an eyewitness testimony is that very credible he&#x27;s in the [ __ ] military are you [ __ ] me he&#x27;s in a jet he&#x27;s an airplane he&#x27;s been in the airplane for 16 years do you believe that the military&#x27;s training this guy do you see even if a guy was sitting there the guy is a [ __ ] robot he&#x27;s been in the military for 16 years that&#x27;s what he does that&#x27;s not a weather balloon are you telling me that the eyewitness testimony of the two pilots who&#x27;s looking at this particular thing that they&#x27;ve never seen in their life and they&#x27;re blown away by that particular thing meaning that thing is ensconced in their head you&#x27;re telling me that their testimony isn&#x27;t that credible then there&#x27;s no burden of proof there&#x27;s nothing that would ever convince you at that point you could be abducted yourself they can do anal pearls on you you would get out and said I don&#x27;t believe in UFOs I&#x27;ve just been some kind of dosed with LSD or something look if the bar is that high the psychologist who gets off the airplane says I didn&#x27;t look at the spaceship because I don&#x27;t believe in UFOs come on it can&#x27;t be ridiculous cannot be ridiculous maybe this happen is soon and they&#x27;re unable to disclose on their own terms yeah maybe you made one of those things of um like slowly leaking the information out but speeding up the leak of the information because something needs to get out I don&#x27;t know I had the feeling that um Podesta really wanted to release the files I had the feeling that Hillary Clinton was actually gonna open up those files in the books it seems like this was something that they were planning and it&#x27;s very possible they were planning it with Hillary Clinton being in office almost like giving her a this kind of impetus serves as clothes once they themselves so I&#x27;m releasing information I suspect Donald Trump getting elected put a crimp in their plans that&#x27;s my suspicion I can&#x27;t don&#x27;t have to be true but if they&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a year and they probably assume Hillary Clinton was gonna get it they&#x27;ve been working with John Podesta Hillary Clinton herself on multiple occasions wanted TV asks the question about UFOs and she has said I am going to open the books yeah losing put a cramp in her plants the cramping in plants but it seems like they want to get the information up and at the very least whether US government comes out or not and saying yes this is disclosure whether or not they do that it&#x27;s not really it&#x27;s not necessary for reality to be what it is that makes sense it&#x27;s like the United States saying that area 51 doesn&#x27;t exist no of course that&#x27;s somewhat ridiculous that goes contrary to reality when people actually know that the place exists the government itself does not define what reality is meaning the government coming out saying there&#x27;s disclosure does not define actual reality it&#x27;s some kind of official legal thing of it in a way that they&#x27;re saying it but confirmation is something different confirmation in this this yes from an ironclad way of any bar of reasonable doubt there&#x27;s something coming to our shores that&#x27;s confirmation confirmation is more important than disclosure disclosure will come from the confirmation itself but I don&#x27;t know man I don&#x27;t know at the very least these guys are releasing this information and this oppose will be more information to come so that&#x27;s gonna be [ __ ] amazing if the journey to the sourcing I&#x27;m curious about the they&#x27;re a public traded company many people could invest in the company itself the aerospace smart it&#x27;s the quiet they don&#x27;t fascinated by in the science part I mean they&#x27;re literally trying to build craft that can replicate what those things are doing and the technology itself and hiring scientists and staff and everybody else to have those labs that&#x27;s in the open public view doing that stuff the question is can we pull it off give me honest that&#x27;s the operative question can they pull it off [ __ ] knows who would [ __ ] knows I gotta be honest I don&#x27;t want I don&#x27;t want their technology in the hands of human beings we&#x27;re horrible people we&#x27;re Apes with Spears with the spears you can only do it so much damage to yourself I don&#x27;t want this capitalism thing getting off the planet like that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a disease that needs to be destroyed before human beings every consider point of trying to interact with any other species how can you interact with someone of the species when your ex cussed and some religious belief came to me take care of your own [ __ ] citizens I mean it think of the ridiculousness of having one person in a country with 90 billion dollars enough resources for 90 billion dollars and yet have other people in third world conditions it makes no sense just so I&#x27;m saying the allocation of resources makes no sense you&#x27;re interacting with something else and you&#x27;re using capitalism which is unreal medium this [ __ ] isn&#x27;t real it&#x27;s it&#x27;s Lanie that&#x27;s created out of thin air and then give it in massive amounts to some while other people don&#x27;t necessarily have it&#x27;s kind of contrived lack of access to the things that people need there&#x27;s something slimy about interacting with something like that from a business standpoint that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s all do I really want to go into space shaking the capitalistic flag with it of conquests and we get over patient&#x27;s behavior and immoral behavior and unethical behavior and all these things that are associated with this Maximizer of your profits it&#x27;s awkward it&#x27;s weird I don&#x27;t want to take illusion and religion into any kind of negotiation or any interaction like this yeah I just I like the fact that they&#x27;re getting the stuff out so don&#x27;t misunderstand me hey I guess I just have mixed feelings I don&#x27;t trust us because they don&#x27;t trust us I get if he with the way the information gets released that being said I&#x27;ve always wanted this information to come out and I&#x27;ve always wanted it to be a top to be up for discussion and so it&#x27;s the topic up for discussion the informations coming out this is some level of confirmation in the way that this is come playing out what do other people do and and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s gonna bore down to how does the rest of the world react how do the United States react up to this point the reaction seemed have been muted it&#x27;s like the aliens come to our shores okay well yeah I&#x27;m going to get a hamburger you want anything from McDonald&#x27;s it&#x27;s like just like one day so ordinary day so maybe people that desensitize maybe all of the Alien movies for the past 70 or 80 years of kind of sunk into this feeling of space brother we&#x27;re more familiar with it I don&#x27;t know you think the news would have been more blind blowing almost not it was mind-blowing to me I was sitting there looking at it&#x27;s just the Ferb I I didn&#x27;t understand everybody else&#x27;s yeah yeah I didn&#x27;t get there yeah so let&#x27;s see America an unsure fraud I can&#x27;t read that I can&#x27;t read that language torrid critters geese I&#x27;m sorry welcome aliens got a minute talk about Jesus so you honestly believe Hillary Clinton would have hoped with the books and exposed top-secret to the public the truth booth no no no no that&#x27;s not what I said I said I believe Hillary Clinton would open the books and I do believe that and then she had the people around her when you look at the Podesta leaks those things were in their leaks themselves I think she was a true believer about innocence now the question becomes what&#x27;s true later and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the point what&#x27;s true meaning how was the information released if is the information released in a way that advantages somebody meeting the filter that the information is released through advantages someone something pushes a particular narrative which is a particular goal I said she would open the books I do think she would open the books well this she would open them in a way that would their their words anthem with a particular perspective yeah potentially that&#x27;s true that&#x27;s true but do I believe she was opening books oh yeah oh yeah I think she was a true believer yeah I think they she was a true believer five minutes after they show up the X why are you burning oil right it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re [ __ ] your planet up you understand that right you say yes we understand but yeah man but that being said what the Hillary Clinton was gonna open a book so now it&#x27;s kind of besides point now she failed she lost she&#x27;s a non-factor but yeah dude I actually do believe she&#x27;s been opening books I don&#x27;t think anyone you need to read the Podesta leaks on that also you need to read the pro leagues well they get to the point where they&#x27;re asking people they&#x27;re trying to get people to ask a question about UFOs she wants to be asked this question she wants to engage the audience in that very specific question there&#x27;s no point in doing that if that&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re interested in talking about she was interested in talking about she was found with you UFO book but that still was person who was on her side Podesta had been working to get your folks well released even in her husband&#x27;s presidency in the Obama presidency gone so far as to say the biggest upset in my career was not getting those UFO files released yeah they were true believers they&#x27;re true believers his rejected we dumb aliens are like nukes and without their Death Star if you have the capacity to get here you went like whatever the technology is that&#x27;s creating the level of energy that they&#x27;re using to either manipulate space or gravity it&#x27;s no contest like if you&#x27;re using a technology and you&#x27;re telling me that these guys have the capacity to travel across intergalactic space however they do it I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a portal I don&#x27;t know if they just zip from one end to the other in the ship I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something that I myself haven&#x27;t conceived the opening way through the move thinks I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s like a warp drive will you you expand space behind you in one end you end up in the other place at hyper we know at speeds if people were seeing it they would just look like you know space is contracting and particular thing who the [ __ ] knows who the [ __ ] knows but if they had the capacity to get you yes they have the capacity to weaponize their technology if you could weaponize that technology you&#x27;re shootin BB guns at something that has a capacity to use gravity itself as a weapon I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t get the fear of response man perhaps they just pray and show up they just pray to Jesus aliens I was telling the story once before that was um and I shouldn&#x27;t have laughed at the guy but it was [ __ ] hilarious the guy said he is um he said he was studying the alien things like he was really enamored with the alien idea and he picked up a book and he was reading this book on aliens and how to make contact with aliens I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s like see SETI or one of the techniques that are in dramas you know Peru but he&#x27;s doing the techniques he&#x27;s doing the meditations and he goes to bed and he says something is in his room and he said he feels himself being lifted off the bed like literally being picked up off the bed and moved towards the wall he say he freaks out he&#x27;s terrified he&#x27;s a he screaming and losing his [ __ ] and crying and freaking out and he falls back to the bed freaked out now from that day on he said that these things were demons these things were coming to get him and he has always sleep with the lights on he became a pastor and he agassi ensconced himself in Jesus for protection I that video always trips me up just isn&#x27;t this the level to which the guy ran funniest [ __ ] thing in the world now that being said if you&#x27;re lying in bed you can&#x27;t move and there&#x27;s something in your room that&#x27;s a freaky [ __ ] phenomena it&#x27;s terrifying it is a terrifying experience so I think it&#x27;s funny this guy became a preacher and all of a sudden all these things were demons and everything else a little bit of sympathy assuming that the guy&#x27;s not lying and taking the guy at his word for the moment a lot of the stuff I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s physical I think the latter to stuff is out-of-body stuff meeting with people filling themselves being lifted the energy the sensation that they&#x27;re feeling is almost equivalent to what people describe when you&#x27;re talking about out-of-body experience when you&#x27;re have a conscious OB and you&#x27;re aware of the sensations self it feels like you&#x27;re set on [ __ ] blaze it&#x27;s like your body is um charged up hearts beating out of your chest and yet you feel this rush of energy as as there&#x27;s a certain level of separation or you&#x27;re not looking with your physical eyes anymore you&#x27;re looking in a different way it&#x27;s hard to explain to those who experienced it it&#x27;s a weird freaky phenomena and if these people are experiencing something like that meaning first time you ever have somewhat of a conscious OBE or you&#x27;re somewhat aware and you&#x27;re having this out-of-body thing you&#x27;re either this kind of astral travel thing I would imagine will freak you the [ __ ] out freak you to [ __ ] out many of the states that a lot of people get in and they say they&#x27;re interacting with beings and everything else they may be interacting with something and that something may be somewhat non-physical in the way that that it&#x27;s interacting with us if it makes sense I mean it gets weird fair enough but I&#x27;m just talking about the experiences that people say they have what is that Harvard professor is it Matt he is an amazing book on this stuff where he was doing studies with these people who are saying who were experiences so some people have different experiences man some people get terrified and over the course of the experience themselves mellow out and find some value and the experience other people get terrified it&#x27;s like oh my god they&#x27;re taking me they&#x27;re doing bad things to be very horrible things are happening to me it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an unnerving experience saying it&#x27;s our own experience it is unnerving experience to be lying in bed frozen not being able to move and this is not a no be frozen this is not like your body locks up we&#x27;re you&#x27;re you know going into that kind of um state where your body freezes that&#x27;s different I&#x27;m okay with that one customer now talking about your mu bigger than all of a sudden your body can&#x27;t move you&#x27;re frozen and you hear something coming downstairs you hear something in your room that is a freaky [ __ ] thing it&#x27;s terrifying so I I understand people stare when they&#x27;re talking about the experience fair enough but oftentimes what you&#x27;ll find is those experiences mellow out with the person getting more context about the experience the evil Ilia thing just doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t fly it just doesn&#x27;t fly now would a zombie really be a threat passed a few crazy weird incidents how would a zombie be a threat can they create at a zombies I mean if they can bite you and they created another zombie it was somewhat of a problem disease we hella scary it&#x27;s SETI all of a sudden sees a signal they decode it and I know alien species is sending a message we&#x27;re or in our way oh do you think they would even tell something like that do you think they would say something like that or um the cookbook surf man never found it&#x27;s a cookbook it&#x27;s a cup buck children immense awesome to any species that can build a fetch to explore space can build machines to self-replicate and artificial intelligence administered and report back ok so that&#x27;s another theory that people have a hypothesis that the beings themselves are not necessarily on the ships that weren&#x27;t you saying is some kind of automated thing that maybe they are bidding space maybe they are building space maybe the g-forces they can experience because they were engineered to experience those g-forces but those things aren&#x27;t necessarily human or they&#x27;re not because they&#x27;re not human but they&#x27;re not necessarily I&#x27;m purely a physical thing that makes sense I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s poorly I&#x27;m biologically it&#x27;s not purely biological or an alien match of submit oh that would be worse that would be worse I think what&#x27;s worse than that is how would you know if they sent that message in that somebody comes out tomorrow says the alien message said submit now we&#x27;re on our way somebody relay that message to you you know that that&#x27;s what we said but what do you think the reaction would be to the public and what do you think the reaction would be to politicians of politics and other countries around the world but the information that you just received came from some of the sources that you yourself cannot validate stepmother was terrifying part about this is the ability to understand what&#x27;s actually true that&#x27;s the worst part the information that you&#x27;re getting this third party the information is coming from somewhere else in this case the pilot himself is explaining what took place but information that is coming from political sources do you trust your political source do you trust your politicians as being good decent ethical people do you trust the politicians to essentially do what mighty interest wants meaning if they&#x27;re doing what moneyed interests wants and they&#x27;re interacting with something from other shores do you really want capitalism to be the defining trait that you used to interact or something else I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s a religious belief sort of illusion I mean it&#x27;s a Ponzi scheme to figure out a way to get somebody massive amounts of resources why having other people not having in it and it is somewhat of a depraved species that can&#x27;t take care of itself even though it has more than enough abundance to take care of itself it just doesn&#x27;t do it they don&#x27;t grow up they&#x27;re not rational beings there&#x27;s no reason why some people want to interact with us in a direct way there&#x27;s no reason that being said with the technology get to the point that pushes us forward in a way that creates new systems of energy new devices and stuff like that maybe maybe but for whatever reason they&#x27;re bringing this information out now dark days this is 100% true with something like this all those dispensing information have a vested interests in doing so completely and not doing so completely knowledge is literally power in this case yeah I agree or what they&#x27;re saying is coded in a way that pushes people in a particular direction like I&#x27;m giving you a certain amount of information that information is gonna give you a perspective but I&#x27;m giving you a particular perspective it&#x27;s not the entirety of the perspective if you had all of the information you would think something different but I as a military apparatus would like to get the public into a particular thought process so the same we&#x27;d have this Russia history they have this other history about something else to get people riled up about something that&#x27;s not really an actual threat that&#x27;s my concern because that&#x27;s my concern so alright guys I am going to end this gasps if somebody donated super cash in this video I am sorry I didn&#x27;t get the chance to see it so I am gonna thank you in advance just in case somebody put something like this above and I just think it a chance to see it I was looking at the other videos but look I want to thank everyone for your support this video went massively long I don&#x27;t know how many people are still gonna be here looking at this particular video but if you do thank you please share please like anything on patreon and if you have been existing no patron thank you very much thanks guys you guys have a good night oh by the way I&#x27;m gonna Holly Sigler&#x27;s show tomorrow at 4 o&#x27;clock also Jerry Beck is gonna be on my show tomorrow at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>meaning he&#x27;s gonna be here live on the soapbox at 6 p.m. and I will be on Holly&#x27;s Sigler show tomorrow at 4 p.m. so love the conversation man thanks oh thanks man I appreciate it i I find this topper to be fascinating and interesting and my part of my point for making this video was what people are talking about the subject and you&#x27;re looking for this thing of okay what&#x27;s proof what&#x27;s a smoking gun how&#x27;re you this is monumental proof like any reasonable bar is looking at this and at the very least the most skeptical person in the world that&#x27;s at the very least a credible skeptic not an [ __ ] skeptic a credible skeptic looks at this and it very least comes to one real conclusion the pallet saw something he saw something beyond seeing something the pallet is looking at something that is doing some fantastic things and it&#x27;s not just the pallet it&#x27;s also one of the other pallets and it&#x27;s also the radar system observing this thing for five minutes if you&#x27;re gonna say visual perception is not credible and you&#x27;re looking at something for five minutes that&#x27;s [ __ ] fantastic and it&#x27;s blowing their mind I would say you&#x27;re insane the bar that we&#x27;re talking about here is actively looking at something writing it down and perceiving that thing writing a report about it having a bunch of backup information to validate the thing that you saw the only argument literally the only argument that the most skeptical person in the world can make is it&#x27;s one of ours that there&#x27;s no way for you to know that this is a alien craft fair enough fair enough but again we&#x27;re stuck with this issue of evidence and right now there is no evidence that any other nation around the world has technology to do what that craft was doing so I present this in my category of I think this makes a pretty goddamn decent argument that this is a real phenomena that&#x27;s something else is taking place that these guys are pushing information out from the standpoint of confirmation and that the PhD scientists that are in this particular video that&#x27;s gonna be at the bottom and the guy who was actually in a jet talking about this and we can even go back to Lou Alexandra it gets across a point but yes this is being confirmed this is a real [ __ ] phenomena this is something that&#x27;s actually legit so that&#x27;s my that&#x27;s my schpeel yeah that&#x27;s my [ __ ] I&#x27;ll leave it at that all right guys uh-oh it could be from a number of things fair enough I guess my main point that I want to get across is it is a thing it is the thing is that a weather balloon it&#x27;s not a rat it&#x27;s not a flying squirrel it&#x27;s not somebody throwing a boomerang it&#x27;s not a mosquito the guy certainly can make a determination was something was a craft that was the size of an airplane versus something that was a bird or pterodactyl or something else it&#x27;s not a satellite it&#x27;s not a flare it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s acting and operating with a particular intelligence associated with it this is in my video catalogue of the evidence the evidence bring me your skeptics bring me your skeptics yeah with you but responding to the idea that it could be time travel asleep yeah and this is our issue with this like it puts you in a bottomless pit you you end up in a rabbit hole like you get started thinking in stuff okay what can this be and right there you stuck you off a cliff off a [ __ ] cliff like look my rule for this stuff is this stone approach I go so far as I can see the last stone meaning I&#x27;ve experienced X this is within my context of experience so at the very least I can kind of see that I may not have experienced that but I can kind of see where that is coming from some of this stuff it&#x27;s so far outside my experience context there&#x27;s no way to appraise it you&#x27;re just kind of in the weeds definitely a petra dot though now aliens yeah no aliens pretty much pretty much you know the most terrifying thing and I ended on this do you trust your political leaders to represent your interests they&#x27;re passing trade deals has given up sovereignty to the United States do you trust those idiots in office so represent your interests the weak resistance that&#x27;s failing and caving on daca that one issue that they wanted a failing and caving on it miserably the resistance do you believe that these people that are laced and swimming in money that themselves rub their breasts and money when they get up in the morning those guys who touch themselves inappropriately with mighty donor money do you honestly believe that those guys I&#x27;m working in a best interest when did they start if they were working their best interests when do you believe that they will magically start working in your best interests if you&#x27;re interacting with something from all these shores the corruption of our government the failures of our government the miserable condition of the people that are in this government that&#x27;s a problem that&#x27;s a problem they can&#x27;t even pass a [ __ ] budget they can&#x27;t even figure out a way to keep a million people in the country there is not supposed to be kicked out the country or the very least you were brought to this country and for all intensive purposes all Americans do technicality or not but fall into two purposes or America this is a dysfunctional government and we&#x27;re adding aliens to this mix that&#x27;s terrifying that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying that&#x27;s terrifying we&#x27;ll see these are strange days stay tuned so alright guys if you enjoy the content feel free to share like subscribe and of course you can
