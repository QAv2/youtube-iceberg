            <p>subject for this evening is soviet weather engineering over north america which they have been doing since the beginning of 1966 1967 that was the first shot our attempt at influencing the weather directly over the united states they then lapsed into a lot of not influencing it for a period of years and in 1983 particularly really opened up the big guns after having energized the infamous woodpecker signals the so-called over the rising radars in the communication band in the mid 1970s the first thing i&#x27;m going to have to tell you is that there are three kinds of electromagnetics and only one is being used today in the western world the first kind is the kind we all study as electrical engineers and even us nuclear engineers study a little bit of it and it&#x27;s classical electromagnetics the foundations of that go back before the civil war it&#x27;s quite old and there are serious flaws and many eras in it as is quite well known in a few circles the second kind first of all let me characterize the first kind of electromagnetics everything is due to the force fields the so-called electric field magnetic field if that reduces to zero in an area you don&#x27;t have any more electromagnetics going on in there the potentials themselves are considered to be mathematical figments now i&#x27;m going to be giving you a little background i&#x27;m going real fast through it but you&#x27;ll need this to understand what i&#x27;m talking about in the weather engineering and understand it so please bear with me during the first part we&#x27;re going to have a little quick sledding the second kind of electromagnetics came from quantum mechanics and it&#x27;s exactly opposed the primary and real things are the potentials and the force fields so-called are totally derived by differentiating operations so you see a flip-flop of 180 degrees about how the two approaches regard electromagnetics further in quantum mechanics when the electric field and the magnetic field reduce to zero in an area you still may have the potentials and if these potentials which are the real things going on interfere with each other you can have real effects still produced in in charged particle systems real physical systems as a matter of fact in 1959 a classic paper by aranoff and baum in physical review pointed this out very strongly and since then part of that has come to be called the bom aronoff effect or sometimes the iron-off bomb effect it had been in physics 30 years at that point pointed out by richard feynman the nobel prize winner and ignored it has continued to be ignored in the nearly 30 years since 1959 when it was strongly pointed out by obama arena what we are saying ladies and gentlemen microworld can get action at a distance that&#x27;s no longer a dirty word and we can get action even when there&#x27;s no ordinary electromagnetics going on and i&#x27;m going to show you how to do that and in the process i&#x27;m going to show you how to change the mass and inertia of an object affect its rate of flow through time affect the gravitational field and so forth now the third kind of electromagnetics is the mechanism by means of which you do those things in other words you reduce the ordinary electromagnetics to zero electric field magnetic field deliberately you then you do this by making a zero system you oppose the vectors so that they sum to zero but they are still there in the substructure hey when we studied electromagnetics they forgot to tell us that a zero vector was not nothing it can be a system of very active forces each of which is time varying and yet the system will not be detectable by any ordinary instrument it turned out that the unorthodox scientific community in the united states have been using this for some years but not expressing it quite that succinctly for example the hooker patents what we are saying now is that if we do this if we make deliberate zeros but we make them with vectors which are still there and active we have a new kind of electromagnetics a third kind and i have dubbed that scalar electromagnetics and i hope the name the reason for the name will become clear a little later i won&#x27;t bother to read that thing we simply have a zero vector envelope but it&#x27;s the substructure that we have placed within a zero that is fantastic in terms of modern physics we have reached into the virtual world what happens before physical change occurs and we now can deliberately engineer it let me say that again in case it went by you with this simple mechanism with few calls and transistors and so forth by making deliberate zeroes we can deliberately engineer the straightener equation and we can deliberately affect the probabilities of quantum mechanics the hidden variable theory now becomes directly engineerable in all the implications of what i have said what had been statistical before now becomes at least partly deterministic i&#x27;m going to jump now a whole bunch of years in 1921 at the instigation or recommendation of albert einstein a man by the name of palusa succeeded published a paper where he had successfully united electrical field and gravitational field in a common unified theory to do that he had to add another physical dimension and a very strange thing emerged there&#x27;s really only one field in nature if you&#x27;re looking at that hyperspace it is the five dimensional gravitational field and it intersects our world in two things one thing we call the electromagnetic field and the other thing we call the gravitational field in the general sense general relativity the ability to curve and warp and twist space-time itself and by the way the electromagnetics just turned out to be the fifth dimensional aspect of that so we added one more space dimension which we do not see klein a few years later explained what happened to that dimension it&#x27;s really rolled up around every little point in our space quite nice mathematically and it&#x27;s real by the way but the theory languished for many years until really about the early to mid seventies when the new symmetries in the forefront of physics and particle physics began to see that with that type of geometry you could get in all these weird particles and you could get in all the forces you really could begin to approach a unified theory of all forces of nature and the physicists became very excited the modern theory a variant of that theory calusa klein geometry has 11 dimensions 10 space one time all but the three ordinary space dimensions we see are considered to be rolled up in little circles around every point but with that thing and super gravity you can get in all of the particles and everything we know into physics in a single unified theory and the physicists are excited that&#x27;s the hottest thing in physics they just haven&#x27;t discovered yet that it is directly engineerable in the simplest fashion you ever dreamed of i&#x27;m going to give you a very simple thing now to let you understand what i&#x27;m talking about this is schematic so don&#x27;t think of the thing as being spatially separated between the two little circles on the on the plane the plane represents our ordinary world the hand represents an extra dimension so it&#x27;s that fifth dimensional uh geometry that uh calusa came up with in 1921. the hand itself represents that fifth dimensional gravitational field which intersects our world in two fashions one electromagnetic shown by the forefinger extended that intersection and the other by the thumb which is our gravitational field as we see it in the little intersections and both of the intersections by the way at the same point they are not spatially separated normally we don&#x27;t make vector zeros nobody ever trained us to do that in electromagnetics there is not a single textbook either physics or electromagnetics in the united states of america or in the western world that dwells upon what you do when you deliberately make such vector zeros i&#x27;m almost willing to state that probably not a single orthodox physicist has made such an experiment if they are it will be only one or two of them but notice what we do if we deliberately zero the electromagnetic intersection which is what we&#x27;re doing when we make the zero but we control what goes into the zero we can put energy in there or we can take the energy out when we do that it&#x27;s coming in and out of the thumb as gravitational energy directly as curvature of space time now what have we said we have said that rigorously with that simple mechanism i can provide the direct conversion of electromagnetic energy into gravitational field energy or vice versa now if you want to do any gravity gentlemen there it is and the unorthodox researchers have been doing anti-gravity a little bit in this country for a period of years like levitating 65 pounds like plywood which is not magnetic field so with a very simple thing and looking at it through modern eyes and adding that single thing we can now use electromagnetics to make gravitational field energy in the general sense or vice versa we can warp engineer and twist space time at will as we wish in whatever pattern we wish and it&#x27;s been in the literature if you cared to notice since 1921 i won&#x27;t dwell on this i will simply state that all that a mass is anyway a particle of mass is in fact a trapped scalar resonance i&#x27;m going to give you a quick once over about taylor resonance we&#x27;ll go on take a normal resonance system with a wave moving back and forth in a cavity so that it&#x27;s in phase and coherent suppose that there were two waves moving along together but the second wave the electric magnetic field were 180 out in the first one that&#x27;s a scalar resonant system your normal instrument won&#x27;t even see it we can build special detectors and have that will see it that&#x27;s all the mass is but you can make a current of that kind of resonance and you can pipe that current down a wire or you can add to that resonance in the system or you can take it away what did i say i said you can pump the mass and inertia directly into an object and increase it or you can pump it out of there if you pump all of it out there it&#x27;ll dematerialize on you and the statements i am making are based in part on experimental evidence in the laboratory private proprietary laboratories now the scalar wave that is the wave that has a zero resultant for the electric field and a zero resultant for the magnetic field but is composed of components which are waving and moving and communicating and everything else is the universal wave in the universe totally undiscovered as yet in western science you can make it for 10 cents on the laboratory bench you can convert a radar very simply to be a scalar radar for example these waves come from and go to the nucleus they go right through the faraday cage they do not interact with the electrons unless you have the most extreme non-linear situation you&#x27;ve ever heard of they don&#x27;t move electrons and you can go right through any faraday cage you can go right through the earth for example you go through the ocean with megahertz signals using these techniques as we sit here talking the soviet union is communicating worldwide uh as a 10 days ago they were communicating on well over 37 frequencies in their command and control systems for the large weapon systems they built for strategic weapons in this fashion i have a personal friend that can deliver on the shelf the communication system prototype already built and tested that will prove that statement and i challenge anybody in the united states outside of him at the present time to measure that communication system these are nuclear waves they communicate between nuclei and if you put in that substructure the correct pattern you can go in and transmute elements in modern physics to make a proton a neutron or vice versa all you got to do is flip one quark and that is simply a pattern in the substructure a man was nominated for the nobel prize in 1977 for proving that biological systems transmute elements even though they only have millivolts and microvolts to use and i bet you didn&#x27;t even know that his name was curver today is dead all the nuclei of the universe are in constant communication much of vacuum space time is made up of these scalar waves between the nuclei throughout the universe another thing that came out of the general relativistic wave these are general relativistic waves special relativity does not apply we are always in a curved space time when we&#x27;re using them part of the thing that came out of the theory is you are no longer confined to the speed of light at all if you&#x27;re clever you can get almost any velocity you want to whether it&#x27;s slower in speed light or faster a tesla for example who was using these kinds of waves shortly after 1900 and keeping it a deep dark secret tesla reported speeds are 50 times the speed of light i have personally participated in an experiment which kicked out an electromagnetic wave of this type at eight times the speed of light if you&#x27;ll check the russian literature and i&#x27;ll give you the references if you&#x27;re interested the speed of light is variable anyway it&#x27;s been known for 80 years by the astronomers that the speed of light in a hard vacuum on the surface of the earth is a little faster than the speed of light in the deep space away from the charged particles so these are nuclear waves they are not electromagnetic waves that interact with the electron shells they electron they interact with the nuclei and with the internal components of the proton and the neutron what i have the audacity to say to you is that we now have a tool that we do not have to talk about nuclear physics we can go in there and engineer the nucleus and transmutation is only one of the things that can be done and again the basis for this has been well established in the literature since 1921 with these waves you see most of our ideas of the macro world are given to us by the ordinary photon interaction which is almost always an interaction with the electron shells this is a different order of reality we&#x27;re really dealing now in hyperspaces at least 11 dimensions and the world looks quite different indeed and physical reality in this kind of physics looks quite different indeed from the ideas we have in our head from classical electromagnetics and classical physics and the normal macro world just as quantum mechanics was a drastic change to classical mechanics this is an even further drastic change to quantum mechanics because it makes what had been statistical now deterministic and engineerable i&#x27;m an engineer i don&#x27;t want to play statistics i want to make models and i want to make the sucker work the great cosmic engines of the universe do not operate with the residues of the differential operators making the force field that&#x27;s the garbage is thrown out the great cosmic engines of the universe operate inside vector zero systems that includes all the nuclei in the universe and everything inside them that modern physics has found out about okay this kind of wave can be modeled as a longitudinal wave i won&#x27;t go into that whole treatment i&#x27;ll just say that whereas you model the normal wave as a transverse wave you model this one as a longitudinal wave and indeed when you interfere this wave you break up the coherence of the substructure they now no longer sum to zero and guess what that gives you it gives you a non-zero vector in the e field and the b field out there real energy now appears at a distance out there from a two transmitters or two wave projectors and yet what&#x27;s in the middle is not energy flow in the normal sense that we transmit an ordinary electromagnetic wave it&#x27;s really an artificial potential the closest thing we have to calling it is an electrostatic wave a more accurate description is it is a direct wave in the curvature of space time itself it&#x27;s a general relativistic wave or gravitational wave so if we have two projectors and they might be two modified radar antenna and we intersect them at a distance we can produce energy at a distance and that energy arises in the space time of that intersection zone it doesn&#x27;t matter if that&#x27;s inside a mountain or inside a missile or inside an airplane inside a human body i have given you now the secret of how to build tesla&#x27;s vaulted death ray to mow down people by the thousands which you can do with that device right there and you can modify ordinary radars to do that it has another very nice feature in modern physics space time has a very high charge very high potential they call it a pseudo potential if i lower the potential of my projectors below zero in other words i make negative potentials pretty strong negative what happens in the intersection zone is not the appearance of energy but the disappearance of energy when i bend space time if i bend it in one fashion the local region looks like a source it looks like it&#x27;s producing energy if i bend it the other way it looks like a sink it looks like energy is disappearing this is real this is general relativity now conservation of energy law that we applying special relativity has gone out the window as is well known in physics in a local general relativistic system you do not have to conserve energy at all what really happens is i either put the energy in here and get it out there or take it out from there and i get it back here and i better dump it or burn out my projectors well it&#x27;s you make a dump and you simply transform it in the other mode and switch it over to the dome that&#x27;s the way the soviets do it nature has been doing this all the time and fault zones and stresses in the rocks and all the interference of the scalar potentials that are made there create fields of the distance glowing lights this is a picture of earthquake lights from the us geological service there are 1200 locations in the united states alone where you can see glowing balls of energy electromagnetic energy controls energy at a distance on any decent weather night if you care to go out there and look and take pictures it&#x27;s easy to investigate the so-called earth stress lights and with this modality by using one additional thing by using three-dimensional interferometry and using fourier expansions multiple frequencies you can make such controlled balls of electromagnetic energy at a distance just like that like the snap of a finger we have done that in the laboratory the human system and everything that&#x27;s a mammal on the rats the roaches everything else even have been doing this all the time we measure brain waves we measure the residue e field and b field that&#x27;s going on what&#x27;s really going in the brain is all the little ion fields that make electric fields and make magnetic fields that sum to zero the structure of that is the real activity of the human brain i think without dwelling on it that you can see the two cerebral hemispheres make a scalar interferometer and if those patterns are correct you can project or create energy at a distance like inside a metal object and you can get metal bending that way now the kind of metal bending i&#x27;m talking about is not the amazing randy bending something on his belt buckle when you&#x27;re not looking at him i&#x27;m talking about what jack houck does when he takes a control sample and another sample and a little old lady in tennis shoes who just happens to be a four-star general&#x27;s wife bends that thing which is thick as your little finger and the highest test steel the known to aerospace industry bends that thing in a angle and it turns blue he takes both samples the control sample and that sample back to the laboratory sections and looks at them under the electron microscope and the one that is the control sample has the normal grain structure the one that is the one that&#x27;s bent by the human being for real not fakery has no grain structure the grain structure&#x27;s been destroyed it looks like the surface of the moon has been subjected to intense point heating throughout the grain structure i have just given you the physical mechanism and the physics by which the body is able to do that it is real it is not a fake jack how can i believe does he not work for your company excellence fellow excellent scientist i won&#x27;t dwell on what all else the biological system can do with that let us suffice to say that we can derive rigorously in terms of physics not metaphysics all of the mechanisms for parapsychology well if you were weaponizing that for a big weapon if you hit this thing explosively with your projectors and you fire two pulses so the pulses meet an interesting thing occurs if you fire in the high potential mode you get an electromagnetic explosion at a distance if you fire in a low potential mode you get a cold explosion at a distance the sudden withdrawal of energy in the intersection zone both types of weapons widely deployed by the soviet union and tested the recent some years back so-called booms off the east coast some of those were seen as flashes estimated to be about 100 tons of tnt equipment were actually the orientation and alignment of such howitzers from the soviet union they have had such hunches since april 1963 specifically the first operational test was april 11 1963 100 miles north of puerto rico the most dramatic uh expression of the cold explosion in recent times occurred on april the 9th 1984 and the papers fortunately won&#x27;t let this one go off the coast of japan about 150 or 200 miles well really 200 miles from downtown tokyo out near the carols a sudden gigantic explosive eruption occurred above the water a cloud so to speak very dense rose rapidly to 60 000 feet into 150 mile diameter five 747s out there one of which was piloted by a former b-52 pilot who thought he just seen the most massive nuclear explosion you ever saw it had the mushroom shape i prepared evasive action turned off course put on oxygen mask prepared and braced for a shock wave which never came there was no flash this was the cold explosion a laser physicist friend of mine that i&#x27;m working with in california in the laboratory where we&#x27;re using only milliwatts at best and we&#x27;re using distances about that far has done a little cold explosion over a dish of water and you get the mushroom cloud exactly like that rising that thing was called everything under the sun bubbling gas you know plumes all sorts of things it was a cold explosion the ocean there is 21 000 feet deep it&#x27;s too deep for submarines indicates it was a man-made phenomenon but it didn&#x27;t end there dr daniel walker and colleagues who have access to sophisticated underwater acoustic equipment and seismic equipment did a complete study on that thing is published in the journal science recently as a matter of fact after his study he successfully ruled out any kind of ordinary known natural phenomenon so we&#x27;re left with a conclusion that he and his colleagues made it&#x27;s either a man-made phenomenon or an as yet unknown natural phenomenon we shouldn&#x27;t have too many natural phenomena unknown that explode for 150 miles particularly when it&#x27;s happened several times before in the open literature that is a rigorous paper published in the journal science science very recently unfortunately the journal saw fit to turn down my colleague and my explanation of what was going on and a complete date list of incidents and history and types of soviet weapons to back it up here&#x27;s just one more incident to show you that these types of sudden mushroom rises from the ocean or near the ocean above the ocean and gigantic size have occurred repeatedly with other suspicious incidents that particular earthquake is highly suspect can you not see that if i dump energy with very powerful radiators and continue to dump energy on both sides of a fault zone it doesn&#x27;t matter where the extra energy comes from with the piezoelectric effect i&#x27;m transforming that into mechanical stress and if i do that long enough and build up enough energy that plate is going to slip and you&#x27;ll get a natural earthquake natural looking earthquake man-made that&#x27;s how you make earthquakes well if you do it in the cold explosion you&#x27;re going to have to dump a lot of that energy when it&#x27;s 150 miles across that is one whale of a lot of energy that you suddenly extracted and here it comes it&#x27;s headed for you it&#x27;ll simply melt your projectors unless you dump it somewhere so you switch the projector into the transmit mode and you catch it and hold it in a storage bank temporarily and then you fire it off somewhere where it won&#x27;t do any harm like bennett here island an exhaust that is 150 miles long seen by our weather satellites from a site that repeatedly exhibits these almost 100 now that we&#x27;ve seen this particular exhaust is about one a little over one degree above the horizontal now volcanoes don&#x27;t do that they don&#x27;t look like that let&#x27;s see the next slide from the same island we see double puffs indicating the interferometer transmitters we see multiple puffs within them sometimes and in fact the satellites have even from time to time caught the actual burst showing that it&#x27;s an explosive beginning of the exhaust these are weather satellites us weather satellites they are not classified unfortunately they&#x27;re from way out there we need some low-level satellite photography which i simply do not have would be interesting to look at it if i had it here&#x27;s one where the explosive burst was caught just erupting from the island these things here blaze away sometimes for hours and hours and days of the time with those kinds of massive exhausts of heat and energy i&#x27;ll show you where they&#x27;re pulling out the energy and what they&#x27;re doing with it uh that&#x27;s about the plumes just to show you that way back there from those exhaust plumes off that island we had some airplanes flew through it they&#x27;re mostly ice particles from the expansion and so forth as you would expect when you&#x27;ve dumped the phenomenon actually you entrain a lot of the cold air you get circulations you get all kinds of effects there so you do get a lot of ice formed a little mud and this kind of thing there is a second candidate right now courtesy of some effort by tom harrell and some kind folks um up at the sat the satellite imagery outfit this one shows and i can&#x27;t bend it begin to pronounce that name can you say that for me off the slide novaya zimla which is an island north of the soviet union up in the arctic circle there not too far really as a geographical distance goes from bennett island and here again on the extreme left you see another exhaust and you see the gigantic weather circulation that so much additional energy the important area causes you see the swirl all the way around the thing stripping vapor energy and vapor water and so forth from the snow and ice and everything else okay well in the mid 70s we got a shock suddenly the communication systems throughout the world in the communications ban that is from five to thirty megahertz were widely being interrupted by extremely powerful signals coming from the soviet union to my knowledge we have not yet located the transmitters they had many resemblances to what we call an over the rising radar so we promptly label label them on over the horizon radar the so-called woodpecker signal is named from the chirp signal that sounds like a woodpecker&#x27;s beak hitting a flat block you can hear them out there most every night chattering away still interfering in fact they now sell the ham radio operators filters so that it operates through that filters out in that region but what they actually did shortly before the death of bregenell they started adjusting across the united states a great interference pattern from multiple transmitters of the woodpecker radars now i&#x27;m not interested except for biological effects which can be damaging in the conventional e field b field signals on that radar but we don&#x27;t have anybody who&#x27;s measuring the scalar component the substructure in the zero they don&#x27;t even have the instruments to do it if they wish such instruments provided i have a friend who&#x27;ll do it for price not me he will he built the instruments and designed them but what they&#x27;re doing here is the substructure interference which is important because that&#x27;s where all the real energy is you can put as much energy as you wish into that substructure and the normal instrument will not even see it it won&#x27;t even detect it anyway where the interference was if you&#x27;ll check the woodpecker signals you&#x27;ll see that&#x27;s the type of interference pattern they set up an interference pattern over the us and they left signals signatures when you adjust these things and you adjust with little slips you pop out energy you get rumbles and booms and air quakes and all this and those things happened from florida north alabama virginia all up through the carolinas up through mid england up through the middle of the country texas all over west coast everywhere these mysterious cracks and rumbles and booms and pops and snaps everywhere while they were adjusting the grid well they got it adjusted by shortly after the end of the year that is in early 1983 they got this thing adjusted and they started pouring it on us so that spring early spring you had extremely severe flooding because what they did you simply determined by your timing and interferometry and fourier transforms which one of the grid cells you want to activate they&#x27;re much finer than this by the way over huntsville alabama a friend and i saw this grid from horizon to horizon and even plowed field roads north of south and from horizon to horizon in even plowed rose from east to west and that is not natural does not happen anyway what they did is you if you take energy out of one cell that produces a low zone a low pressure zone if you add energy in another cell that produces a high pressure zone i think you can see if i scan my radar rotate it the beam either electromagnetically or rotate the antenna gently and move those highs and lows along i can direct and capture and control the jet streams and that&#x27;s exactly what they did the jet streams had a classic bin dipping way down south abnormally far and then roaring up the adirondack chain and so we had all kinds of good weather following that pattern and the deviation of the jet stream even the journal science has published an article from a study that shows in the last decade the variation in the weather over north america has been greater than can be statistically expected except once in 1200 years that summer we got a drought if you recall we lost half the corn crop in the united states in one summer from the extreme drought when you form one of the patterns you get a signature in the clouds you see a little droplet of water is formed around a dust particle a little droplet of ice is cold enough and it makes a little transistor or a little diode in the middle and that thing forms its own little e field and these things line up and what you get is you get a ring almost a complete ring about two thirds of a ring of clouds like geometrically drawn around the peak where the energies is being manipulated and you get radial lines thin radial lines running directly away for 10 or 15 miles sort of like the old rising sun symbol in world war ii we saw these all over the united states here&#x27;s one taken a block and a half from my home by the time i could run in and get my camera it had passed just over the mountain but you can see those are cloud streamers those are not light rays these are not crepuscular waves at all these are cloud rays these are radials giant radios i then went ahead and chased that thing over the mountain to get a little better shot of it they had cut the energy so the middle ring filled up but the rays were still apparent in the next slide although i&#x27;m now shooting at an extreme distance through a telescopic lens but you can see if the lights were a little dimmer you could see the cross hatch interference pattern in the streamers also so we have both the streamers and we have the crosshatch interference pattern existing in the clouds that&#x27;s over huntsville alabama here&#x27;s one that a correspondent sent in and again we have dim light the clouds are actually more prominent than that from california they were seeing them all over the united states these very prominent very significant patterns everywhere i went on radio kabc in los angeles calling everybody&#x27;s attention to this two or three times delivered papers at a couple of symposia and we saw a change we saw the dog on things start getting active most of the time at night there&#x27;s another pattern sometimes they use two patterns close together when that happens the internal rings go out and the rays become much thicker and they become absolutely boat-tailed toward the center now when they cut the power the center fills up immediately with clouds i have been unfortunate and although i have seen classic ones of this i have not yet got a decent picture i will show you what i have which is not a good photograph and the photographs then therefore should not be accepted as proof until i get better photographs which i will do sooner or later again multiple witnesses over huntsville alabama a good friend of mine and i saw this very early in the morning this system motoring along absolutely classic i was very hard-pressed that day on my normal job and did not take off from work and go home and get my camera i have regretted it ever since deeply i didn&#x27;t realize how rare the phenomenon was going to be to be able to get one that perfect but it was absolutely flawless and it looked just like that right over huntsville alabama moving along it over 20 to 30 miles an hour a second one came over later that day there&#x27;s the dates and the time uh in their weather control if you recall they gave us anomalous winter the very cold december snap of 1983 which broke all the records everywhere many of them since records have been kept on the cold and that was deliberately engineered they left signatures before they did it with these kinds of things all over the us we saw the same day remnants of a second twin giant radial system that motored along across huntsville alabama now here is one they&#x27;ve cut the power but the system persists for a while it&#x27;ll process for several hours but it&#x27;ll fill in it will lose its classic shape but you know even the filled in picture is better than no picture but i don&#x27;t have a lens which will take the entire sky i need a fisheye which i&#x27;m going to get as soon as i can afford it but what i want to show you is this is on the i believe the northeast here and i want to focus your attention here over to the right you will see the lines of the clouds going there they go all over the sky back to the other radial on the other side completely over your head is this giant radial connected up to two points even though it&#x27;s filling in now because the power has been cut in this photograph we&#x27;re just a little bit back around from where we were to the left to show that the same cloud streaks and radials are going over on the left and they go completely across for about 15 miles to the next point the next radial intersection where they link up now we&#x27;ll show that other linkage down on the other end as a separate shot and this really as you can see it does go on down there and link up it&#x27;s just beyond the tree line where it links it&#x27;s faded on that end pretty good but we had a whole two radial system a poor picture here i admit but having seen much better ones in this when i did not have a camera or access to one i can only tell you that in the future i will show you a decent photograph if they keep this thing up over huntsville alabama long enough and if tom harold and other assorted good stalwart fellows help me keep watch for them when i&#x27;m working inside and not out looking at the sky well you wonder what happened to you on february the 1st let me tell you what happened to you on february the 1st on december the 8th they started this little goodie out in california they were having these little rumbles and cracks and pops and snaps off the coast there from from los angeles they had it for about a week off and on i was there on the radio show delivering an address on free energy went on another show to try to explain what these things was and i predicted based on this that they had finished adjusting the grid and there would be a violent or drastic change in the weather within 48 hours i went on the radio and i made that statement and the radio announcer said you sound like a wacko and cut me off that&#x27;s some of the mild things i&#x27;ve been caused it does not matter i operate on the thing that if the experiments keep working and they contradict the theory the true scientific method says you must change the theory not insist that the experiment is false if it continues to be replicated so what happened was they then when they got it adjusted a high wind came up very suddenly totally unexpected blew down all the trees on the boulevards they had wrecks and everything i was there during this process and it was within 48 hours from that prediction violent sort of wind storms winds got very high in the los angeles area and all the orange trees were laying over flat everywhere through the boulevards it went on down in texas spawned tornadoes and roared at the adirondack chain and then they bent the jet stream in the most anomalous fashion they bent that sucker right down the west coast of the united states all the way down to the bottom and turned it and went across the bottom skimming across just above the bottom of texas and then roaring up the adirondack chain i&#x27;ve never seen that fashion before but they set about doing that in december 1984 they kept playing with the jet stream they did all kinds of nice experiments they split the thing into two they made it form into wise and looked like they were just checking out to see what all they could do but with this fashion here what you do is when you turn you entrain circulation from way out over the pacific as shown by the purple arrows you pull moisture all the way from out in the pacific and suck it up right across the united states and if you do the neat little trick with the cold stuff you get enough coal stuff bent down from canada and the arctic here guess what you&#x27;re gonna get with all that moisture you&#x27;re gonna get snow and ice in february the first they let us have it and that&#x27;s our infamous ice storm right here in huntsville alabama all this was going on just before that having gone several days without power myself uh i&#x27;m very sympathetic to the fact that i don&#x27;t like that and i hope you didn&#x27;t either but that was given to you courtesy of the hammer and sickle boys okay there are a couple other little things i&#x27;ll throw in just for little goodies you may or may not have seen the paper on the associated press release but i&#x27;ll give you the mechanism and everybody else will tell you i&#x27;m totally crazy and i&#x27;ll say to you then you explain it or ask them to and listen to their jaw fly open and find out they have no explanation at all because this explanation isn&#x27;t in the textbook the navy was having a chat drop off the coast from san diego a very strange and sudden and unexpected wind again arose you know when we form these lows wind rushes in so we got another one and here came a signature a sudden strange unexpected wind caught the entire chap cloud they were about 150 miles off coast there and blew the thing in towards san diego now this is the standard micro wire chaff actually with a dielectric with a coating on it there&#x27;s a certain way it&#x27;s structured for some kinds of chap that we have shown in the laboratory will reflect a scalar wave i won&#x27;t go into that that&#x27;s proprietary to my friend imagine every little piece of chaff up there if the bandwidth if a scalar signal in that frequency in its bandwidth that it&#x27;s cut for is there it will reflect it that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re saying and from any two of those things randomly wiggling and jiggling around you&#x27;re going to have random intersections interferences from the reflected scalar beams and in that little random interference zone you&#x27;re going to get a sudden flash a sudden sparkle it won&#x27;t be visual but a sudden production of ordinary electromagnetic energy and so imagine a zone around the chaff cloud with little twinkles if you could see ordinary electromagnetic energy if you could see them as visual things twinkling and twinkling away and these represents little instantaneous kindling of energy points when they move through the system area they appear in the space time faraday cages and your emi shielding we all use in military equipment have absolutely zero effect on them they knocked out over 60 power to over sixty thousand homes in san diego and you had the strange thing of the part of the city uh very angry at the navy and claiming the navy had done this and the navy set out an investigation and got the foggiest notion what happened i just told you what happened and gave you the mechanism that isn&#x27;t all that happens i hope you realize that i am stating that in my opinion the soviet union has been waging a certain kind of undeclared war on the united states for a period of over two decades and that several hundred people have already died in that war american citizens illegally all of you recall the mysterious airliner the airliner that fell mysteriously rather for six miles in about a couple of minutes what happened well he&#x27;s motoring along up there coming in towards los angeles he&#x27;s out of san francisco there he hits a sudden little pocket of turbulence ring in the bells some interference going on where the energy wasn&#x27;t zero anymore and you&#x27;re getting energy one fashion or the other or ripples turbulence all of a sudden one engine flames out just past that well one of the things that will kindle this stuff into being is a plasma or a flame</p>
