            <p>hello my name is Joan Manan and I am one of the editors of the ebook gravity superconductors interactions Theory and experiments published by Bon now uh what&#x27;s so special about the interactions between gravity and superconductors we know that in superconductors matter is actually in a very special State one that is called a coherent Quantum state but um according to general relativity this special State should be not relevant for the gravitational interactions of super conductors now uh general relativity is a beautiful Theory it is probably our best theory of gravitation but we know that it is not complete because because it does not include Quantum effects and the so-called theory of quantum gravity is uh quite new and so many of its details are not yet understood um nevertheless there are good reasons to believe that um if gravitational Quantum effects exist at all they would find favorable conditions in superconductors and one of the most important Quantum effects is of course uh stimulated emission of radiation now if stimulated emission of gravitational radiation can be obtained this would make possible the design of a gravitational laser however this could be quite different from the familiar Optical lasers because we think the radiation could only be virtual with two main consequences first uh the range of the beam would be limited and uh second the beam would contain uh less energy than an optical beam and much more momentum this is of course a very interesting idea and there are many more theoretical ideas described in the book and also there are descriptions of important experiments like those of B glov and timer so there are in total uh 12 chapters in the ebook written by 10 Autos I can really recommend it thank you</p>
