            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>so I&#x27;d like to talk about some geometric algebra books also called Clifford algebras and uh hus is the one who didn&#x27;t invent it but uh sort of pioneered and and told everyone that hey we need to be doing this and um so he has a couple of books they&#x27;re a bit expensive this is one of them well he has more books but a couple of them particularly on this uh topic and now if you want to become a master of geometric algebra well uh you probably want them but um my recommendation would be more this book now it&#x27;s a fairly thick book and it&#x27;s not going to be easy but it&#x27;s more intuitive if you want um sort of an introduction to the subject now it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a bit difficult and I&#x27;ve got these other books too that are even uh more difficult uh this one&#x27;s a nice one uh sort of tangential to the subject so I&#x27;d recommend this one first uh donon and lenb very good</p>
