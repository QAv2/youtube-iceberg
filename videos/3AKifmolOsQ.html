            <p>[Music] in the laws of nature there is nothing impossible except that the state of your mind makes itself cleaning up this planet is going to be a big job if we&#x27;re going to get the climate back to what we want a lot of work to be done but one thing is certain you need energy that&#x27;s important basically the design is a conventional generator so tapped into zero point energy the only person that i know of who has ever succeeded in making a serial effect generator is john cyril the electron flow is accelerated to an extremely high rate and it creates a vacuum around the device and in that vacuum you develop numbing cold and numbing cold as we know today is a function of superconductivity it also is a function of gravitational force for over 60 years john searle has tried to give to the world a new kind of energy system one that would free mankind from the burdens of oil and fossil fuels from his dreams as a child in pre-world war ii england came an understanding of mathematics and magnetic forces that would change his life from a childhood game of hopscotch came a new understanding of magic squares a mathematical principle that is five thousand years old [Music] he could think laterally and not be bound by conventional rules taught through conventional methods that may have an adverse effect on the human mind john searle is known all over the world as the inventor of the serial effect generator a magnetic device consisting of one or more rings also called plates and a number of cylindrical rollers that when in motion generate electricity the generator is a magnetic device that is totally magnetic it is its own prime mover it will self-start and continue to run and as far as we know we can say never stop the serial effect is an effect based on magnetic fields that generate the continual motion of magnetized rollers around magnetized rings producing electric energy the generator runs in harmony with nature the law of the squares is harmony with nature but the serial effect is a great deal more than a simple generator in our polluted and energy starved world it is the hope of all mankind that we find the solutions that lead us to both prosperity and harmony with nature is it possible to maintain mankind&#x27;s industrial output and at the same time reduce the pollutants that are slowly killing planet earth is there a way to increase the productivity of the human species as we rid ourselves of the poisons and recover the waters of this world if we&#x27;re going to get the climate back to what we want a lot of work could be done one thing you certainly need energy that&#x27;s important and it must be cheap as possible preferable no pollution no noise no heat no vibration no pollution the serial effect generator the perfect machine [Music] as you build this it when you find out that it runs without friction it runs without a governor it runs will accept any load and meet it it will dive down in temperature at one point if you build it correctly and actually levitate and actually lift off the earth developing its own gravitational field when you see all these things you realize that this is a perfect machine it is an entity it&#x27;s the closest thing to a living thing that man can make does jon searle have the answer is john searle&#x27;s invention the point of impact between the question what if there is a machine that could save mankind and the answer the serial effect generator people say well you can&#x27;t do this you&#x27;re going to upset the entire world economy the whole economy is based on oil and it works they&#x27;re saying well it works very well for the people who are running the economy but not necessarily for everyone else i still maintain that it will not ruin the economy it will be a very strong paradigm shift much the same as the shift from horse and buggy to automobile surely this point of impact would produce energy of its own human energy emotional energy joy relief hope wonder or perhaps the darker side of human emotions greed hate and jealousy all these years i&#x27;ve learned one thing you can&#x27;t trust anyone with this technology they want to steal it and any worker seeing this and find out how it works could sell it to another company for millions because this too is the searle effect put simply quantum mechanics is the study of the relationship between energy and matter in particular the relationship between electrons and photons the area in which the actual searle effect takes place it&#x27;s photons that&#x27;s the rules of grounding their energy to the coil it is simply throwing photons out that is what you see trapped in a magnetic field around it albert einstein&#x27;s contribution e equals m c squared made way for huge strides in science very soon abstract mathematical proofs would replace ether theory as the best explanation of all things and their relativity others like nikolai tesla would cling to the idea that energy was all around us and that we could access this energy and transport it through the atmosphere without the need for meters or utility companies while the greatest minds of the 20th century uncovered theories about how the universe works far beneath this lofty exchange john sorrell was dreaming i had dreams and those dreams are the key to all the work which i do in fact better key to all my knowledge the searle effect is developed from the law of the squares and it is from these squares that john searle developed his generator and flying discs but he didn&#x27;t stop there over the course of his lifetime john searle&#x27;s understanding of the squares would be used by him to explain all aspects of life in the universe from dna to relativity from single-celled life to the human being from transportation to construction of buildings the squares could be used to understand everything when i took up my training as an apprentice electrical engineer but the third day i presented a docket to take to the stores and i saw this two with a small tube buff i asked the foreman what that meant he said that&#x27;s too so i said what is two squares so he draws two by two show me four squares four you can take a square if you run the numbers in normal one two three four five six that&#x27;s uniform in but when you toke them up each row each column each diagonal you&#x27;ll find that add up different putting numbers in random we come up with a uniform output every line every column the two diagonals come out precisely the same random numbers in squares will produce a uniform total john searle would soon call this the law of the squares nature&#x27;s way of achieving order from chaos this led to cyril&#x27;s revelation from those numbers john searle had the exact amount of each ingredient in the rollers and rings of his generator now every one square represent a quantity of a material and that&#x27;s very important this is precisely how i developed the svg so i copy nature in every way i work at trying to think how nature is doing it and then produce this object world war ii had ended brought about by the most devastating weapons ever conceived the product of those lofty minds who 20 years earlier wondered what would happen if you hit a single atom hard enough what kind of energy was stored in this tiny place the answer they thought is the source of all energy in the universe the practical answer was bang in fact the biggest bang mankind could ever devise einstein opened the door a bit further like most people they come up with a wonderful formula einstein and then he stops at that and says there&#x27;s no way you can get this massive energy out of an atom the cost would be too high it&#x27;s not worth it then you say you&#x27;ve got another person comes along and thinks about this oh no just bump it with a proton or neutron some of the vocabulary words like volts ohms amps and watts by 1946 john searle had a different idea how could this energy be tapped without smashing the atom into bits his idea was a completely new generator design we didn&#x27;t call themself effect generators then but we were just trying to produce a generator to run the house lights on because i felt that the big generators at the pass stations were a waste of money would present to us vast pollution problems in the future so the whole idea was to get something to produce electricity basically the design is a conventional generator as far as how it looks you&#x27;ve got a magnet passing by a coil in all generators of electricity are based on magnetics and coils you can pass a coil by a magnet or magnet by a coil but that gives you your deflection in the electron flow and the force in one direction i already knew most of the fundamentals what i was doing here was trying to get rid of the petrol engine or other devices to turn the generator that was the objective the two key issues are electrons and magnetic fields john searle understood the basic principles for generating electricity he knew electricity was made up of electrons traveling down the wires into our homes to generate you&#x27;ve got to have electrons for most and great motion that&#x27;s why you go to the rare earth the primary component is a rare earth although it can be any of the rare earths the component that we use is neodymium that&#x27;s element number 60 on the periodic chart and that unit puts out an excess of electrons for some reason and it will also replenish them very easily where earth is the greatest weight of the whole materials that you&#x27;re using that has got to hold the mass of electrons john searle&#x27;s idea was to find a way to ease those spare electrons out of the structure and use them instead of smashing the atom into bits why not tap this vast electron reservoir by using magnetic fields same as any generator of that time so i say to myself if you can release all the energy with a simple particle surely we could ease it out gently by turning it coming in and giving it sunny to run up so if we put a straight line magnetic line through and the electrons spins around all this energy spinning around and come out we get a constant flow tunneling into the atom using a specific magnetic field will cause the electrons to move in one direction and they can be collected and used with production of electricity you have two choices you either rotate the magnetic field or you rotate the conductors in our case we rotate the magnetic flux so as the roller rotates it&#x27;s auto rotating around the base plate to make his generator work john searle had to overcome many problems most of these occurred with the shape and design of his magnets and in the behavior of their magnetic fields how can you make a round magnet orbit another round magnet without stopping or flying off he studied the behavior of a bar magnet and a round magnet it&#x27;s got a turning action on it it tormented me there was that must be to go straight i placed on and it kept straight and not only did it keep straight it freely moved up and down what happens if you make a ring he knew magnetic fields could be impressed or printed on certain materials using a magnetizer a device common to shops and factories that use magnets question battle scientist is why when tree was on they just run round and round the picture here was there was two states involved here and of course there is the two states referred to the two magnetic fields printed at right angles to each other both the roller and the plate had independent magnetic fields one vertical and the other radial from the center to the rim clearly the magnetic field was completely different to the magnetic fields we knew of for some reason why they were different at the time i had no idea the intersection of these two fields produces a wave that carries the roller around the ring although this wave was unknown at the time the phenomenon was present so we&#x27;ve got fields at right angles that&#x27;s why the whole thing moves if you have got two fields it won&#x27;t move now the two key issues for the production of electricity were present in a totally new generator design the electrons were available in the rare earth material the magnetic fields induced the roller to run on the plate we didn&#x27;t even know what the field looked like until a few years ago in germany when we remade a segment i said well let&#x27;s have a look at this field and we dusted it with very fine iron dust took off the surface do you know what that looked like a bicycle went that is the fill that makes this work any other fill won&#x27;t work that fill does it so we know that the magnetic field can be set to perform functions quite different to what we were taught in my day at school and i think we&#x27;re only scratching the surface of magnetism was this thing a generator it created an extremely high voltage but jon searle had no control over it whatsoever with each experiment came a new set of questions my magnetism is not your magnetism could it be that general magnetism contains multiple bands a magnetic spectrum exactly the same as white light contains a spectrum of colors magnetism is identical to light and why that&#x27;s how i look at it they are identical that pass john searle used a combination of ac and dc current when magnetizing the components of his generator if we isolate the particular band we want and then print that we have something different we have a wave this is the surl effect the intersection of two magnetic fields creating a magnetic wave that can be measured and amplified john searle designed a generator using magnetic fields to induce a flow of electrons from a rare earth element through a system of rotating magnetized components so that those electrons would be collected compressed used and recycled magnetic forces and electrons in motion the two key issues necessary for the production of electricity if a condition where you can&#x27;t get a magnetic sense like a wave a sine wave and they act as a river now that stage 3 until reaction effects takes place and to do that you have to set a cylinder on it magnetized and then that wave goes into motion another roller place on that field it floats we know it cannot touch that it&#x27;s too dense with energy so it&#x27;ll float so we got something floating there then if this wave is moved due to reaction between this plate this roller and this plate then that wave is going to carry that regardless so the roll it maintains through its constant height though it&#x27;s now running many times faster it does not fly off the magnetic field is holding the roller tightly to the plate at the same time the electrons moving through the layered elements are collected and compressed on the surface of the plate lifting the roller and creating space between the roller and the plate so the roller slides around and doesn&#x27;t roll around as it moves the thirds be rewritten all the time so the film never diminishes it cannot diminish because a magnetic field is a constant running order the energy or electrons moving through the system recycle the rare earth element attracts new electrons that also move through the system and recycle because of their negative charge the electrons compress causing the drop in temperature and creating the energy field that radiates from the generator in 1956 i was soldering i had to produce another unit and this time we wasn&#x27;t piling up i wanted to try to meter up things to see what the oscilloscope was showing me and it was accidental that when i took the hot iron to solder the wire on i couldn&#x27;t solder it selling from machine was cooling things faster than you could heat them that was accounting for some of the behavior of those early models counter for why when i got hold of it i was stuck to it john searle created a generator design that became a superconductor producing extreme cold and incredibly high voltage that caused it to lift off the ground but could he control this flying disc generator one thing i didn&#x27;t know was that hey gravity can be inversed no scientists ever had come up with that idea that clearly the magnetic field was completely different to the magnetic fields we knew of the heavy rollers spinning as they rotate around the plates acted like a flywheel and caused a gyroscopic effect the extremely high voltage created a dense field surrounding the generator a device built with individually magnetized components incorporating these principles displayed by the device he christened it gyro flywheel high energy density mechanical magnetic device but it would soon be known as the levity disk you&#x27;ve got to put a load with systems load on the generator to speed it up and once it starts you get to about on average about a million volts it begins to really build up a charge then this superconductivity switches in and the earth pushes it up but it&#x27;s also affecting the atmosphere buffet it is making it pull to the rim and rotate with a feel so you&#x27;ve got like a hurricane effort it&#x27;s sucking it up there&#x27;s a magnetic field there&#x27;s a gap a vacuum between that and the rim and it&#x27;s the photons which is discharged trapped by the magnetic field which gives it the glow basically the cell effect was meant to turn the ether which is all around us which contains energy and tap into this energy which has euthemistically now been known as zero point energy and various other people who followed cell&#x27;s footsteps have also potted around and they&#x27;ve tapped into it by mistake i can understand why people would have difficulty understanding it because it does take a great deal of effort to make sense of it technically fernando morris an electrical engineer and computer specialist is responsible for the most credible attempt to rebuild the serial effect generator we have something here that needs to be investigated and really that&#x27;s my role i am a technical investigator of the scg in his home laboratory workshop near san diego california morris is following the footsteps of john searle personally guided by searle himself he is rebuilding the generator precisely as cyril did long ago morris developed the unit that reveals a magnetic sine wave in the serial generator that&#x27;s how i started off is to try to build a magnetizer for it and if i could develop this sine wave which i&#x27;d never heard of before i think we&#x27;re on to something and we can build upon that now that has been that is proven repeatable and i&#x27;ve got the unit to do that it&#x27;s a process of magnetizing the rollers and the plate and when you develop sine waves on it what you&#x27;re in fact you&#x27;re developing a motor and that&#x27;s essential if it&#x27;s going to be a viable device that&#x27;s exactly what i&#x27;ve been saying since 1946 there is a waveform in a magnetic domain on that metal and the scientists say impossible after years of studying searle&#x27;s books trying to decipher their meaning and endless question and answer sessions with the man himself what does he know that assures him searle is right i&#x27;m gonna release a piece of information here that i&#x27;ve shared before and that is the law of squares that&#x27;s one of those question marks right now is how does that come about it took me a while to understand it but what it is it represents time space and energy and what it says it&#x27;s in a random state that&#x27;s not useful energy but what john has done is he has transposed that matrix so that the output is uniform and within nature uniformity means resonance so if you can resonate that with random energy you got yourself an electric current because electrons are the only things that are free to move on metal so what we got here is a converter of random energy into electrical current and that&#x27;s the brilliance behind the machine here is not only was john able to decipher his matrix but he will say well we&#x27;ll make it into a workable device and that&#x27;s the scg morris&#x27;s mock-up of the seg needs an outside power source just like searle&#x27;s original back in 1946 this unit does not contain the rare earth material and will not display the serial effect it was built to demonstrate searle&#x27;s contention that spinning magnets give off an electric charge as measured by the flashing leds what will be the reaction if and when the serial generator functions as the inventor assures it will i think the public will demand to know why is this technology being ignored why have the expert failed to recognize it john has a solution that is really the ultimate solution because we&#x27;re using energy that&#x27;s already available within nature and it&#x27;s benign i think we have a wonderful opportunity here it&#x27;s a shame hasn&#x27;t it hasn&#x27;t been taken advantage of i mean john has been struggling to get this technology out for years john a thomas jr wrote a book about cyril then formed a corporation with him in 1996 disc direct international science consortium for the purpose of rebuilding the serial generator thomas&#x27;s study of the serial effect has convinced him beyond any doubt that searle is telling the truth in the united states has not heard of professor seal they don&#x27;t know who and how he is the people of this world have been offered this technology in a refined form that usable since the early 50s and it was their right to have it and it&#x27;s been taken away from them by the media and by the power companies and by the people running this economic society and we have been told that we cannot have this and it can&#x27;t exist yet we could be living in a new world today that we should have had 25 years ago john searle has since reformed the searle international space research consortium or sisrc an offshoot of his earlier organization the serial effect generator represents a fork in the road of scientific development that was abandoned nearly a century ago when ether theory became a relic of the past the trouble is we are confronted by a brick wall called the expert scientific world if they haven&#x27;t done it or cannot do it it&#x27;s impossible to do if all these years nineteen we were at a peak we were demonstrating and still the scientists say it&#x27;s impossible to do really well we&#x27;re going to show you they&#x27;re wrong and they have held up this technology since 1946 to today perhaps it&#x27;s easier to believe that searle&#x27;s technology does not exist the serial effect generator at first look seems to violate known physical laws energy must come from somewhere john says he found it in the rare earth material could it be that simple cyril speaks his own language a combination of known physics and terms he created to describe his invention numbers in squares told searle that nature has a way of creating order out of chaos does the searle effect generator convert random energy into usable electricity when his generator is overloaded it affects gravity and flies john says he gave it a body and let it fly what is the truth german philosopher arthur schopenhauer was once quoted as saying all truth passes through three stages first it is ridiculed second it is violently opposed third it is accepted as being self-evident could it be that john searle&#x27;s technology is passing through schopenhauer&#x27;s three phases of truth the movement toward alternative energy sources is worldwide and essential the promise of a working serial effect generator represents a paradigm shift and a renewed hope for all life on earth [Music] foreign</p>
