            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>speaking of rubber bands being in your brain yeah I don&#x27;t know if this is real or not I&#x27;m choosing to believe it&#x27;s not real I believe it is but let&#x27;s just say this is weird Okay um so recently what&#x27;s the thing called is it forchan yeah um which do you know much about that not much not that it&#x27;s basically just a I mean just a like a forum or just a forum that&#x27;s like not very moderated very well and so every every time everything worst version of Reddit kind of a very unorganized version of Reddit apparently there&#x27;s this whistleblower that went on 4chan recently couple weeks ago and he&#x27;s like in I believe it was 2022 or 2023 2022 they found in this cave in Antarctica this egg shaped UFO looking thing which that&#x27;s what we talked about a week ago yeah was The Whistleblower you probably haven&#x27;t watched the episode cuz it came out today um or what whatever know you watch as soon as it drops yeah yeah um but there&#x27;s this whistleblower that came out recently Green Beret uh not Green Beret he worked for the military but he was part of the um um what do you call it I forget the word every single time retal program retrieval program for UFOs and stuff so he&#x27;s a whistleblower now but they had a video of one of their retrievals was an egg shaped UFO and apparently after this came out it gave this one guy the courage to disclose the stuff that they found in Antarctica supposedly um of this same egg shaped UFO that they found in ARA did I just like go in a full circle no you&#x27;re good you&#x27;re fine you&#x27;re fine sorry the flu brain is where are we the magic mind takes at least 30 minutes I think yeah yeah yeah yeah um but what&#x27;s also strange is that same episode I believe we talked about the hieroglyphics that a lot of people reported seeing on these UFO same thing happened with this UFO let me send you guys the pictures um where there&#x27;s really weird hieroglyphics all over it also there&#x27;s like a weird catacomb or a like a coffin what do you call them sarcophagus it looked like a marble sarcophagus very similar to the one that we talked about in Russia where that lady was in what was was that called um can&#x27;t remember but yeah that first picture angel of death or something um you can see the the writings and stuff on it some of it looks almost like Hebrew like that one um if you look at number five you see that first picture number five yeah that looks just like that letter in Hebrew I think like me see that one yeah kind of looks like Florida it super weird but apparently this is where cuz then you get stories like like this and it&#x27;s like okay well is there credibility to it because apparently I don&#x27;t know if it was part of the same thread but there was um they said they&#x27;re calling him an alien but he looked like a tall Nordic looking man very pale pale skinn long blonde hair seven eight feet tall was in that sarcophagus woke up and was conversing with them and supposedly there&#x27;s an inter I saw that today it doesn&#x27;t really sound real to be honest first of all that seems so scary yeah we surely would have heard about this um but yeah I mean you can see with the pictures it&#x27;s like you said like 20 feet right like long dude like what is happen the one well I don&#x27;t know about this one but the one that the guy collected yeah that was 20t long that&#x27;s crazy man but I&#x27;m like if that&#x27;s um I don&#x27;t know man it&#x27;s just like if that&#x27;s uh if it&#x27;s leg J what yeah man that&#x27;s the thing it&#x27;s like it seems like it&#x27;s just like they&#x27;re slowly just dropping things like just throughout so it just becomes normal and we don&#x27;t think anything of it and so when it&#x27;s like oh yeah there&#x27;s aliens here we&#x27;re like oh no instead of like complete like what like we&#x27;ve like they&#x27;re like just like dripping us with poison slowly so we just become IM it&#x27;s very similar the shape is very similar to what those us uh fighter pilots saw is the Tic Tac shape right they reported a white spherical Tic Tac shape yeah oh yeah the one that they&#x27;re chasing yeah you&#x27;re right and so this one guy they have the video whether it&#x27;s true or not I think it is cuz the guy said it&#x27;s real because he was in the helicopter yeah says they picked it up egg shaped 20 feet long and then this thing with Antarctica this egg shaped with inscriptions that look like hieroglyphics on it it&#x27;s just like it&#x27;s really weird either a lot of the stuff is coming out now and it&#x27;s all connecting the dots or it&#x27;s all this grand scheme to yeah it really does seem like one or the other because I I can&#x27;t be in the middle on it because it&#x27;s like okay things are real now is it truly a literal spiritual warfare that&#x27;s happening like this is the culmination of all or is this just a man-made project experiment like it really does like there&#x27;s no middle I feel like dude all I know is I you know when I was making the Reel I had to like look up the interview you watch found it was watching the guy the dude has psychopath eyes like oh yeah like every like like there were the comments were so funny cuz like this dude has seen it all yeah I mean like he&#x27;s intense too yeah yeah and at the beginning he&#x27;s like you guys you really need to watch the interview like the full interview not the the cut down one I I skimmed like I clicked through is it on YouTube yeah okay news Nation watch it um but they start off the interviews like he was basically undercover and he&#x27;s like he&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t I wasn&#x27;t undercover he&#x27;s like I was was um basically joined in the military as a Aeronautics mechanic he&#x27;s like great did you go to school for being a mechanic he&#x27;s like I did not said but I was a mechanic and um and so it&#x27;s basically he wasn&#x27;t allowed to actually say but the interviewer was basically like you weren insinuating yeah you were undercover yeah doing this stuff fascinating stuff same guy that from news Nation dude I would love to talk to this dude I would love it he knows everybody all these whistleblowers he&#x27;s the first one to interview all these whistleblowers I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve noticed that the David uh was it David grush yeah the first yeah he news a that guy was the first one to release the interview and then he went to uh Congress and all that stuff but there was a fairly recent one he knows some stuff yeah that uh the news guy he interviewed this guy Ross uh forgive me I&#x27;m probably going to mispronounce his last name cold heart um he&#x27;s an older gentleman but he was a former Green Beret Lieutenant Colonel um was it no oh no sorry sorry John blit blinch blinch blitch blitch blitch what John blitch blitch got it um Ross is the interviewer got it John blitch is the guy he interviewed uh he was green ber lieutenant Colonel um his interview was fascinating he&#x27;s not technically a whistleblower but he&#x27;s working with the whistleblowers because of everything that he&#x27;s experienced and his story is fascinating what happened to him very spooky it starts when he was a kid no and he&#x27;s a very logical man I think he has his Doctorate or Master&#x27;s in a cogn cognitive psychology very smart dude and he was in charge of the um battery nuclear program or something so he was in charge of the team that would place and charge the batteries within the nuclear missiles so top top dude um and he&#x27;s been in every Avenue and stuff he&#x27;s a really humble guy very smart very downto Earth and that&#x27;s what makes his story even more fascinating but he talks about at a very young age he talks about he believes and he made a very distinct um separation between belief and knowing yeah he&#x27;s like you there&#x27;s a difference between believing something believing something happened to me and knowing something happened to me knowing something happened to me um he said that when he was a child he believes this stuff happened to him because of stuff that he knows happened to him as an adult and um he talks about as a kid he was visited multiple times by what he says what we would call Grays today no way he says where did he grow up um you know oh man I forget okay no I&#x27;m listen Midwest I believe to be but he he made this connection it&#x27;s got to be Missouri or something so he he believes that he was potentially abducted even as a child and he said he&#x27;s like there&#x27;s not a lot of things that scare me he said but anytime I started talking about this stuff he kept on doing this like he&#x27;s like I it it sends tear into my bones I wonder see that&#x27;s the thing but he talks about dude he&#x27;s like so he talks about as a kid like he would see them outside his window just staring in and he&#x27;s running to his parents screaming and they&#x27;re like there&#x27;s nothing there and he said that happened just so many times and then as an adult when he&#x27;s like in charge of this nuclear program all this stuff not in charge of nuclear whatever he was involved in um he talks about these very distinct things that happen one where he was investigating something or something happened but he was on this bike ride he said I would do this bike ride because the pressure of my job was just intense so it&#x27;s like it was basically an hour bike ride I would do it every weekend and this one bike ride there are five hours unaccounted for that I was missing and he said my wife called the police and they&#x27;re out looking for me but the whole story is fascinating he&#x27;s like he ended up on like a Indian burial ground on his bike ride he knew there was one he&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t know why but I felt like I had to go walk on it what in the world dude he was walking on it and he said all of a sudden my nose just started bleeding gushing blood and he said I just I need to sit down for a second and then he&#x27;s like it&#x27;s almost like I just like Clos my eyes and open them and he&#x27;s like it was just a little darker outside but then he talks about like up on this hill he saw this truck and he&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t know why he&#x27;s like but I had to go see who was inside that truck and he&#x27;s like climbing up this hill and he got up to the side of this truck he said it was not a human inside this truck he&#x27;s like and even right now I don&#x27;t even know if that was a truck I was looking at he&#x27;s like it&#x27;s he&#x27;s like it was it was almost like Blurry Mirage dreamy feeling and then he&#x27;s like it said freaked him out got out of there and he said he was the most tired he&#x27;s ever been and then he went into a gas station bought some Gatorade chugged like so much Gatorade walked out and the police are like hey are you um John or whatever he&#x27;s like yeah he&#x27;s like okay well you&#x27;ve been missing for 5 hours your wife called in they&#x27;re concerned about you can we give you right home yeah and he couldn&#x27;t remember anything besides that no that&#x27;s so weird but then he talks about this experience to where he&#x27;s like uh what&#x27;s his name um Ross the interviewer is like what do you he&#x27;s like what are their intentions what do you think they&#x27;re like he&#x27;s like oh I met one he&#x27;s like okay we tell us that yeah and apparently as an adult still in this program he there was one night to where he was visited and all of a sudden he like woke up on like a I&#x27;m if I&#x27;m butchering a story I apologize because I watched it like no this is secondhand news um but basically woke up on a table and he said there was this giant he said the only way I could describe it was a giant praying mantis but it could speak to me telepathically what was what was the name of those uh what um Tim alberino talked about them yeah he did oh no dude this is so scary this is so incide was that in insecticide in insecticide is incin incin I think that&#x27;s it but he said that dude imagine like a 10 foot creature looking like a pre ant is laying over you while you&#x27;re helpless he believes those are real and he said says I believe that the Grays are non-biologic artificial exactly Whata what Alo yeah but he talked about this thing was speaking with him telepathically and basically along the lines of like stop squirming stop moving let us do our test we we won&#x27;t hurt you um and he it said something like we can never touch or hurt your soul that&#x27;s one thing we have no access to is your soul oh and he it like did this one thing where like cut his cheek or something and he like saw blood and said see we can hurt you physically but we can never hurt your soul and said now just relax and so he&#x27;s like and he just laid down and then he woke up or in his bed covered in sweat whatever said I immediately got up he said I don&#x27;t know why I I grabbed my camera and I took a picture of myself in the mirror because I noticed on my arm there was three bruises like fingerprint bruises on my inside of my arm and one on top like something had grabbed me and he&#x27;s like this dude I mean he&#x27;s legit bro okay you&#x27;ve been fully convinced you&#x27;ve been literally taken by aliens how do you live how do you live on like telling people like that&#x27;s crazy that&#x27;s such a difficult thing to like truly believe that it it I&#x27;m tell and he&#x27;s good friends with with the guy that was the reconnaissance or the um Crouch or whatever his name is no I blank out every time retrial retrieval ret that word is just not in my brain at all it&#x27;s like the first thing I think of um yeah he he&#x27;s met this guy and they like talked and stuff so like they&#x27;re all like trying to figure out what the bigger picture of this whole thing is I mean that yeah it has to be real man like that&#x27;s the thing it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not a believer in aliens or any of the great like I but it&#x27;s like how can you deny testimony internationally yeah that&#x27;s consistent that I mean it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me what is your take on this you guys terrify me ninjas are butterflies did I say ninja I meant butterfly the butterfly in snow down one of has an empty your mind you Le martial arts ninj attack [Music] Lord</p>
