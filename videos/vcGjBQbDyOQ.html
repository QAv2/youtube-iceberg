            <p>hey do you remember when Terence Howard claimed to have a patent on something that could tap into Zero Point Energy and that it would control the world no it&#x27;s wild so Zero Point Energy is the vacuum energy of space and space is made up of quantum fields and each field has a granite energy known as a Zero Point Energy the combination of these fields leads to an overall non-zero vacuum energy this has led some people to think that there is a free energy out there that just needs to be harnessed now there are a few problems with this first we don&#x27;t actually know what the energy value is it might be zero second because the vacuum is in equilibrium there&#x27;s no direction of entropy that leads to accessible energy and lastly even if you could find some way to extract energy from the vacuum of space it&#x27;s likely a tiny tiny tiny tiny value the force of a singular Photon so if someone tells you that they have a Zero Point Energy machine they are scamming you</p>
