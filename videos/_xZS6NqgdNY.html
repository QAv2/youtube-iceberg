            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>a couple days ago I made a video about a UFO whistleblower who came forward on Reddit I&#x27;ll put a link in the description please go check out that video but the gist of it is that basically this Anonymous person posted on Reddit over a year ago about their experience working at egund Air Force Base about a month ago they do an interview with Ross colart and news Nation this interview is yet to Air and he made a another post on Reddit sort of not complaining but asking why hasn&#x27;t his interview aired on news Nation yet why hasn&#x27;t his story been told yet so in this video I&#x27;m going to tell a story now he has yet to reveal his name and his face but in this video you&#x27;ll learn all about that in fact I&#x27;m going to show some of the documents he gave me that prove who he is he&#x27;s going to be allowed to tell his own story of what he experienced at eglan Air Force Base what he saw about something called site C6 this radar system that can track UFOs and potentially where they land right and a few other personal stories that you might find interesting as well as seeing a craft up close landed right in front of him so and why did Ross colart want to interview him and why hasn&#x27;t his interviewed aired yet right so we&#x27;re going to get into all of that in this video so without further Ado let me introduce the gentleman who you&#x27;re about to hear from his name is William Carter and he goes by Bill and these are some documents that prove his service in the military [Music] [Music] [Music] now bill was kind enough to come on again tell a story explain his experience at egin Air Force space and the UFO that he saw and talk about news nation and Ross colar so I was also able to confirm that those conversations with news Nation happened and that he actually did an interview right as well and here&#x27;s a screenshot of that now some of the information that I&#x27;ve shown I&#x27;ve had to redact some personal information of course right but just to show you the guy is legit and he did go on news Nation now the Fantastical Parts I don&#x27;t know you&#x27;ll have to decide for yourself but I found Bill to be very credible very Earnest very honest just a good old boy I&#x27;m from Texas just a nice gentleman right so sit back hear from bill and his story and let me know what you think in the comments so without further Ado Mr Bill Carter I live inside my own world of let&#x27;s jump right into this Bill thank you so much for coming on the show man thank you for having me really appreciate it um you know uh clearly I saw your your Reddit post made a video about it right on my channel and you reached out through the YouTube comments and I was able to contact you and we went back and forth an email and and here we are and I&#x27;m really excited that you came on to be honest with you and I&#x27;m really excited to share this so Bill if it&#x27;s cool with you what I think would be um let&#x27;s let&#x27;s take people on a little journey here so let&#x27;s just start with how this all began you made a Reddit post last year in July I believe um sort of detailing you know an experience and experiences that you&#x27;ve had let&#x27;s let&#x27;s kind of just go through you know what that is what your story is and then we&#x27;ll work our way backwards from there yeah I had U posted about my experience on egund and how interesting the base was because i&#x27; never seen any place like that before and uh you know egland Air Force Base right yeah just to be clear right just Air Force Base my unit was sent there in uh 2009 because we were getting ready for a train up we were going back overseas again and they would send us there just to get us acclimated to the Heat things like that and we actually had two missions there one was uh marijuana eradication and the other one was um doing uh Garrison security with the Air Force Security Force guys and uh when we got to the base uh we had a what you call guard mount is where they get you together at the beginning of each day and they tell you you know where you&#x27;re going to be going they tell you about the base okay yeah the different sectors and um the first day we were there it was uh my unit um the uh Air Force Security forces and the contractors there and this gentleman that came out and talked to us he said that uh if we were lucky we could uh ride with the Marine Patrol and possibly get to see some space debris or space junk that happens to fall in the waters there surrounding the base well I pretty much forgot about him telling us that and I just remember thinking well I&#x27;m not going to do that because I&#x27;m not going to touch anything in the water that&#x27;s fell out of space and catch a disease or something so I I like I said I put that in the back of my head and we all kind of gave a little chuckle and moved on and uh one of the days I was riding with uh one of the security forces guys and we went up to sight C6 and I didn&#x27;t even know the name of the place at the time thought it was a strange looking building and uh it it&#x27;s a restricted site you have to have um permission to get in there all the military police have at least a secret security clearance and the fact that I was riding with the Air Force Security Force guy we had no problem getting in there um we walked in and to the left of the place there was a guy at a Podium he was somebody that checked IDs and the guy I was with he walked through the little forer there they had or the lobby and he went to talk to some guy in a a white lab coat and uh I&#x27;m sitting there just kind of looking around checking the place out and I see this uh mission statement they have on the wall it says we monitor all space activity terrestrial and extraterrestrial from planet Earth so when I saw that I immediately started having um memories of something that happened to me when I was a kid uh when we were living in uh Danielsville Georgia right outside of Athens um I had a UFO experience with my mother and I was uh very young I was about four years old but I&#x27;ll never forget it because um the place we lived was just a little small trailer park had maybe eight trailers there was like three or four on each side and they had a road that went through the middle and there was a little a bob wire fence at the end of it and I remembered looking out into the pasture and there was this huge uh what looked to me like a fire going on at first I thought it was a fire and I I kept looking at it and I could see it was like casting Shadows on the ground and uh my my mother I I could hear her like you know trying to get my attention she was behind me it scared her I mean I wasn&#x27;t I guess old enough to be scared at the time I didn&#x27;t realize you know it was something you know just anomalous at the time so I get behind her and later on when we talked about it years later she told me I kept trying to look around her to see it and uh she took us into the the trailer locked the door and uh you know I later on I asked her why she didn&#x27;t call the police or anybody and she said there were so many sightings down there at that time in the 70s that uh they were putting people in like uh mental institutions that reported it oh wow and she said everybody was seeing them down there and they actually had one follow them over their car one night before that incident and she had never told me that but um we left egund and U there was uh a couple of more things that I saw there like uh there was um one day that I was riding with another Air Force Security forces guy and we&#x27;re having lunch by the this uh tarmac that has a huge hanger on the end of it and I noticed these white planes with no tail numbers at all I said what what are those planes because i&#x27; never seen one unmarked like that and he said oh we refer to them here as Secret Squirrel planes and I said well who who uses those and he said it was the CIA that they came down there to do like different projects and and things and then they&#x27;d fly out to wherever they went to and uh I remembered one day when we were supposed to be out doing marijuana eradication but at the time we were just having fun driving the Humvees hitting mud holes and going uh mudding out there in the swamps never found any marijuana anyway and uh I stopped one day and I was trying to find a place to go use the bathroom yeah and I heard something over my shoulder and I looked and there were these two columns of guys squatted down in the forest there they were uh sitting like Indian style two rows there&#x27;s probably about 20 guys 10 in each row they were all dressed in black they had black helmets on they looked like older guys they did not look like regular soldiers I mean these guys look like in their 30s or 40s and I thought well these old looking guys to be like the only Special Forces type groups that I knew were there were the Army Rangers because they were just like five miles down the road from us and then I knew the PJs were there and they weren&#x27;t dressed like that I&#x27;ve never seen just full blacked out gear so I looked one of the guys dead in his eyes and I just kind of smiled and waved and uh they just they didn&#x27;t crack a smile they didn&#x27;t blink or anything and I hopped back in the humb and took off and later on I&#x27;d heard things about you know retrieval teams from there but I I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what they were but I know they were definitely dressed different than anything I&#x27;d ever seen so um I had all these memories coming flooding back from when I was a kid and just about two years ago I finally opened up about it because it just got the best of me I I couldn&#x27;t get the S off my mind and I talked to my mother and she couldn&#x27;t believe I remembered it I said well it was the most extraordinary thing I&#x27;d ever seen But for years I thought I had dreamed it you know and then I started remembering about the next day we had went through the fence and we went to a place where it had been and it was this huge black burnt Circle in the ground and I remembered us standing around the circle I remembered us climbing through the bobw fence to see it and I remembered having this like dark feeling when I saw it I know a lot of people you know have different feelings when they claim they&#x27;ve seen things but to me myself it it gave me like a dark feeling and uh I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons that it stayed with me but when I talked to her about it um that&#x27;s when she opened up about one being over the car one night one of the guys that was in the car with them he came up missing later on and they never found that guy and uh so which car what what do you mean my mother and her boyfriend his brother and I think it was his fiance at the time they were going down the road prior to us having this incident and my mother&#x27;s fiance&#x27;s brother he looked up out of the back glass he was sitting in the back seat and he said hey there there&#x27;s something over us here and she said it paced them for a long time and then it finally took off and she had never told me that story ever oh wow and just so happens like a few years later the guy come up missing I remember it it was like pulling teeth getting my mom to tell me the guy&#x27;s name name and I found it online I looked at her ex-boyfriend&#x27;s uh obituary and it had uh information about his brother that um he had uh been missing and they had never been able to find him so he was still missing you know when his brother died so um I started digging in to this place and like I said at the time I didn&#x27;t know that sight C6 actually you know the name or anything and I found the place online and then I finally saw a name for it so when I originally went to the place it it looked like nothing I mean it looked like an old radio station you&#x27;d see on some country road somewhere it did not look impressive at all you would never know by looking at it I mean back then you wouldn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;s changed but back then what what year is this 2009 2009 got it so this is when your egund Air Force Base experience happened 2009 and the experience with your mom when you were four what year would that be roughly you think that was uh around 1977 78 it was like late 77 early 78 and I can remember it at the time um little things like I remember the the Leonard skinnard crash actually because I remember uh hearing these guys talk about it because they thought Leonard skinnard was one guy and oh God it talking about it but um u i uh started you know looking you know up some information about the place and uh I got on Reddit that&#x27;s actually how I started on Reddit I I got to a place called uh machine porn because when I typed insight C6 there was uh a big page with a picture of the uh site on there and these guys were talking about its capabilities like they were saying we&#x27;re talking about site C6 at egund Air Force Base right just to be clear what we&#x27;re talking okay and um these guys were talking about how if birds flew by the radar facility they would just evaporate because the place was so powerful I don&#x27;t know a lot about you know Radars and technology and things like that but uh the birds would evaporate flying across this radar yeah they came across it you know they said evaporate that&#x27;s a crazy word said just that well they said it would explode or something interesting and U one of the guys I met on there was a former radar technician at the site for 3 years from like 1981 to 84 and he told me he said well if you&#x27;ve been in the military you know and you&#x27;ve been to the site he said I I&#x27;ll discuss some of the the things with you about it and tell you what I know and which I gave you the chat blogs about you know what we talked about um and you know some of the things I had a hard time understanding because I&#x27;d never heard of it like harp and uh I&#x27;d never heard of harp and he had told me some of the other well here before we before we get into some of the stuff he told you let me just ask you some questions on your story and different thing because I wanted you to just be able to talk freely and kind of get that out first but I do have a few questions before we move to this this next part here um just just facts and stuff so that people can kind of understand what&#x27;s happening so this um 2009 was the experience at egund where you you run across the uh site C6 for the first time right is this also when you saw the uh dudes in black camo out in the woods or whatever same yeah yeah we were there yeah we were there for two weeks I can actually tell you because I got a army Service uh Army Achievement medal for my time there so I know what time span I was there got it got it okay cool and how long were you in the service as a whole as a whole about 10 years um for active duty in the Marines um one year and a half with the regular army when we were deployed overseas for o f and then five more years in the reserves or National Guard so about 10 years total five and and that and first of all thank you for your service of course I do want to say that my father was in the Air Force grandfather in the uh Air Force as well well Army I think it might switch there I don&#x27;t know World War II um so thank you very much for service of course um thank you so so 2009 was egin so when did you enter the service what year would that be 1994 I I went in the service three three different times the first time I went in 94 to 98 and I got out and started college in 98 and I went to 98 98 99 2000 then I transferred um went to uh Alabama after that and um my junior year I was needing some more school money so I went back into the service I went to the National Guard in 2003 and uh as soon as I went back in they were jerking our arms off to go get deployed because it was after 911 yeah so um we got deployed in &#x27; 05 we came back in &#x27; 06 and I was stop-loss when I was over there because my contract had ended when we were overseas my contract ended about 5 months before we got back and about 10 years later I got a a small check for my inconvenience of being stop-loss past my contract and when I came back I still was a year shy of graduating so I was working for a couple of years and I decided the only way I was going to get finished it was if I went back in and at the time I was still healthy enough to go back in so I did I signed up for three more years and went from 09 to 2012 plus I was raising my son by myself uh I I divorced and we uh um split ways and I had custody of my son so I did that for support as well and u i I finally in 2012 I&#x27;d had so many like operations and surgeries and stuff I couldn&#x27;t stay in I couldn&#x27;t pass the physical anymore so yeah I&#x27;m a disable veteran now got it got it okay well I&#x27;m so sorry to hear about that um to be honest um okay so before we jump into this conversation you&#x27;ve had with this other um radar technician I believe that&#x27;s the title that he had and that he gave and then we&#x27;re going to jump into this news Nation stuff too but let let me just ask you this like what besides your personal experiences when you were a child you know with your mother and and clearly The Experience she had too which is which is interesting as well um what about your experience at egund seemed anomalous or does that make sense like what what well like why why would you want to come and forward and tell your story and think people would be compelled to hear it because so far the stuff about scy 6 or whatever I don&#x27;t know nothing sounds too crazy so far of anything you&#x27;ve said right um it it basically just or maybe I&#x27;m missing something here well to me after seeing what I saw when I was a kid and and knew that they actually monitored the things from there um you know I I&#x27;ve seen what do you mean monitor the thing like what do you mean by that you&#x27;re saying like when you go into the lobby their mission statement says um we monitor all space activity terrestrial and extraterrestrial from planet Earth and that kind of just hit me like you know do you think that&#x27;s maybe like a little like you know ad Astro sort of thing like you know what I mean like a not necessarily oh we got ETS here but just like you know mission statement kind of ingests a little yeah I&#x27;ve seen that many times a lot of units I I was in did that but I just felt like there was something little bit more behind that yeah I feel you it was because for one thing it was a restricted site and if there was nothing really going it wouldn&#x27;t be restricted for one it did not look like anything uh imposing or anything that would be that technologically advanced yeah so but it it definitely had my curiosity because I had not had those thoughts about what I experienced when I was younger for years sure and um so when um I I met the the radar technician and he you know started talking to me about the place I felt a little bit better finding more information out about the place because I wanted just to kind of cool my curiosity about it so sure how did you did you verify that he actually was this radar technician like he was who he says he was well I never saw his DD214 but you know he&#x27;s got the the unit logo and everything on his page and he&#x27;s also told me stories about you know guys he served with there and that&#x27;s you believe him like you believe that he he was in the military yeah yeah okay yeah and he had told me about companies he worked for that i&#x27; never heard [Music] of and like said I&#x27;d never heard of the harp thing um and he got into telling me about uh yeah what is this harp thing let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let&#x27;s hear about this har I really don&#x27;t know much about HARP um it&#x27;s like an acronym you think H RP yeah it is yeah it was something to do with launching stuff out in space and then it coming back down to earth some people have talked about it being like weather manipulation or something like that and alluded to that but there was a uh some kind of big stink over it um because there&#x27;s a lot of controversy over it I mean you could probably read up on it online but um I didn&#x27;t really know enough to ask about HARP I&#x27;d never heard of it and you&#x27;re saying there was controversy about HARP online yeah there was uh about something about what they were doing to the environment or something oh okay is harp like a system a program kind of yeah it&#x27;s some kind of system uh I think they moved it to Alaska oh okay so so so it has nothing to do with site C6 actually well he said there was some involvement with harp at the site and I don&#x27;t really know exactly what they doing there I mean how that works okay yeah yeah I mean I just like I said I I didn&#x27;t know much about it till he started talking about it I wanted to ask a a question a couple questions here about HARP the highfrequency active auroral research program uh several you of you at the table have a little bit of a piece here as you know this is located up in Alaska it&#x27;s currently funded by the Air Force research lab it was formerly funded by the Office of Naval Research one of the Prime customers is DARPA uh which is currently running running experiments at the facilities here so uh questions to to several of you this morning I&#x27;m told by the president of the University of Alaska that the Air Force has pulled its support for the facility and they&#x27;re taking steps to uh to demolish it or take it down uh this summer he&#x27;s making the argument that uh there is other opportunities for us and uh is trying to find a path where the university might be able to take title to the facility I i&#x27; I&#x27;d like to start with you Dr provar I understand that um a lot of folks here on the committee probably don&#x27;t understand what harp does I think most alaskans don&#x27;t really know what harp does or why the agency is involved in it uh so a very brief explanation and then a more direct question would you be disappointed or would you lose something if if harp were to go away uh Senator marasi as as I think you know uh one of our programs has been using the harp facility for the research that that uh it&#x27;s pursuing uh and my understanding is that we did get value out of that interaction um the the P and DARPA is projects and uh we&#x27;re not in the business of doing the same thing forever so very naturally as we conclude that work uh we&#x27;re going to move on to other topics so I it&#x27;s not not a it&#x27;s not a uh an ongoing need uh for DARPA despite the fact that we had actually gotten some good value out of the the that infrastructure in the past understood then to to uh Dr Walker and and Mr schaer then Dr Walker your agency is currently running the facility um uh I&#x27;ve mentioned that it&#x27;s our understanding through the president of you UHF that that the plans are to move move forward and and demolish the facility this summer so the question to you is is that accurate can you explain why and then uh perhaps to both you and Mr schaer is there any benefit in exploring a potential relationship with the university uh of Alaska to perhaps take over the har thank you Senator the Air Force has gotten Great Value out of harp in the past we we took it over from the Navy and Managed IT and actually did a number of uh experiment campaigns up there and uh have finished our our work that we&#x27;re interested in doing up there we&#x27;ve uh moving on to other ways of uh managing the ionosphere which the harp was really designed to do was to inject energy into the ionosphere be able to actually control it and but that work is has been completed uh the air force uh has maintained the site for other government agencies to use for several years now and with DARPA completing their project that&#x27;s our last government customer that we have in the site what what else did this guy say that you found interesting well the the most interesting thing that he told me was that they definitely monitored UFOs when he was there U out in the gulf and and what years was he in 80 he was there from 81 to 84 and then he had friends that worked there after he left and he had told me one of his friends that worked there um died uh they told him the guy committed suicide but he said there was never a body for this guy and he went in to tell me like there had been several lawsuits because um I guess of radiation exposure and stuff around the site like over the years I guess guys that had worked there had brought lawsuits against the Air Force for working there and exposure to it and uh so that that&#x27;s interesting you know he he was was telling me that after he left you know they were involved with the Gulf Breeze incident they were monitoring those after he left according to his friends that were there when he left and uh also he said that one night when he was there they brought something on a flatbed truck he didn&#x27;t get to see what was under it but he said they never brought anything up there like that and uh he said that it was uh something that they brought up there late at night and he also said that when you were watching the radar if you fell asleep at the at the controls they would have the guards come in and escort you out you know with guns and everything else just for falling asleep there oh wow so it was pretty serious um about U watching you know the screens and The Radars there what&#x27;s um oh sorry is he are you done with the stuff that he said I didn&#x27;t want to no um the S itself and I&#x27;ve heard Christopher melon talk about capabilities but he&#x27;s never mentioned sight C6 in particular but I knew what he was talking about when he said we had Radars that could track things 22,000 nautical miles into space the size of a grapefruit I knew he was talking about sight seat sight seat six yeah okay got it interesting do do you have you heard about David gush&#x27;s claims that he was part read into a UFO program that could you know observe these UF you know UAP coming in um at a certain frequency do you think this is the same system oh yeah I there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind like I said they they hide this place and in plain sight and you know if they can track object and from what I understand they can track like 30,000 different objects out there at a time with this radar I was actually going to ask that yeah how do they with all the space clutter and you know I guess they probably have something like if it something is showing to be like controlled movements or something it probably certain observables right that they can okay that&#x27;s interesting all right but but you but you personally never witnessed anything egund that it was just all peculiar stuff nothing you know extraordinary let&#x27;s say you never saw a craft you know you weren&#x27;t read into saw UAP there no right you never saw UAP at this place you were never read into any program well I you know the reason I say this is because this term whistleblower and I kind of used it myself there&#x27;s a lot of people that use that term do you think you&#x27;re a whistleblower like do you think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing like blowing the whistle this when I think about it I I don&#x27;t think too many people know about the site there um and coming forward I know that a lot of people can&#x27;t get the government to acknowledge certain things like the capabilities that the the military has to monitor these things so I mean I just I feel like it&#x27;s um whistleblowing because you&#x27;re you&#x27;re telling people about the site that it is restricted um and most people don&#x27;t know what goes on there yeah the site is online you can read about it but it doesn&#x27;t tell you that they also monitor uaps there which they definitely have the capabilities to do that sure but let&#x27;s be real UAP is just unidentified anomalous phenomena right and UFO is just unidentified flying object nowhere in those names does it identify as you know alien right or ET in fact the whole designation of those acronyms is that it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s ambiguous right that it is unknown so so I don&#x27;t know like you you you know you don&#x27;t really have any proof or anything that says that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening at this you know place I do find you know your story very interesting about what&#x27;s happening um for sure like I guess that&#x27;s the I&#x27;m just saying this because that&#x27;s what people are going to be saying in the comments I can already tell what the comments are going to be so like how would you address these sort of com you know you you have to connect these dots here so if you know they have the capabilities to see something that far out right then that tells you they probably know where they land when they come here and they know where they that&#x27;s interesting yeah yeah that&#x27;s interesting and and that&#x27;s where people haven&#x27;t connected the Dots here you know they they know we got craft the government&#x27;s admitted to that right um wait wait the government has admitted to craft well well when you talk about brush you know he&#x27;s um he&#x27;s came out and said it and okay I think during the during the U I think it was the uh hearings with the uh Secretary of Defense you know they admitted to it during the um hearings that they had um got to re listen to that yeah they had uh pictures like cockpit pictures it wasn&#x27;t very good it was all distorted and all that stuff and you know they showed those pictures and they weren&#x27;t really anything interesting right um but what I&#x27;m saying is if they had that capability then not only do they know where they come from but they know where they go once they get here and that&#x27;s important even if even if you you know probably the most important if I&#x27;m being honest I rather have the second half of that than the first half knowing where they go maybe not where did they come from right like you know where they went because if you just seeing them coming in and then you lose them I think that&#x27;s worse than than the other way so okay that&#x27;s interesting when we were on igland twice we were made to evacuate the area the first time was like the first day or two we were there we were about five miles away from the Army Ranger camp there and they just told us hey get lost they said it was some kind of bomb range or something close by and the wildlife it scares them and they just wanted us to leave that way you know friendly fire or something wouldn&#x27;t happen so um the the last time it happened we were outside playing cards at night and they came out there and rushed us all in we&#x27;re we were living in quanon Huts there and uh we didn&#x27;t have a curfew so we were just kind of like you know why they want us in you know but they just told us hey everybody in and I&#x27;ve heard since then that maybe you know they have something flying that they don&#x27;t want anybody to see which is understandable we couldn&#x27;t see them at not anyway I mean well that brings up a good point right you&#x27;re you served in the military you served our country for long time right um what what are your thoughts about like this National Security aspect to right do do you think it&#x27;s possible that some of this is actually just to cover up our own Advanced Tech maybe make it look like it&#x27;s something else like you know what I mean like I don&#x27;t know yeah I uh I think they may have some Advanced Tech but I also believe that um whatever these uaps are they&#x27;re from somewhere you know I I believe those are real just not Earth yeah you think just from well who knows the origin really but I just know what I personally saw that I&#x27;ll never forget and U I I I&#x27;ve heard people say well that&#x27;s probably some experimental craft and I was talking to somebody about this earlier and they probably just put it out there to test the soldiers or whatever that would never happen I mean there there&#x27;s probably been cases of things that you know wouldn&#x27;t hurt anybody but they&#x27;re not going to put something out there that may get a pilot killed um going to chase it down or yeah I see what you&#x27;re say that&#x27;s an interesting point actually and I I argue that point with a lot of people when they talk about oh they just you know stuck some experimental aircraft out there for the pilots to chase said you know they&#x27;re they are very protective of those planes and they&#x27;re not going to put something out there that could possibly get somebody killed they would have a lot of explaining to do for one yeah and believe it or not most of my experience in the milit they were really concerned with safety so I I don&#x27;t I believe that yeah yeah I believe that 100% um no that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s very interesting um H have you had any experiences since you were a young boy with your mother and you you you saw that that CRA had I&#x27;ve had a couple of sightings since then and I believe there is some truth to the what you call the hit chocker effect I really do um okay and The Hitchhiker effect were&#x27;re assuming we both think it&#x27;s the same thing right you you have an experience somewhere and when you leave that place it follows you it hitchhikes with you back no matter where you go you start to experience other anomalous phenomena right is that what you mean yes so do you think that hitchhiker was from the event when you were four years old or what do you mean well it&#x27;s little things like we would come home and I was an ES teacher for six years after I got oh wow M respect much respect uh this was a room actually I taught in and during the winter time you know we had all the windows down just you know keep it warm and one day I came in here to get ready to teach it was like five or six o&#x27;clock in the morning the only way that you could raise the windows here is from the inside without taking a screen up and I something cool on the back of my neck when I was you know getting ready to teach because I had to teach real early like 5:30 in the morning for you know students overseas and uh I looked behind the the blinds and my my window was cracked about that much and nobody here would have opened it up uh We&#x27;ve came home and our sliding glass door would be cracked um there&#x27;s so many different things that I&#x27;ve seen like that that uh really have freaked us out um and we know that you know we didn&#x27;t do it there&#x27;s no reason I would raise a window in the middle of winter time here it gets cold here oh of course yeah yeah absolutely um wow okay no that&#x27;s that&#x27;s definitely very interesting I&#x27;ve heard a lot of stories about that and I I I think it&#x27;s quite a fascinating phenomenon to be honest with you that doesn&#x27;t get studied enough and and looked into enough uh well look um let let&#x27;s jump into this next part first I just want to say thank you for sharing all that so thank you for that um so so let&#x27;s jump into kind of how I found out about all this um you made that post last last summer was that before or after David grush testified it was before grush that&#x27;s that&#x27;s even more interesting yeah but but after he had done his news Nation interview no it was before way before that if you go back to look at my original interview it was it was over a year ago it was it was way before the grush testimony it had uh I have to look at it but um it was way before grush came out okay so you make that post year goes by when does when do you get in contact with news Nation or how does that work who contacted you you contacted them yeah I sent an email to Ross actually and uh his producers contacted me uh I forget the the the woman that contacted me first and then there was a a male gentleman he contacted me too about setting up a time when it got closer to the interview time so they so so what was the the the cell if you will on on the story from your end like what was your pitch to them well I was telling him about the side and what I discovered and uh which he was was more or less concerned with you know uaps and things like that which you know I never mentioned anything about seeing a UAP there and got it um I uh you know just told him basically what I told you about the site and U he uh went through everything really quick I mean I I&#x27;ve been retired for a couple of years so I don&#x27;t really talk to people all the time and I I&#x27;ve definitely haven&#x27;t talked to you know a a national reporter like him so uh it was it was a little bit too fastpaced for me when I talk about being disappointed in the interview I just mean that you know it just went a little bit too fast for me I think and um I I wished I could have been you know more elaborate with u some your answers and yeah Nuance give better yeah how long did it last like how long was the interview I would say maybe 20 to 25 minutes oh really so that&#x27;s not even going to be the edited interview right it&#x27;ll be shorter than that clearly um so that was 20 minute and it was just you and Ross or producer was there yeah it was just me and Ross we didn&#x27;t have much Small Talk he said oh Georgia boy huh and he said you still got the hair yeah and we just went into it and uh I said you know after so many years it just kind of grows on you and I you know cut used yeah yeah absolutely looks good looks good no absolutely okay so so you you do this interview with Ross um when when did you record it I I didn&#x27;t record the uh interview um well I mean when did they record you know when was it record happened it was around the first week of July okay of this year right of this year I uh I was looking through my emails I had with the producer and I found where he said it should air this month August is what I what uh what I read I think I forward those to you yeah yeah you did you did um you did I I can confirm your uh you know your military service these emails that you had with news Nation all of that definitely um so so yeah so you put up this Reddit post saying like hey I made this story you know I told the story you know I don&#x27;t know if my story is going to come out on news Nation so are you just sharing like some frustration there on Reddit of what&#x27;s the issue like you wanted the the interview to come out sooner or do you think they&#x27;re gon to scrap your interview no what it was um I had no idea that sometimes interviews take months to come out I never done a television interview in my life got and I I just had no clue about when they how this works and I had so many appreciated comments on my Reddit post with people saying don&#x27;t lose Hearts you know sometimes they get three months away and sometimes it&#x27;s a year before they um air them and um I was just uh just just not knowing really got it so you&#x27;re cool with news nation and Ross and right everything and you you want this interview um to come out and and from what I can tell from the correspondence you had with them I think the most recent it was like Hey we&#x27;re going to let you know it&#x27;s coming it&#x27;s all kind of booked right now but as soon as it comes out we&#x27;ll send you the link right um to this so um I mean from what I can tell I you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s at the end of the day you never know that that is true they could scrap it they could not it could be a last minute decision sometimes it&#x27;s not has nothing to do with the quality of the interview it&#x27;s it&#x27;s scheduling it&#x27;s content there&#x27;s a million other reasons that doesn&#x27;t make it a better excuse but sometimes business is business even when it comes to you know stuff like this so and I just say also I had no clue how big that story got on RIT and a lot of people asked about why I put it on Reddit and the reason myself included I just don&#x27;t use a lot of social media um I I just think it&#x27;s bad for you sometimes to do a of stuff like that you&#x27;re not wrong and I I try to keep it simple I um rdit in YouTube&#x27;s about it for me on you know social media and uh Reddit what an interesting choice because I hate Reddit I think it&#x27;s one of the most toxic places on the internet if I&#x27;m being honest people people can be very mean um they&#x27;re mean to me there every day I&#x27;m banned from a lot of subreddits um they talk they hate vetted they now some people love us don&#x27;t get me wrong but we&#x27;re very divisive but man there I get so much hate some of the most vile comments I&#x27;ve ever read on the internet have come from Reddit which is you know I got I had no idea that people were even talking about my story I got a guy um that sent me a message that said hey they&#x27;re talking about your story on vetted I said oh okay which I&#x27;d seen the show a few times I&#x27;d watched it and uh so I clicked over there and I&#x27;m like okay I&#x27;m on the hot seat there was another there was another um mildly warm seat I would say no I&#x27;m kidding I&#x27;m kidding no it&#x27;s it&#x27;s been great I um you know I I wanted a chance to explain you know I I know a lot of people are confused about you know why I put it on Reddit and you know what was the disappointment with the the Ross interview and um you know it was just you know more or less myself you know just being disappointed in myself a little bit and wishing I could have had more time to elaborate but I know he&#x27;s a busy guy I know that you know he&#x27;s got probably a million people coming at him with stories definitely and I I sent him all my military discharges and everything that I I I said and you know to back up what I was saying and um uh you know we just wrapped it up and he was gone I mean it was just short and sweet yeah for sure absolutely absolutely H sometimes it has to be that way you know he&#x27;s he&#x27;s definitely a busy guy definitely when it comes to UAP phenomena if if I get reached out to as much as I do I can&#x27;t even imagine the kind of uh Outreach that he gets um to be honest with you now to be fair you also were in a little bit different position than most people because you were moved into the news Nation sort of thread and and dealt with them and and actually got got to sit down with Ross which is really really cool um you know regardless right that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a really cool thing so look um one thing that I just I don&#x27;t want to forget it I for the last 10 minutes I&#x27;ve had it pinned up here and I&#x27;m like okay just bring it up at some point so I just want to give because I&#x27;m going to forget it um something in one of the comments you made on on my YouTube video I want to let&#x27;s get that cleared up because I made a comment in the video about what you know you and I mentioned something about the skiff like that you were confusing it with the site or something so let&#x27;s just clear that up you weren&#x27;t saying that right yeah let&#x27;s just clear that up sorry I&#x27;m an idiot sometime you know it it happens um the actual the place inside is you know itself is a skiff um because they could be huge right I I I read on that they they can be massive entire buildings can become Skiffs yeah I mean it&#x27;s a restricted s you have to you know have uh a security clearance to get in there um the guy I was reading about today he had commented on something uh one of the posts and said that he was just at sight C6 two weeks ago and oh I saw I saw that comment yeah yeah and uh he said something about yeah this would be a a a place that would probably monitor UFOs or uaps or something like that and uh he uh really surprised me you know and I was glad that he said that he was escorted there because I&#x27;ve had so many criticisms from Air Force vets saying well there&#x27;s no way you could have got in there and all this kind of stuff and I said I I didn&#x27;t go in there alone I wasn&#x27;t by myself I had a guy with me yeah the Air Force guys man they tear me up I mean they they get after me about stuff and uh you know I explain it and they they still they still give me a hard time sure sure no I get it um all right was there any other parts to this story or whatever that you want to clear up that you feel are misunderstood out here in public you know I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read a lot of comments and seen a lot of things so let&#x27;s clear it up let&#x27;s feel free no um like I said um I was just going to you know say my peace to Ross and just be done with the topic really because it&#x27;s so toxic it&#x27;s I mean it&#x27;s such uh I don&#x27;t know you get you got it&#x27;s you got people are skeptical skeptical about it you got uh a lot of people that are you know just have never seen anything and you know I understand that and you know it&#x27;s a taboo with some people so you know it&#x27;s just you have all different aspects of people you know that think so differently about it you know and a lot of people don&#x27;t know what to think because they&#x27;ve never seen anything which I understand that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s why you know I I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people who study the topic for a long time and they get where you know they make a lot of sense in the beginning and then years down the road they&#x27;re just whacked and and I just I don&#x27;t want that to be me yeah I&#x27;ve only done one other podcast the the basement hangout uh I did that once and that&#x27;s the only interview and you told this story yeah all of this here got it yeah how long ago was that you think oh that&#x27;s been six months or seven months ago I think and you came out with your name and everything on that podcast yeah got it yeah got it and and they they were they had interviewed Ross actually and uh they were telling me that I was I should uh mention them about getting him to come back on there for another interview or something and then they said he came on once and we haven&#x27;t seen him since and I said he&#x27;s probably really busy I&#x27;m sure he is oh yeah yeah absolutely well you&#x27;re trying to do your own content and then people want you to come onto their content that makes sense right that becomes very uh um time you know sensitive especially when podcasts are sometimes people think oh we&#x27;re going to go two three hours it&#x27;s like two three hours kidding me that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s a lot maybe once a week or something like that but you know my my whole intention of of saying all this stuff was yeah help people look in the right place and know that they do have the capabilities to do this because these explanations of the footage wasn&#x27;t that great because um our camera was having problems or it was just too grainy to make out you know yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not true they they have the capability to see these things a lot more clearly than you know what they present to the public so I knew it was just hogwash I want to see it I want to see this stuff um do you think there&#x27;s any other you know sites like C6 like that are similar quadan um from like thees C6 mean like there&#x27;s C5 and C4 and see like I don&#x27;t even know you can go online and see a map of egland and it has the different you know sections of the base and it&#x27;ll show you know that&#x27;s actually one of the ways that I found it too was when I was looking for it you know I saw the restricted sites and I had the name of the place finally when I was doing my research and I matched it up to the map and I realized you know hey okay that&#x27;s a that s see six and I saw the picture and everything so I I knew that it was the right place and you know that it was a restricted area because I think when we went up there that day I didn&#x27;t even realize it was a strict restricted area because when you&#x27;re a military police most the time you just go anywhere on the base you want to you have to be able to go anywhere on a base for any reason you know so you don&#x27;t really think about a place being restricted you just walk in sure yeah of course um oh that&#x27;s interesting you know um in the hearing in July last year Matt Gates was there right and he spoke about Egan Air Force Base and how he had um been there and heard from some Pilots there uh I believe Luna and I don&#x27;t know who else Gates and maybe Brett had gone to Eglin tried to get in a skiff there and sit down and get information do you think this skiff that they went in is the same skiff you&#x27;re talking about I don&#x27;t know um but I knew they were going to have fun trying to get in that place and get answers and I knew they were gonna come back angry and they did no yeah they did didn&#x27;t they yeah they from what I understand the the base General went on leave in the middle of them trying to talk to him that&#x27;s right called Washington DC and they were they were ordered to let those rep Representatives talk to those Pilots yeah yeah and they got you know because I made a few videos on it they they showed uh sketches well I think that came out later in the era historical report if I&#x27;m not mistaken the sketches that Matt Gates had talked about from this pilot one of the pilots that Matt Gates had spoken to and he drew out kind of hey this is you know what I saw or whatever um yeah I mean eglan that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s an interesting story that you&#x27;re telling too because eglan has some f as we would say in Spanish some f some some some Fame I guess not not really the same term but I I had posted my story before they went down there I mean if um I can that&#x27;s interesting actually look it up and send it to you so to get a date oh no I have the story yeah yeah no I I read them both on the on the video that I did so I have both of those those links for sure um and I will have gone over all that in the beginning because I&#x27;ll tell the story and and whatever I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll do this cool intro that&#x27;ll be greatly edited and I will look amazing and you&#x27;ll look amazing and we&#x27;ll all look amazing um yeah look it&#x27;s very interesting Not Gon to lie I um I I really appreciate you coming on Bill I mean that especially last minute this broke you came on you know reach I know you don&#x27;t do a lot of these and and as far as I can tell you&#x27;re probably not going to do many more of these because well who knows maybe you will I don&#x27;t know well I mean if people have you know questions like if they don&#x27;t understand something I i&#x27; I say or something I&#x27;ll be more than happy to clear it up on something you know to make it clear because sure I worried about that you know and I appreciate you giving me a chance to explain you know my post and all that stuff because so many people assuming so many different things that uh you know I was like oh I hope I get a chance to clear this up no I&#x27;m glad I agree and more people should have that opportunity to to be honest with you um you know some people were like oh um you know I&#x27;ve been whatever I&#x27;ve been ridiculed before for platforming people this term that I absolutely disgust I hate that term platforming i i people can&#x27;t even Define it when they say it to me they don&#x27;t even know what they mean all they mean is you had someone on your show I don&#x27;t like okay what does that have to do with anything yeah so I I was a little worried okay are people you know you&#x27;re platforming this guy you haven&#x27;t vetted him you know this that and the other and my whole approach is no let&#x27;s get on let&#x27;s talk let the guy explain himself in his own words have the time and space to do it right and feel comfortable be able to give nuanced answers do you know dig in a little deeper to some certain things you&#x27;ve said and people can make their own minds up I don&#x27;t need to make their minds up for them so um no I I really do I appreciate you coming on and being willing to talk because a lot of people won&#x27;t even do that some people just won&#x27;t even tell the story they&#x27;re gone they don&#x27;t want to explain anything so it is I think that&#x27;s wrong I mean if you believe in something you need to stand by it you know sure and you know if people don&#x27;t understand sometimes it&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re mad at you a lot of times they just don&#x27;t understand 100% and and and today the problem with the the entire world is communication I mean there&#x27;s just so many you know misconceptions about things because people don&#x27;t communicate effectively enough sure and I I really hate that so I I try to my best to be as clear as I can no absolutely no you&#x27;ve been very open and clear and honestly I can&#x27;t think of any more you know questions about anything um here here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll say um you might have already mentioned this in the podcast but let&#x27;s just kind of end on a you know positive note here hopeful hopeful note um what what do you hope happens from you coming out and and telling your story I just hope people are more aware that we have the capabilities to see these things and don&#x27;t pay attention to a lot of these politicians and people that say that we can&#x27;t see these things and that the footage is always grainy and you can&#x27;t see it that&#x27;s not true they know I mean they for sure know and if they don&#x27;t don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re going to get something up there that can take a clear picture so they know what they&#x27;re dealing with um it it makes me so mad when our government tries to play dumb to the people because it&#x27;s not right that c certain people have privileged information especially if we&#x27;re not alone we need to be telling people that and you know it&#x27;s like baby steps but you&#x27;ve got this lie that&#x27;s been going on for so long and they don&#x27;t want to reverse thems because they&#x27;re going to open themselves up to liabilities you know like service members that been hurt probably around uh working around these things so it&#x27;s so hard to undo that lie but what I have noticed they will do is they&#x27;ll let people like elzando or grush or something like that tell you because they&#x27;re not associated with the military anymore and what better way to tell people is you have credible people com out telling these stories believable people instead of the government saying yeah we&#x27;ve had these things for about 60 or 70 years now um and uh sorry you know I&#x27;ve heard Lou talk about um amnesty you know like maybe trying to do that for the government or whatever and uh you know I think some things could be forgiven but I I do think you know where people been hurt or threatened or something like that I think there&#x27;s you know U no forgiveness for some of that because if you listen to some of those people at Roswell talk about how they were treated after the Roswell crash that&#x27;s just unsad you know threatening people and things like that just because you want to be greedy and have technology to beat the other guys who probably have the same thing um um at least tell them about these things and tell them what you got you ain&#x27;t got to tell them everything but at least give them something so people you know quit going crazy over it yeah well up can&#x27;t say I disagree well bill um thank you again for coming on the show um I really appreciate it and um yeah just thank you for coming on and hanging out with us I really appreciate great I appreciate you having me on and like I said I watch the show sometimes too when I when I have a chance and uh I enjoy a lot of the podcast and I like you know the guys that uh do podcasts like this especially because of their passion for it you know sure and I I like the fact that people are passionate about trying to get to the truth because they deserve it yeah well said I agree that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m about passionate about getting to the truth that&#x27;s it so all right Bill well thank you again man live inside my own world of Make Believe kids screaming in the CRA profanities I see the Earth through ice covered in in and cross out the ones who had my cries and watch me weep</p>
