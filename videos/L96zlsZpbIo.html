            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this channel is for educational purposes and uh we look at theories of everything uh from the past uh ancient and modern and uh delve into them deeply and uh try to show how they can help you in your life their Paradigm shifting your Awakening to 5D consciousness you&#x27;re forming a holistic worldview and so on and so forth today is our 497th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey Bernard Larson and Mr Larson was an American engineer who lived in the 20th century he was born in 1898 died in 1990 and uh during his fairly long life he um put out uh a dozen or so books and many many articles and talks and um presentations and um in 1959 he articulated his two fundamental postulates about how he believed the universe operated and then from there he derived a theoretical Universe uh how his Universe would look if his postulates were correct and then he compared his theoretical Universe with the actual universe or so-called actual universe of the uh mainstream Legacy scientists that they have uh compiled in their scientific tables he does that here in the book that we&#x27;re looking at today called basic properties of matter which is on chemistry uh Larson arrives at equations for many of the basic properties of matter like the melting point or the interatomic distance or the uh specific heat the compressibility and uh then he uh plugs in all the atoms and many molecules into his formulas and uh then Compares his results with the scientific tables and uh I&#x27;m convinced that he&#x27;s on to something because he&#x27;s able to um more or us recreate the scientific tables strictly from his theory no need for uh any type of uh you know billion dollar Grant to uh have a Laboratory um and have armies of scientists to uh make these measurements you can just uh get it right out of Larson&#x27;s head so um that&#x27;s compelling to me and so that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re uh one of the reasons why we&#x27;re delving in deeply into this it also makes a lot of sense to me Larson is one of the first people uh not the first but um it&#x27;s not very common Renee dekart and Thomas Hobbs had the same ideas um where they attempted to construct a universe based on motion not matter not energy but motion but LaRon distinguished himself from them because he was able to um I guess the way he defined emotion he was able to turn it into an actual generalized theory that applies to everything and I think he did that by uh you know defining Motion in particular um in his first postulate uh he defines motions as the relationship between space and time and he also um defines motion uh or at least points to uh a specific kind of motion that he&#x27;s talking about which is what he calls scalar motion a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction so this is a motion that you can Envision using a balloon uh that you put dots on if you blow up all the all if you blow up the balloon all the dots will be moving away from each other and uh but they won&#x27;t be moving in any specific Direction they&#x27;ll either be moving in or out or I mean out but if you reverse the balloon and and contract the balloon then they&#x27;ll be moving in and uh they&#x27;ll be moving out away from each other meaning that they&#x27;re moving in all directions or they&#x27;ll be moving inward toward each other meaning that they&#x27;re moving inward in all directions that outward movement Larson refers to that as the progression uh and the inward movement is analogous to gravitation and so that kind of that transition that progression that is um omnipresence all always existing um and uh that is the source for all manifestation but that is really the empty universe but the universe manifests by converting that outward progression to an inward motion um gravitation which is inher inherent in all matter all manifestation so that uh just gives you a little bit of a glimpse how the reciprocal system operates but um if you want any more detail about that you probably want to watch one of my first 474 videos on this subject um I go into that a little bit more detail and uh flesh out the fundamental postulates and what the ramifications are um but um we want to try to turn some pages of this book today and so I&#x27;m going to basically assume that you have some kind of background in the reciprocal system before we start here on chapter 16 of this book um called induction of charges I will um recite the first postulate of Larson which is that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so the universe is made out of motion motion is the relation it&#x27;s talking about a scalar Motion in particular a u motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are not existent in and of themselves they only exist together in motion and they have a reciprocal relationship in motion and space time and motion come in three dimensions and they come only in discrete units and then he takes that first postulate and kind of plugs it into the second postulate which is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian and so he takes that which is kind of uh you know the scientific consensus and um he uh deres his theoretical Universe by you know using the laws of probability and other laws of math and the laws of geometry and logic to um arrive at this theoretical universe and his equations for these various basic properties of matter now chapter 16 of this book is called induction of charges and this is one of uh I believe about uh six seven uh chapters that Larson does having to do with electricity and in my opinion this is one of his weakest areas uh I think he made a few mistakes in his derivations here and so do some of uh larsson&#x27;s other associates and uh we will actually look at some of uh the dissenting voices as well here uh to kind of get a more balanced picture about the uh charge picture but um this is a weak point for Larson and it is a weak point for me as well I don&#x27;t understand electric charges very well or electric current or anything L Larson&#x27;s basic theory is that the electron is uncharged I can accept all of this here the the electron is uncharged it can take a charge but like everything else in Larson system an electron is a kind of motion an electron is a rotating unit of space and it moves through matter in the same way that matter moves through space or really the reciprocal of matter moving through space is the electron or really a hole moving through um time which is matter matter is generally made of out of time and um kind of like effervescence kind of like a bubble moving through water something to that effect and um that is the uncharged electron and that is electric current but static electricity is a charged electron but a charge is not inherent to an electron a charge can be taken by an electron but a charge can also be taken by U matter or or sub matter or sub atoms and uh charge is not an electron which is kind of what is assumed but the charge is like everything else a kind of motion it charg is a rotational vibration uh which is kind of a motion like this like the hairspring of a watch um and uh that is what gets applied to both you know atoms um sub atoms and electrons um okay let&#x27;s see where he goes here with this book with this chapter induction of charges clarification of the structure of the gravitational equation and application of the new information to the formulation of the primary Force equation opens the door to an understanding of the kulum equation FAL q q Prime over d^ 2 that expresses the electrostatic force um and those qes refer to charges and um although in the last chapter Larson turned one of those two Capital Q&#x27;s into a lowercase Q uh and uh change the units in LaRon system all scientific phenomena um come in units and those units are time and space uh based exclusively so where you have the MKS system you know me um meters kilogram seconds en LaRon system you just have space and time and so you have um for example motion uh the the bike is going 10 miles per hour 10 miles of space and one hour of time space over time but matter is also kind of motion energy is kind of motion force is a kind of motion and they all have their signature in time and space a fraction with space as Nu space or time as the numerator time or space as the denominator so matter for example is time to the 3 over space to the 3 um energy is time over space charge is also time over space but the electron is space and current is space over time um and so Larson gets uh kind of followed up in his units last chapter and we&#x27;ll see where he goes from here uh with these units so um f equals Q capital Q Q Prime capital Q Prime over d^2 that uh expresses the electrostatic force this equation is set up on an equivalent basis within a numerical coefficient that is the numerical value of the charge Q is defined by the equation itself it would seem therefore that when the other quantities in the equation Force F and distance D are expressed in terms of the CGS equivalence of the natural units H should likewise take the CGS value of the appropriate natural unit and this comes from his discrete unit postulate everything is in discrete units so there is a discrete unit of motion there&#x27;s a discrete unit of I mean of speed there&#x27;s a discre discrete unit of energy there&#x27;s a discrete unit of mat matter and so on and you know they basically come from plugging in one unit of space uh like for example with speed one unit of space per one unit of time and uh larsson&#x27;s unit of space is approximately 2 millionth of an inch his unit of time is 1.52 * 10-6 seconds and then when you equate that the actual unit of speed is the speed of light and um he deres uh his other units like that so he says Q should likewise take the CGS value of the appropriate natural unit but the dimensional the dimensions of charge are t/ s and the natural unit of t/s in CGS units is 3.33 * 10- 11 seconds per centimeter which you get by taking the natural unit of time and dividing it by the natural unit of space so seconds per centimeter um 3.33 * 10us 11 whereas the experimental unit of charge has the numerical value of 4.80 * 10us 10 in conventional physics there is no problem here as the unit of charge is regarded as an independent quantity but in the context of the theory of the universe of motion where all physical entities for all physical quantities are expressed in terms of space and time only it has been a puzzle that we have only recently been able to solve one of the new items of information that was derived from the most recent analysis of the gravitational equation and incorporated into the primary force equation is that the individual Force equations deal with only one force motion um motion is in parenthesis there the force apparently exerted by charge a on charge B and the force apparently exerted by charge B on charge a are not separate entities as they appear to be they are merely different aspects of the same Force the reasons for this conclusion were EXP explained in the gravitational discussion and this kind of stems from this idea of scalar motion where say if you have um the inward motion of that balloon all of the dots are moving toward each other if you uh arbitrarily decided that one of those dots is motionless so you basically came up with a reference point of one of the dots and you define that to be motionless then you would find that it appears as if all of the other dots are moving toward that dot and that there is an actual force field surrounding that first dot that is attracting these other dots and so that&#x27;s why Larson uses the term apparently U it appears as as if there is a force there but there isn&#x27;t all of the dots are pursuing their own course and they all are moving inward toward all other dots uh there is no Force but it appears that there is and mathematically it behaves as if there were okay so a second point also derived from the gravitational study reported in chapter 14 although it could have been arrived at independently is that there is a missing term in the usual statement of each of the force equations this term identified as 1 / s times the quantity s over t to the nus1 in the primary force equation must be supplied in order to balance the equation in the gravitational equation it is an acceleration term in the kulum equation it is reciprocal Space 1 / s well Larson&#x27;s got me lost there I&#x27;m not sure what he&#x27;s doing it sounds like he&#x27;s fudging the numbers though to me I mean I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s doing it on purpose but I think he&#x27;s convinced himself that this is the right way to go but I don&#x27;t think that it is because it sounds like a fudge Factor but um if somebody could explain that to me then I would be more um apt to um delve into it a little bit further uh to try to figure out what he&#x27;s talking about there but I&#x27;ve never figured that out okay here uh and again that&#x27;s it&#x27;s how you appro have to approach the reciprocal system there&#x27;s a whole lot of stuff that you&#x27;re not going to understand and if you just reject it out of hand and put the book down then you uh you know you won&#x27;t gain any of the benefits of the reciprocal system many many many times throughout my studying of the reciprocal system I&#x27;ve been nonplused about some aspect of it and you know like where is he getting that from but then uh later on in my studies he will answer my question and it will be satisfying because I&#x27;m like oh I see what he&#x27;s talking about now so you can&#x27;t just give up on somebody because you know they say a couple things that you disagree with or that you don&#x27;t understand the logic behind you know um Larson is tic he is articulating a Theory of Everything um and he has to provide a new language uh New Concepts new ways of thinking and sometimes s those things are hard to articulate and so he might not always be using the optimal language to articulate these things um you know because he&#x27;s having to do this on the fly on his own without you know the benefit of um you know time tested um you know communication um you know um channels okay so here we encounter a difference between the two equations that we have been examining in the gravitational equation the unit of mass is defined independently of the equation in the kulum equation however the unit of charge is defined by the equation consequently any term that is omitted from the statement of the equation is automatically combined with the charge instead of having to be introduced separately as was necessary in the case of the acceleration term of the gravitational equation the quantity 1 / s which as we have seen is required for a dimensional balance therefore becomes a component of the quantity that is called charge in the statement of the equation that quantity is actually t/ s the True Dimensions of charge multiplied by 1 / s the omitted term which produces t/ s squar which are the U the signature of force the time uh time space um signature or Force the same considerations apply to the size of the unit of this quantity since the charge is not defined independently of the equation the fact that there is only one force involved means that the expression capital Q capital Q Prime is actually Q to the 12 * Q Prime to the 12 so we&#x27;re using the square root instead and um it follows that unless some structural Factor as previously Define enters into the Kum relation the value of the natural unit of Q derived from that relation should be the second power of the natural unit of t/ s^2 in carrying out the calculation we find that a factor of three does enter into the equation um this probably has the same origin as the factors of the same size that apply to a number of the basic equations examined in volume one it know uh which is uh his book called Nothing But motion uh which is on Atomic physics primarily and um it no doubt has a dimensional significance although full explanation is not yet available uh so this all kind of leads me to doubt all this more but um continuing on the natural unit of t/ s^2 as determined in volume 1 is 7.31 * 10 - 6 seconds per cm squared on the basis of the findings outlined in the foregoing paragraphs the value of the natural unit of charge therefore is Q = 3 * 7.31 uh 6 * 10- 6 the quantity squared which equals 4.81 * 10us 10 ESU and that is uh very close to the value that he uh was saying that is the natural unit up here uh pager 2 ago 4.80 * 10us 10 you says there is a small difference a factor of 1.32 between this value and that previously calculated from the Faraday constant like the similar deviation between the values for the gravitational constant this difference in the values of the unit of charge is within the range of the secondary Mass effects and will probably be accounted for when a systematic study of the secondary Mass relations is undertaken and I find all that to be fairly fishy also um it it&#x27;s kind of like he juggled the numbers around until he was able to arrive at some kind of expression that got very close to the value that he&#x27;s looking for and then he explains it away by saying that it&#x27;s part of the secondary Mass um the secondary mass is a a very small fraction um that um is not taken into account with the primary Mass um and it comes [Music] from I I believe it comes from like um electrons in the matter um and other subatomic particles that weigh like a fraction of a a unit of of mass um I&#x27;ll get back to you on that secondary Mass I&#x27;m about to read an article about that um so maybe today I&#x27;ll read that uh to kind of uh recall what exactly he&#x27;s talking about but I find it uh very unconvincing but um that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not right so I just keep going on and um the equivalence of the scalar motions a and ba which plays an important part in the force relations is also responsible for the existence of a unique feature of static electricity the induction of charges one of the basic characteristics of scalar motion resulting from this equivalence is that it is indifferent to location in the reference system from the vectorial standpoint locations are very significant a vectorial motion originating at location a and proceeding in the direction AB is specifically defined in the reference system and is sharply distinguished from a similar motion originating at location a location B and proceeding in the direction ba but since a scalar motion has magnitude only a scalar motion of atom a toward atom B is simply a decrease in the distance between a and b as such it cannot be distinguished from a similar motion of B toward a both of these motions have the same magnitude and neither has any other property of course the scalar Motion Plus the coupling to the reference system does have a specific location in that system so that&#x27;s the key point about scalar motion is that the um the the direction is not a property of the motion it is a property of the reference system that you define and so once you choose one of those dots to be your reference point then you can start measuring the directions prior to that you just have magnitude and a generalized Direction being in or out but once you uh once you Lo uh decide on a reference point then you have the direction so the direction is related to the reference system not the scalar motion so scalar Motion Plus the coupling to the reference system does have a specific location in that system a specific reference point and a specific Direction but the coupling is independent of the motion the factors that determine its nature are not necessarily constant hence the motion AB does not necessarily continue on the ab basis a change in the coupling May convert it to ba or it may alternate between the two okay we&#x27;re going to do one more paragraph here uh the rotational component of the scalar motion of a charged atom always uh maintains the same relation to an atom at another location half of the elements of that rotational motion are approaching the second atom while the other half are receding in equivalent directions and at equivalent speeds but this is not true of the rotational vibration that constitutes a charge in this case the relation of the motion charge to the distant atom is continually changing that is the relative motion of the two atoms has the same vibratory character as the charge itself as has been stated a scalar motion a such as chart as a charge toward or away from atom B is indistinguishable from a similar motion of B toward or away from a the representation of this Motion in the spatial reference system can therefore take either form okay that uh that kind of went over my head too I I might have to go back and look at that again um and uh we might start up with that again uh when we start this chapter again tomorrow uh but that will do it for today uh thanks for tuning in and just keep uh you know keep plugging away on this um you know uh be okay with not being completely clear about everything and uh you know just try to give him a hearing we&#x27;re trying to this is a generalized Theory so we&#x27;re not specifically looking at the chemistry of this U for the sake of the chemistry we&#x27;re looking at it to get the concepts and to get the methodology from lson so that we can apply his theory to other subjects as well uh the same way he has uh We&#x27;ve looked at books on metaphysics religion philosophy you know biology um also um psychology economics we&#x27;ll be looking at and so on okay thank you</p>
