            <p>So tell me about the moment when you realized that you were involved in a retrieval of nonhuman technology, alien tech. So it became very clear the first time our communication process and procedure uh was modified and then just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous. It was it was not human. How close did you get? Well, I was a helicopter pilot and I operate with 150 foot to 200 foot long line. So, I got within 150 ft of this object.</p>
