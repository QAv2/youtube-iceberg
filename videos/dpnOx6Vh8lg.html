            <p>in quantum mechanics there is a wave function which evolves most of the time according to the Schrodinger equation however now and then something mysterious happens the wave function collapses but why does this collapse occur quantum mechanics doesn&#x27;t provide an answer it merely states that the wave function collapses when a measurement is made the real question is what criteria Define a measurement no one knows this remains one of the Great greatest unsolved problems in quantum mechanics at first glance it appears that a measurement requires the involvement of a conscious Observer if this is true it implies that physics may be particularly set up for Consciousness to play a central role the physics equations seem to create an apparent gap for Consciousness that affects the collapse of the wave function</p>
