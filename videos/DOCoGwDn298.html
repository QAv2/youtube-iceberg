            <p>oh that is perfect right where it needs to be we took scientifically accurate measurements and they lead us to a spot somewhere up here over the ranch that is our next measurement and the way we could do that is we tether a weather balloon and raise it up through that region that has equipment on it that couldn&#x27;t have worked out better I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good launch I say we pack up and go back and try and track it on the internet if this experiment is successful it&#x27;ll tell us exactly where these energy spikes are occurring and hopefully what&#x27;s causing them it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not this is not updating that&#x27;s strange to me that&#x27;s supposed to update every minute crazy that the point where we lost contact with a balloon is at the exact same altitude we calculated the RF energy to be coming from so the interpretation of this is there&#x27;s something above us sending signals down</p>
