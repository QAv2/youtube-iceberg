            <p>The government shutdown continues and Trump is using this downtime to gut school programs for marginalized black students. But his tricks aren&#x27;t new. Here&#x27;s how history shows us how to fight back. In the fall of 1870 in Tuskegee, Alabama, four black men, Tony Cliffe, Barry Harris, Caesar Frederick, and William Hall were lynched along with William Luke, a white teacher from the North just for running a black school. This violence demonstrated white fury against black education during the reconstruction era.</p>
<p>During reconstruction, over 600 black schools were attacked. Just the idea of an educated black citizenry infuriated whites. Fortunately, black people didn&#x27;t take the denial of an education for their children lying down. We pulled our resources, hired teachers, and turned abandoned buildings into schools. Whatever it took for our ancestors to educate themselves and their children, they did.</p>
<p>Of course, they faced violent push back, but they refused to back down. Today, the Trump administration continues to dissolve the Department of Education, which will undoubtedly hurt black students. But we don&#x27;t have to stand for this. Like our ancestors, we can find ways to teach and care for ourselves and our children. We can demand more for ourselves and our people.</p>
<p>Pay attention to local educational issues. Vote locally, run for local office. We must each commit ourselves to stopping the attacks on our futures. Do you ever just feel like your ancestors left you homework and it&#x27;s due today? This shirt is about that. Our ancestors passed us the torch and we keep it lit.</p>
<p>Rise, resist, repeat. Push Black is only here because of you. Without your support, we can&#x27;t continue this fight. We need you more than ever. Go to shop.pushblack.</p>
<p>us right now. Get this shirt and let&#x27;s keep the legacy alive. There&#x27;s limited stocks, so don&#x27;t miss out.</p>
