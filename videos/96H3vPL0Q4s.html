            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel this is a channel for educational purposes we try to shed light on some great theories of everything that I&#x27;ve come across in my research and to do some deep diving into so that you can see the possibilities and uh today is our 447th video on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B LaRon uh Dewey B Larson was an American engineer who lived in the 20th century died in 1990 around 1959 he put out his two fundamental postulates about how he believed the universe operated and then shortly thereafter he began to or even maybe before he started to elaborate uh on those two postulates through a process of deduction if my postulates are correct what would my universe look like and so he uh defined his theoretical universe and then in some of his volumes he compared his Universe to the measured universe of the scientists uh especially that what they have um measured in their Laboratories and compiled in their um scientific tables also uh in their uh uh what do you call them observatories and in their astronomical tables I I don&#x27;t mention this often as often as I should but uh in 1959 uh that same year Larson predicted the existence of quazars in um several um details about what they were and that was like three years before quazars were discovered so his track record uh is formidable uh he was able to predict the existence of things that had not even been discovered yet um and so that uh also you know gives him more credibility in terms of that maybe his theoretical universe is worth uh considering doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s right but it it&#x27;s primacia evidence and uh then uh we&#x27;re looking at his book on chemistry here called basic properties of matter Larson calculates uh first he derives equations for many of the basic properties of matter such as the compressibility and the interatomic distance and the melting point and then he um Compares them with the tables and Compares them very favorably um so uh either Larsson is like fudging the numbers or he is onto something uh in my opinion and so that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re taking a look at his work here uh we&#x27;re looking at chapter five in this book basic properties of matter which is on heat and um but before we get to that we&#x27;ll try to give you a little once over on what the uh reciprocal system of Theory actually says first it&#x27;s a system of theory meaning that it um is an inter connected uh series of theories so there&#x27;s a theory for astronomy there&#x27;s a theory for chemistry there&#x27;s a theory for physics there&#x27;s a a theory for economics there&#x27;s a the theory for religion metaphysics philosophy all these things and they&#x27;re all interconnected they all are based on the same principles and in many cases you can use the same equations across fields which is so much different than the pigeon hold jargon Laden um uh curriculum of a modern you know Western life where you know you have to go to graduate school and study for S years to learn um you know biology but then you don&#x27;t know Jack about any other subjects because they what you&#x27;ve learned about biology doesn&#x27;t apply to anything else but here if you learn something in one field it will apply to other fields as well it&#x27;s an interrelated a system of theory and then uh the reciprocal system is also known as the universe of motion because Larson uh attempts to build his Universe upon motion the first postulate his first postulate reads as um the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so we&#x27;ve got motion we&#x27;ve got three dimensions we&#x27;ve got um discrete units and we have two reciprocal aspects space and time okay when larsson&#x27;s talking about motion he&#x27;s talking about something more generalized uh that is called a scalar motion a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction you can Envision a scalar motion with a balloon that you put dots on if you blow up the balloon all of the dots will be moving away from each other they won&#x27;t be moving in any specific Direction they&#x27;ll in fact be moving in all directions every dot will be moving away from every other Dot and really every point every location on the surface of that balloon will be moving away from every other location on that surface so it&#x27;s a motion in all directions um therefore no specific Direction and really the directions are just in or out depending on whether the balloon is expanding or Contracting the expanding balloon Larson calls the progression the Contracting balloon he refers to as gravitation and uh this basic motion can occur really in three dimensions and uh you can also abstract this motion if you decide that you want to assign a reference point to one of the dots you say this dot for the purposes of my uh you know um sanity here is motionless and then you can start to measure the the directions and um and you will be able to see that all of the other dots will be moving either toward or away from that other Dot and it will look as if there&#x27;s a force field it will look as this there&#x27;s an attractive force or a repulsive Force emanating from the your reference Dot and that it is affecting these other dots but in fact all of the dots are actually just uh following their own path they&#x27;re all moving uh toward all each other and so there is no Force Larson refers to this as an as if force it looks like there&#x27;s a force but there isn&#x27;t and it actually mathematically computes to a force um you know there is an inverse Square law of the gravitational force and the dots will comply with that inverse Square law but there isn&#x27;t any Force it&#x27;s each one of the dots is pursuing its own course now if you take that um idea of this assigning reference system and basically stopping the universe or abstracting um you know the um the whole moving uh motion Universe then you get uh this the spatial reference system and the temporal reference system so the the spatial reference system is what we&#x27;re familiar with here in the uh you know in our um environment here in the universe where we perceive three dimensions of space in a still frame um you know coordinate space XYZ coordinates um and it&#x27;s appears to be like a background that we&#x27;re moving through and so we see this coordinate space along with clock time so the clock time is a scalar Motion in time time is getting later and later and later and it&#x27;s not moving in any specific Direction now if we were in a different environment of the universe we would perceive the inverse of that which would be three dimensions of time in a still frame and progressing space space space would always be getting later and later and later like a scale in a scalar manner like on the surface of an expanding balloon but time would appear to be motionless and you could um me measure it in three uh three dimensions with vectors so that&#x27;s you know vectorial Motion in space or time in their spatial or temporal reference system now it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that in order to describe these three dimensions of space or time you only need one dimension of motion okay so you have three dimensions of motion but you only need one to describe the spatial reference system and you need one to describe the temporal reference system okay now um you also have the this reciprocal relationship between space and time um this seems a little bit absurd the reciprocal of space is time but um if you just look at our most basic motion speed the car is moving 15 mil hour that&#x27;s 15 miles of space in 1 hour of time space over time um and if you double the speed then you would say the car is moving 30 m an hour now or equivalently you could say the car is now moving 15 miles per half hour so you can double the space or you could half the time that is a reciprocal relationship and so there is a reciprocal relationship in speed at least Larson spreads that out and applies it to all scientific phenomena he equates all scientific phenomena to motions so in Larson&#x27;s world uh matter is a kind of motion energy is a kind of motion uh temperature and pressure are kinds of motion electrical charge is a kind of motion um and so on so um and he says that they all are reciprocal Rel relationships between space and time basically all of our scientific quantities are fractions with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator keeping in mind that time and space can be um multi-dimensional okay and then we have um the discrete unit postulate now first in order to really even get with the concept of a uh Universe of motion you have to be able to understand that motion exists before anything moving uh you have an empty Universe where motion is the only thing existing you have motion of uh nothing and in fact the thing that would be moving is motion itself because matter is a form of motion so uh Larson has what he call calls the null point or the neutral point the zero point he calls it the progression of the natural reference system and this is um the progression like on the surface of that balloon it it&#x27;s always progressing one unit of space per one unit of time and um it turns out that that one unit of space in one unit of of time is the speed of light so Larson refers to that as unit speed or the speed of light so that is the null point or the zero point or The Ether the origin the source of this universe is motion outward at the speed of light in all directions and he refers to that as the progression of the natural reference system so as the midpoint or the null Point uh you get half of the universe is actually moving moving slower than the speed of light and half is moving faster than the speed of light the half that&#x27;s moving slower is called the material sector the half that&#x27;s moving fast faster is called The Cosmic sector in the material sector you have coordinate space and clock time in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and clock space um and so that shows not only the reciprocal relationship between the two sectors but also that when you cross that boundary the rules reverse and the roles of space and time are interchanged now within both the material sector and the cosmic sector you have an inside region that also has to do with the discrete unit postulate the discrete unit postulate is basically that space time and motion come only in discrete units you can&#x27;t have half a unit or 23 of a unit you either have a whole unit or you don&#x27;t have anything and so in the material sector uh you have atoms and molecules that are interacting in less than one unit of space one unit of space is approximately 2 millions of an inch um and uh you know it&#x27;s very large compared to the size of atoms and so when atoms interact in this small space they don&#x27;t interact in space because there isn&#x27;t space because it&#x27;s less than one unit of space and if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you don&#x27;t have space so if you don&#x27;t have space you only have time because the universe is made out of space time or motion and so um it&#x27;s got to be one or the other or both so if it&#x27;s not space it has to be time lson refers to this as the time region and in the time region again when you cross that border into the time region the rules reverse and now the progression is moving inward you know the progression of that ex that formerly expanding balloon is now moving inward but really it&#x27;s moving still moving outward in time but we see it as moving inward in space because space and time are reciprocals of each other and uh the gravitation is now moving away so the um progression is causing pressure or or or compression and gravitation is causing repulsion or I suppose you could say um you know spreading out and or moving farther apart and um there is a spot uh where where those two forces are equal uh because the progression is constant it&#x27;s omnipresent Eternal and it&#x27;s always the same it&#x27;s one unit of space per one unit of time but gravitation is variable based on this inverse Square law and so there is a point where they are the same that&#x27;s called the equilibrium distance and Larson refers to that as the uh the interatomic distance this is the distance between um atoms in pack that are packed together in the solid state so the same thing also happens in the cosmic sector except that that happens uh with Cosmic atoms and Cosmic molecules what we call um antimatter and it occurs in what Larson calls the space region because it occurs in less than one unit of time uh but again the rules revers and the progression is now Inward and gravitation is now outward now an atom is formed based on um the progression which is the source and it&#x27;s based on reversing the progression in three dimensions you first reverse it with a photon which is a vibrating unit and then you reverse the photon uh with rotations two two-dimensional rotations and one optional one-dimensional rotation in the opposite direction and that is the uh those are the numbers Larson uses for his periodic table it&#x27;s a three number system three motions the primary uh two-dimensional rotation a secondary two-dimensional rotation that altern at with the first and then a uh one-dimensional uh rotation in the opposite direction that can be zero in the noble gases and it can be positive or negative and so these are kind of the basic factors larsson&#x27;s dealing with when he uh deals with the basic properties of matter as in this book here now in chapter five we got to a point where we were talking about the specific heat curve um heat is is really uh you know it&#x27;s a disruptive Force to the atom so it you know once you get to your equilibrium position then um then you deal with forces of compression which will tend to force that equilibrium position even closer together and the forces of heat which are going to move that equilibrium position farther apart and um Larson discussed the various aspects of heat that move it apart and that cause it to eventually leave the time region entirely which is um in one dimension when it leaves the time region it is called the melting point and at in when it leaves the time region in all three dimensions it&#x27;s referred to as the um boiling point or you know becomes a gas there&#x27;s also a a heat increment that you have to get to um kind of cross that border the heat of fusion or the heat of vaporization uh but uh but there are various uh expedients that the atom can use in order to kind of Stave off um leaving the time region because it wants to stay in the time region and one thing that it can do is it can um to modify the specific heat curve is it can um kind of change the uh uh well let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let Larson explain it here okay when the rotation 2 curve reaches its end point at uh 2917 okay before that uh he he calculated here the specific heat which is the amount of heat that you need to add to um to accomplish a certain temperature change uh in a certain uh element and that specific heat pattern uh also it has units just like everything in Larson system has units like uh you know because it&#x27;s a discrete unit system and um basically he found that um he using the gas constant which is a measure of the specific heat and when the when the gas constant gets to two and one3 units when it gets to three units it leaves the time region in one dimension uh but because of the photon and the vibratory nature of the photon um the photon can add 2/3 or subtract 2/3 from that number and so if the if the um so so when it&#x27;s subtracting 2/3 of that number the number needs to be 2 and 1/3 but before it gets to 2 and 1/3 the second rotational unit is activated and when you use the second rotational unit uh because it&#x27;s a three-dimensional distribution you have to divide by 8 2 the3 power and so now um egie says the pattern is followed up to the two and the3 level at that point the second rotational unit is activated the initial specific heat level for rotation 2 is subject to the same n the3 factor is the thermal specific heat and is therefore uh 12th instead of 2/3 and this change in the negative initial level raises the net positive specific heat corresponding to the thermal uh value 3 R up to 2 and 11 12th as opposed to 2 and 1/3 and enables the thermal motion to continue on the basis of the preferred negative initial value and this causes the specific heat curve to bend and then when it gets up to two in 11 12s it can change again to the rotation three basis which is based on 3 to the 3 power and that which is 27 and 1/ half of that or 2/3 of that is 2 over 81 uh which is approximately 2975 okay that was the number I couldn&#x27;t figure out where he got that from but that it&#x27;s because I was forgotting forgetting to divide by 2/3 there so when the rotation 2 curve reaches the end point reaches its end point at 2917 r r is the gas constant our net positive specific heat a further reduction of the initial level by a transition to the rotation 3 bases where the higher rotation is available raises the maximum value to 2975 or 2 in um 79 over 81 another similar trans transition follows if a fourth vibrating unit is possible the following tab tabulation shows the specific values corresponding to the initial and final levels of each curve as indicated earlier the the units applicable to the second column under each heading are calories per gam mole per degree Kelvin so he gets he has a a table here and um he&#x27;s uh showing you the negative specific heat level once you get up to that uh four level you&#x27;re dealing with uh really one out of 96 because 4 to the 3 power is 64 and you take 2/3 of that so 164 * 2/3 is 2 over um 192 1 over 96 and so that level goes all the way up to 2.98 9 uh 9896 and that takes uh the specific heat level up even higher um ultimately the maximum net positive specific heat that is possible on the basis of a negative initial level is attained here the transition to a positive initial level takes place and the curve continues onto the overall maximum which is 3 and 2/3 so now the whole Photon uh what does he say uh transition to a positive initial level so it switches from the negative initial level to the positive initial level of the original Photon that&#x27;s at the core of every atom and so now um you get to go all the way up to 3 and 2/3 whereas before you were just up to 29896 so the atom naturally does everything that it possibly can to avoid Crossing this boundary um it first it goes to rotation two then rotation three and maybe rotation four and then it flips over to the positive initial level and the curve continues on to the overall maximum as a result of this mechanism of successive transitions each number of vibrating units has its own characteristic specific heat curve the curve for rotation one has already already been presented and so the curve for rotation one is just a straight curve and then the curve for rotation two has one uh shift in well the curve for rotation one is really a straight curve till it gets to the to uh the point where it shifts to two uh to the positive initial level of the photon and then it goes up the uh the two level curve shifts twice and then the three level curve shifts three times and the four level curves shifts four times for convenience we will call this a type two curve the curve for rotation one has already been uh presented that that&#x27;s he calls a type two two curve just to make it more confusing um and then the different type one curves those of two three and four vibrating units are shown in uh figure four as can be seen from these diagrams there is a gradual flattening and an increase in the ratio of temperature uh to specific heat as the number of vibratory units increases the actual temperature scale of the curve applicable to any particular element or compound depends on the thermal characteristics of the substance but the relative temperature scale is determined by the factors already considered and the curves of figure 4 have been drawn on this relative basis so depending on what kind of of an atom you have it&#x27;s going to take one of those different kinds of Curves as indicated in uh the equation which is uh T 2T Over N the 3 so 2 * uh temperature over the end of the third the number of um rotations the slope of the rotation two segment of the specific heat curve is only 1/8 of the slope of the rotation one segment while this second segment starts at a temperature corresponding to 2 and 1/3 specific heat rather than from zero temperature the fixed relation between the two slopes means that a projection of the 2unit curve back to zero temperature always intersects the zero temperature ordinate at the same point regardless of the actual temperature scale of the curve so he&#x27;s taking these line segments from the inflection points of the curve and he&#x27;s projecting them back all the way to the zero point the zero temperature ordinate point at the same point and they and so regardless of the temperature scale the uh the line projects back to the same point on that vertical uh axis there the slopes of the three unit and four unit curves are likewise specifically related to those of the earlier curves and each of these higher curves also has a fixed initial point we will find this feature very convenient in analyzing complex specific heat curves as each experimental curve can be broken down into a succession of straight lines lines intersecting the zero ordinate at these fixed points the numerical values of which are follow as follows and so the first curve intersects at minus. 132 this second one at 3.89 this third one at 5.23 and the fourth one at 5.62 um okay I think that&#x27;s about it here for today and uh you know don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re getting lost here um this is all in the weeds and it&#x27;s all like more advanced than you probably need for uh learning the being a beginner in the reciprocal system but I&#x27;m just trying to quote Larson because I&#x27;m not able to express uh what he&#x27;s saying fully um and I want to put it on the record so that the person if they really are studious they can get it and hopefully I will clarify these uh as I learn to understand them all right thanks for having uh tuning in</p>
