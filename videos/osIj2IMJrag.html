            <p>welcome back to energyscapes Ocean and space today I thought would have a conversation about two people in particular that did some work uh that was very interesting probably nearly 20 years ago now they were working on it and that&#x27;s uh Douglas tour and Dr ning Lee you&#x27;ll recognize them in this photo which you can get off the internet with the disc in front of them that created a anti-gravity effect um so you can find that you can find that photo on the internet now um Douglas tour worked with Dr Nang Lee and collaborated with her at the University of Alabama in Huntsville so over 20 years ago and they were supposedly working on a gravity generator and according to a leaked document from the office of Technology transfer at the University of South Carolina which was confirmed what confirmed by wide magazine back in 1998 they planned to paint and license this disk device or gravity generator as they called it apparently some of the aspects of it included having a couple of electrodes that produced an inhomogenous electric field we&#x27;re now charged with a voltage potential degenerated gravitational effect um so the electric field of the charge sphere was radial and therefore spherically uh symmetric and produced a gravitational field with spherical symmetry sorry so depending on the sign of the charge the charged sphere would generate this gravitational force that would either attract or repel mass of objects so um in doing this research they found that a time-dependent electric electric field will produce a time a um a Time dependent propagation of a gravitational field away from the source at the speed of light with each cycle reversal and of course um what happened is the first electrode would be a portion of a sphere a cone uh or a cylinder and the second electrode would be attached to and related to the sphere cone or cylinder as well and they could be Hollow so that&#x27;s what they were doing back then then I dug up an article uh about Dr ning Lee and her work on this disc from Popular Mechanics in October 2000 and that was called taming gravity so I&#x27;ll just highlight a few things from that and then cross reference it with a couple of books that relate to it now Popular Mechanics visited uh Huntsville Alabama and its laboratory to have a look at the proof of concept of this disc that Dr ning Lee was working on um they called it a force-filled machine all right and when complete you could literally place a bowling ball uh above it and let go go and it would hold its position and be repelled by this disc now of course physicists define gravity as an attractive force between two masses and is one of the one of the four forces the other two being the strong and weak nuclear force and of course the electromagnetic force um so when we go back to for example if we go back to 1911 it&#x27;s way back then to over 100 years ago we had a guy called Edward defaro now he looked at weight reducing devices and called them condensing cylinders which probably were just giant electromagnetics um so that but they were still interested in what the effect of gravity was or how to control gravity even back then even though they quite didn&#x27;t understand the concept and what they were looking at but if you jump forward and back into the early 2000s you even had people like BAE Systems and their project Green Glow looking at um gravity or the Quest for control of gravity so it&#x27;s been around for a long time and we can go back way before then right back to world two with all this sort of stuff um so Dr ning Lee&#x27;s work there is an Einstein connection there as well and just pulling information from this article from Popular Mechanics the disc that was fabricated by Dr ning Lee that was back in the 1980s and so she predicted that for example a Time varying magnetic field if it were applied to a superconductor the iron&#x27;s trapped in a ladder structure would absorb enormous amounts of energy all right and therefore generate rapid Spin and of course a small gravitational field so we could it&#x27;s also useful to think of something called an unusual state of matter called the Bose Einstein condensates right which is a state of management manner that matter that&#x27;s generated in the lab under experimental conditions and it&#x27;s when atoms are all aligned in the same way and they behave as if they&#x27;re a single atom so you you buy orders of magnitude magnitude expand the gravitational effect of just one atom into billions and billions of times so that&#x27;s what this disc was that Dr ningley had the disc actually made that happen so billions of atoms acted as one producing this gravitational field to have an observer observable effect and repelling for example the bowling ball um so I&#x27;ve got to remember of course that this this wasn&#x27;t modifying gravity it was producing a gravity-liked effect and that was either attractive or repulsive right so Dr nangli explained that as the iron spin they create this gravito electric field that&#x27;s perpendicular to the spin axis and that&#x27;s what was happening on their disk okay and the larger the disk the greater the the force field it produces and supposedly it could be controllable all right so you could think for example you could think of UFOs when you talk about this and and the supposed disc sample Source or shape UFOs having such a um device as part of their propulsion system and we can go back to exam for example Otis car Otis cars work on his disk and what he was looking at to doing with with um propellers propulsion systems and the plans and schematics for his saucer shape disc or even back to for example Victor shawberger uh during and after World War II and his um saucer-shaped disc and implosion technology and and that as well and generating a um anti-gravity effect or gravitational field that canceled or reduced Mass significantly enough to travel that absolutely enormous speeds uh through physical space and then of course you&#x27;ve got people like uh David Childress going back and looking at the DSs secret program that supposedly worked with flying saucer discs as well and developed that technology during and after World War II outside of Nazi Germany so there&#x27;s a whole history there about all this and we can even go back to more of a theory behind it about whether gravity is attractive and repulsive or a gravity-like effect that can be produced that is either great um attractive or repulsive to people like Andrew Thomas and His Works hidden in plain sight uh book one the link between relative relativity and quantum mechanics and has booked to the equation of the universe now he discusses the fact that it can be proven that gravity is both attractive and repulsive and it looks at the theory and its application around why that is so and looks at things like walking radiation event Horizons and black holes and ripping apart matter and talks about why gravity is both repulsive and attractive so it&#x27;s quite quite some good cross references there with Dr ning Lee&#x27;s work now what happened to Dr lingley is curious as well and I&#x27;ve got a statement here that I&#x27;ve found and downloaded uh where they said what happened to her anti-gravity research and the quote here from here as I&#x27;ve collected all the measurement data for my equations if we take mass and rotate it very rapidly we can generate gravity we can increase gravity we can weaken it we can steer it in any direction I have the theory I will publish it I have all the mathematical equations I will explain it I will think my theory is mature I will tell the world anti-gravity is nothing to laugh about I think the experiments of doctor I think that&#x27;s how you pronounce it I&#x27;ve shown the anti-gravity effect is Crystal Clear it&#x27;s too important and belongs to All American people now she disappeared back in the early 2000s and people couldn&#x27;t contact her anymore and so the and the head scientist uh at the University of Alabama Larry Smalley also died back then as well so what happened where did the research go and what happened to ning Lee she did form a company called AC gravity LLC and got a grant from the US Department of Defense to pursue her research so we know that much and we also know that she sent a private email to colleague colleagues in May 2003 because I have a copy of that here which I&#x27;ve got hold of as well and there was a reply to that from the uh Department of Defense that she was working for them and therefore not permitted to discuss her work openly anymore so it leaves it with a bit of a mystery there as to what happened to her work and her technology that she had supposedly proven actually worked with this disc and its repulsive uh gravity-like effect so I&#x27;ll leave it at that for now um it&#x27;s another puzzle or a piece of the puzzle in in quite a big puzzle on uh propoundedness propulsion systems disk technology gravito electric effects so get on the comments if you&#x27;re interested have a look and let me know what you think [Music]</p>
