            <p>foreign [Music] with a Meg we haven&#x27;t gone to that stage yet we&#x27;re still in the open loop system where we haven&#x27;t put the feedback but it&#x27;s possible to do that we just are working things out one thing at a time here&#x27;s what we have in the Meg and here&#x27;s why we can do it with the Mig legitimately as proven in physics in the Meg uh suppose I have a toroid coil a toroid is wound around like this in a circle but it&#x27;s wound all the way around it very tightly and it closes back almost on itself what happens in the toroidal coil is a magnetic field the B field is confined inside the coil it can&#x27;t escape outside normally the magnetic field spills out all into space we need to know two things magnetic field in any force field is not a primary field of nature the primary thing is always a potential and it&#x27;s called a magnetic Vector potential a that&#x27;s the name of it magnetic vector potential now a magnetic Vector potential is a weird Beast it&#x27;s got two components basically one is swirling it&#x27;s a curled component we would write that Del cross a and that is what we call the magnetic field B and normally it hides the other compound it covers it to where we don&#x27;t see the other component the other component is one that doesn&#x27;t have a curl doesn&#x27;t have a curl it&#x27;s moving straight so the curl of it is zero but it&#x27;s still a real potential if you take this Toro oil coil first of all we had to pay to get that b field trapped but it&#x27;s been found by Aaron offenbaum in 1959 that if I normally have a source of B field and I just draw a DOT here that makes me feel it&#x27;s actually a dipole and here&#x27;s the B field spreading out in space I know that&#x27;s a curled magnetic Vector potential a that I&#x27;m looking at and it&#x27;s hiding this other component I can&#x27;t see it turns out if you&#x27;ll take all that b field all that curl compound and pull it back in and hold it in the little area localized area so that doesn&#x27;t spill out into space you reveal outside there that hidden component the uncurled or the curl free a potential so isn&#x27;t this interesting if you localize the B feel into a little small location instead of spreading through all space you have all the B field energy you would have had through all space you got that in your hand in this local space but outside that you&#x27;ve got a whole bunch of extra energy now in uncurled a potential form well a potential is wonderful in the curl form it makes magnetic feel so if I&#x27;ve got magnetic field I got all my curl component down here in this localization Zone and outside here I have a new component of energy I didn&#x27;t have to use before in my immediate environment available isn&#x27;t that interesting because it&#x27;s easy to collect it all you have to do is change it real fast the time rate of change d-a-d-t produces an e field in the opposite direction from where the a field was going which direction it was heading it makes an e feel and the magnitude of this e field that it makes this electric field is proportional to how fast you change the thing the time rate of change so now wouldn&#x27;t it be interesting if I could find a Transformer core material and construction which would do localization of the B field what would I have if I did that instead of just looking at the B field in my Transformer I would have to be feel now inside the core material but outside the core material I would have a new available reservoir of extra energy in my environment and all I got to do is perturb it and it&#x27;ll make electric fields which come back into the system and introduce real electric field energy into the system which normally no Transformer does that&#x27;s what we do with the Meg we found with this nanocrystalline material they&#x27;re making for new Transformers and all we found a construction core right off the shelf type of construction and nanocrystalline material there&#x27;s two or three types that&#x27;ll do it that if I make a Transformer core material here I&#x27;ll draw a simple one this is just a diagram it&#x27;s not exactly the way we structure it any source of magnetic field for example if I have an input coil here like this and I&#x27;m paying for the input all the magnetic field from this coil all of it is trapped in this core it doesn&#x27;t get out and there&#x27;s no spillage out there into space interesting how can I prove that I put a permanent magnet very tightly across here North Pole here south pole here gotta have real good contact no air gaps well this magnet it&#x27;s a very powerful little magnet it&#x27;s right across the Transformer core material and then I take an instrument with a field probe to measure magnetic field B and I put it right on let&#x27;s say that North Pole my instrument measures no magnetic field or almost zero it&#x27;s impossible to get total contact you will have the tiny tiny air gap so you will measure a tiny tiny feel but essentially a zero magnetic field right on the surface of the magnet now that proves that all the magnetic field that normally Spilled Out of This magnet everywhere has got sucked into this core and it&#x27;s sitting there when you localize the B field and expose around it that usually hidden uncurled a potential that&#x27;s called The Aronoff bomb effect arenoff was a student a bomb arunoff bomb was David Baum of course as everybody&#x27;s aware and in 1959 they published a very formidable and fundamental paper in a physical review series pointing out this effect when you localize this magnetic field in the space outside this core not in the core outside the core there appears this a potential but it&#x27;s the on curl variety now it&#x27;s extra I didn&#x27;t pay for it if you want to put it in proper gauge language the air enough volume effect gauge transforms the space outside the localization area which means you see additional energy available there in space itself that&#x27;s rigorously proven in literature don&#x27;t have to reprove it twenty thousand papers in literature but it&#x27;s not in electrical engineering but it&#x27;s in physics the difference here in the Meg is we don&#x27;t have to pay for what this material is doing we didn&#x27;t have to pay to get that extra a potential energy Reservoir formed outside the core that happened free it&#x27;s from that re-gaged space-time which is a change in that vacuum is a result of the fact that this core material will do for free what I got to pay a toroid to do only is free I don&#x27;t have to pay for that effect if I got a toroid I can get the effect but I pay for it I lose everything I&#x27;m going to get I don&#x27;t have to pay for it in this case the material does that extra action for me that&#x27;s the beauty material Effects by the way are one of those places already recognized in thermodynamics itself as violating the second law of Thermodynamics material effects like long-term memory and all kinds of things Reed trigaging and contribute his book modern thermodynamics that deals with non-equilibrium systems you will find that that&#x27;s one of the areas that is known by the thermodynamic system cells to violate that second law so I don&#x27;t have to prove it I&#x27;m violating it permissibly it&#x27;s already been done by Nobel Prize winner so what we have now is I have an interesting situation I have a norm what looks like a normal Transformer core but there&#x27;s a very abnormal thing happening in it all of the magnetic field B is now confined to the Core and around that I&#x27;ve got all the magnetic field energy the swirling energy that I normally have in every Transformer I&#x27;ve got all of that I haven&#x27;t lost anything but in addition I&#x27;ve got this extra energy Reservoir in space just outside the core and every time I perturb the core like with my input coil I put in clever devil that we are we put in pulses sharp rise time and sharp Decay time if I want to get a little bigger e field I make a sharper rise time and a sharper Decay time I get a knee feel One Direction one time and the other and what happens is the space here I can have as many coils wound on this core as I wish let&#x27;s put an output coil on it just to say we got an output and looks like I got my drawing a little bit reverted but that&#x27;s okay there&#x27;s an output and over here I got a big load but in this space outside the core I&#x27;m going to shade the core here so we can begin to see what this looks like in this space outside where my uncurled a potential is and I&#x27;m going to put a bar over that a to mean that it&#x27;s a straight moving a it&#x27;s not a swirling hey it&#x27;s not a magnetic field at all every time I shake or perturb this a potential it makes an e field a equals minus d a DT and the sharper the change the greater the size of the E field from space around the core this does not happen in any other normal Transformer in the in the whole world as far as we&#x27;re aware from the space outside the Mig there arises then these tremendously strong e fields which radiate into every coil that&#x27;s wound on this Transformer so every chord on this Transformer this way I could have a dozen coils on here every one of them is also regardless of what other function it&#x27;s producing is also an input coil for energy coming in from the vacuum in electric field form not magnetic field form the biggest action in the Mig is an electric field Transformer not a magnetic field Transformer and we&#x27;re using a proven effect Aaron Obama affected twenty thousand papers in the literature already tell you happens for real we didn&#x27;t dream this one up we just found how to do it for free how to get it to happen with a material doing it for us and Stillness have to pay a thyroid to do it and lose all the advantage every call then has got e field inputs that&#x27;s in phase the funny thing about our output a normal Transformer output will be up towards 90 degrees these are 85 degrees it&#x27;s got some resistance in it but it&#x27;ll be like almost pure reactive power coming out of it that&#x27;s not true of the Meg it&#x27;ll be two degrees it&#x27;ll be essentially in Phase it&#x27;s almost pure power and not a real power not reactive power hence it&#x27;s in pulse form and so what we have to do we have to add another unit on here standard technology to change these pulse forms into a normal kind of power form like oscillating current or DC current whatever so you just go buy that off the shelf from people who are experts and do it very efficiently but what we really have the significant it&#x27;s not a regular Transformer we have an extra energy input from the environment that we don&#x27;t pay for that&#x27;s the key now let&#x27;s draw the Meg diagram and it turns out to be just like that crazy heat pump I have my system called the Mig I&#x27;m going to do the open loop I&#x27;m putting in the operator input I&#x27;m paying for that paying the power company or the you know paying for a battery or something but now from the environment I have this extra input of energy and I&#x27;m going to put the bar over the a and when I perturb it it&#x27;s going to be in D A DT equal minus E instead of going out it&#x27;s going to come in so now I have an extra input of energy into my system free from the environment just for putting in the input I&#x27;m putting in that comes the other part comes along for free I get that as an extra added attraction so if I put in one part and I get my input from the uncurled a potential active environment the E field input if I get that to be let&#x27;s say five parts be very conservative here I can make it 10 to 12 or 100 Parts but it&#x27;ll burn the insulation right off the wire then it&#x27;ll destroy the unit but suppose I settle for five I make adjust the rise time and Decay time until I get this five parts in now coming out I have input here six parts total the part I put in and I pay for the five parts that the environment puts in I don&#x27;t have to pay for so I have six parts of energy coming in here a normal Transformer can be about 85 percent 90 percent efficient recapitulating I pay to put input one part the environment is now by the way we have it adjusted we make the adjustments in the input until we get this effect let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s putting in five parts and now we have a total of six parts total energy being put in here okay let&#x27;s suppose this is ninety percent efficient coming out of that then I&#x27;ll have ninety percent of the six parts which is 5.4 so my energy that I&#x27;m getting out is 5.4 parts okay what&#x27;s the cop I put in one I get out 5.4 divide 5.4 by one the cop is equal to 5 .4 I get 5.4 times as much usable energy out as I get in this is just an energy converter now when I add another stage on here to convert that into a standard kind of power form you know either direct current and certain voltage or so forth AC I will have an inefficiency existed there maybe I&#x27;ll cut this down let&#x27;s do real bad let&#x27;s cut this down to three let&#x27;s lose two points almost half of it we didn&#x27;t have too efficient a conversion let&#x27;s say we were sloppy we didn&#x27;t go get the state of the art we&#x27;re much better than that but even with the bad one once we have it set to run loads and actually running loads and lights and Motors we&#x27;re putting in one part we&#x27;re getting out three parts we have a three to one we have a 3.0 cop practical and that&#x27;s 3.0 this is a standard achievable thing with a Meg okay then the question that&#x27;s asked then why don&#x27;t you guys have this thing on the market in mass production rolling everywhere it&#x27;s a very good question because let&#x27;s see why we don&#x27;t have what is going on in the Meg that we went through we pointed out that the E field hits every one of those coils there&#x27;s a little bit of out of phasing and everything they&#x27;re not all on the same phase and each call once it gets an e field Fires at every other coil and everything&#x27;s feeding forward feedback that&#x27;s a highly non-linear situation and that is the devil and all to try to precisely measure trying to measure an individual signal in a dense signal environment is not a simple thing that people can do it but it requires special instrumentation and highly specialized measurement equipment forget your normal oscilloscopes and probes you can never straighten all of that out you do it by trial and error and adjust it until it&#x27;s mostly additive what we need now is to do all the Precision modeling and all the Precision work to work all that out with a math model to work out the actual measurements and the characteristics of the material how that affects it and all this that&#x27;s one year very hard work you&#x27;ve got to have four specialists in special areas to work with you to do it we&#x27;re trying to measure all those exact signals and work out what we would call The Transfer function exact mathematical model for the transfer function of the Meg if you build those all out of phase so they&#x27;re subtractive rather than additive you&#x27;ll build a worse Transformer than a normal you&#x27;ll be better off throwing all that away and build a regular Transformer but if you get them additive you beat the heck out of every other Transformer in the world because it goes way over Unity we don&#x27;t have good control and good models of all of this what we have to do is adjust everything by hand and that&#x27;s not science we have to keep tweaking the heck out of it and so what we have to do is a standard but very interesting and very dense highly non-linear control problem an adjustment problem we have to have modeling full modeling for it we have to have an air enough measurement specialist air enough bomb measurement Specialists those guys are well employed very few of them that know our measurement measurement also you can get them but they&#x27;re expensive we have to have another person that knows non-linear oscillation Theory and also we have to have another one that knows non-linear oscillation control theory those are specializations you don&#x27;t run down to your local University and your local PhD can do that the interactions have got to be moved to design and Science and modeling rather than fiddling with it we have a 9 million dollar one-year job with a team including not only the normal guys but those four Specialists we got to hire that are very highly paid by the way I might say and they&#x27;re fully employed gainfully they&#x27;re not looking for a job by the way what voltages are you working with what level input and what level output five volts 10 Well normally we try to put something that&#x27;ll power something so we&#x27;re going to reduce whatever we come out with the output voltage we&#x27;re going to reduce it to like 120 volts or something like that now we can produce a thousand volts or 5000 volts out of this thing and burn the insulation right off the coils uh normally as an input we&#x27;ll use a battery or and we put in a circuit in front of it which is a switching circuit to do the switching to make it oscillating give the surprise time get the Decay time so you put in a circuit to do all of that and you adjust and tweak the circuit for the various tunings you want to do it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a sort of a tuning nightmare almost to get everything properly tuned but when you properly tune it it does produce what I&#x27;ve got on this paper but you can see right away this is not a simple problem I don&#x27;t go get me some Transformer guys and whoop up some of these and go sell them now you got your choice about how you fund this the normal scientific Community is not going to fund it they say you can&#x27;t do that electrical engineering says you can&#x27;t do forget it so what you&#x27;re going to have to do you&#x27;re going to have to go to venture capitalist here you it&#x27;s a mixed bag a mixed breed there are some good Venture capitalists there&#x27;s a whole bunch that ain&#x27;t too good you cannot work with uh as we discussed before with a government agency they&#x27;ll steal you blind and patent around you all around what you&#x27;ve done so you&#x27;re still going to have to go to a risk venture capitalist you&#x27;re going to have to convince him that the risk in fact justify the investment on the front end if you look at the risk analysis figures they&#x27;re great how big a payoff is self-powering systems and systems that produce a steady three to one output electrically they see once we run it through the hopper the year that we want to do on it where we have good models that we can design it in advance we can put the coil exactly like we need them exactly where we need them exactly with water orientation and so forth once we can do all of that from the front end we can build the thing straight forward and put it together and it&#x27;ll work just like that you&#x27;ve made it a technology and a science at that time not a twiddle with it research outfit we have a lab bench experiment that&#x27;s successful we do not have a ready for production device that can be cranked all across you know by the thousands and put on the market we&#x27;re approaching all the control problems first we have to do all of that first now in the United States we tend to be stupid a lot of times we took non-linear oscillation Theory and control of non-linear solid and made them two separate fields if you use the U.S control system the guy will have you chasing strange attractors for the next 10 years if you go to the Russians they&#x27;ll laugh like the devil at all of that and they&#x27;ll say there&#x27;s no problem even random oscillations we can control straight away with our Theory but they put the two together as one field fortunately they&#x27;re results of their control theory which as far so periods of hours are now available in books in the West we have a few people now who understand and are trained in the Russian system so we would jump all that other stuff and go direct to the Russian control system and use that to begin with once we have the math models we have the phenomenology fitted to it and we have the ability to design and build and scale up and it&#x27;ll work that way with just minor tweaking at that point we&#x27;re ready for production and marketing we&#x27;re not right now we are ready for the final stage of development to go from a lab bench experiment working successful two the pre-production out uh model ready to go into production engineering and production the beautiful thing that we have we have a recognized proven certified mechanism which does regaze that space around where the air enough bomb is affect and it&#x27;s in the literature Improvement I don&#x27;t have to reprove it so is it scientifically proven yes in the literature will the scientific Community accept it no because what they do is they say oh no it&#x27;s a power problem that&#x27;s electrical engineering electrical engineering says you can&#x27;t do that now they have been using the air not bomb effect since 1959 but have been paying for it like in a little tour oil course not getting it free and the other thing is the people have been using it are people that do itty bitty quantum mechanical experiments nobody has thought to use it in power General operational control is the square wave or the cycle it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not exactly a square Wave It&#x27;s a sharp ass time sharp Decay time that&#x27;s adjustable the pulse width and the pulse repetition rate are all adjustable there are many adjustments you can make everything affects this thing is you adjust what I&#x27;m asking about is the um the only danger is melting the insulation no there&#x27;s the the real problem is not that we can solve that just with the rise time Decay time and we&#x27;ve got that problem solved but the problems that are difficult really difficult is where you have all these high non-linearities and feed forwards and feedbacks you actually have a very dense signal environment right inside this thing you have to measure individual signals in a dense signal environment that&#x27;s a tough job but in theory you could build in theory you could build a system where all this is automatically calibrated once you have the once you have done the technology and the modeling yes you can do that now if we want to close loop this system let&#x27;s take this same system let&#x27;s put a real efficient so efficient I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s 1.0 because we can get 0.9 if we pay for real good guys to do it but for ease of calculation let&#x27;s put a feedback system on this thing and let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s 1.0 it&#x27;s 100 efficient so I don&#x27;t have to worry about that figure because this 5.4 might be bigger see I&#x27;m using my three here with what we really got of it in Practical after we got the shaping for loads I&#x27;m paying that price the actual output is 5.4 but I&#x27;m only charging the three because I&#x27;m willing to pay I know I&#x27;ve got to pay that conversion price it&#x27;s not going to be that much but I&#x27;m going to be very conservative here so I&#x27;m going to pay 2.4 points and leave my three okay with this hundred percent or nearly 100 I&#x27;m gonna feed one part back I&#x27;m Gonna Leave two point zero as the output but the one part that I feed back now can remove my generator and it&#x27;s Furnishing for part of its output is Furnishing that input this is clamped and governed so it&#x27;s not going to run away okay I&#x27;m now reduced to 2.0 from what I had been doing that was all the way up to 5.4 but that&#x27;s free energy it&#x27;s coming out it&#x27;s coming right out of the environment and it&#x27;s continuing and I&#x27;m not paying anything for it it now is the equivalent of a solar powered system or a hydroelectric powered system or a windmill powered system and its cop now is infinity with a closed loop once I disconnect that joint once I get it going and stable and operating on the load with all the controls working everything&#x27;s stabilized out I disconnect the generator that&#x27;s Crohn&#x27;s condition by the way Chrome laid that down in 1945. the great Gabriel Crone who built a successful negative resistor and self-powered the network analyzer at Stanford University laid down the condition for making itself powering so we&#x27;re just using Chrome&#x27;s method I am not free to name the university that&#x27;s working with us we are working with a foreign University we had to go completely out of the United States before we&#x27;d find one that in addition to non-disclosure would sign a non-circumvention agreement an inventor can&#x27;t work under just non-disclosure he&#x27;s also got to have non circumvention you must not say that I&#x27;m going to change some calls and all them patent this thing all around you and run off with it so if you have a non-circumvention agreement you can work with them we could find no U.S universities that would work with us under non-circumvention because they are charged with making patents and he&#x27;ll try to out patent you on your own device we found one in a nice foreign country and we&#x27;re we&#x27;re very satisfied with those people we&#x27;re working very close with them they are deliberately to be purely scientific staying independent of us they will not accept funding from us they are using their own funding which is bigger but they&#x27;re using their own funding so scientific Independence is being maintained the things that I&#x27;ve described we have to do before we get to ready for pre-production engineering is a minimum of one year and a minimum of nine million dollars any way we price it when we get the people that we have to have the Specialists the equipment the new test equipment the new methods of tests new test guys that do that kind of testing it&#x27;s an expensive proposition it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not cheap but that&#x27;s peanuts compared to what we&#x27;re spending on hot Fusion or what we&#x27;re spending on all kinds of things fuel cells and things like that they&#x27;re spending billions of dollars here this is scalable this is doable now there&#x27;s one other way we could do it we could sell stock and raise stock from investors and I could make all kinds of songs and dances and so could the rest of our group we prefer not to do that we are seeking one single risk Venture partner that we can work with it&#x27;s an honest group or people we can work out a mutual arrangement for both our benefits and then we can get on with the job now what we refuse to do is turn control over to it we could have gotten funding if we would surrender control and guarantee it never makes the market we have no intention of doing that so we will stumble along until we get funding that we can still guarantee it&#x27;ll go to market or we can give it the best shot that human beings can give in the world we&#x27;re not going to take something and park it on the shelf and it&#x27;s just one more system that never is going to make it</p>
