            <p>[Music] welcome to the True Crime Scene podcast today we present you with the truly shadowy origins of a controversial company called paler Technologies a company whose founder Peter teal is is now currently deeply involved with the Trump Administration and their involvement with Israeli intelligence agencies and their disturbing plans for the Palestinians stick around to learn all about this company&#x27;s history with the Central Intelligence Agency mad and DARPA and all of their Shady dealings in this video we really lay it all out for you and present a lot of great information not covered by tub popup pundits so without further Ado here we go tuner Technologies is a data analytics and software company that has deep ties to various intelligence agencies including the CIA DARPA and mad Israel&#x27;s so-called intelligence agency the company is known for developing Advanced software platforms for data integration analysis and visualization which are widely used in National Security intelligence and defense sectors palente products are designed to help organizations make sense of vast amounts of data which has made the company particularly attractive to intelligence agencies like the CIA DARPA and foreign intelligence services like mad founding and origins of paler Technologies paler Technologies was founded in 2003 by a group of entrepreneurs with backgrounds in technology intelligence and Venture Capital the company was established with the goal of creating data analytics software that could assist in counterterrorism efforts and intelligence gathering its primary goal was to build tools capable of analyzing and making sense of large data sets specifically for government and intelligence applications here are four key founders of paler one Peter theel the&#x27;s background is as an entrepreneur venture capitalist and co-founder of PayPal teal is widely known for his investment in Facebook and his strong influence in the technology World his education teal has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University as well as a doctorate of jurist prudence from Stanford law school Teal&#x27;s role in paler is the co-founder and former CEO his background in both technology and investment help secure palente early funding and set the company&#x27;s Direction he also served as the company&#x27;s initial financier keal&#x27;s connection to the CIA stems from his role in financing and supporting paler software which was initially developed to serve intelligence purposes including so-called counterterrorism number two Steven Cohen Cohen worked as a chief engineer at PayPal where he played a role in developing the financial platform&#x27;s infrastructure step Cohen has a PHD in computer science from Stanford University Cohen co-founded paler alongside teal and others focusing on building the company&#x27;s core data analytics software number three Alexander karp karp was CEO of paler Technologies karp is known for his academic background in philosophy and his extensive work in data science and software development his leadership has been Central to palente operations especially with its military and intelligence connections karp has a PhD in Philosophy from Stanford University karp&#x27;s role in paler was instrumental in guiding the company&#x27;s Direction and forming relationships with the CIA and other governmental agencies palente relationship with the CIA initial CIA investment palente relationship with the CIA goes back to its early days one of the company&#x27;s first major Investments came from inel the cia&#x27;s Venture Capital arm which was established to invest in Hightech companies that could support the CIA is intelligence gathering and biod defense efforts inel was established in 1999 to ensure the CIA had access to Cutting Edge Technologies paler Technologies was among the first companies to receive significant backing from inel in 2004 paler secured its first funding from inq which allowed the company to develop its software platform for intelligence applications this was a pivotal moment in paler growth as it marked the company&#x27;s commitment to helping intelligence agencies Palante data analytics software has been used extensively by the CIA particularly for counterterrorism and intelligence gathering operations palente here creates software for the CIA the software allows intelligence agencies to analyze large-scale data sets integrate data from various sources and make sense of complex relationships between individuals organizations and events paler software including paler Gotham and paler Foundry is specifically tailored to meet the needs of government agencies involved in National Security paler Gotham is used primarily by intelligence agencies including the CIA to conduct search and Analysis of large volumes of intelligence data while paler Foundry is used for a variety of Enterprise level applications in the public and private sectors darpa&#x27;s role in palente devel velopment while palen&#x27;s primary focus has been on working with intelligence agencies like the CIA the company has also been closely linked to DARPA which stands for defense Advanced research projects agency which is responsible for advancing cuttingedge Technologies for military and defense purposes DARPA and palente early funding DARPA the department of defense&#x27;s advanced research and development arm has provided funding to paler Technologies for projects focused on intelligence gathering and data analysis as part of its Mission DARPA has a history of investing in technologies that are critical to National Security including data analytics artificial intelligence cyber security and biotechnology paler data integration and Analysis platforms fit well within these areas of Interest palen&#x27;s involvement with DARPA was instrumental in developing its capabilities for handling Military Intelligence cyber security and large-scale data integration palente ties to mosad Israeli intelligence known for their vast International SEO abuse blackmail operation hopefully my abbreviation made sense just trying to avoid censorship on this platform palen&#x27;s relationship with Israeli intelligence specifically mosad has been the subject of speculation and controversy due to the closed collaboration between the company and Israeli intelligence agencies mosad is isra National Intelligence Agency responsible for intelligence gathering covert operations and counterterrorism activities collaborations with Israeli intelligence paler Technologies has been reported to have a close working relationship with Israeli intelligence agencies including mosad and shinette Israel&#x27;s domestic Security Service palente software has been used by Israeli agencies for a variety of counterterrorism and Military purposes particularly in relation to data anal analysis and intelligence gathering for example mosad has reportedly used paler to analyze terrorist networks and to support intelligence operations in cyber security and military operations one notable example of paler collaboration with Israel is its involvement in analyzing data related to the Iranian nuclear program paler data integration tools were used to analyze large sets of intelligence data to help the Israeli government understand and track developments in Iran&#x27;s nuclear Ambitions Peter Teal&#x27;s relationship with Israel Peter teal one of palen&#x27;s co-founders has long expressed a strong support for Israel which has influenced the company&#x27;s decision to work closely with Israeli intelligence agencies tial has spoken publicly about his admiration for Israel&#x27;s technological capabilities and the importance of Israeli Innovation and areas like cyber security and defense to advance Zionism now what do you think about the use of Art artificial intelligence or lavender by the IDF in identifying Hamas targets and secondly do you agree with Elon Musk about that the population decline is a risk for Humanity um um look I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not um you know you know with without without um going into all the you know I I&#x27;m not on top of all the details of what&#x27;s going on in Israel because my my bias is to defer to Israel it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not for us to to second guess every um everything and uh I I believe that um broadly the IDF gets to decide uh what it wants to do and that they&#x27;re broadly in the right and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s sort of the the perspective I come back to and if I if I fall into the Trap of um arguing you on every detailed point I&#x27;m I&#x27;m actually going to I would actually be conceding the the the broader issue that um the Middle East should be micromanaged from Cambridge and I think that&#x27;s just simply absurd and so I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not going to concede that point um palen&#x27;s relationship with the CIA DARPA and mosad underscores its controversial role in the intersection between technology military and intelligence the company&#x27;s software is designed for agencies tasked with National Security counterterrorism and defense and it has become a willing tool in the United States and Israeli government&#x27;s intelligence arals a company like paler which actually is cheering on the war you know they held their board meeting in Israel a few months after the war started because the uh CEO said he wanted to embarrass other supporters of Israel to come forward and vocally support the war and then their founder Peter theel for some his PR guy must be an idiot but he had him and one of those things where he&#x27;s got to answer questions from students in the UK and so they asked him how did he feel about the fact that their software is being used to speed up targeting against civilians in the Caza he said well you know I don&#x27;t really follow that so much I mean I I sort of trust Israel to take care of I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re taking care um the only person I&#x27;ve ever heard say something like that is Tony blinkin I mean it&#x27;s just and he actually came from West exec advisers which uh advises weapons companies uh but they do it in such a way that they say they give strategic advis they&#x27;re not lobbyist so they don&#x27;t have to report a lot of things uh you know the more you scratch the surface many many of these people are benefiting we did a piece on um what happens to four and five star generals and Admirals when they leave the government 80% of them went into the weapons industry 80% yeah and you know as a general maybe you make 200,000 with a bunch of perks which is a lot of money uh if you go to lockie Martin you could make 200,000 to go to four meetings a year and if you go to a a you know one of these tech companies investing in like paler uh if you hit it big you could make millions so a lot of these folks while they&#x27;re in government you know they&#x27;re aware where they want to end up so they don&#x27;t want to mess with these firms because this is this is how they&#x27;re going to cash in and to work with these folks and then on the other end of it once you graduate from some of these firms and and make a lot of money and and establish yourself then as you&#x27;ve documented in profits of War there are also Avenues to get back into government yes it&#x27;s like a spin cycle you know like James Mattis who came in to the Trump Administration came from the board of General Dynamics when he left he went back to the board of General Dynamics they&#x27;ve kind of so rationalized it that they just feel like well I&#x27;m doing the right thing and the fact that I&#x27;m making money is secondary future implications precedent setting the use of palente Technology sets a precedent for artificial intelligence in Warfare potentially normalizing such practices this could have long-term implications for international Norms around Warfare privacy and human rights so in conclusion while paler technology offers sophisticated solutions for data analysis and operational efficiency in military contexts its application in the Gaza conflict has sparked intense debate over ethics legality and human rights further scrutiny and perhaps regulatory oversight might be necessary to balance the benefits of such technology with the imperative to protect civilian lives and rights paler Technologies has established itself as a key player in the intelligence and National Security sectors with close ties to the CIA DARPA and Israeli intelligence the company&#x27;s data analytics and intelligence gathering tools have proven invaluable to these agencies in their work to counter terrorism cyber attacks and threats to National Security palente Founders especially Peter teal have played a significant role in shaping the company&#x27;s strategic Direction particularly in building relationships with government and intelligence agencies with its deepening involvement in data science big data and counterterrorism paler represents a crucial component in the growing intersection of technology and intelligence in the modern world thank you very much for tuning in to True Crime Scene podcast and our presentation on paler Technologies please like share and subscribe to our channel for more mind expanding information see
