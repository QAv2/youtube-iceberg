            <p>well let&#x27;s go on with our colors Tom Bearden is on the line from Huntsville Alabama with us and we have coral wanna know about the scalar waves Carl Tom let&#x27;s go and can barely hear you but I go on I read considerable about Nikola Tesla in the past few years and one of the measurements that he made was in a storm the wave action electric wave action that went around the earth and he he measured the amount of time and everything and what I wanted to know was is this in the same basic DLF type of frequency ranges no Carl it&#x27;s not in the ll but the the point you bring up is very interesting storms do produce scalar waves and as a matter of fact one of the things that produces ball lightning the mysterious phenomena that used to be a fraud and now is accepted and known to be real ball lightning for example is often produced because a cloud in the region and the ground or two clouds form a scalar interferometer projecting scalar waves which because of their random this form is sort of a circle then you get a glowing ball of energy where the energy bottle is and that&#x27;s usually what produces the ball lightning from the clouds now what Tesla detected in the Colorado Springs and caused a great deal of excitement when he realized what it was he detected the way is from the storm even though it was very far away and he realized that what he was looking at was something extremely unusual with his very agile mind yeah I mean we went from that on into the things where he demonstrated from Colorado Springs the fact that he could transmit a wave around the earth and form a standing wave if he had succeeded in finishing the tower that he was building a Long Island Wardenclyffe he would have given the world free energy with such a standing wave huh however Wall Street did not like the idea that we just normal they figured energy was something to sell and something to tax and all that ended that all right I have two things I would like to find one one there and the last all</p>
