            <p>now we&#x27;re going to look at radial Vector representations this picks up where we left off with circular and spherical Vector representations we&#x27;re going to write Vector x equals R times R hat where R is the length of the vector X and R hat is the vector x divided by the length the vector R hat implicitly encodes any angular dependence along in a path on the unit sphere the vector X Prime by Chain rule as R Prime R hat plus r r hat Prime we&#x27;re going to calculate our hat Prime this is an illustration of our hat and R hat Prime where R hat Prime is scaled to Unity tracing out an arbitrary path on a unit sphere observe that R hat Prime is always tangential to the unisphere and perpendicular to R hat at all points we&#x27;ll need a little Lemma namely R Prime is X Prime dotted with r hat to derive this we start with r squared equals x dot X take derivatives of both sides you have 2R Prime equals 2x Prime dotted with x divide through by 2R on both sides we&#x27;re left with r Prime equals x Prime dotted with X over R which is R hat we&#x27;re going to derive the expression for R hat Prime that&#x27;s the derivative of the vector x divided by its length R we use chain rule to find X Prime divided by R minus r Prime over r squared the derivative of one over R times X Factor out R in the denominator to find one over R all times x Prime minus r Prime R hat now we factor out R hat we can do this by writing one equals R hat squared for the X Prime term come up with r hat divided by R all times R hat times the geometric product with X Prime minus r Prime we use our Lemma to write R Prime as R hat dotted with X Prime and we notice that we have the geometric product of R hat with X Prime minus the dot product of R hat with X Prime which is the wedge product of our hat with X Prime this gives us our final result our hat Prime is R hat divided by R all times bi Vector R hat wedge with X Prime here&#x27;s a sneakier way to come up with the same result I can write X Prime equals 1 times x Prime where one is our hat times R hat factor out R hat and write the geometric product or hat with X Prime as a DOT product plus the which product you can use our Lemma to identify R hat dotted with X Prime as the derivative of the scalar length R Prime to strip X Prime as R Prime Times R hat plus a rejection of our hat from X Prime we can also expand the derivative of x Prime as R Prime R hat plus r r hat Prime and notice that we must have R times R hat Prime equal to the rejection R hat times the bi Vector R hat wedged with X Prime that gives us the same result we can expand our hat Prime as a conventional triple Vector cross product we start by taking the vector or had times the wedge product and closing that in a grade one selection as this is a vector in the first place it doesn&#x27;t change the result we then expand the wedge product as a cross product as I times cross product commute the I and are left with the geometric product of R hat with a wedge product a vector expand that as dot product plus I times cross product our DOT product term is a scalar all multiplied by a pseudoscaler which is grade three so the great one selection of that term is zero we&#x27;re left with just the triple cross product incorporate the sine of I squared equals minus one into the order of that cross product as an application of these results let&#x27;s compute the kinetic energy of a particle with mass m found that our velocity is R Prime R hat plus r hat times R hat wedge with v since R hat and R hat Prime are perpendicular we can compute the velocity Square by squaring each of these terms independently we have energy equals MV squared over two which is M by 2 of R Prime squared plus M by 2 of our hat times R hat which V all square root let&#x27;s insert a factor of r squared changing one of our R hats into an r that leaves us with for that term one over two m r squared times R hat times R wedge with MV MV is our momentum and we&#x27;ll write a bi-vector angular momentum as L equals R wedged with MV or R wedged with P we can now write our energy in terms of L the angular momentum term is one over two m r squared times R hat times L times R hat times L but R hat and L and to commute we can change the order flipping the sign leaving us with r hat L squared r hat L squared is a scalar so we can write this as L squared times R hat squared and R hat squared is one we&#x27;re left with the energy one-half MV squared equals m over two of R Prime squared minus one over two m r squared L squared the minus sign is because we&#x27;ve used a bi-vector angular momentum representation which scores the negative values to summarize given x equals R times R hat we found that X Prime is R Prime R hat plus r r hat Prime we found a geometric algebra expression for R hat Prime our hat Prime because R hat divided by R times r h wedged with X Prime that&#x27;s just one of our times the rejection of R hat from X Prime all the non-radial components of X Prime we also found the conventional triple cross product representation of R hat Prime finally we found an expression for the kinetic energy of a point particle with mass m that kinetic energy is one over two M times Mr Prime squared minus 1 over 2 m r squared times the angular momentum squared Mr Prime is the radial component of the particles momentum and L is the angular momentum R which p this video was created with Mana for more content be sure to like subscribe and click the Bell check out my blog Peter
