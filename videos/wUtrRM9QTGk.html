            <p>new york times breaks the story out december of 2017 it explodes it&#x27;s a tremendously important story it changes the ufo landscape forever but it gets some things not quite right you&#x27;ve been on the sidelines watching all the reactions to this for the last three years they report a program called atip headed for a long time by lou elizondo who got 22 million dollars to study ufos and the reality is the 22 million was what went to you and asap to study much broader subjects than ufos and you did interact with lou elizondo back and forth and and the atep folks but you had you were the big program that was what was left over right is that right yeah i we uh yeah we we were we were the primary program and um our program manager is of a completely different name who ran our program the great guy this is the one i said earlier i&#x27;m you know it&#x27;s wonderful that that people like him work for our government because he&#x27;s he&#x27;s a terrific guy and i met lou a couple of times didn&#x27;t really he he didn&#x27;t play a role in in in our program in in any way in terms of who we ever reported to or or whoever we discussed kind of things with and and uh and our other our program manager was very fundamental and key um the the the uh the contest and the entire program was was created through our program manager and through senator reid and anyway and and stevens to put this out for a competition and um and that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s all i know is and then we won the competition and we were we were deserving of that because we were so prepared to to participate and do this and and we were best suited to win we had we had everything in line to do that since that story came out as i said i mean the ufo world is turned upside down you have a much broader audience that seems to be focused on it these senators and congressmen who would never talk about this in a million years are now willing to come out and say this is worth studying it is a sea change but it&#x27;s largely because of the work you guys did well um one of the uh so so um with the tic tac off the coast of san diego um the event in 2004 we just serendipitously happened to hire on our team in 2008 uh one of the pilots uh of the group that that saw the tic tac underwater the churning of all the water and underwater and then as it is it came out of the water and um and so we got a firsthand um briefing on something that we probably shouldn&#x27;t have had um because it should have been totally classified but it wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t even acknowledged you know in fact uh it was ignored right it was ignored it was it was completely ignored and and the fleur videos were put in drawers in places that subsequently a friend of yours and mine who now who up until just very recently ran the whole program for the united states right of things off the east coast and west coast and so forth and he just ran it ran it and and uh and so he was he is the best qualified person to run this program the united states has and he now no longer runs it and they&#x27;ve got somebody that&#x27;s a couple of ranks lower than him to to run the program and my personal opinion is there&#x27;s an effort that&#x27;s going to try to to eliminate this or put put this back in a back drawer compartment now because they&#x27;ve changed the rank as to who&#x27;s in charge change the rank take took the guy who&#x27;s most knowledgeable out of it giving them an impossible task to write the master report in six months with no budget right and the guy who&#x27;s in charge of it by the way is doing it on his own time i think yeah that&#x27;s right we had a lot of ducks in a row and we we had bought facilities uh spent many millions of dollars in buying buildings and and i did have a large program uh to do a major uh construction on this property besides what we already have here and that was going to be really fun and cool in fact what i was going to use so we would have nothing that would protrude the surface much you know i was going to use life support systems that you use in space because you don&#x27;t have a door you can go out of or a window you can put up right so you survive based on the ecosystem the environmental control i support systems that you create on board your stations right and so i was going to actually implement those into the underground facility which was going to be substantial and so that was a lot of fun to to do that i know that you you did knock on many doors during the offs after in the bass program and that doors got slammed as you&#x27;re asking for sensitive stuff access to sensitive stuff yeah is the secrecy directly related to what you&#x27;re just talking about the military uh the military imperative we&#x27;re going to hold on to this stuff and figure out how to make weapons out of it and we got to get there before the russians and chinese do because they are working on it right yeah um yeah there&#x27;s there&#x27;s definitely a crash has been reported in in in russia and uh i&#x27;ve heard of them in china um south america brazil um they&#x27;re they&#x27;re scattered all around almost as though they&#x27;ve been deliberately done you know now let&#x27;s just salt uh you know scatter the seeds around and see what happens um so you know you you would hope that people that have custody um have a a sense of responsibility uh to and and and accuracy in estimating what&#x27;s going to happen with something that you put in the hands of people that are not equipped it&#x27;s pretty premature for them to be able to to handle something that you just put into their hands and they would they would weaponize it so so i&#x27;m hope i i just would hope that um uh that that doesn&#x27;t happen you know how you know what are the scenarios in which that could happen maybe and and and uh but but you&#x27;re just hoping that those scenarios never never occur which would be obviously if another country develops very unique capabilities and it appears as though those capabilities are beyond what logically could have been generated from where we are science wise now that might change the philosophy of people here that have access to something and so what that might do is instead of having just a very few scientists work on super unique kinds of things you would have a manhattan project that&#x27;s what it needs right if you have a manhattan project in today&#x27;s communication world how do you keep the cat in the bag how do you how do you keep control and maintain control without having all of a sudden you&#x27;ve generated a a mad mutual sure destruction kind of philosophy you know which worked in the 50s and 60s and 70s for nukes but this is this is a this is something different did you learn anything through bass through osap program about consciousness i mean you cast a wide net you were looking at big picture stuff how different phenomena might interact uh not only just technology but big picture ethereal stuff did you learn anything about consciousness during that that has affected the direction that you&#x27;re about to to take the leap that you&#x27;re about to take yeah they were they were the things that were being um being uh set up as games was uh were were thought connected there was a spontaneity when you felt you didn&#x27;t see well you didn&#x27;t sense anything with the five normal senses you felt something is in the room with you so you start taking pictures you ask not allowed you&#x27;re thinking and asking for things to manifest on on digital cameras uh or you&#x27;re you&#x27;re thinking and asking for something to change the physical arrangement of objects on table you know tables and different different things so and if you if you&#x27;re bringing something home with you and an apparition is manifested that you can start to see the quizzical look on the face of that apparition i would say there was some kind of causal connection between the skinwalker ranch and something else that we with whom we did not know uh you know we do not know um with whom we were communicating and so and it could have been e.t we don&#x27;t know for sure um the bar of light as an example is is very abnormal in the survival of consciousness demonstrations something like i have not come across that in just in that kind of way it just it not wouldn&#x27;t fit i just haven&#x27;t come across it i don&#x27;t know anybody else that has in that kind of context so it goes definitive bar of light definitive bar of light and then it disappears so it has the capability of appearing and disappearing producing light but the light doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s internal to the bar it doesn&#x27;t glow and you&#x27;ve heard that many times with other kinds of objects that manifest outside outdoors it&#x27;s a craft of some kind it&#x27;s a ball but it doesn&#x27;t project photons it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t spread its light on the ground it&#x27;s a ball that contains has the light but it doesn&#x27;t produce any any uh you know any beam effect and that&#x27;s aside from the ones that do right okay but um you&#x27;re talking about the ranch as having discarnate entities maybe um oh they certainly were discarded in in many ways looking back at that then is that related to what you&#x27;re about to embark on it&#x27;s just the same entity and i ask it in the context of what you touched on before as soon as you started just planning and talking about this new venture things started happening to your employees and people around you and to me and to you especially in the last month strange things in your home i mean pretty dramatic yeah yeah and and i um and because of of the way they&#x27;re happening um i&#x27;d say in the passing of my wife as you know my wife i lost my wife we were married 55 years and she passed on the 19th of february of 2020 and i thought that and actually i i was surprised that she was the roughest of those of the deaths compared to my my uh my father my son and my grandson she was maybe uh the most difficult to deal with and yet i am the most prepared to deal with it in spite of that because i thought well i knew that the passing was happening it was happening over a substantial period of time and uh over months and and even years in terms of acquiring the the disease and all and and all that but so it was coming but and i thought gee okay i this is going to be a blow and an impact but i am better prepared now than ever to handle it and i was wrong yeah i was surprised so because of the events though that have manifested i can i can i can associate these logically should be connected to her because of the only there it&#x27;s the only connection i can logically establish because of the circumstances surrounding around the events and but you know and that&#x27;s just happened basically in the last i guess oh it&#x27;s been a month and a half since the first one at least i think a month and a half things happen in your home that have a personal connection to her that you perceive as yeah and my and my dog she gave me orders before she passed that when if my dog if our dog pre-deceases me my responsibility is is to have her his ashes in a container next to her someplace she dearly loved this pooch and so i said sure of course and so um the uh the event uh there&#x27;s one event that had no connection to him but um uh another event that there really two other events that really did and so i&#x27;ve had three events they were very demonstrative and in one of the events there were three other people besides myself that were aware of this and then just the pooch and me on the other two</p>
