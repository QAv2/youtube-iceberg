            <p>[Music] in the laws of nature there is nothing impossible except that the state of your mind makes itself marvelously intelligent enough to recognize that every so often i come up with some interesting intelligent statements maybe if they once a darth they would see all of it is interesting information cleaning up this planet is going to be a big job if we&#x27;re going to get the climate back to what we want a lot of work could be done but one thing is certain you need energy that&#x27;s important without john i wouldn&#x27;t be i wouldn&#x27;t be the man i am today john changed my entire life turned it around completely the man is the most honest sincere friend that you could ever hope to have he has tremendous stamina and has a almost an unheard of ability to go without sleep he could operates on between i think three and four hours uh max for 40 years i have been searching to find the clue to the cell effect but what it did for my mind it stimulated it motivated and turned my whole life upside down i&#x27;ve met professor searle and his associates they&#x27;re nice people clearly they believe in the seg and the the effects that they&#x27;re talking about basically the design is a conventional generator so according to sir tapped into zero point energy without knowing how he did it here we had something we couldn&#x27;t understand it wasn&#x27;t doing what i wanted that&#x27;s what a generator wanted the only person that i know of who has ever succeeded in making a serial effect generator which it was named by someone else uh given that name by someone else but the only person i ever know who ever made one is john cyril the problem is the people they want to to see the display i think 69 to 71 the german tv sent a report in color and there was shown a flyable disk it was hovering in the top of the trees i think 25 meters the electron flow is accelerated to an extremely high rate and it creates a vacuum around the device and in that vacuum you develop numbing cold and numbing cold as we know today is a function of superconductivity it also which is has not been known a function of gravitational force this thing wanted to fly [Music] [Music] for over 60 years john searle has tried to give to the world a new kind of energy system one that would free mankind from the burdens of oil and fossil fuels from his dreams as a child in pre-world war ii england came an understanding of mathematics and magnetic forces that would change his life from a childhood game of hopscotch came a new understanding of magic squares a mathematical principle that is five thousand years old john searle is deaf his deafness is the result of beatings and neglect suffered as a child but the isolation would serve his purpose perhaps this physical limitation accounts for his freedom of thinking he could think laterally and not be bound by conventional rules taught through conventional methods that may have an adverse effect on the human mind in his quiet universe his experience would have a different effect an unusual effect a natural effect the sorrow effect on his own and without any real formal education john searle is possessed by an insatiable curiosity that would lead him to conclude that nothing is impossible except that which the state of your mind makes it so [Music] jon searle is known all over the world as the inventor of the serial effect generator a magnetic device consisting of one or more rings also called plates and a number of cylindrical rollers that when in motion generate electricity the generator is a magnetic device that is uh totally magnetic it is its own prime mover it will self-start and continue to run and as far as we know we can say never stop the surl effect is an effect based on magnetic fields that generate the continual motion of magnetized rollers around magnetized rings producing electric energy the generator runs in harmony with nature the law of the squares is harmony with nature but the searle effect is a great deal more than a simple generator in our polluted and energy-starved world it is the hope of all mankind that we find the solutions that lead us to both prosperity and harmony with nature is it possible to maintain mankind&#x27;s industrial output and at the same time reduce the pollutants that are slowly killing planet earth is there a way to increase the productivity of the human species as we rid ourselves of the poisons and recover the waters of this world if we&#x27;re going to get the climate back to what we want a lot of work to be done one thing is certain you need energy that&#x27;s important and it must be cheap as possible preferable no pollution no noise no heat no vibration no pollution the serial effect generator the perfect machine as you build this it when you find out that it runs without friction it runs without a governor it runs will accept any load and meet it it will dive down in temperature at one point if you build it correctly and actually levitate and actually lift off the earth developing its own gravitational field when you see all these things you realize that this is a perfect machine it is an entity it&#x27;s the closest thing to a living thing that you can man can make does jon searle have the answer is john searle&#x27;s invention the point of impact between the question what if there is a machine that could save mankind and the answer the serial effect generator people say well you can&#x27;t do this you&#x27;re going to upset the entire world economy uh what you know the whole economy is based on oil we have and it works they&#x27;re saying well it works very well for the people who are running the economy but not necessarily for everyone else i still maintain that it will not ruin the economy it will be a very a strong paradigm shift much the same as the shift from horse and buggy to automobile surely this point of impact would produce energy of its own human energy emotional energy joy relief hope wonder or perhaps the darker side of human emotions greed hate and jealousy all these years i&#x27;ve learned one thing you can&#x27;t trust anyone with this technology they want to steal it and any worker seeing this and find out how it works could sell it to another company for millions because this too is the searle effect [Music] john roy robert searle was born at the downs a workhouse a place of disgrace in wantage england on may 2nd 1932 ironically that same year werner heisenberg of germany was awarded the nobel prize in physics for the creation of quantum mechanics put simply quantum mechanics is the study of the relationship between energy and matter in particular the relationship between electrons and photons the area in which the actual surl effect takes place it&#x27;s photons that&#x27;s the role of grounding their energy to the coil it is simply throwing photons out that is what you see trapped in a magnetic field around it john&#x27;s father robert henry searle and mother violet gertrude maude pierce would have two more children john&#x27;s sister iris would arrive in 1934 and his brother peter came some time after robert claimed that peter was not his child and one evening he just never came home violet was abandoned and soon after would be sentenced to jail for neglecting the children a warrant was issued for robert but he was never found as a child it appears from all uh official records i was ill-treated and bashed about and in the end the courts placed me in the care of dr menardo holmes in england who then put me out to foster parents john would lose contact with his brother and sister he would be placed in foster homes the first one at the chestnuts suffolk county england here he would be the responsibility of two women there wasn&#x27;t any man at the chestnut the school did not have no no teachers so there&#x27;s no amount to force me into believing anything or do anything later in life john would insist that being raised by women would be one of the most beneficial aspects of an otherwise difficult and at times brutal childhood now i never knew the abc i couldn&#x27;t do psalms i couldn&#x27;t do anything basically nobody cared about me what they didn&#x27;t know was i have no hearing so they were wasting their time talking to me did they beat me like if that would help that made no difference the 1930s were a time of great depression and great breakthroughs albert einstein&#x27;s contribution e equals mc squared made way for huge strides in science very soon abstract mathematical proofs would replace ether theory as the best explanation of all things and their relativity others like nikolai tesla would cling to the idea that energy was all around us and that we could access this energy and transport it through the atmosphere without the need for meters or utility companies relativity would win the day and ether theory would become a relic of the past it would soon be known as archaic physics [Music] while the greatest minds of the 20th century uncovered theories about how the universe works far beneath this lofty exchange four-year-old john searle was dreaming his dreams were specific and repeated two dreams that would alternate four times a year over the next six years i had dreams and those dreams are the key to all the work which i do in fact they&#x27;re the key to all my knowledge the dreams were actually recurring nightmares that frightened john as a boy he would remember them but not understand their meaning until the right time you wake up screaming my mother said that&#x27;s the devil that&#x27;s my foster mother so she&#x27;d give me a good belt in the belt the devil over me he finished his schooling at thornton infant in 1942 he then entered i secondary school in suffolk county england john would leave suffolk county in 1944 he was transferred to russell coates naval school in dorset there he trained to take his part in the war effort by 1946 the war was over john left naval school he got his first job at british rewind&#x27;s electrical repairs and boarded at number 30 crawley road in london that was the first job i was given by the documentary homes that placed me there for as apprentice for electrical uh engineering this would be the turning point in the life of john searle the searle effect is developed from the law of the squares and it is from these squares that john searle developed his generator and flying discs but it didn&#x27;t stop there over the course of his lifetime john searle&#x27;s understanding of the squares would be used by him to explain all aspects of life in the universe from dna to relativity from single-celled life to the human being from transportation to construction of buildings the squares could be used to understand everything when i took up my training as an apprentice electrical engineer but the third day i presented a docket to take to the stores and i saw this two with a small tube buff i asked the foreman what that meant he said that&#x27;s two square so i said what is two squares so he draws two by two tell me four squares four and i said to him it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me what on earth do we have empty squares for if it&#x27;s a square there must be some value there you can take a square if you run the numbers in normal one two three four five six that&#x27;s uniform in but when you toke them up each row each column each diagonal you&#x27;ll find that add up different putting numbers in random we come up with a uniform output every line every column the two diagonals come out precisely the same random numbers in squares will produce a uniform total john searle would soon call this the law of the squares nature&#x27;s way of achieving order from chaos this led to cyril&#x27;s revelation and gave meaning to his recurring nightmare at the age of 14 i looked at my dream it&#x27;s a game you&#x27;ll probably know we call it hopscotch the first dream as i call it is going to school on my way to school a one and a half mile walk i would pick up all the children and just before we get to the school gate we have what we call a hopscotch patch on the road itself and it consists of three squares four five then the odd one&#x27;s six then seven and eight now it&#x27;s always that type of pattern and there&#x27;s a reason for it i obviously been playing with all the children it&#x27;s now my turn i&#x27;ve reached the point where i throw the pebble in square three i have hop to scope square two my left leg is firmly on the ground the right leg is now up in the air about to move across square three where the pebble is into square four suddenly all the children vanish in the picture now comes an entirely different ingredient of a steamroller the village steamroller the only mobile object i&#x27;ve seen outside a horse and cart this time is coming at me from the top of the squares towards me and it&#x27;s many times bigger we have the roller done in two massive sections and it&#x27;s coming to me and it&#x27;s saying stop think act if not you had it it&#x27;s telling me by my leg movement that it&#x27;s not square three i need go to square four a square four that you&#x27;ve got to calculate out the ingredients here is the story of how to do it mathematically and of course the dream was telling me everything i wanted to know but i had to find those answers i had to relate what the dream was saying to what i was trying to do so it was a slow tedious job and because i got the sums wrong a number of occasions on on the start from those numbers john searle had the exact amount of each ingredient in the rollers and rings of his generator now every one square represent a quantity of a material and that&#x27;s very important this is precisely how i developed the scg so i copy nature in every way i work at trying to think how nature is doing it and then produce this object the first recurring nightmare had become a dream with meaning cyril&#x27;s revelation continued with his second recurring nightmare this time it relates to what i&#x27;m doing on the way back from school here my job in the evening after my change my clothes and had a meal i have to put the ladder up to the loft the shed open the door get the straw go and bed the hands down for the night now when i get up this ladder which is many times longer than normal the door opens and now instead of bells of straw straw stems are laid out as straps of a structure i am now standing towards the middle part of all this structure then suddenly the room is blazing away afar so massive that no one could put it out and it&#x27;s all around me but something says have no fear you&#x27;ll be lifted out from the center of that flame john would interpret the second dream to mean that the device would be circular and have many struts moving out from the center to the rim climbing the long ladder meant understanding the infinite combinations of numbers in squares then he would break through the trap door and be at the center of the ring made of straw the fire meant that there would be great energy at the rim of the device world war ii had ended brought about by the most devastating weapons ever conceived the product of those lofty minds who 20 years earlier wondered what would happen if you hit a single atom hard enough what kind of energy was stored in this tiny place the answer they thought is the source of all energy in the universe the practical answer was bang in fact the biggest bang mankind could ever devise einstein opened the door a bit further like most people they come up with a wonderful formula einstein and then he stops at that and says there&#x27;s no way you can get this massive energy out of an atom the cost would be too high it&#x27;s not worth it then you say you&#x27;ve got another person comes along and thinks about this oh no just bump it with a proton or neutron his job at british rewinds introduced john searle to some of the vocabulary he would use the rest of his life words like volts ohms amps and watts the first job that really got the dream moving and it was a simple task in grayson road at the british rewind limited where i was apprentice and my job was to learn to strip motors uh strip the coils measure them and count the turns and then re-make a new coil and put back and the rotors as well so i came into connection with motors for the first time electric motors by 1946 john searle had a different idea how could this energy be tapped without smashing the atom into bits his idea was a completely new generator design we didn&#x27;t call themself effect generators then but that we were just trying to produce a generator to run the house lights on something simple because i felt that the big generators at the power stations were a waste of money uh would pursu present to us vast pollution problems in the future so the whole idea was to get something simple not difficult to produce and produce electricity basically the design is a conventional generator as far as how it looks you&#x27;ve got a magnet passing by a coil and all generators are of electricity are based on magnetics and coils you can pass a coil by a magnet or magnet by a coil but that gives you your deflection in the electron flow and the force in one direction i already knew uh most of the fundamentals what i was doing here was trying to get rid of the petrol engine or other devices to turn the generator that was the objective this led to his first experiment conducted at home on a kitchen table with his landlady present so what do you remember i remember every we must have had the house here because they&#x27;re looking at the distance at the end of the road and then it&#x27;s the side all right and i think it must be in this area and it&#x27;s gone the first model that was built by john cereal at the age of 14 and a half after receiving some inspirational dreams was assembled on a kitchen table with his landlady&#x27;s permission and he put it together and then started to load it it&#x27;s a generator so let&#x27;s put a light on it let&#x27;s put a cooker on it let&#x27;s put an iron on it let&#x27;s see what it&#x27;ll hold and how much it&#x27;ll do before it bags down heats up and burns up because that was a bad thing to do indoors i should always do experiments outside as i discovered well as you increase the load at one at a certain point the temperature at that time mysteriously dropped down to close to four kelvin which is almost absolute zero and when it did that it became super conductive developed its own gravitational field we found later and uh hit the ceiling and it was on the ceiling and i said to the young lady after that&#x27;s a stupid thing what&#x27;s it doing up there she said to me you told me nothing would happen and it was it had cracked the plants because they passed the ceilings it could crack the it hit really were forced it was holding them carrying all the wiring and the cookers and the irons behind it dangling down so i stupid enough cut a ladder gone and grabbed it and i couldn&#x27;t let go of it and as a result his hands froze through the framework so the landlady put a screwdriver in to stop it and luckily it didn&#x27;t shatter it and then his uh get his hands off of it and that was the first experience of it levitating twice he conducted the same experiment at number 30 crawley road london england and both times had the same startling result i thought well the lead is heavy let&#x27;s put some left on the bottom yeah that keep it down okay i felt i was wrong i know increasing weight i&#x27;ve increased the density now that was more energy and it went down quicker not only did it go quicker floors are chest stressed downwards never upwards the forces said that they split through the plaster timber out through the tiles the tiles were also stretching woods not outwards and it just went through like selling a pee and out and away we don&#x27;t know just all we know just went on and on but not right away when it was clear the building it hovers and that&#x27;s where trouble number two comes in you&#x27;ll see people had the sets of radio sets off they were all absolute turned off when that starts to glow the radio sets all come on so then you haven&#x27;t turned them on they come on full blast and the dim that makes and of course i wasn&#x27;t a very popular man eventually shot away and i was taken to the police station and given a free home accommodation his new idea about tapping the energy of the atom resulted in the destruction of his home at 30 crawley road it was an accident that happened not intended or planned unfortunately some people didn&#x27;t like it and they chucked me into a place where i&#x27;ll be secured and went blow holes through roofs and that again what was happening to cause this simple generator design to quickly overload and lift off the kitchen table apparently this was a new idea but even the inventor could not explain what happened it was a learning curve i was being forced to follow what he wanted to know was how electric motors were the two key issues are electrons and magnetic fields john searle understood the basic principles for generating electricity he knew electricity was made up of electrons traveling down the wires into our homes to generate you&#x27;ve got to have electrons for most and great motion that&#x27;s why you go to the rare earth the basic components at the primary component is a rare earth and it can be although it can be any of the rare earths the component that we use is neodymium that&#x27;s element number 60 on the periodic chart and that unit puts out an excess of electrons for some reason and it will also replenish them very easily where earth is the greatest weight of the whole subs uh whole materials that you&#x27;re using that has got to hold the mass of electrons john searle&#x27;s idea was to find a way to ease those spare electrons out of the structure and use them instead of smashing the atom into bits why not tap this vast electron reservoir by using magnetic fields same as any generator of that time so i say to myself if you can release all the energy with a simple particle surely we could ease it out gently by tunneling it coming in and giving it sunny to run up so if we put a straight line magnetic line through and the electron spins around all this energy spinning around and come out we get a constant flow tunneling into the atom using a specific magnetic field will cause the electrons to move in one direction and they can be collected and used with production of electricity you have two choices you either rotate the magnetic field or you rotate the conductors in our case we prefer to rotate the magnetic flux so as the roller rotates it&#x27;s auto rotating around the base plate to make his generator work john searle had to overcome many problems most of these occurred with the shape and design of his magnets and in the behavior of their magnetic fields how can you make a round magnet orbit another round magnet without stopping or flying off he studied the behavior of a bar magnet and a round magnet there&#x27;s something wrong with it it tormented me there was that must be able to go straight it&#x27;s the dream saying slice the roller into eight segments now it will keep straight well i did this i placed on and it kept straight and not only did it keep straight it freely moved up and down what happens if you make a ring he knew magnetic fields could be impressed or printed on certain materials using a magnetizer a device common to shops and factories that use magnets such as british rewinds the question about battle scientists is why when three was on they just run round and round the picture here was there was two states involved here and of course there is the two states referred to the two magnetic fields printed at right angles to each other both the roller and the plate had independent magnetic fields one vertical and the other radial from the center to the rim clearly the magnetic field was completely different to the magnetic fields we knew of for some reason why they were different at the time i had no idea the intersection of these two fields produces a wave that carries the roller around the ring although this wave was unknown at the time the phenomenon was present so we got two right angles that&#x27;s why the whole thing moves if you have got two fields it won&#x27;t move now the two key issues for the production of electricity were present in a totally new generator design the electrons were available in the rare earth material the magnetic fields induced the roller to run on the plate we didn&#x27;t even know what the field looked like till a few years ago in germany when we remade a segment i said well let&#x27;s have a look at this field and we dusted it with very fine iron dust shook off the surface do you know what that looked like a bicycle went exactly as it was laid out in the shed in the dream that is the fill that makes this work any other fill won&#x27;t work that fill does it so we know that the magnetic field can be set to perform functions quite different to what we were taught in my day at school and i think we we&#x27;re only scratching the surface of magnetism was this thing a generator it created an extremely high voltage but john searle had no control over it whatsoever with each experiment came a new set of questions i was certainly looking for a generator but it obviously was a generator that wanted to fly so i had to put a body to it it was no sense to just throw it away forget it was to put the body to it we&#x27;re hoping that that would solve some of the problems the unit that went through the roof at 30 crawley road was crude by comparison to later models 1946 just before christmas that last one was done so i had a good christmas what came next for john searle would be a lifetime spent on the study of this phenomenon soon to be known as the sural effect when i started this technology there was absolutely nothing to turn to in book form or scientific formless by which it could be designed in fact i had to rely on dreams dreams as a child these dreams which were nightmares now we&#x27;re going to be changed into a world reality john searle was learning to match pieces of knowledge with his dreams as he began his lifelong effort to explain the startling result each time he powered up his generator lack of education as a child was actually useful to me because i now had to look at things and question what i saw in 1950 he enlisted in the royal air force and was stationed at an airfield in suffolk by 1952 john searle was back in civilian clothes he boarded at the home of george haynes a terminal cancer patient in the west midlands it was my highly religious person it was down to cancer and it wouldn&#x27;t it did it said it wouldn&#x27;t die in horse but he&#x27;d want to go home every night i went up to his bed eight o&#x27;clock to listen to him telling me about the bible and that and then he&#x27;d ask me what my interest was and i told him about this he said john if you can make people look up in the sky he said because they&#x27;re always walking with their heads down i will pay the cost of doing it so he caught his son up and said when&#x27;s i&#x27;m going to take john down to winsbury to the government sales market sales of government equipment get everything he wants here came the first real opportunity to build his generator as a flying disc and observe the phenomenon so we got the shared cables and all the sort of bits and pieces of one needs to do some experimenting and eventually we made the first three foot we part it up and of course it went it sort of hovered there of some yards above the treetops radio sets all switches on in the area and then it shot off and the radio sets went dead again so i went up to the room i said to him i said uh sorry we&#x27;ve lost it did the people look up i should think so make another one from his deathbed george haynes senior financed the earliest experiments on the flying disc generator searle tried to keep the three-foot disc from shooting off into space i said to him i cannot control it oh don&#x27;t worry make the people look up we did all right there was no history but about that point though i tried different ideas each time to try to overcome this lifting effect i never won six flying discs were built and all six were lost we had to do six before the man died each one we were trying different ideas and we couldn&#x27;t solve the problem we lost them the last one we had a 60 ton shear pin connected but even that sheared and was lost from then on we had a break the old man died now the chap told me to get out the house i wasn&#x27;t wanted there so i moved on to other accommodations so for a few years a couple years nothing happened then where i was staying a man wrote the electric board and said that this man is very clever in magnetics and electrics i would like you to interview him for a possible job john searle at age 21 is made forman part of a three-man team in charge of 11 areas in research and development at midlands electricity board those three of us in the team we were in charge of living areas all technical problems which they couldn&#x27;t solve at the workshops came to us to carry out the research on research and development at midlands electricity board this was a perfect fit just like it was at british rewinds electrical engineers and experts in magnetism and electricity again surround him he could tap their knowledge and begin to understand this phenomenon of the flying disc generator john cearl made a critical decision to investigate what it was and not what he wanted it to be before we reach that point where we can say right we can now design your generator how much output you want and we&#x27;ll get down to sign it for you we had to check and find a lot more little steps a lot of little problems we had to try to identify this thing wanted to fly so to me then the easiest thing was to work on a body let it fly well i&#x27;ve been playing with this with equipment i&#x27;ve uncovered a lot of things which i suspected but couldn&#x27;t prove whenever possible john searle engaged in dialogue with anyone willing to share their knowledge on things mechanical and especially things magnetic or electric in march 1953 cyril married doris shirley foster they would have six children family life would be difficult he was consumed by the phenomenon of the flying disc generator now i was shot at the headquarters of the midst electricity board i had 11 different subunits around to look after because i started talking in my spare time about this effort and because everyone was laughing at me one day the boss heard all the news they come in to me and they said john you&#x27;re here as a member in charge of 11 areas men under you are laughing at you now we have three options a pack your bags and go be shut up see do it so i thought about it a minute and i said well i like my job so i don&#x27;t want to go b i can&#x27;t shut up see i&#x27;ll do it so i said well what do you want i said we want to press argan oven magnetic all right we&#x27;ve got all that here what else do you want i said ingredients well you tell us ingredients we&#x27;ll get them with this opportunity john searle&#x27;s knowledge of electricity and magnetism grew to a point where he began to theorize the startling behavior of his generator one such theory in magnetism met with stiff resistance and would help to form the genesis of mockery and ridicule that follows him to this day my magnetism is not your magnetism could it be that general magnetism contains multiple bands a magnetic spectrum exactly the same as white light contains a spectrum of colors magnetism is identical to light in a way that&#x27;s how i look at it they are identical that pairs john searle used a combination of ac and dc current when magnetizing the components of his generator if we isolate the particular fan we want and then print that we have something different we have a wave this is the surl effect the intersection of two magnetic fields creating a magnetic wave that can be measured and amplified john searle designed a generator using magnetic fields to induce a flow of electrons from a rare earth element through a system of rotating magnetized components so that those electrons would be collected compressed used and recycled magnetic forces and electrons in motion the two key issues necessary for the production of electricity here i am they won&#x27;t come and see that what i say is true there is a condition where you can&#x27;t get away in a magnetic sense like a wave a sine wave and they act as a river now that stage 3 until reaction effects takes place and to do that you have to set a cylinder on it magnetized and then that wave goes into motion another roller place on that field is floats we know it cannot touch that it&#x27;s too dense with energy so it will float so we got something floating there then if this wave is moved due to reaction between this plate this roller and this plate then that wave is going to carry that regardless so the rolling maintains still its constant height though it&#x27;s now running many times faster it does not fly off the magnetic field is holding the roller tightly to the plate at the same time the electrons moving through the layered elements are collected and compressed on the surface of the plate lifting the roller and creating space between the roller and the plate so the roller flies around and doesn&#x27;t roll around as it moves the floors be rewritten all the time so the fill never diminishes it cannot diminish because a magnetic field is in constant running order the energy or electrons moving through the system recycle the rare earth element attracts new electrons that also move through the system and recycle because of their negative charge the electrons compress causing the drop in temperature and creating the energy field that radiates from the generator in 1956 i was soldering i had produced another unit and this time we wasn&#x27;t partly up i wanted to try to meter up things to see what the oscilloscope was showing me and it was accidental that when i took the hot iron to solder the wire on i couldn&#x27;t solder it selling from a machine was cooling things faster than you could heat them that was accounting for some of the behavior of those early models counter for why when i got hold of it i was stuck to it john searle created a generator design that became a super conductor producing extreme cold and incredibly high voltage that caused it to lift off the ground but could he control this flying disc generator in the late summer of 1954 he left midlands electric board and moved to berkshire near pangborne woke up we see the actual the actual field this view is the field where it&#x27;s joined today and i could get on to it the beauty of it as you see is quite nice and open here i would do experiments experiments to discover how to control the flying disc generator you see we use gyro technology now gyro that&#x27;s only one problem about the gyro is that you can&#x27;t put it at the rim of the crop right on the rim because you&#x27;ve got to control it by striking it from outside of it you can&#x27;t do good straightening on the inside because it don&#x27;t do nothing it won&#x27;t respond but if you strike a gyro on the outside it tips at that point instead the inside of the flying disc generator was equipped with switches and circuits to activate 64 hammers positioned around the rim that&#x27;s in this field we solve that problem so which way would they fly down this way all over the trees and it depends whether it&#x27;s late evening or day at this day time we go to the trees when it starts getting dark like this you could run up and down this the chance of vehicles coming up there was very unlikely john searle&#x27;s time here was short by 1955 he moved his family to 17 stephen&#x27;s close mortimer berkshire but now he could control the flying disc generator and i haven&#x27;t been here for a very long time but that was where my early days experiment was done that&#x27;s before we use war mensteria for the big work [Music] we built 41 a total 41 crafts that actually flew and were fully controllable they were six before that that were lost they could not be controlled during the 1950s john cyril continued to experiment with his flying disc generator but it needed a name one thing i didn&#x27;t know was that a gravity can be inversed no scientists ever had come up with that idea that clearly the magnetic field was completely different to the magnetic fields we knew of the heavy rollers spinning as they rotate around the plates acted like a flywheel and caused a gyroscopic effect the extremely high voltage created a dense field surrounding the generator a device built with individually magnetized components it was a device and it contained all these signs within it you&#x27;ve got that gyro cyclotron effect frequency control magnetic electrons photons basically every size involves in one engine incorporating these principles displayed by the device he christened it gyro flywheel high energy density mechanical magnetic device but it would soon be known as the levity disc and the first successful one was launched in 1956. it went up we flew across the houses because crompton hill we up above the house it&#x27;s a wonderful sight used to go there and we flew this over the rooftops and then we had a surprise you see we saw the tiles waving as it went along and the dinette made it in the middle of the night was absolutely fantastic and the reason is of course there&#x27;s a suction underneath this it&#x27;s in a way this suction head and it pulls these tiles up and down some fall to the ground obviously but what we also found is that when pigeons or birds flew near to it or they were taken by surprise and they got caught they fell to the ground and caused it to hit the ground and break their necks so you saw in the papers birds died from ufo and made it quite clear to them it was not a ufo the government knows it&#x27;s identified they know what it is every government knows what it is they&#x27;ve known it for years i said so we&#x27;re dealing with something in reality by 1956 the first team of investors agreed to fund john searle and the research on his levity disc this group of 13 pensioners assembled as a club called launch unit navigable individually controllable or lunic enterprises and we toyed with this down in walminster where we built these uh what label was labeled ufos we call them lefty discs but we built this now 13 old age men back that project and they only backed me on the following condition that i did not go commercial with this they didn&#x27;t want any problems with tax man they were doing this for fun but to me that was all right it was giving me a chance to experiment with ideas to prove two things it could hold together and it could fly and this is what we proved that it could hold together and it could fly the device as an electric generator for domestic use became an afterthought john searle knew this was the beginning of his lifelong battle with official persons and with the scientific community very soon british civil aviation had questions about the levity disk what happens if the power fails how do you steer it and the big question how does it fly you&#x27;ve got to put a load resistance load on the generator to speed it up and once it starts you get to about on average about a million volts it begins to really build up a charge then this superconductivity switches in and the earth pushes it up but it&#x27;s also affecting the atmosphere above it it is making it pull to the rim and rotate with a feel so you&#x27;ve got like a hurricane effort it&#x27;s sucking it up over the years we experimented with many ideas the trouble was the authorities said that we could not fly this device in public on show unless we made some means to control it in the event of power failure we call this a flight cell and what we&#x27;ve done is that all around the vehicle we&#x27;ve chopped into 64 sections in which we can open a section the idea was it by opening one you could direct the angle across to the past that smallest flying machine we could fly which would be contortable by have operated 121 footer the need for a craft that large was because anything smaller than that couldn&#x27;t hold the vacuum tubes or or valves as john calls them or the transformers or the radio equipment there just wasn&#x27;t enough room also in order to direct this craft that needs certain electronic solenoid equipment and some hydraulics in those days we had to use very large bottles big heavy transformers big chokes they all take up a muscle relays there was a gpo type they were very large so we&#x27;re looking at a massive weight 64 flight cells at the rim of the levity disk could be opened or closed independently changing the energy flow which caused the disc to tilt and turn to accelerate or stop to gain or reduce altitude signals to the flight cells were sent using ham operated radio the command signal was always preceded by a coded radio signal to prevent outside interference ham operators and i must admit that without their help this could not be done you have to have some signal coming from it debate to trace it if you have a series of ham radio operators that are willing to help you and the professor did john would call them and tell them when the unit should be when the disk should be over their position and then give them have them it also emitted a beacon so they could triangulate on it and then make a course correction that he would tell them the code to use so they would give a frequency code to the ship it would make a course correction if needed to go wherever he wanted and he had a whole series whole network of hands all across the the world i used 1200 cycles for my transmission carrier that&#x27;s why the tortoises came after me when they saw the transmitter i was using on television there was military we got to confiscate that that&#x27;s illegal i have no rights to that so i said well if you take that away how do i protect the public from this massive weight up there this equipment gives me the carrier of 1200 cycles a second i need that to carry my information to that craft so i could continue transmitting and carrying out this flying research work [Music] although he tried it was hard to keep the levity disc secret john searle saw a future that would want to take advantage of his generator and levity disc it&#x27;s the flying side that brought the money in in 1968 we&#x27;ve reached the greatest height we&#x27;ve ever done the generator could be used as a power source but it was the flying side that caused excitement these craft had designations and sequence numbers such as the p11 probe means a probe it&#x27;s a man uh p m if if it&#x27;s a man vehicle like this these first ones we did were all a man in his growing library john searle kept extensive records of his generator and levity disc among these documents are calculations and descriptions of experimental flight tests some of which survive today these are photos and excerpts from the original record of the p11 launch on june 30th 1968. we have carried the p11 weighing 100 weight to a position clear of the overhead high voltage lines the sun is shining but it is not pleasant the wind is cold and a force of aid is blowing we shall attempt a full launch and run at 1 500 hours greenwich mean time we prepared the power supplies to all equipment on the craft we are very busy yet from the corner of my eye i can see watchers but none have dared to enter the field people rushed to hide from us as if we were some kind of aliens from another world time to start the crafts generator up this is connected to an outside source in our case a small diesel engine a minute passes by and the cutout switch of the craft breaks contact with the outside power source the call comes through from cornwall that all is ready the carrier beam is on for the run we accelerate the craft&#x27;s generator now she is on her own when the generator started there was a wine rising to a high pitch but that has stopped the craft is shorting up very fast yes the craft will clear the power lines with no trouble i have stopped taking photos to record what i saw the ground appeared to be rocking yet i could not sense any such rocking no noise was heard but leaves and other material on the ground around us began to move in circles i glance over the far side where two strangers were what happened to them they were running for cover in the direction from which they had come most likely scared stiff then the call came in she&#x27;s crossing cornwall now time 1503 hours greenwich mean time our team in cornwall turned the craft for its run back the p11 was over cornwall three minutes after launch a distance that would take four hours to travel by car she climbed at rates of up to one mile per second and during that day rose to heights of 15 miles above the surface of the earth we went over to the launch point and found that all the small undergrowth had been pulled up with the soil and had left a scooped out effect where the craft had stood another problem we must solve is this pulling up of earth on liftoff and this burnt ring mark effect we found that it does tend to mark the ground the reason for this is that there&#x27;s an iron content in the ground and it&#x27;s this iron that&#x27;s been pulled up and it pulls that surface of ground up with it it should have the rare earth on the outer layer put it on the inner reversal of course it solved it just in one action instead of having a magic field focusing to the ground it made a doughnut shape around the vehicle the field now is a very small c field around the rim of that craft results is no focus to the ground no ground distortion occurs the other problem often presented in my case when scientists speak about my work is that it ionize the air around the craft this is not true there is no air around that craft there&#x27;s a magnetic field there&#x27;s a gap a vacuum between that and the rim and it&#x27;s the photons which is discharged trapped by the magnetic field which gives it the glow the p11 was a great secret success story a beginning to a new age which promised that one day in the future man would travel by this method into space was it sacred it was supposed to be but only the media was allowed to come and watch first we had 400 scientists that were also allowed to come who down it what they said was this it could not support itself let alone fly so i say right we have now tested 40 different structure ideas i&#x27;m going back to the one i originally proposed you are invited and the media to come and watch by fighting you do not disclose where the work is done sunday tip bits came and watched the flight test then we had the news of the world come the fight because they seen it we want to see this desk at st john&#x27;s hall in mortimer berkshire england scientists the press and the public were invited as he demonstrated his technology and declared his intention to build a manned craft this was the hall which we used to hold our first sunday of each month shows this is the hall that was known as saint john&#x27;s hall that&#x27;s the stage which i used to stand on to deliver my lecture the audience will sit here as press used to be at the back when we had a load of press come to make mockery we had to cut sport i stood there we had the national anthem played there so they all had to stand all these people came to make mockery at the end of 10 hours the press came up to me and said we have never seen a man stand there talk for 10 hours without looking at any references whatsoever so i reply to them when you speak from the heart you don&#x27;t need papers john cyril may have spoken from his heart but by 1969 his message played to a world that had witnessed american astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin returning safely to earth having walked on the moon the single greatest achievement in history the media made the levity disc a sideshow and john searle the original urban spaceman a crackpot the flying saucer man few would take him seriously the merits of his generator design as a power source were lost in his single-minded effort to prove his levity disk the press and the publicity grew there must be thousands of newspaper articles television footage and there were thousands of people who came and they filmed and they filmed they took pictures that was the type of publicity we had and there are many books on the market written by many writers that include my work we had bbc regularly each month for nearly two years would come and update the people first they would take them back to what happened last month then they say we went down to the woods today and this is the progress the structure of the demo one is now together and the housing is going in that will house the power unit that will lift it into the skies at this point the demo one would prove that electromagnetic flying discs were not only real but represented the future in power and transportation in 1968 john searle formed the nsrc for this task the national space research consortium headquartered in his home at mortimer berkshire england scientists and the media were invited to watch the demo one being built outdoors on a piece of land loaned to him for this purpose this is the voice of john searle during the construction of demo one the position today is that we now know so much about defining these vehicles on the point of a unknown vehicle that we feel the time is right to go ahead and carry people john searle had plans for a larger craft that would carry three people he continues this three-seater craft which we&#x27;ve been asked to do it will be a 90-foot diameter vehicle it will weigh roughly 90 tons on completing and then the purpose is that one pilot will carry two official experts with him one day you&#x27;ll see a three-seater car with a lone star in the sky and within a year you&#x27;ll see massive giants coming up into the sky taking 2 000 people from new york to london in 20 minutes or 15 minutes from london to sydney in 30 minutes and we won&#x27;t think nothing about it and i think that this is business this is really what industry wants fast movement cheap price no noise and no pollution and the levity deaths will give you this while the press and publicity pushed john searle to the scientific fringe some individuals examined the merits of his generator design was this a revolutionary new way to generate electricity cyril came to an important realization that will stay with him for the rest of his life once i see that they want it i want to own it that&#x27;s everywhere i go the same thing happens it&#x27;s the same ignorance and greed coming together as a terrible dangerous situation jon searle came out into the open with his levity disk expecting a different reaction to the one he got the press and media were quick to mock and ridicule the flying saucer man reinventers i think will always hit problems there will always always be ridicule they&#x27;ll be laughed they&#x27;ve been marked at all the big you name them they all came under the same bombardment searle saw himself as an inventor like so many others before him he would endure the mockery because he knew his truth about the generator and levity disc his confidence never wavered well everybody who does something different is a crank and if this is the good side of an inventor then i&#x27;m i don&#x27;t mind being called one the interviewer that was interviewing me way back then 68 when he said are you a crank and i said well everybody that inventings are cracks by you people so i don&#x27;t mind being one that must mean i&#x27;m going to be important one day did he invent something so astounding it had to be marginalized his generator and levity disc could no longer be kept secret cyril tried to patent his new generator design the power source for his levity disk back then 68 the patent office run me to say that i haven&#x27;t studied your patent you submitted we advise you not to paint it it&#x27;s a know-how never never partner know how when you&#x27;re ready to go to the market you have two options you can either take out a watermark in your name or in the name of the company who&#x27;s going to produce it you&#x27;ve got two options never never tell anyone all the details the vital bit that makes it work keep it to yourself until you&#x27;re on the marketplace having been advised that his generator design is a know-how and he should keep it to himself until ready for the marketplace only serve to further isolate cyril during this period he held a full-time job and spent all of his spare time developing the generator and levity disc several events helped to explain his conviction the first happened near warminster england where john flew his p11 craft on sundays when i first came in to open i was caught red-handed flying a craft every sunday night we&#x27;ll pour the craft in take the place out put new and send it off again off we go to the next weekend now this one night now we&#x27;ve done this so often we never never dreamt of anyone coming by not at that time the night and there we are it sent the craft off and unknown to us we were actually seen by a television crew on the way back from something they did that night so monday they went to the warminster area to see the uh two raf people in charge of the ufo investigation that went and studied ufo claims and they&#x27;d said that&#x27;s all this craft listen no we got no new craft on test because they thought it was a new air force project being secretly tested no they said so they go down to the radar unit of theirs and ask them to check last night&#x27;s report nothing there we saw it let&#x27;s go down there next sunday and see if anything happens and of course the air commandor agreed to go with them we brought the craft down we changed everything that didn&#x27;t interfere they were watching but unknown to us and putting a new place in and sent it off i said to tony let&#x27;s pack up get out of here i i feel something strange let&#x27;s get out and then bang on my shoulder tony stop pulling it back we got it this is the air commodore great britain if they say his name oh and the itv camera crews turn on the cameras searle was at home in mortimer the following thursday with his friend reverend george nicholson and a visitor from aldermaston atomic works at 3 15 i read george nixon with me as witness news flash news flash is saying the air commander has a message to tell you then i do the voice said this is the air commodore of great britain and i knew instant what they were going to say and he said people in warminster may now be able to sleep in peace for weeks people in the warminster area had been reporting numerous ufo sightings the british air commodore broadcast a news flash assuring that it was john searle&#x27;s flying discs and not ufos there are no aliens it is the work of john cerl we caught up with him last sunday night on asking him when that was going to return he said next sunday we didn&#x27;t believe him we called him a liar but he insisted we could stay we wish but it wouldn&#x27;t come back till next sunday and we did i&#x27;d like to inform you we are now packing our bags and moving on because we agree john saw means what he says and then he said the words when this man comes out in the open and show the world he will overrule the americans and the russians he will be master of all air and space and the flash ended after the news flash the scientist from aldermasten atomic works insisted cyril turn over his levity disc the scientist just like that give it to me i said oh they poked me again and said give it to me i said oh she turns to reverend george nixon pokes him and said make him give it to me is that i can&#x27;t make him give it to you what you&#x27;re offering him nothing it&#x27;s about to keep a lot of people employed and he will get royalties from the work done so if reverend johnson nixon said to him it&#x27;s not royalties he want he wants cash now he said we&#x27;re actually not giving it to me i&#x27;ll stop everyone helping you then you&#x27;ll give it to me and it went off a month later czech started to come in from australia japan because the news had flashed all over the world about this air commodore catching me with this attention searle was further convinced that the outside world would eagerly accept his generator and levity disc the activity around the building of demo one drew the attention of dr arthur kane from nasa in the united states here&#x27;s the view doctor came from nasa there he wrote a serious report to nasa he came and interviewed the injectivity and he stated in his reply that unless nasa married this technology when i hit the marketplace they&#x27;d be completely finished they would have nothing to match it or to touch it by june of 1976 this letter arrived it reads in paraphrase dear mr cyril i have the responsibility for u.s air force propulsion and energy conversion research and development we would like to acquire a copy of your report entitled disk-shaped type of flying craft the letter is signed george eulig major united states air force engineering division edward air force base examined my work i was requested to submit my work to them to evaluate so that i could get funding he said he&#x27;d be in london and he&#x27;d like to collect all the materials to take back for the scientists to examine all i had to do was to be in london to deliver the goods to him that was only a small unit of four foot which we just took around to show what it&#x27;s it&#x27;s made up and how we make them up by how it functions in which you&#x27;re not letting it fly you&#x27;re just showing people how the theme works so the unit runs very slow as the major&#x27;s letter said back to me that they could find no inertia and that goes against all grains they were people who developed rockets for war and were still making ballistic missiles for the purpose of future wars so you got people geared to rocketry though they did look at this technology they decided that it would take a lot of study work to understand it and therefore forget it rocketry was vital i was in the wrong place at the wrong time regarding nasa and at the edward air force base people whether john searle was thought of as a serious inventor or just the flying saucer man he had gained worldwide notoriety the weekend work on his levity disc was updated regularly and featured by some media outlets in one case a demand was made for time that he didn&#x27;t have searle explains you were invited last sunday to come and see everybody was invited all of me was you didn&#x27;t want to know johnson was nothing this was all dreams now you&#x27;re suddenly seeing a paper who did take the trouble to come that is true all right so you&#x27;re not going to show me the igv no certainly all right we&#x27;ll put paid to that something come out front page don&#x27;t show con man do not invest in it thinking that that would force me to sell what i did i said that to the government i told them you know what i&#x27;m doing this is slanderous definition of character and they wrote back dear mr sir we can&#x27;t do nothing but what we will do is we&#x27;ll ask all our opportunities to play with all the information you need to help you the british government was aware of john searle if only as a result of his own letters complaining of the press coverage this was a one of a kind story the flight performance claims for his levity disc were astonishing it&#x27;s easy for us to put a crap up and set it to anywhere in the world a man or man and it will reach the point in the shortest possible time the program on the models used to do from england to australia in 30 minutes with no trouble at all and we anticipate the minecraft we&#x27;re building now will also easily cope with that speed from 1963 until about 1978 where we had to stop because the cost of operation we flew unsafely into the demo one that flew 500 times around this globe through the use of ham operators 500 times around the earth had the unmanned levity disc reached outer space in his plans for the manned craft searle openly spoke to the press about a trip to the moon the moon as i said we could say an hour trip you landed after you cleared the air belt so you&#x27;re 20 minutes climbing out and what did the newspaper say you also say two seconds to the moon johnson didn&#x27;t say that johnson said 20 minute gentle timeout two seconds switch off power on the top plate to let it pick up speed then put it back to hold it at that new setting 52 minutes we should be in orbit around the moon to look for an ideal spot probably ten minutes to find an ideal spot to put down on from the earth to the moon in one hour the flight tests of his levity disc established stunning claims that did not go unnoticed by the cold war superpowers they accused each other after detecting unknown spacecraft there was a time where we did put a test we did take a vehicle up there and russia and were accusing the americans of having a secret device out there the americans were accusing the russians of it it wasn&#x27;t either and that was the air commodore statement really here the americans are the russians are jumping away each other accusing each other these secret things going on and here&#x27;s the man in england twirling the knots that is causing wholesale chaos with the big boys searle caused even more trouble the high energy from his disc interfered with radio communication at nearby black bush airport ironically this was where he would earn his fixed wing pilot&#x27;s license to avoid any civil aviation objection to him piloting the first manned levity disk i think it was daily mirror report a derby area about ufo night watch where thousands were watching the sky for ufo just a sort of ride away johnson and a colleague are testing one of their ufos the press rang me and said that black bush airport said that they have phoned you up and asked you to remove your disc from the airflow area because you&#x27;re blacking out the radio is that right i said yes they have asked me to remove it this has now been done so we&#x27;ll be putting this in the paper this report so i went and got the papers okay ufo over black bush a ufo appeared over black bush blacked out the razor communications of incoming aircraft that&#x27;s all it said now from that moment on every article that came out said jufo never ever made my mention my name but i had invited them to come and see the show the press treatment of cyril began to take its toll with the high level of attention some of the demo one team members became suspicious was there something genuine beneath the ever-growing circus around john searle dispute and dissension came to the demo one team dispute occurred and the team would turn up because unknown to me at the time the one chapter in charge of the work with me uh had another team down in eastleigh he was making the same vehicle but he would join my team to find out how we did it they had a craft in exactly the same construction as mine so we dropped them basically i just dismissed the whole group and just finished it myself john searle would not patent his generator so whatever was secret would remain secret the money stopped coming in and he terminated the demo one project in 1978 soon he was faced with something new i had a good team agreed at mortimer very good team but then you see like all teams you&#x27;ll get one who suddenly realized the value of what they&#x27;re doing and then greed comes into play they think that by owning it they control the world they dictate who can do what and who can&#x27;t how much you gotta pay for that right um and that&#x27;s the the shame of it because here was certainly that should been on a market generator should have been on a market 68. at home in mortimer cyril was served with court papers stating that he owed the electric board over 10 000 pounds by 1982 he was arrested and accused of stealing electric power here&#x27;s how he answered the charges well what happened was electricity was expensive and i didn&#x27;t have the wage packet to meet the cost of that working on this trying to get this idea right and we did have two units one i took to shows and the one i fitted in the house and put all the wiring on it they weren&#x27;t in my house for 30 years they took apart they found nowhere or tear in fact they was almost sure they only just been made that was that good what happened to that one well they whether court asks if they could bring the generator in for the court to see it they said they had confiscated it so i should i feel inclined to think that they broke it open not knowing what was inside who confiscated the electric boards themselves um because they told the court that it did not compile comply with their standards the judge wasn&#x27;t quite satisfied that i was this dangerous man that they were trying to project so they asked the chief man what was strange about this man&#x27;s house so he said why there was two little switches block switches were called grid switches on the wall so he pointed over to it and they said see those two switches yes what&#x27;s strange about that well he&#x27;s got 16. we took the floorboards up they got power transformers on them what&#x27;s strange about that i&#x27;ve never seen anything like that before so he asked him what else was strange so i said well out in the shed it&#x27;s got all this equipment from the floor to the ceiling it looks like nasa he said what else was straight well they said we were trying to find where the electric came from we cut the wall where to cut the walls open we come on this box you say we took it out when we open it we got these plate things and we got rollers running around so the justice what&#x27;s strange about that is that well we can&#x27;t understand how they run can&#x27;t you do that no can anyone do that no is that man there clever than you yes is your bill back no way am i going to make that man pay you 10 975 pounds i knew what the judge was trying to point out to him that i can&#x27;t be insane if i&#x27;m clever than him the electricity to run his home sometimes came from his own generator that generator was never returned to him the semi-favorable court decision was costly the price he would pay was divorce and the breakup of his family the memory is difficult i&#x27;m a loyal person and i that that i wouldn&#x27;t walk out unless pushed out only the work kept me going john searle sacrificed his family in favor of his invention he left his home and disappeared into the midlands of england the only consolation came in the form of recognition for his commitment to his generator professor shinichi sikhi from japan suggested the name that would stay with the generator to this day you are the finder of the technology so it&#x27;s ought to have your name to confirm you are the inventor so they suggested it be called the cell effect generator so the fact generator is simple just call it sdg when i look at it now it&#x27;s a shame that the amount of stuff that was lost uh because there was about 101 volumes of records of everyday work photographs that were taken by people that sent me copy press articles these days have all vanished over time after the court case in 1982 john searle walked into obscurity in the midlands of england taking nothing with him but the secret know-how he had refused to patent his extensive research library records documents all equipment and his family were left behind very little has been recovered he had this he had that he showed no evidence he said things were destroyed by far we&#x27;ve heard that story many times before bad people a load of crap i don&#x27;t believe a word the man says man that is the standard thing four years later in 1986 searle was found and asked to return to his lifelong work he had lost nearly everything but here was the chance to tell his story and prove his generator with a more scientific approach he was a man that hunted for two years to find me and when he did find me by that that he contacted somebody america oh yes we just spoke to him is in the midlands um so they gave him my address and it came up and he said if i come back i&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll put two thousand in two thousand pounds then to get you started for the next 15 years john searle lectured all over the world england australia scotland canada and the united states to name only a few crowds were sometimes shocked to discover he was still alive but eager to hear him tell the story of his generator and flying disc in germany 1989 he was awarded the honorary title professor of mathematical structures of creation and energy i was well known i was known by people like sir freddie laker and other people like that i met princesses we talked they enjoyed every minute with me john searle had become professor cyril and an aura of mystery had formed around the flying saucer man but where are the witnesses there are plenty of witnesses around but there seems to be a problem they do not like to come out in the open they have read too many books about men in black breaking in destroying their homes burning that property and fbi and things like this breaking in stealing they&#x27;re stealing that and they&#x27;re frightened that dead frightened is the surl effect generator so profound a device that it would change everything we know perhaps cyril&#x27;s refusal to patent his secret was working against him this is richard vere compton i worked with john i was responsible for converting ordinary 250 volt electric drills um so that they would run on 12 volts so we could so we could cut up the timber rather than using hand saws and we could speed the process of building the disc the 30-foot disc ken pirelli turned up on my doorstep and told me about searle i went to see him and saw what he was doing was rather amazed that he was building a disc in somebody&#x27;s garden um so i thought well this could be fun let&#x27;s see what happens and of course very soon one began to feel that nothing was really going to happen if nothing would happen what was it that captured veer compton&#x27;s interest well basically the cell effect was meant to turn the ether which is all around us which contains energy and tap into this energy which has euthemistically now been known as zero point energy and various other people who followed cells footsteps have also potted around and they&#x27;ve tapped into it by mistake at his home in mortimer searle had been arrested for stealing electric power veer compton had visited searle years before the arrest and remembers the switching over to the serial effect generator he said what he was going to do was to switch the spell effect generator on by cutting off the electric power and it would then be running on the cell effect generator well as i said before and i keep using this book the jewelry is still out as to what john actually did were the puffs of smoke and mirrors did he switch a straightforward inverter to inverter on was there any dip in the voltage as far as we were concerned one minute uh the lights were on and the next minute the lights were still on and there was no dipping there was no fading there was no bleep so um this is unusual if you&#x27;re switching from one parcel to a next but no i have not seen the cell effect work veer compton never saw it work why then have so many tried to copy this serial technology the story is always the same john is told the really big money is not coming unless he can prove the generator by revealing how it is made jon searle refuses to give up his secret the secret will never be there until the conditions have been met as the patent office advisement will be fulfilled and the sooner they understand that and get down and get it done the sooner we&#x27;re going to do it where is the secret john right here over the years the standoff has continued searle has been involved with numerous individuals and companies making the same promises to rebuild his generator they all fail for this same reason they are working with scientists around the clock to get that engine out i told you before i sign a contract with someone else to make it but the controversy around cyril and his generator continues to grow some take a different approach this is michael nelson from nasa the national aeronautics and space administration in the united states a lot of people have an interest in anything that has to do with more efficient electric motors more efficient energy devices because we&#x27;re in a situation where we&#x27;re in an energy crunch i do work for nasa i can&#x27;t say i&#x27;m representing nasa at this point but we just have an interest in in this kind of in what you&#x27;re doing and what&#x27;s going to come out of it hopefully what people want to say is impossible is that you keep a couple of magnets continuously moving uh you know you have one big stationary magnet and you have a smaller magnet that rotates around that and if you can just show that you&#x27;ve made a major step forward as far as showing hey this principle will sustain movement that&#x27;s the big question that i&#x27;m seeing people raising about what is possible or impossible you have done this in the past and so you&#x27;re trying to get to a point where you can do this you know you&#x27;re looking at just trying to do a small demonstration of say one roller or how are you thinking about it well at the moment i&#x27;m hoping that down there california morris will make what i call the glass demonstrator and get that running and have a bulb so that as it revolves the bulb lights and it just keeps on running all day long by your lecturing there you go once you do that you&#x27;ve stepped beyond the bounds of what people say is possible there are legitimate experiments that are going on to manipulate gravity involving superconducting discs that where an intense magnetic field or an intense electromagnetic field is applied while a disc is spinning at a high rate of speed and where there&#x27;s there are experiments that are being conducted to to investigate this phenomenon superconductors and rotating magnets may hold the key to generating an unlimited source of energy but did john searle&#x27;s combination of rare earth materials and magnetic fields in his serial effect generator already do that magnets have been used in a thousand different ways over the years and this type of behavior has has never been exhibited has never been seen this information was never given out before others who have gotten a hold of a piece of a demonstrator that would show the serial effect and they broke it apart then they looked and studied and it cannot be back engineered the seg experiments the initial ones that professor certal talks about occurred at the height of the cold war if this technology was viable and he says that military people looked at it if the technology really is viable it would have been irresistible to the military whose hands the technology go into is the problem that&#x27;s why all these years i sort of geared this technology away from the military establishment the claim is that these things have been built previously they&#x27;ve worked they&#x27;ve been demonstrated but today no working prototype exists and in order to build a working prototype some people want a half a million dollars and they can&#x27;t show you anything until that time as far as why has anybody done it many people have tried the only one that has succeeded is professor cyril we want to succeed again we want to build again and demonstrate again this is our primary goal the only thing holding us back is funds there&#x27;s talk of power companies and utilities big corporations who are threatened by this kind of a concept and the the theory is that they&#x27;ve tried to suppress it they&#x27;ve tried to suppress the research and prevent it from reaching market because it&#x27;ll damage their markets they want to maintain control the oil companies and some of the other big businesses run this world unfortunately they run most of our governments so that even our government which we would think would be very interested in something like this sometimes it doesn&#x27;t respond because of pressures put on by big business by economic advisors the most benefit to any individual let alone a company to be made from this is by appropriating it and distributing it to the public and by manufacturing it and making people pay to buy it from you taking out a patent copyrights whatever you need to make yourself or your company the source for something so profound uh the the you would just you&#x27;d be the richest man in the world very quickly now if we give them a method where they can produce electricity at the cheapest method with virtually no input i think that they would like that and go along with it and want to develop it themselves once they see that this device is going to be a fact of life they will try to cash in on it maybe there are people somewhere uh researching this type of thing but it&#x27;s pretty obvious that nothing uh no no hard evidence really has turned up yet the effect was well known in the scientific community it was compared to it was alluded to this is much like the cereal effect or this is a lot like the cyril effect so he was used as a as a base point and not somebody that was off the wall if you can prove the technology if you can demonstrate the technology is functional that it really works all questions will be answered people can&#x27;t argue with success they can&#x27;t argue with what they see right in front of their own face i can understand why people would have difficulty in understanding it because it does take a great deal of effort to make sense of it technically fernando morris an electrical engineer and computer specialist is responsible for the most credible attempt to rebuild the serial effect generator we have something here that needs to be investigated and really that&#x27;s my role i am a technical investigator of the scg in his home laboratory workshop near san diego california morris is following the footsteps of john searle personally guided by searle himself he is rebuilding the generator precisely as cyril did long ago morris developed the unit that reveals a magnetic sine wave in the serial generator that&#x27;s how i started off is to try to build a magnetizer for it and if i could develop this sine wave which i&#x27;d never heard of before i think we&#x27;re on to something and we can build upon that now that has been that is proven repeatable and i&#x27;ve got the unit to do that it&#x27;s a process of magnetizing the rollers and the plate and when you develop sine waves on it what you in fact you&#x27;re developing a motor and that&#x27;s essential if it&#x27;s going to be a viable device that&#x27;s exactly what i&#x27;ve been saying since 1946 there is a waveform in a magnetic domain on that metal and the scientists say impossible morris has invested his time and considerable personal fortune into this effort after years of studying cyril&#x27;s books trying to decipher their meaning and endless question and answer sessions with the man himself what does he know that assures him searle is right i&#x27;m gonna release a piece of information here that i&#x27;ve shared before and that is the law of squares that&#x27;s one of those question marks right now is how does that come about it took me a while to understand it but what it is it represents time space and energy and what it says it&#x27;s in a random state that&#x27;s not useful energy but what john has done is he has transposed that matrix so that the output is uniform and within nature uniformity means resonance so if you can resonate that random energy you got yourself an electric current because electrons are the only things that are free to move on metal so what we got here is a converter of random energy inter-electrical current and that&#x27;s the brilliance behind the machine here is not only was john able to decipher his matrix but he will say well we&#x27;ll make it into a workable device and that&#x27;s the sag morris&#x27;s mock-up of the seg needs an outside power source just like searle&#x27;s original back in 1946 this unit does not contain the rare earth material and will not display the serial effect it was built to demonstrate searle&#x27;s contention that spinning magnets give off an electric charge as measured by the flashing leds what will be the reaction if and when the serial generator functions as the inventor assures it will i think the public will demand to know why is this technology being ignored why have the expert failed to recognize it john has a solution that is really the ultimate solution because we&#x27;re using energy that&#x27;s already available within nature and it&#x27;s benign i think we have a wonderful opportunity here and it&#x27;s a shame hasn&#x27;t it hasn&#x27;t been taken advantage of i mean john has been struggling to get this technology out for years john a thomas jr wrote a book about cyril then formed a corporation with him in 1996 disc direct international science consortium for the purpose of rebuilding the serial generator thomas&#x27;s study of the serial effect has convinced him beyond any doubt that searle is telling the truth the funding that was done for all of this work originally was done by individuals that wanted to see this done all private no public uh money was put in people in the in this country in in in london in england all around the world have been lied to they have been told that this does not can&#x27;t exist or doesn&#x27;t work every sunday professor cheryl would go out and physically demonstrate a craft going up into the air in front of a whole crowd and was there was no admission here is the craft here it is in the air this is what it does and they didn&#x27;t believe it and they shunned him and called him and classified him in with ufo people and and french people and he&#x27;s showing you my god there it is and the united states has not heard of professor cyril they don&#x27;t know who and how he is the people of this world have been offered this technology in a refined form that usable since the early 50s and it was their right to have it and it&#x27;s been taken away from them by the media and by the power companies and by the people running this economic society and we have been told that we cannot have this and it can&#x27;t exist yet we could be living in a new world today that we should have had 25 years ago john searle has since reformed the searle international space research consortium or sisrc an offshoot of his earlier organization he lives and works in a small residence in the north of london it is packed with equipment and computers visitors come from all over the world and are mostly welcomed by the man with a wary eye all my life says that lesson i see this everywhere people are more impressed with lies than the truth i can&#x27;t because i&#x27;m talking from the heart the truth of what i know and what i do but the proof that everyone wants to see is the generator running it&#x27;s not enough that searle has written thousands of pages in his books volume after volume demonstrating his knowledge of magnetism and the tremendous scope of his work it is a standard problem here is something that is not confirmed in print technical books it has to be confirmed in print you market it you&#x27;ll get four nobel prizes at least the serial effect generator represents a fork in the road of scientific development that was abandoned nearly a century ago when ether theory became a relic of the past john searle came along and whether he knew something special or just didn&#x27;t know any better he chose the empty road and traveled it alone could it be that searle is right there you get gold soul as a that&#x27;s a silly old fool lost his marbles he be in a nursing home being careful if they don&#x27;t make it they don&#x27;t want to know if it don&#x27;t come inside their rules they don&#x27;t want to know the trouble is we&#x27;re confronted by a brick wall called the expert scientific world if they haven&#x27;t done it or cannot do it it&#x27;s impossible to do if all these years 1964 we were at a peak we were demonstrating and still the scientists say it&#x27;s impossible to do really well we&#x27;re going to show you they&#x27;re wrong and they have held up this technology since 1946 to today perhaps it&#x27;s easier to believe that searle&#x27;s technology does not exist the serial effect generator at first look seems to violate known physical laws energy must come from somewhere john says he found it in the rare earth material could it be that simple cyril speaks his own language a combination of known physics and terms he created to describe his invention could it be that john&#x27;s earl is misunderstood numbers in squares told searle that nature has a way of creating order out of chaos does the searle effect generator convert random energy into usable electricity when his generator is overloaded it affects gravity and flies john says he gave it a body and let it fly what is the truth german philosopher arthur schopenhauer was once quoted as saying all truth passes through three stages first it is ridiculed second it is violently opposed third it is accepted as being self-evident could it be that john searle&#x27;s technology is passing through schopenhauer&#x27;s three phases of truth the movement toward alternative energy sources is worldwide and essential the promise of a working serial effect generator represents a paradigm shift and a renewed hope for all life on earth the questions around john searle and his invention need only one answer build a working generator when the rollers are moving around the plates and the energy is there to use or when the skies are filled with flying discs transporting goods and people from place to place until that time we have the man who speaks from his heart seems strange after all these years they&#x27;ve been walking on this on the ground and this is what they call the common but to do sort of shows you had to get permission they never refused me i was never refused they came to the okay so we used to do a lift off and take the pedal over there the audience would be here that we would fly over here make up we were crushing and everybody held him then up it would go again this area was a good place for shows people come from far away mean everything was done the people said never happened and that dreaming is a very [Music] you</p>
