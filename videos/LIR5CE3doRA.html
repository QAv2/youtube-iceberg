            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Without further ado, here we go. Ben. &gt;&gt; Okay. [applause] &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you everybody.</p>
<p>Um, we&#x27;re going to cover a whole lot of stuff. Uh, so I&#x27;ve been uh the biology consultant biologist on the ranch for the past six, seven years, which had nothing to do with the TV show and that there wasn&#x27;t a TV show at all. Um, let&#x27;s uh do let&#x27;s kind of do a zoom in here. We&#x27;ll take a look. This is where Skinwalker Ranch is.</p>
<p>Um Oo, it&#x27;s on Earth. Wow, look at that. &gt;&gt; So, uh but Skinwalker Ranch, it&#x27;s in the Uenta Basin. Um it&#x27;s a whole spooky place, the whole valley it&#x27;s at. Anyways, uh but we&#x27;re going to I&#x27;m going to give you if you have no idea what Skinwalker Ranch is, I&#x27;m going to start off and give you kind of a brief history of the ranch itself and then we&#x27;re going to share some of my biological observations that I&#x27;ve done on the ranch.</p>
<p>Um, if you watch a TV show, it seems like most of the time we&#x27;re just launching rockets. Uh, but there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that&#x27;s happening all the time there. And so if you look at this image, you see there&#x27;s kind of a ridge. Uh, if you watch the TV show, it&#x27;s good storytelling. This is really close to civilization, but it&#x27;s also really remote at the same time.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s hard to say. It&#x27;s right by the Native American reservation, the Ute reservation there. But that ridge and then all the way down to that river there is basically where the ranch is. Okay. So um so the first thing it&#x27;s a 512 acre ranch and one why is it called Skinwalker Ranch? Well because the path of the skinwalker goes through it.</p>
<p>What is that? You see that red line going up and down? That is the quote unquote path of the skinwalker as the tribes have told us. It also happens to follow a fence line where tons of crazy stuff constantly happens. Where the cattle die, where the magpies build weird nests, where all kinds of crazy stuff or we&#x27;ll get into a second. The big red line around the top that is basically kind of the rough boundaries of the reservation up above. And the oval is roughly the ranch.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s shaped differently than that, but that&#x27;s roughly the ranch. So this path of the skinwalker goes through there. Why is it? I don&#x27;t want to get into the politics of it, but needless to say, the Utes and the Navajo or the Da back in the day had some bad blood between them. I&#x27;m not going to get into all the how and the why, but it resulted in the Navajo cursing the lands of the Utes and with the curse of the skinwalker and cursing up from the south through the path of the skinwalker up to where the youths are. And in fact, you see that weird lake? It&#x27;s mostly frozen, but that&#x27;s bottle hollow.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a man-made lake. UFOs come out of that thing. I know it sounds stupid. I&#x27;m just reporting. Weird stuff happens in this man-made lake that the path of the skinwalker goes through.</p>
<p>So, well, what is a skinwalker? Well, you always see this. You always see this kind of image. And skinwalker is a nebulous term nowadays. It wasn&#x27;t a skinwalker originally. Now, by the way, if you don&#x27;t have a written history, written scripture, written law, then your personal interpretation is always valid as a person of that people.</p>
<p>So, if you talk to anybody from any of these tribes, you might hear a different story, but roughly speaking, a skinw walker is usually like a dark medicine man who in order to connect with that dark magic does something terrible that usually involves killing a family member. And then as such they&#x27;re imbued with powers from beyond to do things like take on the skin of an animal and become that animal to be a shape shifter. Um you don&#x27;t talk about skin walkers. If you go to these tribes both ute or Navajo you don&#x27;t talk about it. It&#x27;s bad ju guuju bad medicine to talk about.</p>
<p>So nowadays it&#x27;s kind of a nebulous term. Anything that&#x27;s kind of black magic dark paranormal weird creepy ugabooga is sort of given the term skinwalker. Um, but this is originally what it was. Um, and so, but again, the curse again because of things that were happening between the Utes and the Navajo Navajo cursed the Ute land with the path of the skinwalker that runs through Skinwalker Ranch in a very specific place. Okay, we&#x27;ll get to him in a second.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s talk about your tax dollars here. Okay, so who owned the ranch? What is this ranch? Well, it has thousands of years of history. We have and the season coming out now should have some of the archaeology. We have ice age people living there all the way up through modern days. There&#x27;s petetroglyphs on the ranch.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s archaeological digs. People have been there forever. And the tribes in the area in historic times all share that it&#x27;s spooky place. Weird bad juju stuff happens there. So um in Okay, we&#x27;re going dates here.</p>
<p>In 1994, Terry and Gwen Sherman bought the ranch. They wanted it to be a cattle ranch and they were going to raise these big giant fancy cattle breeds and they immediately started having happens like cattle mutilations where you go out, you&#x27;re tagging the cattle and you turn around and suddenly there&#x27;s a cow that&#x27;s dead and it&#x27;s eviscerated and it&#x27;s like surgically cut missing bones. It&#x27;s like I was just like two minutes ago looking there. How did this happen? Where&#x27;s the blood? Crazy creepy things. Uh the Shermans went half an hour into town, came back, all the cattle were gone.</p>
<p>And they looked everywhere on the ranch and then they went and looked inside one of these big old semi-truckss and all the cattle were like stacked up in there alive like catatonic and they brought the sheriffs out and they open it up and the cattle came out. It&#x27;s like how did you range up all of our cattle and get them to go stack up in there? So it made the news if you remember back in the 90s it was making it in the news uh stuff was happening at Skinwalker Ranch and it was freaking them out so much that and so they technically owned it from 94 to96. In 96, it was purchased by this guy, Robert Bigalow. Robert Bigalow is a real estate tycoon and he runs Bigalow Airspace, which is top-notch air and space equipment and cutting edge airplanes and spacecraft. And he&#x27;s like, &quot;Well, him and his wife had had a UFO encounter.&quot; And they&#x27;re like, &quot;Well, we want to know what&#x27;s going on with this ranch, so let&#x27;s buy it and let&#x27;s see what we can do about this.&quot; So, here&#x27;s the stats and here&#x27;s something you should know if you&#x27;re a taxpayer.</p>
<p>So uh George Knap testified to Congress last year about this fact. So there is a government organization called OAP which stands for the advanced aerospace weapons systems applications program government right it was run by Dr. James Latsky and Robert Bigalow his friends he&#x27;s a government contractor he&#x27;s making planes for the government and he said hey I this is to Congress this is you can look in his congressional records he testified that well u Lockheed supposedly had some retrieved nonhuman technology some UFOs or something like that that had just been sitting on since the 50s and had done nothing with it. He was aware of it and he said, &quot;Hey, we want to do take a crack at it. We want Bigalow Airspace to take a crack at seeing what we can do with this material.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;re a government contractor. I&#x27;m going to start a new subcontract which is called NIDS, the National Institute for Discovery Science. And we would like you to donate $22 million to let us steady take this stuff from Lockheed and steady it ourselves for the sake of the government. The government said yes. Senator Harry Reid, Senator Daniel Inui, and Senator Ted Stevens said yes.</p>
<p>$22 million. Here you go. And it was all and now five million of that was supposed to go to steady skinwalker ranch. All the rest was supposed to be reverse engineering this stuff. It went up the ladder approved approved approved.</p>
<p>They were starting to build this laboratory at Bigalow Airspace to be able to research this stuff. And again, this is on congressional record. You can go, you&#x27;re a taxpayer, look it up yourself. You can see this testifying to Congress about this. So, uh, at the very tail end, two head government people who are off the record in their name said, &quot;Nope, nope, nope, nope.</p>
<p>Not doing this, not doing this.&quot; So, instead, all of that money went to studying Skinwalker Ranch. So, throughout the 90s, from 1996 to 2016, um, Senator Harry Reid got Skinwalker Ranch funded. So, your taxpayer dollars were going to our government researching what happens on the ranch. We don&#x27;t know all that happened. Very little of that has come out.</p>
<p>Well, in our time in 2016, our local hero, Brandon Fugal, bought the ranch. Now, he was a skeptical person. You don&#x27;t want to be a skeptic. A skeptic is no different than a believer. If you&#x27;re a believer, then you&#x27;re never going to question anything.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re a skeptic, you&#x27;re never going to believe anything. Be skeptical. Be believing. Don&#x27;t be a skeptic. Don&#x27;t be a believer.</p>
<p>Be someone who is believing. be someone who is skeptical and always opening to hearing and learning more. He was skeptical. He bought the ranch and he&#x27;s like, &quot;I can get this figured out. I&#x27;ll put good teams on this and we&#x27;ll figure this out in no time.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s probably a bunch of croc, a bunch of hoie.&quot; And it wasn&#x27;t. And he had his own experiences. He&#x27;s like, &quot;Wow.&quot; So, he started bringing people onto the ranch, different experts from different fields, people he trusted. And Brandon is a big huge fan of this museum. And so he started inviting me out because I&#x27;ve worked in all kinds of different fields that overlap in strange ways.</p>
<p>And he&#x27;s like, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s have Ben start looking at stuff.&quot; And then I found so much stuff that they&#x27;re finally like, &quot;We got to put him on the show.&quot; So, but I&#x27;ve been doing this for years. [clears throat] Now, this man lives on the ranch. This is Eric Bard. Forget the show. The show is entertaining and it gets some of the information out.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s good show. But this man lives on the ranch all the time, even away from his family. and he puts so many hours in researching this ranch and he&#x27;s just helping people and you can get online and be part of the insiders which sounds like a gimmick but he can&#x27;t read all the cameras all the time. So there&#x27;s people now you can get online and help see things on the camera and report it and say look here&#x27;s what we saw here we see. So that&#x27;s a little background [laughter] went too far there.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s a little background about the ranch itself. It&#x27;s a weird place and the interesting thing about it is that all the areas of science do not correlate. The biological things do not correlate with really UFOs. There people who claim that they saw portals. Even in the &#x27;9s, our government, one of the reports says they saw a portal thing open up and this animal come through it.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the dumbest sounding thing I&#x27;ve ever heard. That sounds like that sounds ridiculous. Government reporter. They&#x27;re just reporting what they&#x27;re filming and seeing. All these weird things that happen on the ranch, paranormal type stuff, ghost type stuff, cattle mutilations, uh, animals from the past, a lot of ice age animals, and a lot of things that will be described similar to something like a velociaptor.</p>
<p>That sounds ridiculous. Okay. And so I&#x27;m like, well, you&#x27;re going to invite me out? I want to experience this stuff firsthand. I want to know for me. I want to use my own equipment and I want to do my own tests and I want to know what&#x27;s what.</p>
<p>So my first day I go to the ranch and there by the front gate there&#x27;s a dead rabbit. Now dead stuff teaches bones, skeletons, bodies, biology follows certain rules. When you die your gastrointestinal bacteria go like, &quot;Oh no, they&#x27;re not eating more food for us to consume in the stomach.&quot; Well, let&#x27;s start eating the stomach lining. And then you bloat. That&#x27;s why things bloat.</p>
<p>This thing did not bloat. Three days, first day, second day, third day, fourth day. No flies, no scavengers, no ravens, no magpies, no crows, no vultures, no eagles, no coyotes, no foxes, no raccoons. Nothing touched it. I picked it up.</p>
<p>Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, soft. It was like a fresh dead rabbit. No rigamortis. The tendons never did anything. It never dried.</p>
<p>It never stank. The fire ants never started eating it. Nothing would touch it. And so finally, I snapped a picture. This is back in the day where I&#x27;m like, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m on the ranch.</p>
<p>Oh, can I snap a picture? Oh, I was so timid back then. Now it&#x27;s like, take a million pictures and photos and videos.&quot; But I didn&#x27;t know back then. So, this the only picture I have of it. On the fourth day when I was going to leave, it was gone. There were no tracks anywhere and it was just gone.</p>
<p>Just randomly. Okay. Uh Eric Bard, the man I showed you who lives on the ranch, he wanted to steady. He one of his thoughts he thought, I wonder if there&#x27;s maybe like psychedelic mushrooms or some sort of mindaltering presence on there. And I thought it could be a possibility, too.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve documented cortiseps on the ranch. Cortiseps are mushrooms. Well, they&#x27;re not mushrooms. They&#x27;re a spore that gets into the brain of life forms, insects, and it takes over their brain. It&#x27;s where you get like the Walking Dead idea, right? And then they climb up to a high place and they latch on.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s even an X Files episode on if you&#x27;re that old. And they and you latch on and then you and then it either explodes out your brain or out your butt and all those spores go out from that high point. So if it happens to an ant then the ants will take it away from the colony because it doesn&#x27;t want to infect the colony. I started finding this with grasshoppers and cicas. Um so there are cortiseps.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s worth noting but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re impacting our human minds but that was worth noting that there are cortiseps on the ranch. Okay here&#x27;s a happy dead skunk. So my first week on the ranch I found a dead skunk. Now he looks pretty lifelike. He almost looks like a taxiderermy fellow there.</p>
<p>Little face sticking out there. And so I took some pictures of it. Came back a month later, he was still there. Came back a year later, he was still there. Two years later, he&#x27;s still there.</p>
<p>He never ever decomposed at all. I poked him. I didn&#x27;t pick him up. A skunk. He smelled like a skunk.</p>
<p>I did, but I poked him. And he was always squishy. He never rotted. He never bloated. And microbes inside or outside never broke him down.</p>
<p>Skunks, you guys, you know the story. You know the story. Yeah. Skunks, the collagens and the fur when they die, there is a different chemical reaction that happens and the collagen, the hairs come apart. Um they just within a day or two come apart from the skin.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t happen. The dermal tissue just held on to it for three years. It just looked like this. And so we&#x27;re like Eric and I one day were like, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s just let&#x27;s do I we&#x27;re not for the show, but let&#x27;s just document this.&quot; So, we sat down with our phones and filmed it and we&#x27;re like, &quot;Huh.&quot; And turned it over and it was still the same. Went over to it the next day after 3 years.</p>
<p>The next day it was gone and the tuft of fur, this is the tuft of fur, was wedged up in that homestead right there, the old ruins there. Uh, there was another tuft on the ground and in its place where the skunk had been was this. Now, this is a perfectly decomposed foot, not from a skunk. This is a smaller rodent, probably like a prairie dog or a Uenta ground squirrel, something that&#x27;s a pot gut, something that size, but the ranch. So, here&#x27;s the rule we found out.</p>
<p>If you are small deer, coyote size, or maybe like a small deer or smaller, the laws of decomposition, which is called tonomy, don&#x27;t apply at all. If you are bigger than that, the rules do apply. you will decompose, but other stuff happens that you&#x27;ll see in a minute. So, this is weird and to me and I don&#x27;t like I hated it before when people were telling me about the ranch, oh, the ranch wants this or the ranch doesn&#x27;t like that. I&#x27;m like, what are you see? It&#x27;s a geographical area.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t have wishes. It doesn&#x27;t have intentions. The ranch doesn&#x27;t like that you&#x27;re here. It&#x27;s the dumbest thing I&#x27;ve ever heard. The problem is once you&#x27;re on the ranch and once you see these phenomena happening, there&#x27;s no vocabulary to describe it.</p>
<p>So what you find is that the religious people start using scientific terms. The scientists start using religious terms because they&#x27;re both lacking a vocabulary to discuss these things. And that&#x27;s what happened. So all I can say is if you go on to the ranch and you are if you have bravado, if you&#x27;re like this is a bunch of crap, it&#x27;s dumb. I can disprove this.</p>
<p>You will get attacked. People literally get attacked. Um they&#x27;ll have like Thomas Winterton, you know, his brain you almost like lots of people almost died. Lots of people have been radiated. Lots of bad things have happened to people.</p>
<p>Lots of people had heart problems. Not me. I had cardiac arrest and died. But not on the ranch. So I got heart issues and it never bothered me because I&#x27;ve come on the ranch kind of like, well, let&#x27;s learn.</p>
<p>What do you want to teach me? People who come Eric&#x27;s the same way. Eric&#x27;s never been attacked. He comes on and just what do you want to what do you want to teach me? I take this and again I could be wrong. If I&#x27;m wrong, fine. But this was as if it was saying, &quot;Oh, you and Eric are going to document that I can&#x27;t decompose something.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll show you.&quot; Blam, perfectly decomposed leg the next day. Even though it wasn&#x27;t from the skunk, so kind of interesting. Okay. Um, birds. Okay.</p>
<p>So, big animals, one set of rules. Little animals, another set of rules. birds kooky duke off the chart. This is an oral. Uh I don&#x27;t have photos of this.</p>
<p>You can see this if you watch the show. Um this is a diagram. So this bird is an oral. They brought me an oral body. It looked normal.</p>
<p>When I opened up the legs, this is what it was like. The blue is tissue and bone. The black are empty spaces. It was just like there&#x27;s bone gap. Bone gap.</p>
<p>bone gap. The tendons still ran the full length, but there were gaps in the bone. This is number one impossible. Number two, no injury could cause it. Number three, no bacteria or virus could cause it.</p>
<p>And number four, if a living animal had this, it would would just it it wouldn&#x27;t be able to function, would be able to stand. So, how so I couldn&#x27;t even see this until I cut open the legs and saw inside. That is on the TV show. What isn&#x27;t on the TV show? Well, that is we&#x27;re going to talk about that. Starling.</p>
<p>They brought me a Starling. And okay, I&#x27;ll stick with this picture. The Starling was squishy. Again, no decomposition. And it stayed squishy the whole time.</p>
<p>Every time we go to the ranch, squishy squishy. It was just like a doggy chew toy. Totally squishy. No smell, no stink, no rigamortis setting in. So, we&#x27;re like, well, that&#x27;s cool.</p>
<p>Every time I visit, document that again. Then I took it off the ranch and it started to decompose once it was off the ranch. Now again, that&#x27;s ridiculous. Think about it. Like actually think now that may not make for good TV, but that defies all the the I want to be rooted in reality.</p>
<p>What are the laws that we are playing with? What are the laws of reality? The ranch disobys whatever those rules are. So apparently the rules we think we know are not the actual rules cuz apparently when you go to a man-made geographic region and then you leave suddenly decomposition starts. So um the skull started to rot and smell and these bubbles started to appear that kind of looked like the labrea tarpets in miniature. They were kind of black and viscous kind of shiny and they would bubble up and I&#x27;m like what is that? I&#x27;d take tweezers, put on my rubber gloves, go to pull it out, and it would pop. But when it popped, it left no residue.</p>
<p>This happened five, six, seven times, and finally I&#x27;m like, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s going to believe me. I better get some photos.&quot; So these are some photos. I got one more zoomed in. Again, it&#x27;s not the best photo. Um, but I don&#x27;t know what these are.</p>
<p>These don&#x27;t these don&#x27;t correlate with any normal decomposition behavior of any microbes. So, but this is just something that happened. Now, we also had screech owls that they brought me a dead screech owl. It was soft when I opened it up. The keelbone was gone.</p>
<p>Just think about a Thanksgiving turkey. That big old the whole the breast bone, right? That was gone. The wishbone was gone. The femurss were gone. The bird was not opened up.</p>
<p>There were just bones missing. That&#x27;s ridiculous. that if you had a UFO fly over and aliens got out and said, &quot;Hi, tell me what laws of physics are being broken.&quot; Guess there are aliens. There&#x27;s no That&#x27;s astounding, but it&#x27;s not breaking any laws of physics. This is actually breaking the law, known laws of science.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no laws against there being aliens out there visiting us. There&#x27;s no laws against that. Okay? This doesn&#x27;t make sense. This is actually more profound to our existential understanding of reality. Okay, this one, I don&#x27;t know why, but everybody should be talking about this all the time.</p>
<p>I forgot about this. I forgot about this. And at Phenom Con, somebody raised their hand and said, &quot;Hey, Ben.&quot; Yeah. So, um, why is it that nobody&#x27;s talking about the fact in season one a UFO in broad daylight flies over a cow and then the cow buckles and dies underneath it? And I&#x27;m like, yeah, why aren&#x27;t we talking about that all the time? Like, that&#x27;s really weird. So, here you go.</p>
<p>Look at that. Now, unfortunately, this is early early cameras that they had on the ranch, but broad daylight, this UFO appears over this cow, and then on screen, the cow dies. When they went over to the cow to examine it, it was dead and it had dangerous levels of radiation enough to the point where if you watch the show, they&#x27;re like, &quot;Let&#x27;s get out of here.&quot; They all their little guy counter weird thingies and they it&#x27;s not my field. and they all run off and they come back later on and it&#x27;s back down to normal radiation levels. That also is impossible.</p>
<p>If you ever had a medical treatment where you get radiated, you know everything you sit on or touch is also radiated. You radiation isn&#x27;t transient. So, um this cow and then it the thing flew off. I&#x27;m gonna kill you cow and then flies away. Like I don&#x27;t know what that is.</p>
<p>some unidentified thing and it hovered over the cow. The cow buckled and died. Now, here&#x27;s what&#x27;s really strange. The cow, so mammals, when we die, our tendons when they dry, we curl forward. [snorts] If you look at mummies that are natural, they curl forward.</p>
<p>Uh birds and dinosaurs are the opposite. They go, we call it dinosaur death pose. Uh this is what the cow did. Did the dinosaur death pose. You look at that.</p>
<p>That is not a normal position for me. And if you watch the show, that&#x27;s not the position the cow was in. The cow died and it did start to decompose, but post decomposition, it did this whackadoodle shape. And again, this is in paleontology what we call the dinosaur death pose. So I don&#x27;t believe that the cow had a skeletal and tendon structure like a dinosaur, &gt;&gt; but ra but whatever happened, it responded in a way like a dinosaur did.</p>
<p>Oh, very very strange. Okay, the dermested beetles also. So, dermested beetles are incredible. You guys have a colony one right now. Dermesta beetles are a museum specimen provider best friend.</p>
<p>Once the gooey stuff is gone and you&#x27;re done to the dry stuff, you got jerky on your bone. Dermesta beetles clean it super nice and then you just, you know, kind of peroxide it off. They all anywhere you you go put a chicken bone in your yard within a week or two, you&#x27;re going to have dermest beetles there. They&#x27;ll take care of it. They come out of nowhere.</p>
<p>They find it. No dermested beetles touch this cow. I did in a cropsy and gathered so many. So there were weird little green beetles that I&#x27;ve never seen before, but there were no dermest anywhere. I have never seen that happen.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know how it decomposed because this is two months after the cow died. They had me come out to check it out. So that was strange. Okay. The bone um that&#x27;s on the show.</p>
<p>Uh, so one of the rib bones I noticed had a bite mark through it. Now, if you&#x27;re not familiar with predatory animals, that&#x27;s not exciting to you. You&#x27;re like, &quot;Okay, bite.&quot; No, you don&#x27;t go around biting bones. Teeth are delicate. You don&#x27;t bite through bones.</p>
<p>Now, the animals that do, there are some animals, like we know hyenas love to eat bones. A lot of animals will try to break a bone off to get marrow and to get some calcium. They use their back teeth. So, if you look on, okay, this is a cougar, you got these front pointy teeth, you got these back teeth that are sharp, but they&#x27;re for crunching. If you are going to break off a bone, then you are going to snap and break and eat it like a little uh like a little pretzel or something.</p>
<p>Um they are there are bites like that on the bottom of this bone. Okay. Something did bite bite bite chomping things off. But the bite through it is has a concordial fracture which means it goes in this way and it has a cone coming out the other way. Like if you shoot a BB gun through a glass, right? Concordial fracture.</p>
<p>That means this bite happened with tremendous force. It wasn&#x27;t a crunch. It was a very powerful quick intense bite. And whatever did that is very unusual because that is not the way any of our local predators would handle a bone. As you can see, other things have like broken off chunks, but something bit all the way through.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t have anything that has the power and the pointiness to do that. We have animals with a pointiness like a cougar, but they don&#x27;t have the bite force to chomp through it. And we have things like a black bear that have the bite force to do it, but they have these round posty teeth. they&#x27;re not sharp. So, I went back [clears throat] and I tested it and I tested those uh on measured it on all different kinds of animals that we have in the area.</p>
<p>Um you on black bears, on coyotes, on foxes, on things that there&#x27;s no things like uh pine martins, all these things. And the only skulls that matched up were a dire wolf, which is extinct. It&#x27;s an ice age mega predator we had here. By [clears throat] the way, if you ever look at a skull, you have to imagine muscle and skin and tendon over. They&#x27;re always way bigger than you&#x27;re looking at.</p>
<p>So, a direwolf or a jaguar. Jaguar has the strongest bite force of any cat for its size. You see this line here? This is called the sagittal crest. The bigger this is, the stronger the bite force you have because the muscles, the anchor that close your jaw, attach to that sagittal crest. So, I said it when they recorded me.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m like, the only things that match out of everything are a direwolf or a jaguar. And actually, it matches a jaguar better. And they didn&#x27;t put that in the show. They just like, oh, direwolf, it sounds like a regular wolf, but dire that sounds exciting. We&#x27;re going to run with that.</p>
<p>Um, but who knows what it is. Who knows what it was. Um, so, you know, we [clears throat] were testing it and I was showing them, but um, this is a direwolf and a uh, black bear. Now, these guys, it&#x27;s interesting. a bear and a wolf about the same size skull.</p>
<p>So, a bear can smell better as you can see. But look at the sagittal crest on the wolf. The bear has a bigger brain, but the wolf has a triple or quadruple more of a bite force because it has that bigger sagittal crest and that area is filled with the muscles that close. That&#x27;s the kind of bite. So, not only does a black bear not have the pointy teeth, it doesn&#x27;t have the bite force to pop a hole.</p>
<p>If a if a black bear chomped through that ribbone, it would have just been crunched. It wouldn&#x27;t be a nice pop like that. So, as we&#x27;re talking about stuff, I took teeth of [clears throat] black bears, coyotes, wolves. I didn&#x27;t have a jaguar, but we took a bunch of different teeth, put them in a drill press, and just did a press test with, you know, an expansion to see what force can go through. We took a second rib that&#x27;s in the freezer in the back room.</p>
<p>We took a second rib and said, &quot;What compares through?&quot; All of them shattered as you can see when we did the test. All the teeth when they they couldn&#x27;t go through it. Uh so direwolves and greywolves. Uh direwolves are bigger. They&#x27;re grossly exaggerated in the media.</p>
<p>They were bigger than a greywolf, but not that much bigger. They were bigger. Um so direwolves and greywolves were both here during the ice age. Direwolves are extinct. Greywolves are still here.</p>
<p>Um, but they&#x27;re, you know, they&#x27;re famous because of media and like Game of Thrones, which I haven&#x27;t even seen, but everybody&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, direwolves, man. [clears throat] People like that.&quot; Okay, but Jaguars, what about them? Nobody talks about them. Oh, they&#x27;re from the tropics, right? No. No, they are not. For over a million years, they lived from Canada to Argentina.</p>
<p>And over the past 10,000 years, they&#x27;ve had a huge range reduction. We used to have two of them, a giant jaguar and a regular jaguar. These are two species, cousins that lived alongside each other. Now just the little ones still around. [clears throat] And we&#x27;ll get more into jaguars in a bit.</p>
<p>Okay. Um, the ranch will give you if you come in there with a good attitude. I know it sounds so dumb. I just I you guys, I I don&#x27;t have the vocabulary. I&#x27;m just sharing you.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m being casual about it because I don&#x27;t have the words to do it justice. The ranch behaves. I know a ranch can&#x27;t have an attitude, but the ranch acts as if it does. Okay? And it acts as if you come in with bravado, you get attacked. If you come in with a curious mind and you just want to learn, then it will give you stuff and it will give you renditions of what you want to see and it will give you what you&#x27;re looking for sometimes in very uncanny ways.</p>
<p>And this is one of the weirdest ones for me. Showed up to the ranch and the producer came out. We go walking across and we&#x27;re like, we both looked down. Huh, there&#x27;s a dead quail. Huh, there&#x27;s another dead quail just right there in front of us.</p>
<p>I picked one up. Floppy floppy soft. This is a dead summer. And uh Caleb and Dragon both said, &quot;Yeah, they weren&#x27;t there in the night. We walked through here and so somehow it happened right before I got there.&quot; Boom.</p>
<p>Boom. Two dead quail. This is the male. This is the female right by each other. And I want you to notice, look at the face.</p>
<p>I should have done a picture zoomed in. The upper beak is bashed in. The lower beak is not. That is impossible. The upper beak overlaps the lower beak.</p>
<p>And so for it to bash in, it would bash in both. The female the same. I hope you can see it. It&#x27;s the same. Upper and lower beak.</p>
<p>Lower mandible is out. The upper mandible is curled and jammed in. They&#x27;re both dead. Neither one stank. They were Neither one.</p>
<p>Rigamorta said it. And I&#x27;m like, well, hey, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do an experiment here. They&#x27;re right here on the ground right where we park. We put a little ring of rocks around them. So, okay, nobody do anything.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re just going to leave them here. They were 2 feet from a red fire ant hillill. We&#x27;re like, well, let&#x27;s see what the fire ants do. Three days of fire ants. Nothing touched it.</p>
<p>No predators, no scavengers. They didn&#x27;t stink. Rigamortis never stayed in. They stayed floppy. They stayed pliable.</p>
<p>Um, the ants wouldn&#x27;t touch it. Finally, when I went to pick them up before I was going to leave, I did watch one ant come over, crawl up on it, and it went over to the eye and it kind of like tasted near the eye, and they&#x27;re like, and it ran away, and they left it alone the rest of the day. I packed them up, and they&#x27;re in the freezer at the ranch right now. I had done any necropsies on them yet, but it&#x27;s crazy. Like, it&#x27;s kind of like the ranch like, &quot;You want dead stuff? Here you go.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s some dead stuff, little man.&quot; over the ranch. This isn&#x27;t biology, but the clouds are weird and they usually are. If you get off the ranch, uh the road that runs what? South um that&#x27;s just a little east of the ranch. If you go down that road and then turn towards the ranch, you&#x27;ll see um it&#x27;s almost like a bubble. Uh and it might this might just be strictly geology.</p>
<p>It might just be that the geology and the geography uh compresses air right over the ranch. But you&#x27;ll see it like and it forms this weird stuff. Or it could be something really trippy and paranormal. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m just showing you what the clouds do over the ranch.</p>
<p>And no one ever talks about that either because it&#x27;s not as exciting as shooting rockets in the sky. Okay, so I decided, well, let&#x27;s uh do a gamble here and let&#x27;s do some bio sensors. So I train birds of prey. So this is my great horn, Shadow. I brought her on the ranch and I also brought uh this is Pepper Barnell.</p>
<p>I brought them out and I said, &quot;Let&#x27;s be really careful about this. We&#x27;re not going to fly them, but let&#x27;s uh see what they see.&quot; Owls can hear in three dimensions. Their ear openings, one&#x27;s higher, one&#x27;s lower. The feathers around the facial disc can shift and adjust, so they can fine-tune the way sound waves hit them. They also see in spectrums of light and color that we do not see.</p>
<p>So, if you shine a black light at an owl, most of them are like pink and purple and striped and weird looking. They see that on each other. We don&#x27;t see it. So they see things we don&#x27;t see. They hear in ways we don&#x27;t hear.</p>
<p>I brought both these birds to the ranch and they were like like looking around like like they were seeing things. Was wild. We&#x27;ve done paranormal investigations here at the museum and we&#x27;ve done the same thing. We&#x27;re like bring owls around. They&#x27;re like they&#x27;re like seeing stuff.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s interesting. Uh doesn&#x27;t prove anything inclusively, but it was an interesting approach. Uh kind of seeing what do the animals experience there. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So then we decided to take it up a notch. This is my friend John Griggs.</p>
<p>Him and I, we said, &quot;Let&#x27;s take our Falcons.&quot; So we grabbed our Paragan Falcons. We brought them to the ranch. Let&#x27;s try flying them. So we usually use radio transmitters, but we also put 3D GPS transmitters on that will show like over a Google Earth image map, like a 3D pathway thing. Now, the company that does that is Marshall Radio.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re here in Utah. They also provide the uh GPS for government drones. So when the government flies a drone, an enemy can knock it down with like an EMP gun like do impulse over, knock it out of the sky. So they buy these transmitters to put on the government drones because it won&#x27;t impact the the transmitter. So we&#x27;re like, &quot;Okay, let&#x27;s try this.&quot; So first we went over and we flew the Falcon over.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to fly the bird through the triangle. So Eric and I went, if you&#x27;re not familiar with the ranch, there&#x27;s an area we call the triangle. It&#x27;s just a random area, but it kind of forms a triangle and weird stuff happens there. Uh, weird anomalies happen. It seems like an epicenter of where everything happens.</p>
<p>So, [clears throat] we get up on the hill and the GPS said that Eric and I were jumping up in the air thousands of feet, hundreds, hundreds of feet, like 300 feet, 200 feet, 100 feet, 300 feet, and we&#x27;re like, we&#x27;re just standing here. We fly the bird through the triangle. When it went through the triangle, the radio receiver flared up, got all the static. GPS just was normal, but the second the bird was on the ground, it said that John was jumping up in the air, like going hundreds of feet. So, we did it a second time.</p>
<p>Same thing happened. And we&#x27;re like, well, let&#x27;s try something different. So, went all the way to the east field, start flying the bird. The bird&#x27;s going up thousands of feet, circling up, doing great. And then we try to call it down.</p>
<p>And it would come down and come into the lure. And right before it would catch it would like would freak out. We didn&#x27;t know why. And it it kept freaking out. Would not touch the ground.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like okay. So then the bird started circling up again even though we&#x27;re trying to call it down. And all a sudden the GPS started missing blips and like like like where is it going? It&#x27;s like missing blip going missing blip. And all a sudden on camera the bird disappears. We have phones filming it.</p>
<p>We have the TV show people are filming it. The bird disappears and JOHN&#x27;S LIKE, &quot;MY FALCON, WHAT YOU WHAT YOU DO TO MY BIRD?&quot; Then we&#x27;re like, &quot;Ah!&quot; Immediately it reappears on the GPS and it&#x27;s over the triangle about a mile away immediately and we&#x27;re like, &quot;Ah,&quot; we go and over there. The GPS said that the bird went through the mesa and now that it&#x27;s out, the bird is moving and the bird&#x27;s movements are accurate on the GPS, but now the GPS is off by about a half mile. Everywhere it goes is me. The radio receiver was perfect.</p>
<p>It was like once the bird once we got her radio signal again was spot on where it should be. We call the bird back. The bird was just fine. Now if you go back and see this where this took place uh if you watch the TV show, there&#x27;s an episode where they show this white glowing orb seems to go in the mesa over the east field. And there&#x27;s another episode where Brandon&#x27;s flying over in the helicopter and you see this white glowing orb come out of the mesa over towards the triangle.</p>
<p>Those are the exact same spots where this GPS stopped and started again. So, why is it not on the show? Well, they were like, the editors were like, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s put this in the next season and claim it was this season because we have so much to fill.&quot; And I&#x27;m like, &quot;Okay, whatever.&quot; But then there were people in those shots who were not on the show anymore. So, they&#x27;re like, &quot;Well, we can&#x27;t do it now.&quot; I&#x27;m like, you had a bird that seems to have flown through the mesa traveling through space and time. Why are you not putting this on the show? It seems like that should be important, but um and I&#x27;ve been sitting on this for six stinking years. And and and they&#x27;re like, well, we might put in the show.</p>
<p>We might put on the show. And finally, I&#x27;m like, Brandon, you can I please have permission to talk about this one because this is really big. And he gave me permission. And so, it&#x27;s been out since September, thankfully. Okay.</p>
<p>on that north south running axis, the path of the skinwalker. That&#x27;s the the line right next to the main homestead. Um, that&#x27;s where the cow died. The UFO shows up and a cow buckles and dies under. That&#x27;s where the cow died the next year about a mile down the road.</p>
<p>But on that same fence, like buckled and died. And I&#x27;m like, look at the magpie nest. The magpie nest there. You can&#x27;t see in these images because these just things I took with my phone, but so a magpie nest is a very specific nest. They first make a mud nest.</p>
<p>It looks like a rob nest. It&#x27;s mud and clay and grass. And then around it, they build a stick nest with walls and a ceiling and a side door. It&#x27;s a very specific, very recognizable nest. These guys were doing that sideways so the eggs and the babies would keep falling out.</p>
<p>They were building it right, but it&#x27;s like they had the directions right, but the angle wrong. And they kept doing that year after year after year. We don&#x27;t know why, but I&#x27;m like, this is on that same path of the skinwalker, whatever that is, is the same spot. So, whatever&#x27;s going on, this is very unusual. Um, so then, uh, Dragon, that&#x27;s kind of a graphic picture if you don&#x27;t know what it is.</p>
<p>Like, what am I looking at? You&#x27;re looking at a fish. &gt;&gt; So, dragon went and did some fishing and he caught a little catfish and he&#x27;s like, &quot;Hey, you always want dead stuff here. Why don&#x27;t you do the crops on this? Tell me what you think.&quot; So, I cut it open. Everything&#x27;s fine. And then I get down to the dorsal pathway there along the spine and it&#x27;s all red and it looks very much like iron.</p>
<p>All the rest of the tissue, all the rest of the flesh was just normal fish muscle, but right along the spine open up and it was like iron. And I&#x27;m like, that looks so much like iron. I got to test it. So, I got a magnet and yep, it was magnetic. whatever was inside of it was magnetic.</p>
<p>So, uh, Travis brought up the point, he wasn&#x27;t suggesting this what is, but he brought up the point that modern medicine is now doing a thing where some of the medications they make, they put iron in it and they use a magnet to guide it to the place where it needs to be. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m not in the medical field, but so but he&#x27;s like, &quot;Okay, this is a technology that we&#x27;re experimenting with in humanity, but this is a random fish that Dragon caught doing some night fishing in Dry Gold Creek. What, you know, so again, this is anomaly. This isn&#x27;t like the ranch showing us something. This is just some strange artifact of the ranch itself.</p>
<p>So kind of kind of strange. Okay. All right. Where we at here? Dead birds. Dead cow.</p>
<p>Bite through the bone. Okay. Okay. Oh, got the clouds. Make sure.</p>
<p>Okay. We&#x27;re on track here. All right. So, one of the teams went down the river and they had some kayaks they were pulling along and they had equipment on top of it. So, they were not boating.</p>
<p>They were just like dragging our equipment. Along the way, they found this dead thing and it stank. They&#x27;re like, &quot;What is this inside of a old dog or something? Let&#x27;s uh this is disgusting. It stinks so bad. Well, [clears throat] maybe Ben would want it.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s uh [laughter] let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let&#x27;s get the skull. So, they took a machete and they and they hacked off the skull, put it in a bag. Thank goodness they did, but they they just they assumed it was just some old dog and they didn&#x27;t want, you know, so thankfully they at least did that. Um, and then two weeks later they bring it to me and I&#x27;m like, my goodness, that uh by size and shape and number of teeth, looks like a subad adult dire wolf is what it looked like. And they only gave me it was just a lower jaw.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m like, go back and get the rest of it, please. And they&#x27;re like, well, okay. They went back. The rest of the skull had washed down the river. So they got me the rest of the skeleton and it was so rank they put it all in like a quadruple garbage bag and then they froze it.</p>
<p>So they gave me this frozen block and they&#x27;re like here take your stinky dog. Uh so I [clears throat] thought it out in my yard the rest of it. We&#x27;ll get to this John in a second. I thought it out in my yard and in my garden bed and it&#x27;s decomposing in very strange ways like weird white. I don&#x27;t it looks like kind of like like styrofoam if like styrofoam crystallized all over the outside almost like a weird soapy crystal formed all over it and I scraped those off.</p>
<p>So uh I&#x27;m going to pres get it all out and share what we have eventually. But uh I&#x27;ve just been too busy to do that. But so we&#x27;re like well what is this? Could we do a DNA test? So we took the tooth and I gave it to somebody. I don&#x27;t even remember who and then it disappeared. I think somebody stole it.</p>
<p>So they&#x27;re like we need another tooth. I&#x27;m like, so I got the next biggest tooth and I shipped it off. They sent me send it to a genetics lab. Um, we&#x27;ll get to that in a second. So, and I didn&#x27;t know who it was going to at first, and I&#x27;m like, dear whoever, you know, um, this might be from a direwolf.</p>
<p>It probably isn&#x27;t, but it looks like one direwolves lived here during the ice age, blah, blah, blah. And thinking I&#x27;m giving them a little bit of education. What I didn&#x27;t realize, it was going to Colossal Bioscience, which is the world premier genetics lab. They&#x27;re the ones who brought back direwolves recently in the news. They&#x27;re the ones that are working to bring back woolly mammoths and dodos.</p>
<p>Okay. And they were like, they were like, &quot;Little boy.&quot; They&#x27;re like, &quot;Yes, we we know direwolves. We&#x27;ve sequenced several of their genomes.&quot; And I&#x27;m like, &quot;Oh, sorry. I didn&#x27;t notice you guys.&quot; Um, so I&#x27;ll get to the what the genetic results were in a minute. Um, but when I brought the jaw back to the ranch, I had it in a little Tupperware bin, little short thing, lid open, no lid, just a little paper towel sitting there.</p>
<p>And they&#x27;re like, &quot;Hey, Ben, come on.&quot; And we&#x27;re having lunch. Uh, why don&#x27;t you set that outside? So, I left it on a little table right next to the trailer. And when I came back out, this is what was all over. Look at these lacerations all over it, including underneath it. Every side of it had these lacerations.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m like, this is maybe 10 to 12 minutes. It wasn&#x27;t moved. The container wasn&#x27;t moved. It was in the exact position I had left it in cuz I didn&#x27;t want to touch it. I mean, see rubber gloves.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want to touch it with my bare hands. So, I knew the exact position it was in cuz I was showing them. Um, and I thought, could it be like a rodent somehow? But you look at it, they&#x27;re not in concentric lines. Rodents have four front incizers and well, two top, two bottom incizers. And you can see the patterns are all over the place on these things.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what formed these. I have no idea how it could have happened, but it happened in 12 minutes in daylight while we were just a few feet away from it and they were undisturbed. I I don&#x27;t know what to think. So, this is what I mean. This ranch is weird.</p>
<p>This This isn&#x27;t ever going to make it in a show. Got to launch a rocket. That&#x27;s more exciting. Let&#x27;s go burn something. Let&#x27;s blow something up and do a test that&#x27;s showy and interesting to the general public.</p>
<p>But this is ridiculous. This is uncanny. Okay, so the DNA results came back and Colossal was like, well, um, 10 or give or take 11%, basically 10% of it was greywolf, so we can confidently say it was a type of greywolf. And I&#x27;m like, so what about the 90%. The 90% is something else.</p>
<p>YOU&#x27;RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. 10% is like beyond the minimum. How could you? So, um, so first of all, let&#x27;s talk about that 10%. The 10 or 11% was greywolf, but it was not American greywolf. It was Greenland greywolf and Eurasian greywolf.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t live here and they don&#x27;t live with each other. Okay. Now, we&#x27;re not supposed to have wolves in Utah anyways, but Greenland greywolves and Eurasian greywolves most definitely are not here. And again, they shouldn&#x27;t ever encounter each other. So, where is that DNA coming from? the other 90% or 89% is a new unknown wolf uh that goes into the greywolf clay, but they&#x27;re like we you could tell I can&#x27;t remember how they read it up, but they&#x27;re like uh you could tell they&#x27;re like we&#x27;re just going to focus on this 10% because we don&#x27;t want to say something outlandish that will make our company look weird or make our stockholders like scratch their heads.</p>
<p>They have like every K9 sequence like every fox, every wolf, every breed of dog. dingoes, even like the the Papo and singing wolves, the sing the little mini ones, right? Even those, they have all these sequins and it came up with none of those. So 90% of this is a new wolf. Eric said, &quot;Let&#x27;s call it a crypto wolf.&quot; And I&#x27;m like, I like that. But everybody&#x27;s so focused on the direwolf part that people are just like, &quot;It&#x27;s some kind of direwolf.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t know what it is.&quot; Uh, it didn&#x27;t match with direwolves um with regular direwolves. The jaw we found uh the size and shape matches a subad adult direwolf. So just because it&#x27;s morphologically the same doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what it is. But the DNA 90% is something new to science. That should be big news.</p>
<p>New species discovered in Uinta basin in Utah. But nobody&#x27;s talking about that. It&#x27;s not what we focus on. Okay. Uh this is kind of an anecdotal story worthy of sharing.</p>
<p>So, [clears throat] um, one night this cameraman back here, this amazing documentary master Charlie and I, uh, we were like, &quot;Let&#x27;s do some astrophotography.&quot; So, we went out to where this bubble is and we&#x27;re and we we start taking some photos and getting some good photos. And I&#x27;m like, &quot;You know what, Charlie? Sometimes this ranch is spooky and you feel it. You feel like you&#x27;re being washed or you feel like something&#x27;s off. And other times, like right now, it just feels like a normal ranch.&quot; And he&#x27;s like, &quot;Yeah, just feels like absolutely nothing.&quot; And then we hear this sound immediately like, &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; And we hear this sound. It sounds like if you if you shoot a 22 bullet across the desert, that that combined with if you&#x27;ve ever thrown a rock at a water tower or if you&#x27;ve ever been on a frozen lake when it&#x27;s cracking and you hear that, it was those two sounds combined.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re like, &quot;What?&quot; And we look over and see this ring expanding out. It wasn&#x27;t illuminating, but it was an expansion ring. Not a not a circle, a ring. And as it expanded, whatever it was, energy was moving outward at a pace that it was compressing the moisture on the end. If you watch like videos of bombs in slow motion, you&#x27;ll see that some you&#x27;ll see a ring come out where you see water vapor forming.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s what it was like. It was like water vapor pushing out and under the moonlight and under the stars, you could we&#x27;re like, that&#x27;s kind of Let&#x27;s Let&#x27;s go back. Yeah, let&#x27;s go back. Start walking back over to the ranch house and Tom came out and he&#x27;s like, &quot;You guys okay?&quot; We&#x27;re like, &quot;Yeah, why why wouldn&#x27;t we be? Did you hear that sound?&quot; He&#x27;s like, &quot;No, but did you see the power go off?&quot; Like, what? No. And so there&#x27;s the command center and the ranch house.</p>
<p>And one of I don&#x27;t remember which one, but one of them the power had gone and then had come back on. And he said, &quot;That&#x27;s impossible. They&#x27;re on the same breaker box. You can&#x27;t have one go off and not the other.&quot; But it did. So, it was like that was that was kind of strange.</p>
<p>[clears throat] Okay. Um the bubble which they originally called the cone and then the dome and now it&#x27;s the bubble. This round circle I&#x27;m just giving you a reference point because we&#x27;re supposed to be talking about biology here. There we there&#x27;s an anomaly and they call it the bubble nowadays. That&#x27;s roughly the size and shape of it.</p>
<p>It moves. It like undulates and so it can range out to on all sides about almost 200 feet wider to in but it moves and it goes up about 1,000 ft. They&#x27;ve dropped stuff out of helicopters and if they&#x27;re over the bubble it will bounce off. They have done big old huge fire things and rocket things underneath and had it cap on. I have watched and filmed myself like a big old $40,000 drone that one of our drone guys was flying and it goes up and it&#x27;s working a grid and once it gets to the bubble it like it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s hit something and then it has to recalibrate and then it starts going through.</p>
<p>While seems impossible and every time I was flipping out I&#x27;m like this right here is impossible. So this bubble we don&#x27;t know what it is but I&#x27;m interested in the biology. I&#x27;m interested in what do life forms how do they respond to this thing? You know, you take your magnets and your Geiger counters, your rockets, do your thing. But I want to know how does life respond. So, this is an antill.</p>
<p>This is an antill on the ranch outside of the bubble. This is a strategic structure. You probably don&#x27;t think much about ants. Ants are cold-blooded. They got to warm up in the morning.</p>
<p>They have work to do. So, they get rid of all the organics and they gather up just sand, which is crystal. It&#x27;s warm. It warms up quickly. And they make a cone.</p>
<p>So that means the rising sun will hit it. They clear out. You ever see plants around an antill? Not normally. They clear everything out. So those first rays of shallow sunlight will hit it and start to warm up the colony downward.</p>
<p>This is a normal antill. This is outside of the bubble. This is inside the bubble. This is not a normal antill. There&#x27;s grass all around it.</p>
<p>The ants would come in and out. They&#x27;re just like, it&#x27;s like they were drunk. They were just kind of like, &quot;Hey, what&#x27;s going on, man? has it. Yo, it&#x27;s kind of cold. All of the antills inside of the bubble are like this.</p>
<p>All of the antills outside of the bubble are standard cones. Nobody noticed that cuz who cares about ants? But these are bioindicators that are telling us something. We need to pay attention. Um, this is the weirdest thing. On the bubble itself, on the border of the bubble itself, we were setting up posts.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re up now. They cover pretty much the whole bubble. And all these posts, like every fifth one has like a GPS tracker and then they all have like a solar panel on top to do a little light at night so you can have a visual so you can know, am I about to walk in the bubble? Am I walking out of it? What&#x27;s going on here? We were putting these up and we were on the bubble boundary and all of a sudden all these ants start biting us. That&#x27;s normal, right? We look at them, we film them. They were going crazy.</p>
<p>They were going nowhere. They were coming from nowhere. They were not harvesting. They were not defending. They were just running around in circles in place going nowhere.</p>
<p>They were out of their minds. It was like somebody was scrambling their brains. Um, nature is not wasteful. You don&#x27;t burn calories for no purpose. You burn calories to fight, to defend territory, to mate, to survive.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t be like, I&#x27;M JUST GOING TO GO FOR, especially if you&#x27;re a colonial animal, an ant that can&#x27;t harvest things. What&#x27;s the worth to the colony? All of them were doing this. They were just flipping out in circles. We filmed it. We documented it.</p>
<p>And that was right on the border of the bubble. As if going on the border is not good for your brain. So, we&#x27;re like, let&#x27;s get out of here. It&#x27;s probably not a good thing. Okay.</p>
<p>This is a plant called Golden Aster. And um there&#x27;s an area south of where they&#x27;re drilling, which by the way, this isn&#x27;t a biology thing, but we got a little more time this round. you go back on Google Maps and go back in time where they&#x27;re doing the drilling, that entire messa is sinking in. And every time I go there, I&#x27;m like, that&#x27;s gone deeper. That&#x27;s getting way deeper.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s where they&#x27;re drilling in. It is all sinking in. So, keep tabs because who knows what&#x27;s actually in the mesa. Get interesting. But right below there, there&#x27;s this pathway and if you get above it, if you fly, you&#x27;re like, it looks like an air strip and like the way the plants are growing, it&#x27;s this perfect rectangle.</p>
<p>So, we call it the landing strip. We don&#x27;t know what it is. And this plant grows there. This is golden aster. Now, I&#x27;m like, well, it&#x27;s growing from the ground.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see what these plants tell us. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m an animal man, not a plant man, but let&#x27;s see what the plants have to say. So, uh, we did tests on the acidity, the alkalinity. And it turns out on one side the alkalinity was high, on the other side the alkalinity was very high, and in the center of the runway the acidity was very high, like ridiculously high. So, don&#x27;t know what that means.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on with that, but there&#x27;s definitely a biologically measurable difference from the same plant. Now, what about the plant itself? Well, look at the leaves. Here&#x27;s leaves from either side of the runway, and here&#x27;s leaves from in the runway. Um, I&#x27;ve talked to some botnists who said this is consistent with radiation burns. Uh radiation doesn&#x27;t just burn, it alters your DNA and it makes it scrambles.</p>
<p>Your DNA is a code to replicate and make new cells. Uh that&#x27;s why when we get old, we start to is because our cells are doing a copy of a copy of a copy. Well, if you interrupt that and make really bad code, then you get this. And this is what it looks like. This is looks like this is radiated plant material.</p>
<p>So, kind of interesting. Okay. So, we started to find um two years ago, I&#x27;m guessing two years ago. So, Utah&#x27;s in a drought. If you don&#x27;t know, the Southwest, we&#x27;re 25 years into a drought.</p>
<p>This is the second biggest drought in the past 2,000 years. We have the bristle cone pine tracking, we can see that that&#x27;s this is the case. Uh animal populations are plummeting everywhere in the southwest. All of the sudden on the ranch two years ago, all the small animals exploded. Jack rabbits everywhere, cottontails everywhere.</p>
<p>Uh turkey population exploded, quail, analopee, ground squirrel, you winter ground squirrel, the pots, everything. Huge cvies of quail, magpies explode. Everything little exploded in numbers. We&#x27;re like, &quot;This is not normal. It hasn&#x27;t rained.</p>
<p>We haven&#x27;t had some big snowfall. What did this? How on earth could this happen? Um, and we started to check scat samples and we need to do DNA tests on what the scat is, but I think we know. We&#x27;ll tell you in a second. Finding coyote bones. Something was killing and eating coyotes.</p>
<p>Now, wolves do not do that. Wolves kill coyotes. They don&#x27;t eat them. They&#x27;re too closely related. It will be like you eating a chimpanzee.</p>
<p>If I roasted a chimpanzee, there would be something off-putting about it to you. You&#x27;d be like, &quot;Uh, how about a steak?&quot; You know, you share too much DNA with a chimp. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m like eating a human arm. Same thing. We see gosh hawks kill cooper hawks, but don&#x27;t eat them.</p>
<p>Uh, wolves kill coyotes, but they won&#x27;t eat them. They&#x27;re too closely related. Something is killing and eating coyotes and raccoons on the ranch. Now, what do we know about raccoons? They live in and near the water. Coyotes will go anywhere, but raccoons, they swim.</p>
<p>They spend a lot of time in the water. They eat crayfish and things like that. All my all my uh raccoon scat samples are filled with crayfish shells and scales and stuff. So, something is killing and eating the coyotes. These are coyote bones in from some of the scat samples.</p>
<p>And this is a guard hair. I need to get more pictures of this. The guard hair is it&#x27;s passing through the digestive system. It&#x27;s eating the fur. It&#x27;s eating coyotes.</p>
<p>So, that wouldn&#x27;t be a wolf. Not a direwolf, not a greywolf, not a Eurasian greywolf or a Greenland greywolf. It&#x27;s none of those. So, um, we need to do more on this, but there&#x27;s big cat tracks on the ranch. These are some of the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Uh, Nathan and Caleb have even much bigger, but this is enormous. We at first were dismissing these as gigantic cougar. Now, cougars are not that big. I This This is a cougar, which by the way, anytime you see a skull, you got to flesh it out. This alive is about as big as a volleyball, but this is a cougar.</p>
<p>Cougars kill deer and elk, okay? They don&#x27;t kill coyotes. They don&#x27;t eat coyotes. So, that&#x27;s a cougar. Um, they&#x27;re not as big as you think. We do have cougars in Utah.</p>
<p>We have quite a few, but these were bigger. Um, but jaguars, I mentioned jaguars earlier. Jaguars used again, they used to live from Canada all the way down to Argentina. And [clears throat] that is a recent reduction. You might not know this.</p>
<p>They are very aquatic. They love the water. They spend most of their time in and near the water. They are the most aquatic of cats. This is one killing a cayman, which is in the crocodilian family.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s another picture of one killing one. They will get them from the water. What other animal is going to hunt basically a crocodile from the water? Crocodiles eat everything. These things go in the water. Come here, you.</p>
<p>And they go and kill and eat caymans and alligators and crocodilians. It&#x27;s nuts. They love the water. Um, so again, these are the two uh jaguars we had during the ice age. The modern jaguar, which was here during the ice age, and the giant one.</p>
<p>So, um, but a lot of people don&#x27;t know that pioneers and settlers crossing the Great Plains documented seeing what they called leopards. They said there&#x27;s bobcats, which have a short bob tail. There&#x27;s the cougars that don&#x27;t have spots, and then there&#x27;s leopards, the big spotted cats. And the Native Americans talked about them. Lewis and Clark expedition says, &quot;Yeah, the Native Americans tell us that there&#x27;s also leopards with spots.&quot; Okay, so we think that at least in the 1800s, we had them even in the Great Plains.</p>
<p>Um, we know in the 1900s we still had jaguars being killed in Arizona and Texas. And they still are in Arizona and Texas. You can look it up. I&#x27;m going to be doing some videos on it soon. Um, but not Utah.</p>
<p>And so what of this? Well, what about black jaguars? Now, what is a black panther? A black panther is a really stupid clunky term and I hate it. And I&#x27;ll tell you why. It&#x27;s like pachyerm. What&#x27;s a pachyerm? elephant, right? That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s an elephant. No, Pachyerm is a clunky term from like a 1700s that means thick skin.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s like elephants, rhinos, and hippos. Those were the pachyms. They&#x27;re not related at all in any way, shape, or form other than they&#x27;re mammals, but those were the pachidorms. Okay. Well, uh, and now people just say elephant is packer.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re, you know, they&#x27;re probuscades. Okay. Well, a black panther is not a species. any in the any in the Leo line.</p>
<p>So like lions and leopards and jaguars and cougars, any of those that could technically interbreed, if they&#x27;re melanistic, then it can be called a black panther. Uh the two that are most often melanistic are jaguars, a lot of them are, and uh wild leopards in Africa. Fair number of them are with some frequency. It&#x27;s not very common though. So, uh, well, what of that? Well, one more.</p>
<p>So, this is footage just off the ranch that, uh, Caleb, uh, hooked me up with. So, Caleb is head of security there. So, don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ll zoom in in a second. So, they were seeing this. You probably can&#x27;t hear them talking.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re saying, &quot;What is that? Is that a bear? Is that It can&#x27;t be a tiger. What is that?&quot; They They think it&#x27;s a black bear at first. It&#x27;s so big that they think it&#x27;s a black bear. Don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ll zoom in in a second. &gt;&gt; Whatever this is, it&#x27;s a cat.</p>
<p>It has a long tail and more importantly, we&#x27;re going to show you in a second, it has shiny fur. Caleb has been back to the way. Caleb has been back to this site and he has checked it out and gone up to those bushes and he&#x27;s like, &quot;Yeah, this is way bigger even than a cougar.&quot; So, let me go back. Oh, okay. So, I was supposed to be two here.</p>
<p>This is a cougar. Cougar has a similar appearance. Again, a cougar is much smaller than a jaguar. U, they&#x27;re both powerful hunters. I mean, a cougar will go after elk.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s pretty impressive. Jaguars will tackle cayman in the water. Uh, but look at that fur. It is not shiny. Cougars have fur that absorbs light.</p>
<p>Jaguars have fur that reflects light. I have a jaguar pelt. It&#x27;s from the 1940s up here. You can see it when you&#x27;re done. And go ahead and lift it up and look it in the light.</p>
<p>Even this jaguar pelt is shiny. The black ones are far shinier. If you have black fur, by definition, you are melanistic. And those melanin cells are even more reflective. So even though you&#x27;re dark, you&#x27;re shiny.</p>
<p>So knowing that, let&#x27;s see here. Okay, so let&#x27;s take a look at this clip. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s rather a bear or a &gt;&gt; that is not a bear. &gt;&gt; Now watch when it walks away. Watch the tail.</p>
<p>Look at the shine. I&#x27;m going to play it again. &gt;&gt; Is block be. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s rather a bear or a &gt;&gt; not a bear. See the the daughter saying it&#x27;s either a bear or a she&#x27;s like that is not a See that tail got that hunchback.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s got those big broad big cat shoulders &gt;&gt; and it&#x27;s got the shiny luster reflecting off &gt;&gt; and it&#x27;s rather &gt;&gt; shiny. It&#x27;s got that long tail. So, uh everything would point to this being a jaguar. Now, we were like, &quot;Well, maybe it&#x27;s a dark cougar.&quot; And that&#x27;s what Caleb thought too. Caleb was like, &quot;Ah, it&#x27;s probably like a dark cougar.&quot; You know, there&#x27;s going to be dark individuals.</p>
<p>I looked it up. I work in this industry. I have friends who breed and train like like the Tiger King guys but less evil. Uh people who train bears, people who train wolves, people who train lions, people who train jaguars, people train leopards and raise them. I have friends in this industry and across the board.</p>
<p>You can look it up yourself. Don&#x27;t trust me. Go ahead, look it up. We have no actual documentation of melanistic cougars anywhere. In fact, in the zoological field, they have tried to breed that in.</p>
<p>They were like, &quot;Well, if we had a black cougar at a zoo, people will come to see that. That&#x27;d be really cool.&quot; Just like, you know, white tigers, they don&#x27;t exist. That there&#x27;s no such thing as a white Siberian tiger. A Siberian tiger is orange. The white tigers, that&#x27;s a recessive gene that they usually only get by breathing father to son, mother to daughter, or breeding siblings.</p>
<p>And it usually results in severely disabled and mutated individuals. The few that are not end up in the zoos and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Wow, we&#x27;re going to pay extra money to go see the white Siberian tiger.&quot; It&#x27;s not okay. Same thing. These people have tried to breed a black cougar. They haven&#x27;t been able to do it.</p>
<p>Nobody&#x27;s been able to do it. They don&#x27;t do that. Now, people have said, &quot;Well, what if this maybe this is a pet keeper? Maybe somebody illegally had one.&quot; That&#x27;s a valid point because I asked my friends in the big cat industry and I said, &quot;What would happen if a if a jaguar, somebody had one legally and got loose?&quot; They said it would have been raised from infancy by people. It would be seeking people out for food. Everybody everywhere would have seen this thing.</p>
<p>This is a wild animal that knows how to slink and try to be unseen. This is not a meow meow, give me food or I&#x27;m going to kill you. No, this thing is being sneaky. So, uh, here&#x27;s the important thing. Where was it? Let&#x27;s take a look.</p>
<p>It was on Earth. Look at that. Okay. Zoom in. Go ahead.</p>
<p>There we go. Okay. So, this is actually like a soda shop in Roosevelt, but it&#x27;s going to be really important to see in a second where it was at. So, we&#x27;re going to zoom in this little hill behind what is it? The Beach and Drink Company. You can go see it yourself.</p>
<p>So, was climbing up on that hill, but that seems strange, but zoom out. You see that river there? This river is just like basically like two miles from Skinwalker Ranch. Following that river system, it goes straight to the ranch. Um, a jaguar has a minimum range of 50 square miles. So that&#x27;s well within the range of a jaguar.</p>
<p>Uh, that little ridge right there, that that&#x27;s Skinwalker Ridge. That&#x27;s Skinwalker Ranch. So that&#x27;s part of its range. So, whatever this thing is, this appears to be a black jaguar on Skinwalker Ranch, killing and eating the coyotes, and it was ranging out following the river. It probably goes up and down that river all the time looking for things to kill.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not killing deer. It&#x27;s not killing elk. It&#x27;s not killing cattle. Wolves love to kill cattle. It&#x27;s what they are built to do, to kill cattle and buffalo.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re built for it. No cattle have been killed except for by aliens. UFO goes over the ranch, cow dies, but no super predator is eating the cattle, but it&#x27;s eating coyotes and it&#x27;s eating raccoons and it&#x27;s following the river system and this seems to be what it is, which is pretty cool. So, &gt;&gt; black jaguars. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. So, um I don&#x27;t know what to think about this. I think it&#x27;s exciting. There&#x27;s there&#x27;s different ways to view this.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m uh biologicalminded. It could just be that some individual has made its way all the way up from Mexico to the extreme far north. Again, we have them in Texas. We have them in Arizona. Why not northeastern Utah? It&#x27;s pretty far.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s possible. But there&#x27;s again this long history of people making the ridiculous claim that seems verifiable of ice age animals being on the ranch. We had jaguars here during the ice age. Could it be that you have something that came through from somewhere else and is wandering around? I don&#x27;t know. But for sure, I mean, we have I mean, if you want to take away two things, that there&#x27;s a black jaguar roaming around Skinwalker Ranch and a UFO in broad daylight flew over a cow and killed it.</p>
<p>I mean, those are two ends of the spectrum there. Um, so interesting stuff. Then this most of what happens on the ranch. I can&#x27;t talk about these are the things that I got authorization by Brandon to be able to talk about. So, I hope you enjoyed hearing about this.</p>
<p>Um, I want to share two things. If you&#x27;re new to some of this stuff, two things I highly recommend. First of all, this just came out. The Age of Disclosure. This is good for everybody.</p>
<p>Um, it has good information, but more importantly, it has top our top government leaders right now all the way up to as high as Marco Rubio coming out and saying, &quot;Yes, this is real. This is going on. on. We need to be addressing this. We need to be releasing this information.</p>
<p>So, I highly recommend you watch this video, too. Now, Moment of Contact came out a few years ago. This is the updated version. Uh, so the 2025 version, new revelations of Alien Counters. Please watch this and just have an open mind and have a conversation afterwards.</p>
<p>This will blow your mind. I just want you to watch it and be like, &quot;Huh?&quot; Like, honestly, this isn&#x27;t the most important topic, but this I think is one of the most important documentaries ever. If you want to have an honest conversation, like let&#x27;s be honest, we&#x27;re not alone in the universe. What are the odds? bajillions bajillions of planets and we&#x27;re the only ones out there. Doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s aliens here.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s like, are we so arrogant to think we&#x27;re alone? No. So, let&#x27;s have a conversation about that. This video really important and I think it it does good to have a conversation and to be aware of some of this stuff. So, um those are two that I I highly recommend for talking about the subject. The Skinwalker Ranch Show, it&#x27;s a really good TV show.</p>
<p>I enjoy it. It&#x27;s also cheesy sometimes. It&#x27;s not the fault of the people who are making it. It&#x27;s not the fault of the people who are on it. It&#x27;s the It&#x27;s the corporate guys at the end who are worried like, well, let&#x27;s do this and let&#x27;s add this and it&#x27;s that end of things.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not even the editors. They&#x27;re good people who are sincere about what they&#x27;re doing. They&#x27;re trying to share. And again, not even a fraction of what happens on the ranch makes it out to the public. So, um, so that&#x27;s just a whirlwind of the biology of the ranch.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re gonna have some questions. Uh, I&#x27;ve got items up here you can look at. You&#x27;re welcome to hold. You just take a paper towel. You can take a look at uh this is the rib that whatever bit through that.</p>
<p>Got a saber-tooth cast, jaguar, cougar, and direwolf. And uh Wendy will pick on you to answer any answer some questions. &gt;&gt; You said that you&#x27;ve seen other ice age animals on the ranch. What other animals do you have? &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s people who have claimed they have seen things. Not that I&#x27;ve seen.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s people who have doc in the 90s things that sound like sloths. Um there are people who have seen things that sound more like tigers and I&#x27;m like jaguar. Um but uh also there&#x27;s a very specific account of somebody who had something that by today&#x27;s standards we would call it a velociraptor something like a raptor thing that they shot at and it followed bloody footprints. The Shermans followed it as well as the OSAP team from our government who was there followed it and it went up into a tree and then disappeared. So, u lots of different also parrots people.</p>
<p>So, people say that they&#x27;ve seen parrots on the ranch like tropical birds and tropical animals. I saw a bird about the size of a robin like like a cardinal. We don&#x27;t have cardinals in Utah. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a birdman. whatever this thing was, it was red and it had a short tail and it was 100% red, but it looked just like some native bird.</p>
<p>I went through all my field guys, I&#x27;m like, I don&#x27;t know what this is. But, uh, I did see that and I&#x27;m like, okay, if you&#x27;re some farmer in the 1990s, whatever that thing is, you might see that and think it&#x27;s a parrot. But, uh, so I&#x27;ve seen that, but um, not sure beyond that. But, I know there&#x27;s so much that doesn&#x27;t get talked about. There&#x27;s so much that doesn&#x27;t get talked about.</p>
<p>Were there any more whole bite mark whole shaped bite? &gt;&gt; Not that I found. Uh, a lot of the bones were chomped off of where things biting from the side and biting off pieces and trying to peel off meat from it. That&#x27;s the only one I found with a bite all the way through. That was kind of a whirlwind day. So, there could have been more, but that&#x27;s the only one that I found for sure.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, it sounds like only the smaller animals did not decompose. &gt;&gt; Yep. Yeah, the small small land animals that aren&#x27;t in the water because that thing in the water did. But small land animals don&#x27;t decompose according to our normal rules. Birds, it&#x27;s a crapshoot.</p>
<p>Could be anything. Could be some weird thing. And the bigger things do decompose, but then the skeleton will alter in weird ways. &gt;&gt; What do you think? What&#x27;s your top two craziest things that you &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s see. I mean, having that falcon fly through the mason and come out the other side.</p>
<p>That was that was really wild. Um, I had a thing I don&#x27;t feel comfortable talking about, but I&#x27;ll just say I had a thing where I think that my mind was interrupted and my perception of reality was interrupted and verified on camera and by other people present. So, I don&#x27;t necessarily want to talk about it here, but that that was kind of unnerving. Oh, I&#x27;m gonna say the bed one. That was trippy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That was my first time to the ranch. I was sleeping in the ranch in the in the uh command center bedroom. And I&#x27;m like, this is weird. Skinwalker ranch. Oo, spooky spooky.</p>
<p>Uh I&#x27;m going to sleep with the lights on. So, I leave the lights on. So, I get on the bed and I&#x27;m sitting there looking and I&#x27;m like, there&#x27;s no internet connection there. So, I&#x27;m trying to like look at old pictures of my phone to just scr track myself. And all a sudden I look down and on my bed it was like somebody grabbed the sheets and was like pulling them down and I&#x27;m like nope nope.</p>
<p>So I grab them and I start pulling back up and it starts pulling back against me and I&#x27;m like I refuse to entertain this at all. So I got all the blankets all on my bed and I wrapped them in between my legs so it&#x27;s 100% on so nothing can pull. And I&#x27;m like no I&#x27;m just going to ignore this 100%. I am not even going to acknowledge this because I was still so so trippy. Um, and I did I talk about I talked about the the Tom and Candace shooting the thingy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, I can&#x27;t because we did the earlier show that that was another one like my first time to the ranch. Tom and Candace made that ranch house magical. It was beautiful. We came in, there&#x27;s all these retro things. They have all these prisms hanging up in the in the window and then the sun sets.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, Ben, look. It&#x27;s rainbow o&#x27;lock.&quot; cuz the sun&#x27;s coming through. We&#x27;re like, &quot;Wow.&quot; But then I&#x27;m like, &quot;What&#x27;s with all the guns by both of the doors?&quot; And they&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, well.&quot; And they were kind of sheepish about it. They didn&#x27;t know me yet really. And they had said that like, well, the dog wolf thing came in and attacked William.</p>
<p>So the dog that lives on the ranch, William, some black dog wolf thing, as they put it sheepishly, came in and attacked the dog. And when I went there, the dog was wearing a cone. And they even had the local medicine man come in and do a blessing on the dog. The vet had already uh stitched them up, but they had a medicine man come and do a blessing while I was there. So that was trippy.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re like this beautiful people, wonderful people. And they had made that home a beautiful place, but like by every door there&#x27;s all these guns, you know, like in case anything comes charging in again. Um but I&#x27;d really have to think on what was the trippiest thing. But I mean some of the little things just are blow my mind. Again, if you what could be could impact your internal gut bacteria if you die on the ranch.</p>
<p>Oh, what is impacting your gastrointestinal bacteria? That is huge. That&#x27;s not external. That&#x27;s inside of you. I&#x27;m dead. Oh, immediately that bacteria starts eating your lining of your stomach and your lining of your intestines immediately.</p>
<p>Within two minutes. So it didn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t happen to the little stuff. That is mind-blowing to a biologist. To a normal person, it&#x27;s like, so it didn&#x27;t bloat. Whatever.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like, no, this is this is again, if an alien showed up and said, &quot;Hi, cool. Hi, you exist. Good to know.&quot; That&#x27;s not that weird. That&#x27;s just exciting, but it&#x27;s not that weird. So, yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, you mentioned that you had approved with Brandon the things that you shared with us. Not to have you not asking you to share something he didn&#x27;t approve, but how many things did you present to Brandon that he said, &quot;Let&#x27;s go share that.&quot; &gt;&gt; Uh, I Okay, so I had I had three biggies that he wouldn&#x27;t let me do, and I had four or five that he said, &quot;We might still use that later on. We might bring that out later, so why don&#x27;t you hold off on that and we&#x27;ll bring it later.&quot; But, uh, he he was pretty good about it. Um, because most of these things, it&#x27;s like these we&#x27;ve been sitting on these things for years. It&#x27;s like, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s get it out.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s have people talking about it and discussing it and sharing their views. That&#x27;s what we need. We need people We need other minds talking about this and telling us where we&#x27;re wrong. We need other people being like, &quot;Here&#x27;s what you didn&#x27;t think.&quot; Oh, okay. That&#x27;s good to know because we&#x27;re again we&#x27;re we&#x27;re dealing with vocabularies that are new for all of us.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh are they going to force Bigo to release the things that he learned his time there? Uh so they kind of shafted us. So so here&#x27;s what happened. We were trying to go have government disclosure on whatever the government itself has, including those Bigalow files. And the government was like, &quot;No, no, no, no, no.&quot; And then they&#x27;re like, &quot;Well, actually, yeah.&quot; The first time they tried to do the UAP Disclosure Act under Chuck Schumer two whatevers ago, they tried, but then the government came in and they rewrote a few things saying anybody anybody who has files or actual material from like UAPs or UFOs supposedly if you suppose if you have files, if you have footage, then that becomes government property. That&#x27;s why the UAP disclosure act did not go through is because people like Jacqu filet and stuff who have apparently stuff they&#x27;re like why don&#x27;t and Brandon was like no so you could just take the whole ranch the government under that could then just be like well the ranch has paranormal stuff and UFO stuff so we&#x27;re just going to take it by eminent domain so it&#x27;s a battle it&#x27;s going on behind the scenes they try to do a sneaky dirty thing uh we were trying to get the word out still trying to get the word out But um it&#x27;s just a battle and there&#x27;s powers behind the scenes that are fighting back and forth on it.</p>
<p>So they&#x27;re they&#x27;re trying to um stuff keeps getting leaked. If you watch if you watch this, you will find out some of these people like one of the dudes uh had a heart attack and almost died and his colleague had a heart attack and did die and they&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, if I had died, is this going to the grave? I need to get this out. I need to say before I die, I need to get this public.&quot; So, a lot of these old-timers are starting to get the stuff out because they&#x27;re like, &quot;Who cares? We need the truth out.&quot; Whatever the truth actually is. &gt;&gt; I was actually raised. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Tommy is a relative. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s wild. &gt;&gt; So, curious, have you seen the green orbs? Have you heard any stories about them &gt;&gt; up here or down there? &gt;&gt; There. &gt;&gt; I haven&#x27;t down there. I have on the ranch.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen stuff on the ranch. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. um blue um size of a marble uh I&#x27;ve seen and very much interacting with your mind uh very much able to like still recordable still able to be filmed by other people but very much in connection to who you are what&#x27;s going on in your head the stuff that I&#x27;ve seen I mean they&#x27;ve caught big stuff on film on the ranch I mean big huge you know broad daylight here is something the size of a like like what the the big old that big weather balloon thing we had remember like that huge like you know what, five, six, seven feet wide floating along 5t above the ground.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve seen that and caught that on film. Um have stuff just show up randomly. We were filming one night in the river and we&#x27;re done and everybody&#x27;s done like all the camera crews all done and I&#x27;m like you guys look like what? I&#x27;m like, &quot;Look up there. There&#x27;s this big old huge.&quot; It&#x27;s maybe like a football field away, maybe like 80 to 100 feet up. It&#x27;s just glowing bright big just sitting there.</p>
<p>And they&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, yeah. Yeah.&quot; I&#x27;m like, &quot;Turn the cameras back on.&quot; Like, and they&#x27;re like, &quot;So, I just filmed with my phone, but everybody was so exhausted.&quot; And it&#x27;s like, &quot;Yeah, this stuff happens with enough regularity that it was like, we&#x27;re done for the day. Whatever this is came to say hi. Yeah, come back tomorrow.&quot; Just it&#x27;s just nuts. Everybody &gt;&gt; [applause]</p>
