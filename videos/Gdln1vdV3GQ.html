            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Is President Trump really going to give us UFO disclosure in a few months? That&#x27;s the story that&#x27;s been circling around for a few weeks thanks to a British filmmaker in Larara Trump. his daughter-in-law has chimed in and now she is doubling down on this saying that yeah, this is happening and now she&#x27;s added a twist to this story. So, let&#x27;s talk about it. Get in here. This is Jack with Cosmic Road.</p>
<p>I talk about UFOs in the paranormal. Please hit like and subscribe and let me know what you think in the comments below. Yeah, I&#x27;ve covered her comments before uh but now again she&#x27;s added this twist to it. So, let&#x27;s go over what she is now saying. &gt;&gt; Do you think that he&#x27;s he&#x27;s about to make an announcement about UFOs? Because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, I I said this in my podcast, too. What&#x27;s funny is we&#x27;ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this cuz we&#x27;re like, &quot;Well, what do you know?&quot; Cuz Miranda, we all want to know about the UFOs, right? I want to know what&#x27;s going on. And he played a little koi with us. And so that of course led us to believe Eric and I were like, &quot;Oh my gosh, if he won&#x27;t even like fully tell us, maybe there&#x27;s more to it.&quot; And then I have just heard kind of around that. I think he&#x27;s actually said, I think my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has that I guess at at the right time, and I don&#x27;t know when the right time is, he&#x27;s going to break out and and talk about and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. So, did you catch that? Uh, yeah. So, she has previously said uh on her own podcast, like she says that, you know, she believes this might happen. Uh, but when I first reported on this a few days ago, I was pretty dismissive about it because it seemed to me like she was just uh referencing the Mark Christopher Lee information uh the British filmmaker who says that yeah, Trump is going to come out with UFO disclosure I think like July 9th or something like that. Uh, and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s doubled down on this idea too.</p>
<p>And now he says that actually there&#x27;s going to be a press conference in May uh like kind of uh leading up to this big reveal which is interesting and I&#x27;m going to be talking more about that in a moment because I think that&#x27;s an important wrinkle in this. Um but u when I previously reported on this I was dismissive of it. She says she&#x27;s been hearing this rumor around and she says that here too. But in this interview, she adds the twist where she says that Trump himself has said this or she says she thinks that he has said this. Uh so if you know this can be relied upon in any way and I don&#x27;t know that it can uh then she has some sort of inside information that President Trump has said among his inner circles that he is going to come out with this speech.</p>
<p>Now, I&#x27;m not going to hold my breath on that. Uh, and and I&#x27;m going to tell you why I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s going to do it. But then I&#x27;m going to tell you why it might make sense. Uh, but the reason I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s going to do it is because he has not positioned himself to do it. His public stance is very uninterested in UFOs.</p>
<p>I mean, he has said leading into the election that he would give us UFO disclosure or that he should he should do it and he will. Uh, but other than that, he has basically just said, &quot;Yeah, pilots have seen some stuff and you know, they&#x27;re they&#x27;re credible guys.&quot; I mean, he said some stuff like this an &gt;&gt; interview the other day in which you said, &quot;You&#x27;ve been briefed on unidentified flying objects. Are they are they real?&quot; &gt;&gt; Uh, well, I don&#x27;t want to really get into it too much, but personally, I tend to doubt it. Uh I mean you have people that swear by it, right? And pilots have come in and they said and these are pilots that have not pilots that are into that particular world, but we have had people saying that they&#x27;ve seen things. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we&#x27;ve had people that have seen things and they&#x27;re credible people and he takes them seriously.</p>
<p>Uh but UFOs aren&#x27;t his thing. That&#x27;s his public stance. I think that if you if he was going to come out with UFO disclosure uh you know imminently uh you know in May or July that um between this position that he&#x27;s taken in this interview um in May he would have some leadup to it. He would be dropping a little hints uh and he hasn&#x27;t been doing that at all. Uh I mean his focus is carrying out his agenda whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>Uh that&#x27;s where his focus is. It&#x27;s not on UFOs. It&#x27;s not on bringing us UFO disclosure. It hasn&#x27;t been dropping breadcrumbs or paving the way for a speech in May or July. Um, but uh where I think it might make sense is this press conference in May.</p>
<p>[snorts] If that could be the thing uh where he comes out and says, &quot;Hey guys, wait a wait a moment. I have just received a briefing uh and I&#x27;ve followed up with this information and I&#x27;ve learned more and wow, hey, UFOs might be real and I&#x27;m gonna deliver a larger uh speech in July after uh you know, getting even more information. You know, that could be how he positions himself to do it because again, I don&#x27;t think that he would go from that interview with Tucker and other interviews where he&#x27;s given where he said, &quot;Hey, you know, UFOs aren&#x27;t my thing.&quot; Um, but you know, people have been seeing some stuff. Uh, two, you know, going out, you know, fullon UFO disclosure. I I think there&#x27;s got to be some leadup uh, you know, there&#x27;s got to be some, um, something between those two things.</p>
<p>And there there&#x27;s not unless it&#x27;s this uh speech in May where he comes out and he says, &quot;You know what guys, you know, I have received some information and it has changed my opinion about all of this and I&#x27;m looking into it and I&#x27;m consolidating data and I will pre present a fuller picture in a a a larger speech in July.&quot; Now, do I think that&#x27;s going to happen? No, I do not. I do not expect Trump to come out with UFO disclosure um anytime in the near future if if at all. You know, if he does, I I would imagine he would save it toward the very end of his presidency. Uh after he&#x27;s accomplished or not accomplished whatever whatever there is on his his slate to do. Uh and he wouldn&#x27;t want anything to interfere with that.</p>
<p>So, um that that&#x27;s my thinking on all of this. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s going to do it. But Mark Christopher Lee has doubled down and now Larara Trump is doubling down and adding a wrinkle where she says that maybe she thinks oh that he has actually said this himself.
