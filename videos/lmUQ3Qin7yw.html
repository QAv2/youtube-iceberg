            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right uh hello everyone and welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel we look at theories of everything all-encompassing theories uh Magnum opuses from obscure authors ancient and modern and uh Paradigm shifters and really anything that can help you with your holistic approach to life uh things that you may never have heard of before um because they&#x27;ve been suppressed but they are overall beneficial to your life today is our 406th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson Larsson was an engineer who lived in the 20th century uh out in the Portland area mostly and around 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about the way the universe operated he took those two postulates over the next 30 Years and uh identified a theoretical universe so this is larsson&#x27;s Universe uh if his two postulates are correct then the universe would look like this is basically his theoretical universe and then he um compared his theoretical Universe to the uh you know the empirical universe of the Legacy scientist what they had measured in their Laboratories uh about um you know what the universe looks like and uh we&#x27;re going over one of his books uh right now just at the very beginning um called the basic properties of matter in this book Larson theoretically deres many of the basic properties of matter such as the boiling point and the melting point of of different elements and compounds and then he Compares those with the scientific tables that have already been established um and so it&#x27;s an interesting study but it&#x27;s a little bit difficult to get into uh as we found out yesterday we got uh we didn&#x27;t even get through the first paragraph because lson a lot of times targets uh in my opinion the wrong audience for his work and so he leaves behind if you&#x27;re kind of a lay person so I&#x27;m trying to take the role of having to have gone through this work before and um you know had to stop after every sentence to figure out what he was talking about um I&#x27;m trying to be somewhat of a guide here I think the first thing to do though is just to identify uh Larson&#x27;s two fundamental postulat so we know where he&#x27;s coming from basically Lars person is proposing a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy uh it is made out of motion in fact matter and energy are just merely kinds of motion and in particular Larsson is referring to a kind of motion that he refers to as scalar motion this is a kind of a non-localized more generalized motion of that that you would Envision if you were uh blowing up a balloon with dots on it all of the dots are moving away from each other as you blow up the balloon they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction so that&#x27;s a scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but it has no particular direction every dot is moving away from every other Dot and um so uh that is part of his uh first postulate the first postula is where U most of the action occurs um also uh with this universe of motion uh motion is U other people have arrived at that concept before the universe of motion but they weren&#x27;t able to make it work because they didn&#x27;t Define motion um and uh Larson defines motion as the relationship between space and time so that sets up a generalized Rel us reciprocal relationship between space and time and uh just like all reciprocals if you go if you need uh you know to um jog your memory about what a reciprocal is it&#x27;s from your math class in like fifth grade or something a reciprocal of three is 1/3 3 over 1 and 1 over 3 they both have the same entities in them but they&#x27;re in different order if you multiply them together you get one so 3 and 1/3 here we go again um sorry very much about this I&#x27;ve got to remember to stop doing this um every night I&#x27;m recording at the same time and I cannot figure out how to turn that alarm off I&#x27;m not trying very hard but um yeah I don&#x27;t have a lot of free time okay so um 3 and 1/3 uh 4 and 1/4 5 and 1/5 these are all reciprocals and so reciprocals have the the same qualities um but they&#x27;re in different order uh so too with space and time space and time um basically motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator time or space as the denominator um all of our scientific quantities are really forms of motion but motion can have three dimensions Larson calls that coordinate space coordinate time uh he he observed that space has three dimensions XYZ coordinates or volume in a still frame um and so by the reciprocal postulate he also postulates that time has three dimensions um in a still frame and so um you can get multi multiple dimensions in your really up to six um in your um time space um coordinates of a fraction in uh of scientific quantities for example um motion speed is space over time the bike is going 10 miles per hour 10 miles of space in 1 hour of time uh acceleration I drop the rock out the window it fell at 32 ft per second per second 32 ft of space uh 1 second per second of um time space over time squared uh turns out that uh energy is time over space took me 3 hours to move that thing one mile uh 3 hours of one uh 3 hours of time and one hour of uh 3 hours of time and one mile of space and uh ma matter turns out to be time to the thir power over space to the thir power um density time to the third power over space to the sixth power because density is matter over volume so time to the thir power over space to the thir power times 1 over uh times um one over space to the thir power um per volume space per volume or matter per volume uh and so on and so forth so um what we have is a system uh that is self-checking so you can check your equations and so on based on its base time coordinates um but you also um have what Larson calls clock time and clock space this is the scalar motion part um as we identified with the balloon space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart um but in no specific Direction same too with time time is always getting later and later and later and later but in no specific Direction so Larson refers to those as clock time and clock space then there is the uh aspect of uh of discreetness time and space only come in discret units they are quantized meaning that there is a minimum unit that you must have before you have anything you have to have a full unit of space and you have to have a full unit of time before you have space or time um if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time now again we said that space over time is speed if you have one unit of space and one unit of time you have what Larson calls unit speed 1 over 1 equals 1 but unit speed turns out to be the speed of light and this is the background speed of the universe the universe is always moving outward at the speed of light in all directions this is the empty Universe this is a universe with nothing in it um this is the zero point of larsson&#x27;s universe or the neutral point the null point the he calls it the progression of the natural reference system this is omnipresent always occurring um so this is a STK contrast from the um Legacy scientist Universe where they M make their measurements from zero motion Larsson makes his measurements from motion outward at the speed of light in all directions okay um that basically means half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light which LaRon calls the cosmic sector and half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light which LaRon calls a material sector within each sector there is also a sub region um because if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space that means that you are in time only So within the material sector Larsson has what he calls the time region and that is for atoms and molecules uh you know anything smaller than one unit of space which is 4.56 * 10us 8 um uh meters the unit of time is 1.52 * 10-6 seconds and in the cosmic sector you have what he calls the space region if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have uh if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time then you don&#x27;t have time and you only have space and so that is the space region and that is for Cosmic atoms or what other people would refer to as antimatter uh okay now um we started here reading this um chapter chapter one called solid cohesion so he&#x27;s referring to uh how different elements hold together in the solid state and um I guess we&#x27;ll just start at the beginning because we get didn&#x27;t get very far last time the consequences of the reversal of Direction in the context of the fixed reference system um okay that is the that is the uh Legacy science reference system the reversal of direction that takes place at unit distance okay that&#x27;s one unit of space were explained in a general way uh in volume one which is called Nothing But motion that&#x27;s another one of his books that we went over on this uh channel uh about six months ago and so um he&#x27;s talking about phenomena that are occurring within the time region in less than one unit of space and when you cross that boundary the rules invert uh the order of space and time invert just like when you cross into the cosmic sector the rules invert in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space in a still frame and you have clock time clock is always getting later and later and later when you cross that speed of light boundary then you move into the cosmic sector and you get um coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space space is always moving farther and farther and farther apart but within those sectors you have the time region and the space region and when you cross those boundaries the rules also invert again so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s talking about the reversal of direction that takes place at unit distance we&#x27;re explained in a general way as brought out there the most significance significant of these consequences is that the establishment of an equilibrium between gravitation and the progression of the natural reference system becomes possible okay so now the progression of the natural reference system we refer to as the movement outward at the speed of light in all directions and that uh you can kind of model with the scalar motion of an expanding balloon the balloon that you blow up all the dots are moving away from each other gravitation is the opposite of the progression gravitation is as if you sucked in the balloon all of the dots would be moving toward each other okay it the the force field of gravitation is a misnomer there is no field there not like one there&#x27;s no action at a distance uh there&#x27;s no um everything is being drawn to this one uh the center of the Earth or whatever uh there is just that each one of the locations is moving toward each other one of the locations okay so that is the essence of gravitation so these are opposite forces but between the full uh you know progression outward at this speed of light in uh all directions and then gravitation inward at the speed of light in all directions there is an an equilibrium that is um that is established uh and that is really what lar calls the interatomic distance now this same phenomena occurs outside the time region in the in the material sector uh as um what he calls the gravitational limit there is a location outside unit distance where the magnitudes of both of these motions are equal the distance that we are calling the gravitational limit that&#x27;s really for astronomical phenomena the sun um and that is an unstable that is an unstable uh limit it&#x27;s not an equilibrium it&#x27;s just an uh equality uh and um for the Sun the first gravitational limit is like 3.61 light years so uh within 3.61 Lighty years you tend you&#x27;re tending to move toward the sun if you get outside of that limit then you are going to be tending to move away from the Sun so it&#x27;s an unstable limit you either move toward it or you move away from it but within unit distance you&#x27;re talking about an equilibrium so here he says but this point of equality is not a point of equilibrium on the contrary it is a point of instability if there is even a slight unbalance of forces one way or the other the resulting motion accentuates the unbalance a small inward movement for instance strengthens the inward force of gravitation and thereby causes still further movement in the same direction similarly if a small outward movement occurs this weakness this weakens the gravitational force and causes further outward movement thus even though the Inward and outward motions are equal at the gravitational limit this is actually nothing but a point of demarcation between Inward and outward motion it is not a point of equilibrium now he gets back to the region inside unit distance in the region inside unit distance on the contrary the effect of so this is the time region the effect of any change in position opposes the unbalanced forces that produced the change if there is an excess gravitational force an outward motion occurs which weakens the gravitation and eliminates the unbalance if the gravitational force is not adequate to maintain a balance an inward motion takes place this increases the gravitational effect and restores the equilibrium unless there is some intervention by external forces atoms move gravitationally until they eventually come within unit distance of other atoms equilibrium is then established at positions Within this inside region the time region as we have called it okay so what you have to have to understand is that within the time region the the the there is a reversal of directions So within the time region the progression of the natural reference system is operating Inward and gravitation is op operating outward gravitation tends to move things toward unit distance and the progression tends to move things away from unit distance and in this case within unit [Music] distance the progression is going to move things closer and closer together because that is away from unit distance but in the outside region outside of the time region the progression is moving everything away from each other and also away from unit distance gravitation is moving things toward each other toward unit distance but inside the time region we have a reversal of directions so that is uh again kind of a misnomer of gravitation we think of gravitation as pulling the a atoms together but it&#x27;s actually the progression of the natural reference system that pulls atoms together and gravitation that pulls them apart these two forces arrive at an equilibrium and that equilibrium is what Larsson calls the interatomic distance he hasn&#x27;t gotten quite to that point yet the condition in which a number of atoms occupy equilibrium positions of this kind in an aggregate is known as the solid state of matter the distance between such positions is the interatomic distance a distinctive feature of each particular material substance that we will examine in detail in the following chapter so the next chapter chapter 2 here we&#x27;re talking about solid cohesion so you know we&#x27;re on the same on the same track displacement of the equilibrium in either direction can be accomplished only by the application of a force of some kind and a solid structure resists either an inward force a compression or an outward force a tension to the extent that resistance to tension operates to prevent separation of the atoms of a solid it is commonly known as the force of Co cesion so cohesion is the resistance of tension so the tension tends to pull the atoms away from each other and cohesion is the resistance to that Force the conclusions with respect to the nature and origin of atomic cohesion that have been reached in this work replace a familiar Theory based on Al together different premises this previously accepted hypothesis the electrical theory of matter has already had some consideration in the preceding volume but since the new explanation of the nature of the co uh of the cohesive force is basic to the present development some more extensive comparisons of the two conflicting viewpoints will be in order before we proceed to develop the new theoretical structure in Greater detail okay now Larson is going to go into kind of a history of science approach where he&#x27;s going to look at this electric theory of matter which is the prevailing theory of matter um and kind of poke holes in it show how it&#x27;s not as uh infallible as you might think um and then eventually he&#x27;s going to show how his theory of cohesion is superior to this electric theory of matter okay so the electrical I hope you get an appreciation of how difficult this is for Larson he&#x27;s having to explain so many things at once just to get you kind of up to speed so you know you can complain about maybe the way he&#x27;s writing or how he&#x27;s overlooking certain things or how he&#x27;s not explaining certain things or passing over certain things but it&#x27;s a very difficult job to write Paradigm shifting uh material because the audience that you&#x27;re you know that you&#x27;re going uh for it it needs to uh get up to speed and in many cases they also need to unlearn what they&#x27;ve already learned so you know Larson is facing a Garg uan task here um you know we&#x27;re still on the second page and you know he&#x27;s already had to uh navigate about 10 different uh difficult um Maneuvers as far as you know writing is concerned and conveying his message okay so now he&#x27;s going to get into the electrical theory of matter the electrical or electronic theory postulates that the atoms of matter of solid matter are electrically charged and that their cohesion is due to the attraction between unlike charges the principal support for the Theory comes from the behavior of ionic compounds in a solution a certain proportion of the molecules of such compounds split up or dissociate into oppositely charged components which are then called ions the presence of the of the charges can be explained in either of two ways one the charges were present but undetectable in the undissolved material or two they were created uh in the solution process the adherence of the electrical Theory based on explanation one at the time this explanation was originally formulated electric charges were thought to be relatively permanent entities and the conclusion with respect to their role in the solution process was therefore quite in keeping with contemporary scientific thought in the meantime however it has been found that electric charges are easily created and easily destroyed and are no more than a transient Fe feature of matter this cuts the ground from under the main support of the electrical Theory but the theory has persisted because of the lack of any available alternative obviously some kind of a force must hold the solid aggregate together outside of the forces known to result directly from observable motion there are only three kinds of force of which there has her to for been any definite observable knowledge gravitational electric and magnetic the so-called forces which play various roles in present day Atomic physics are purely hypothetical of the three known forces the only one that appears to be strong enough to account for cohesion of solids is the electric force the general tendency in scientific circles has therefore been to take the stand that cohesion must result from the operation of electrical forces notwithstanding the lack of any corroboration of the conclusions reached on the basis of the solution process and the existence of strong evidence against the validity of those conclusions one of the serious objections to this electrical theory of cohesion is that it is not actually a theory but a patchwork of a patchwork collection of theories a number of different explanations are Advanced for what it is in all appearances the same problem for what it is to all appearances the same problem in its basic form the theory is applicable only to a restricted class of substances the so-called ionic compounds but the great majority of compounds are not ionic where the hypothetical ions are clearly non-existent an electrical force between ions cannot be called upon to explain the cohesion so as one of the general chemistry uh tests on the author&#x27;s shelves uh texts on the uh author shelves puts it quote a different theory was required to account for the formulation of these compounds end quote but this different Theory based on the weird concept of electrons shared by the interacting atoms is still not adequate to deal with all of the nonionic compounds and a variety of additional explanations are called upon to fill in the gaps okay I think uh okay we&#x27;re going to go one more paragraph here in current chemical parlance the necessity of of admitting that each of these different explanations is actually another theory of cohesion is avoided by calling them different types of bonds between the atoms the hypothetical bonds are then described in terms of interaction of electrons so that the theories are united in language even though widely Divergent in content as noted in chapter 19 volume one a half dozen or so different types of bonds have been postulated together with hybrid bonds which combine features of the general types okay so uh I think he stated the problem here um more or less that this electrical theory of matter does not uh [Music] explain nonionic compounds you have things like any a and you know you have uh that&#x27;s an ionic compound but there&#x27;s a bazillion of other kinds of compounds that do not rely on this kind of electrical um veilance type of situation um and they are still explained under this electrical theory of matter uh he&#x27;s going to get go into that a lot more but it&#x27;s I think uh I was very much struck by this when I first read it many years ago just how uh laughable this uh electrical theory of matter was in terms of explaining um all these different kinds of chemical bonding and that the vast majority of them have uh very very little to do with veence uh at least you know electrical veilance the way that I learned it when I was in chemistry class or whatever so uh Lars will get into that a little bit more tomorrow and uh I think you get to see um the way he kind of picks apart the um uh Legacy Theory and then he&#x27;s going to uh eventually uh show how his his uh approach is superior um all right well uh thanks for tuning in today and have a great day</p>
