            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Nicola Tesla sits alone in his suite at the New Yorker Hotel. He&#x27;s frail, old, but his mind as sharp as ever. Papers are scattered across his desk. Equations no one else understands. Diagrams of circuits and energy fields that shouldn&#x27;t exist.</p>
<p>Not yet. He&#x27;s writing furiously, eyes darting toward the door every few moments. He knows he&#x27;s being watched. He&#x27;s known for years. Outside in the hallway, men in dark suits stand by the door waiting.</p>
<p>They weren&#x27;t just there to watch him. They were there to erase him. Because Tesla isn&#x27;t just working on any invention. He&#x27;s working on something that could change everything. He claims to have found a way to extract limitless energy from the very fabric of space itself.</p>
<p>An infinite power source. Free energy available to anyone anywhere. A discovery that would render oil, coal, and even nuclear power obsolete. And then Tesla is gone. Dead.</p>
<p>Found in his room on January 7th, 1943. Within hours, the FBI moves in. They seized his notes, his research, everything. Officially, it was for national security. Unofficially, it was because Tesla had discovered something they couldn&#x27;t allow to exist.</p>
<p>The most powerful energy source in the universe, suppressed before it could ever see the light of day. But here&#x27;s the real question. Did Tesla actually crack the code of 0 energy? And if so, where did his research go? Because some say it wasn&#x27;t lost, some say it&#x27;s been hidden, and some say it&#x27;s already being used. Hey folks, before we dive deeper, quick favor, please. If you want more stories like this, the kind that slip through the cracks and barely survive the algorithm, please help me by subscribing.</p>
<p>No fluff, no sponsors, just weird truths most channels won&#x27;t touch. All right, back into it. [Music] There are two versions of history. The one you read in textbooks and the one they don&#x27;t want you to know. Nicola Tesla was supposed to be remembered as one of the greatest minds of all time.</p>
<p>And yet today he&#x27;s a footnote, a name attached to electric cars and coil experiments. While others took credit for the real revolution he started. He gave us alternating current, the very thing that powers your home. He invented the Tesla coil, pioneering wireless energy transfer. He envisioned radio waves, X-rays, and remote control decades before they became reality.</p>
<p>and he was on the verge of creating wireless global electricity, free, untethered power for all. But here&#x27;s where things get interesting. Tesla&#x27;s biggest backer, JP Morgan. Yes, that JP Morgan, the banking titan who controlled more wealth than entire nations. He initially funded Tesla&#x27;s Warden Cliff Tower, a project that if completed could have provided wireless electricity to the world.</p>
<p>But Tesla made one mistake. He told Morgan the truth. This energy couldn&#x27;t be metered. No wires, no power grids, no profit. Morgan pulled the funding overnight.</p>
<p>And just like that, the tower was abandoned. Tesla&#x27;s experiments were shut down. His reputation systematically destroyed. His ideas were labeled impossible until others repackaged them years later. His inventions were stolen, copied, and patented by competitors.</p>
<p>His final projects erased. When Tesla died in 1943, penniless and alone, the FBI immediately seized his papers under the guise of national security. They weren&#x27;t looking for radio patents. They were looking for something else. Because Tesla wasn&#x27;t just playing with electricity.</p>
<p>He had discovered something bigger. A new form of energy. One that if it worked would have broken the world as we know it. And that brings us to the most dangerous idea of all. 0 point energy.</p>
<p>Energy can&#x27;t be created or destroyed. That&#x27;s the first law of thermodynamics. But what if it&#x27;s wrong? Or worse, what if we&#x27;ve only been told part of the truth? For centuries, scientists believed that space, true space, was an empty void. a cold, dead nothingness stretching between planets and stars. But then quantum physics changed everything.</p>
<p>When physicists looked closer at the empty vacuum of space, they found it wasn&#x27;t empty at all. Instead, it was teeming with energy, a sthing, invisible ocean of power bubbling beneath the surface of reality itself. Even in the coldest, darkest corners of space, something was there. a force, small but everpresent. This wasn&#x27;t science fiction.</p>
<p>It was measurable. It was real. In 1948, physicists Kendrick Casemir and Dirk Per conducted an experiment proving that two uncharged metal plates placed extremely close together in a vacuum would be pushed together by something. That something 0 point energy. It meant that even in a complete vacuum, there was still a force at play.</p>
<p>One that mainstream physics couldn&#x27;t fully explain. If we could tap into it, it would be limitless. Infinite energy. Energy that doesn&#x27;t rely on oil, coal, nuclear reactions, or anything we currently control. Now, who wouldn&#x27;t want that answer? the people who profit off the energy we already have.</p>
<p>Because while 0 point energy was being studied quietly in physics labs, something else was happening behind the scenes. Tesla, one of the greatest inventors in human history, claimed to have found a way to access it. And just like that, his work disappeared. According to recovered notes and testimonies, Tesla was experimenting with a device capable of extracting energy from quantum vacuum. He called it the radiant energy device, a mechanism that could pull allegedly unlimited electricity from the air itself.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t burn fuel. It didn&#x27;t need massive power plants. And it wasn&#x27;t just theoretical. Tesla demonstrated it working. This wasn&#x27;t some garage tinker project.</p>
<p>It scared the most powerful people on Earth. And then Tesla&#x27;s funding was cut. His research was seized. And when he died, the government classified his work under national security. The official reason? They claimed his research was inconclusive.</p>
<p>And yet, classified documents from the 1950s and beyond show that the military never stopped looking into it. So, here&#x27;s the question. If 0 point energy doesn&#x27;t work, why has it been one of the most heavily classified topics in modern science? And if it does work, why haven&#x27;t we seen it? The answer might be the most dangerous truth of all. Because this isn&#x27;t just about science anymore. This is about control.</p>
<p>[Music] Energy isn&#x27;t just power, it&#x27;s control. Wars have been fought over oil. Empires have risen and fallen over resources, and every major advancement in human history has been shaped by who controls the energy. But what happens when energy itself becomes free? That&#x27;s the nightmare scenario for the people in charge. Let&#x27;s break it down.</p>
<p>If Tesla really cracked 0 energy, then the biggest threat wasn&#x27;t the technology itself. It was the idea that the world wouldn&#x27;t need those in power anymore. Let&#x27;s look at big oil and energy corporations. If energy became free, trillions of dollars in infrastructure, investments, and profits would collapse overnight. The military-industrial complex, wars over energy wouldn&#x27;t just become obsolete.</p>
<p>The entire power structure of global conflicts would shift. governments and economies. Countries that control oil and energy exports would lose their leverage, their wealth, and their geopolitical dominance. Now, let&#x27;s take a step back and look at what actually happened to Tesla&#x27;s research. January 7th, 1943, Nicola Tesla dies alone in a New York hotel room.</p>
<p>Within hours, FBI agents storm in and seize every scrap of paper from his office. Officially, the government claims Tesla&#x27;s work was dangerous but ultimately useless. Unofficially, his most important research disappears into classified archives. And then just a few years later, classified military documents show deep interest in 0oint energy technology. So, which is it? Was Tesla a harmless old man with useless ideas, or was he sitting on something so powerful that the government couldn&#x27;t let it slip through their fingers? Because here&#x27;s where things get interesting.</p>
<p>The US government denies it has made progress on zero point energy, but leaked documents, whistleblower testimony, and unclassified patents say otherwise. In the 1950s, Project Winterhaven explored electrogravitic propulsion that suspicially mirror zero point energy theories. In 1988, NASA scientist Paul Lavolet reported that military-funded experiments were testing propulsion systems that used exotic energy sources not found in public science. In 1996, Boeing&#x27;s Phantom Works division conducted classified studies on quantum vacuum energy extraction. And then in 2019, a Navy patent surfaced describing a device that pulls energy from the vacuum of space.</p>
<p>The exact concept Tesla proposed over a 100red years earlier. Every time someone gets close, the research disappears, goes black, or gets labeled as pseudocience. But here&#x27;s the real kicker. If this technology does exist, why haven&#x27;t they unleashed it? There are only two reasons 0 point energy wouldn&#x27;t be made public. It doesn&#x27;t work and all the leaked documents, military patents, and classified experiments mean nothing.</p>
<p>Or it does work and the people in control know that the second it&#x27;s released, the entire world will change. Because 0 energy wouldn&#x27;t just replace oil and electricity. It would make cars, planes, and rockets obsolete. It would end power shortages overnight. It would remove anyone&#x27;s ability to charge you for energy.</p>
<p>No more gas bills, no more electric grids, no more control, which means the people who run the world would no longer be needed. And that, oh no, that&#x27;s the real reason this research stays buried. Science should be about discovery, about pushing boundaries, about unlocking the unknown for the good of humanity. But when it comes to zero point energy, the price of knowledge isn&#x27;t just professional exile. It&#x27;s eraser.</p>
<p>Because anyone who gets too close disappears. Let&#x27;s start with the obvious. Nicola Tesla, 1943, dies alone. FBI sees this as research. His most advanced work never seen again.</p>
<p>Dr. Eugene Malow, 2004, MIT scientist and journalist who fought to expose suppressed energy technology found beaten to death under suspicious circumstances. Stan Meyer, 1998, inventor of the water powered car, claimed to have created a self-sustaining energy device, suddenly dies after a meeting with investors. His last words, they poisoned me. Dr.</p>
<p>Paul Brown, 2002, physicist working on advanced nuclear energy systems, dies in a freak car accident before presenting his findings. Thomas Townson Brown, 1985, developed anti-gravity and vacuum energy research, labeled a fraud, discredited, and left in obscurity. And these are just the most well doumented cases. Now, sure, coincidences happen. People die, accidents occur.</p>
<p>But when every scientist exploring a certain technology either vanishes, dies suddenly, or gets ruined beyond recognition, at what point does it stop being coincidence? Let&#x27;s break this down. When someone starts uncovering zero point energy, the pattern looks like this. Step one, debunk and discredit. Label them a conspiracy theorist. Use media to mock their research.</p>
<p>Step two, buy it out. If the tech works, corporations swoop in, buy the patents, and lock them away. Step three, bury it in bureaucracy. If they won&#x27;t sell, legal problems suddenly appear. Funding dries up.</p>
<p>Government agencies make life impossible. Step four, make them disappear. If all else fails, the scientist either dies under mysterious circumstances or retires, never speaking of their research again. This has been the game for over a century. But here&#x27;s where things get really interesting.</p>
<p>In 2014, aerospace executive Dr. Steve Greer revealed that classified military projects were already working on zero point energy. He claimed that at least two defense contractors had developed working prototypes but would never release them. In 2019, a former Loheed Martin engineer stated that blackbudget programs have been decades ahead of public energy technology. We&#x27;ve had the situation.</p>
<p>You just won&#x27;t ever see it. He said multiple leaked patents from the US Navy show designs for space time manipulation, vacuum energy extraction in inertialess propulsion. And here&#x27;s the kicker. The patent applications claim the technology is already operable. Let that sink in.</p>
<p>Not theoretical, not experimental, operable. Which means the technology already exists. which means the only reason it&#x27;s not being used is because someone decided you shouldn&#x27;t have it. Now, this isn&#x27;t just about technology. It&#x27;s about control.</p>
<p>Because if Tesla was right, if 0 point energy can be accessed, then why are we still burning oil? Why are we still dependent on finite resources when the universe offers infinite power? And most importantly, who made the decision that you don&#x27;t get to know? [Music] When we think of the pyramids of Giza, we imagine tombs, monuments, or symbols of a longlost civilization&#x27;s ingenuity. But what if they were something else entirely? What if they weren&#x27;t just structures, but machines? power generators, energy hubs, evidence that ancient civilizations understood 0 point energy long before we even had a name for it. Let&#x27;s take a look at the evidence that changes everything. Granite and quartz conductivity. The inner chambers of the Great Pyramid are made from high concentrations of granite and quartz, both of which are highly conductive materials capable of producing pisoctric energy.</p>
<p>when subjected to pressure or vibration. Then there&#x27;s the missing capstone. Ancient text suggests that the pyramid&#x27;s capstone was once made of gold, one of the best conductors of electricity. If the pyramid was designed to harness and focus energy, the gold capstone would have been its central conduit. Then the underground water connection.</p>
<p>Beneath the Great Pyramid is an aquifer, a moving body of water. Moving water generates electromagnetic energy just like in modern hydroelect electric power plants. Could the pyramid have been using water flow to generate power? Nicola Tesla&#x27;s connection Tesla&#x27;s Warden cliff tower was based on the principle of wireless energy transmission using the natural electrical conductivity of the earth itself. Some researchers believe the Great Pyramid was designed for the exact same purpose. Not to store bodies, but to store and transmit power.</p>
<p>If this is true, then it means ancient civilizations had access to free unlimited energy. And it means the knowledge of 0 point energy isn&#x27;t new. It&#x27;s been known for millennia. Which begs the real question, where did it go? If the ancient world had free energy, why don&#x27;t we? Was it lost due to natural disaster, a civilization ending event? Was it stolen and hidden away by those who wanted to maintain control? Or was it deliberately erased by those who benefited from a world powered by scarcity? And here&#x27;s the kicker. The ancient pyramids are scattered all over the world.</p>
<p>Egypt, China, Meso America, even underwater near Japan. They all share suspiciously similar designs. They all align with specific celestial markers. And yet somehow every single one of these civilizations forgot what they were for. What are the odds of that? Or maybe they didn&#x27;t forget.</p>
<p>Maybe someone made sure they never had the chance to remember. And if ancient civilizations figured this out before, then that means 0 point energy isn&#x27;t the future. It&#x27;s the past. A past we were never supposed to uncover. [Music] Okay, we&#x27;ve connected the dots.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve followed the hidden trail. We&#x27;ve uncovered what Tesla started and what was taken from him. But that leads us to the biggest question of all. What happens next? Because if 0 point energy is real, if it&#x27;s already being developed, if it&#x27;s already being suppressed, then we&#x27;re looking at the single greatest cover up in human history. And here&#x27;s the terrifying part.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not just about energy. It&#x27;s about control. Imagine a world where energy is free. No more power grids. No more monopolies.</p>
<p>No more dependence on fossil fuels. No more manufactured scarcity. No more wars fought over oil and resources. No more corporations holding the world hostage for profit. Sounds utopian, right? Sounds like something humanity deserves, right? Now, imagine what happens when the people who profit from control realize they&#x27;re about to lose it.</p>
<p>Wars don&#x27;t start by accident. Global crises don&#x27;t just happen. Technological revolutions don&#x27;t get buried for no reason. If you had the key to limitless energy, but releasing it meant dismantling the entire power structure of the world, would you be allowed to? So, here we are. A world running on outdated energy because we&#x27;re told there&#x27;s no other way.</p>
<p>A history full of mysterious deaths and missing discoveries. a past that whispers of lost knowledge and hidden truths. And the only real question left is what would happen if we finally broke free? Because here&#x27;s the thing, they can suppress an idea. They can silence the scientists. They can erase the evidence.</p>
<p>But they can&#x27;t stop the truth from slipping through the cracks. And maybe that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re here. Because you know something&#x27;s wrong. Because you feel it in your gut. Because deep down you understand this world was never meant to be built on limits.</p>
<p>It was meant to be built on possibility. The only question left is how long will you let them keep it from you? [Music] Thanks for watching.
