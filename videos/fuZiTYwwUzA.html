            <p>all right hello I&#x27;m Thomas uh welcome to my channel I do educational videos uh we are on the 60th video of uh covering the reciprocal system of theory of Dewey B Larson Larson arrived at this Theory uh starting in about 1930 took him about 20 25 years to develop it into its full-blown Theory of Everything came out with this first uh two fundamental postulates uh the most uh the gist of it is that um the universe is not made out of matter the universe is not made out of energy but the universe is made out of motion both matter and energy are forms of motion and uh motion is uh particularly scalar motion no emotion with no Direction but just magnitude and that motion exists in three dimensions three scalar dimensions and also in uh discrete units and represented by two reciprocal aspects space and time motion motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other meaning that they are the same except that they uh are have flipped roles and so uh they both have the same qualities uh being three or four dimensional uh and also progressing time progresses but space does too space has three and I would say or four dimensions and time goes too um now they have them in different Realms and the Realms are divided by the speed of light whereas Einstein says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson says that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe or the neutral point and there is a half of the universe that moves faster than the speed of light as as well as the half that we&#x27;re familiar with that is moving slower than the speed of light he calls the slower than the speed of light um the cosmic or the material sector and sector one and he calls the faster than the speed of light the sector 2 or the cosmic sector and um bodies in the material sector grow by aggregation by you know grouping each other you know upon each other glomming onto each other and until they reach their most complicated complex form which is DNA and then uh at that point the DNA becomes eligible to be taken over by a sector 2 component which is a control unit just in the same way that a thermostat controls the room a sector two component even though it&#x27;s just a minor component of the overall sector one uh and sector two combination uh it serves to control the environment and that is what Larson calls the life unit so the life unit is a combination of a slower than the speed of light and if faster than the speed of light unit in the right combination in the right configuration and then life itself uh evolves uh in the direction of complexity until it gets to its most complex which is the intelligent human being and then the intelligent human being becomes eligible to be controlled by a sector 3 unit and sector three is the area generalized area outside uh really outside of the universe or independent of space and time or possibly just that boundary that speed of light boundary uh where all the relativistic stuff goes to zero and um that sector three is really what he calls the metaphysical region Beyond physical and that is kind of what he&#x27;s writing about in this his final book called beyond space and time that we&#x27;re focusing on uh here this is I think the 38th episode uh working on his book beyond space and time we&#x27;re in chapter 14 that is called thinking and memory uh we just got done with a few chapters on communication and that&#x27;s communication from sector three sector three communicates with humans uh in various forms such as ESP intuition scientific insight and religious Revelation those are all uh what Larson says our Communications from sector three but here we&#x27;re talking about thinking and memory and these are really sector two processes but they have sector three implications because the prerequisite for sector three uh contact is an intelligent human being so the human being needs to be able to think and to remember uh really uh as Larson says here you cannot uh think without memory memory is a prerequisite for thinking and then thinking is the prerequisite for intelligence that&#x27;s needed uh for the intelligent human being to be eligible for control by sector 3. and so here toward the end of chapter 14 uh he&#x27;s talking about dreaming and that dreaming is the result of the fact that both the thinking and the memory are uh need to be um detached and rewound uh periodically because they get out of sync and when they get out of sync they need to be rewound but the thinking is more complicated than the memory and so the thinking takes longer to rewind than the memory does and so there&#x27;s a period where both of them are rewinding it calls that non-rem and then there&#x27;s a period where just one of them uh the thinking is rewind rewinding and the memory is already done and so it&#x27;s kind of like idling and at that point that is what he calls REM sleep dreaming and uh now he&#x27;s uh he&#x27;s going uh toward the end of the chapter talking about the purpose of dreaming talks about uh Freud uh Freud regarded the dream as a safety valve which relieves the mind of harmful material by allowing it to be expressed during sleep our theoretical findings are that what it exists is a need for sleep in order to synchronize the processes of the mind with the structure of the brain the mind is the sector two component the brain is the sector one component and they work together because the life unit is is the two put together um the need to separate memory from the thinking mechanism during a portion of the synchronization process in order to allow the thinking mechanism to continue the adjustment process for a time after the synchronation synchronization of the memory is complete that&#x27;s kind of a typical Larson sentence there um you have to read it five times before you can figure out what he says but uh he&#x27;s precise with this language but it just goes on and on thus the only need for anything other than sleep itself is for the correct proportion of REM sleep to Total Sleep the dreams occur not because they are needed but because they are part of the normal physiological activity during the sleep that is needed the general nature of the dream process in the non-rem state is the same as in REM sleep but the thinking mechanism and the memory are connected to each other during the non-rem dreaming and both are disconnected from the environment the non-rem dreams are there for subject to control by the thinking process and this super and the thinking process serves kind of as a sensor it sensors out all things that are kind of like not logical um this supervision eliminates most of the Inc incongruities of the type that is characteristic of the REM dreams and makes the non-rem dreams more like the mental processes during the waking state uh one expert caused the more plausible and more like thinking and less like dreaming attributes which can be expected in view of the participation of the thinking mechanism in shaping the dream experience uh more concerned with our contemporary lives but as we will see in the next chapter which is called the stuff of Dreams the REM dreams are likewise concerned with the Contemporary experience the difference is that the connection between the REM dreams and the experience is less obvious another reason for the greater plausibility of the non-rem dreams is that more of them are direct recall of experiences the factors that determine the extent to which direct recall occurs during dreams are the same for both kinds of sleep and consequently there is no difference in the initial probability of such recall but since the REM um dream is not subject to censorship the original result of the association process whatever it may be has to be accepted remember uh he talks about this earlier in the chapter that memory operates upon Association okay um apparently there&#x27;s about one chance in five that uncontrolled Association will retrieve the actual experience from the memory storage as studies indicate that not more than 20 percent of the REM dreams are of the direct recall type in the non-rem dreams the thinking process sensors the memory uh produced from Storage if a memory called up by association is incongruous it is rejected and another Association is called for in most cases the direct memory is reached somewhere along the line of this trial and rejection process and the direct memory content of the non-rem dreams has found to be 80 or more in this respect the research findings coincide with the theoretical conclusions there is less agreement however between the theory and the views of the investigators with respect to the other aspects of the thinking process during sleep um okay I lost my place there sorry um okay now he he talks about uh a few of the different experts um problem solving one of the forms of thinking um is theoretically Possible only if all of the necessary components of the solution are present in memories and the only requirement is to put them together in the proper manner or to experience one of those flashes of insight uh discussed in chapter nine one of the communications uh from sector three in most cases all the information is not present in the memory storage furthermore the thinking during the dream is not able to make a full use of the information that is actually contained in the storage as the many aids to directed thinking that are available in the waking state are lacking in dreams such as tabular and graphic representation um theoretical results also throw considerable cold water on the idea of the unconscious mind introduced by Freud the memory storage is outside our Consciousness except when we have occasion to recall some item or when such an item is called up by the Association process it is no doubt possible for long varied memories which we would not recall in the ordinary course of events to be brought out by association in dreams under hypnosis but the idea that these experiences can affect the life of the individual without being called up from Storage is hard to reconcile with the theoretical findings uh this analysis indicates that the emotions or Sensations which disturb the trouble troubled individual are not generated by The Forgotten experiences but by the experiences or some aspects of the experiences which he wants to forget but cannot and again I talked about this earlier uh Larson&#x27;s uh use of the word forgetting um now if you have more of kind of a new age perspective or whatever uh uh more mystical perspective uh you&#x27;re thinking of the akashic records and that we don&#x27;t ever really forget anything nothing is forgotten permanently um but Larson is really kind of saying that forgetting is an important uh ability to be able to be able to forget you know kind of like maybe a defensive back in football needs to have a short memory because uh they get beat they they can&#x27;t let it get to them um and in the same way he&#x27;s saying that uh you know uh you&#x27;re not uh the uncut you know the the unconscious of Freud that is just their kind of uh turning into the uh nightmares and turning into all kinds of uh things if they&#x27;re if the unconscious memories aren&#x27;t dealt with uh Larson is really saying the opposite that there is no suppression of emotions or anything like that that they are um actually by continuing to continuing to circulate those memories is where you can get into trouble so uh and Pratt Perrette is not a Freudian but he strongly disagrees with Larson on many of these matters and we will get to that at a certain point okay this is the I think this is about the last page here of this so let&#x27;s try to finish this chapter in general the various devices that the psychoanalysts use to accomplish what they regard as dredging up items from the unconscious such things as free association dream interpretation and hypnotism can equally well be regarded as means to circumvent the subject&#x27;s unwillingness to reveal his conscious knowledge of these matters but it may be that the knowledge of which the subject is conscious is so vague and general that he is unable to reveal it as noted earlier experiences are not usually retained in the memory storage in such a way that they are subject to recall in their entirety on demand ordinarily certain features items of information mainly are abstracted and kept available for recall while the remaining details are gradually forgotten and I would just say more like gradually covered over they&#x27;re still there though you can&#x27;t like forget I just don&#x27;t I just don&#x27;t buy that you can just forget something and then it&#x27;s just poof it&#x27;s just gone it you can get buried um but anyway going on but the retained features are not necessarily useful items for example the original experience may have been accompanied by a feeling of anxiety if the memory process in the memory process an association may be set up between this anxiety and some person or object X that played a part in the experience future contacts with X or something associated with X May then result in recall of the anxiety sensation without the individual being aware of what has happened he simply feels anxiety without knowing why if he is emotionally susceptible he may prolong the memory by frequent recall even without any additional contact with x the view of the situation indicates that the analysts procedure in attempting to identify the original experience as the first step toward correcting the abnormal mental condition is probably sound if the association between the anxiety and X can be identified it can probably be broken by some means by some means so that the recurring anxiety stimulus is eliminated but the Freudian belief that the trouble is due to items that are present in an unconscious mind does not agree with our theoretical findings it is not what has been forgotten our Theory tells us it is that aspect of the original experience that has not been forgotten the original circumstances The Experience itself may have been forgotten but Sensations are remembered as well as experiences and a certain kind of stimulus may call up a disturbing memory that lingers on as a residue of the Forgotten experience okay that is the end of the chapter um and again uh I have to kind of think about this a little bit more but um I think he&#x27;s making an assumption that we can forget something that they&#x27;re not literally still there and I I do think that certain uh mystical uh occult or esoteric practices uh have taught us how to recall uh those very very deep uh you know embedded memories that are that we never thought we could remember but they&#x27;re still there but um I think his main point is that he&#x27;s not we don&#x27;t want to be dredging those up because that&#x27;s where the problem comes from and that kind of makes sense because uh Freud was a um as far as I know you know kind of like a cabal member and uh he was uh kind of like a Chaos Agent and so he might have been attempting to you know trick us all into be being dredging up our problems to keep them current you know so keep them in the mix so that they&#x27;re always haunting us um but I&#x27;m not sure about all that you know I I do think that you know there can be some kinds of suppression but I do think that uh um you know at a certain point you kind of just leave well enough alone [Music] um there may be ways to work out your suppression they have to be pretty uh systematic and um Freud&#x27;s version of it it seems like it&#x27;s just kind of like dabbling to me so uh tell me if you disagree and otherwise have a great day and we will see you next time with the stuff of Dreams</p>
