            <p>[Music] all right so buckle up because we&#x27;re diving into a topic that&#x27;s like a UFO conspiracy theorists dream come true we&#x27;re talking anti-gravity government secrets and a scientist who disappeared I got to say this deep dive request really grabbed my attention yeah it&#x27;s one of those stories that leaves you with more questions than answers that&#x27;s for sure you&#x27;re kidding so we&#x27;re digging into the rumors about this Chinese scientist maybe cracked anti-gravity back in the 90s her name is Dr ning Lee and let me tell you the pieces of this puzzle are wild we&#x27;re talking published research papers claims of functional anti-gravity devices you know to really get a handle on this we had to talk about anti-gravity itself for a second I mean it&#x27;s usually something you hear about in Sci-Fi movies right sure but the idea has been bouncing around in physics for decades think about it right what if we could just mess with gravity like we do with electricity seriously that would be absolutely insane like our whole understanding of the universe would be flipped on its head exactly Transportation space travel everything would change overnight I mean forget flying cars for a second although those would be awesome imagine trains zipping around faster than ever using almost no energy or just hopping into your own personal aircraft we&#x27;re talking about a total transformation okay okay I&#x27;m with you on the changing the World Part yeah but here&#x27;s the thing that really gets me Dr Leia wasn&#x27;t just thinking about this stuff she was actually building it or at least that&#x27;s what she said we&#x27;re talking about actual anti-gravity devices yeah and she was publishing papers about them up until the late 90s now whether those devices actually worked that&#x27;s a whole other can of worms but the thing is people were taking her seriously and not just anyone you&#x27;re talking about big names and physics right exactly some Heavy Hitters and it wasn&#x27;t just the Science World either because in 99 Dr Lou she just up and leaves her university job starts her own company called AC gravity and get this they get funding from the US Department of Defense that&#x27;s right and that little detail that&#x27;s huge I mean it tells you that someone in the US government someone who knows their way around Cutting Edge Tech they saw something real in Dr Lee&#x27;s research they thought it was worth investing in and that&#x27;s not something you see every day I mean think about it we&#x27;re talking about potentially changing how we understand physics the applications could be mind-blowing right makes you wonder what they saw in our work and if it even worked at all and here&#x27;s where things get even weirder after 2002 Dr Leah she just vanishes yeah like Off the Grid no more papers no conference appearances strange you mentioned earlier that some big names in physics were taking her work seriously but did anybody try to like replicate her experiments that&#x27;s the thing there&#x27;s no proof that anybody actually managed to replicate her work some scientists they pointed out some holes in her theories but others they said her research was just way too ahead of its time maybe even you know deliberately buried Okay so we&#x27;ve got the scientists on the edge of a massive breakthrough potentially backed by the US government government and then poof gone I&#x27;m starting to see why you requested this deep dive yeah and there are a few more details like little breadcrumbs in the story the sources they mentioned her being at a conference in 2003 still linked to the dod but after that nothing mhm then in 2021 an obituary pops up online but it barely mentions anything about her life or work after like the early 2000s wow so they kept her on the down low even after all those years that&#x27;s really strange yeah and that&#x27;s where things get really interesting I mean historically there have been tons of times when scientific discoveries were just completely hushed up buried by governments you know for National Security and all that like remember the atomic bomb developed in total secrecy during the war and even after it was over the information was super tightly controlled so are you saying Dr Lee might have stumbled onto something so big so gamechanging that it had to be kept Under Wraps it&#x27;s definitely a possibility I mean imagine if her anti-gravity research actually worked think about the military applications aircraft that can move in ways we can&#x27;t even imagine weapon systems that use gravity itself that&#x27;s a whole new ball game that&#x27;s both incredibly exciting and totally terrifying at the same time but what about the Chinese government I mean she was originally from China right could they have been involved in her disappearance oh absolutely that&#x27;s a huge Theory especially with how things are between countries these days if Dr Lee had really made a breakthrough it makes sense that the Chinese government would want her back you know with all their research and expertise especially with anti-gravity Tech having the potential to completely change the global balance of power I we&#x27;re already in a tech race but this would be on another level exactly and one of the sources I read it actually quotes an expert who says flat out that the Chinese are most likely to develop this technology first now that&#x27;s a pretty bold statement don&#x27;t you think to just come out and say publicly yeah it&#x27;s like he&#x27;s hinting at something like he knows more than he&#x27;s letting on this is like something out of a spy movie it really is and here&#x27;s where it gets even more interesting remember you were talking about UFOs what is some of those unexplained sightings the ones that just don&#x27;t make sense they&#x27;re actually this technology in action maybe super Advanced drones using prototypes based on Dr Lee&#x27;s research whoa that is a wild thought so you&#x27;re saying there&#x27;s a chance that one country already has this technology and they could be using it for surveillance or even military operations and nobody would even know you know it&#x27;s kind of mind-blowing to think that this Tech might already be out there somewhere even if it&#x27;s top secret right it&#x27;s like this weird mix of excitement and fear at the same time and speaking a fear you mentioned the Zar bomba earlier feels like a bit of a jump from Dr Liz and anti-gravity but I&#x27;m guessing the saas bring it up for a reason definitely the Zar bomba that hydrogen bomb the Soviets tested back in &#x27; 61 it&#x27;s like this Stark reminder of just how much destruction were capable of unleashing I mean it was way more powerful than anything used in World War II the shock wave literally went around the world yeah the sources mentioned that kind of power being used to create tsunamis imagine entire cities just wiped out like something out of a nightmare it&#x27;s scary to think about and the thing is the tech to build those kinds of weapons it&#x27;s still around and if this whole do leave thing is true if anti-gravity Tech is being developed in secret well who&#x27;s to say someone isn&#x27;t working on weapons even more powerful than anything we&#x27;ve seen before that&#x27;s a question I don&#x27;t even want to think about it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re hardwired to push the limits of Science and Tech but we still haven&#x27;t figured out how to keep ourselves in check how to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get used for the wrong reasons it&#x27;s true we&#x27;re always CAU between creation and destruction and that&#x27;s why these conversations are so important it&#x27;s not just about governments and armies it&#x27;s about all of us and how we shape the future of technology you&#x27;re right it&#x27;s easy to get caught up in the mystery the Intrigue of it all but we got to remember the bigger picture what kind of future are we making exactly and you know what there might a clue right in front of us the sources talk about the mushroom cloud from the Zara bomba how it looked just like an actual mushroom Ah that&#x27;s kind of a powerful image the ultimate symbol of Destruction looking exactly like something that grows and connects things right it&#x27;s like a message from the universe or something okay I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb here maybe the way to keep Tech from destroying us is to embrace that other side the spiritual the interconnectedness the things that remind us we&#x27;re all human that&#x27;s a really interesting thought and you know what it might not be so farfetched there are actually a lot of scientists out there who are starting to explore the connection between science and spirituality trying to find answers to some of life&#x27;s biggest questions so for our listeners out there the ones who are fascinated by the unknown maybe the question isn&#x27;t just is anti-gravity real or did Dr Lee actually figure it out maybe the real question is can we handle it can we unlock these secrets without destroying ourselves H that feels like a deep dive all on its own I think that&#x27;s a great place to believe it something we all need to think about M cuz the answer to that question is going to shape the future for all of us [Music]</p>
