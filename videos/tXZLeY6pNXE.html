            <p>electrogravitics and gyroscopic principle investigating mystic science and basic overview understanding the conscious spectrum connection spectrum a band of colors as Demian a rainbow produced by separation of the components of life by the different degrees of refraction according to wavelength ease to classify something or suggest that is to be classified in terms of position on the scale between two extremes or out understanding a scale between two extremes or opposite points electricity gravity magnetism are all the same just transformed at different points of reference it&#x27;s one big picture here and that as we can see vibration sound very keen and combustive material with gas creates a reaction or product for crop production basically nothing is created nor destroyed just transform just like there are different states of matter the basic examples water as the frequency becomes higher state of the matter changes from a vapor to a solid or the inverse is also true as the frequency becomes lower the state of matter changes from a solid to a vapor that is the absence of heat that drives the frequency up [Music] transformation of pure energy by changing a energy frequency one is changing its ability in the manner that it does work energy is the ability to do work nothing is created or destroyed it is the frequency that changes the energy level this can be seen in the colours produced in the spectrum or the state that the atom is in in the matter gyroscopes look to see how this gyroscope appears to be with weightless or losing weight defying gravity because it is the faster the RPMs are on the gyroscope the more weight it loses point being has a retention of kinetic energy also known as strange behavior is different in materials when energy is put in or taken out the more mass an object has the more ability it has in store energy gyroscopes and magnetic propulsion let&#x27;s make the connection just like a maglev train can levitate due to the properties of aluminum aluminum mirrors or reflects the magnetic poles causing a levitation effect making it possible for the train to be dressed down the track alternating magnetic fields the OTC x1 inch uses aluminum for thrust in breaking the capacitors give thrust and collect power for the high voltage discharge while the Yukon breaks or slows down the system by changing the current flow they both interact with the electromagnetic field the central Campbell you&#x27;re lending battery accumulates and discharges electricity it&#x27;s basically a gyroscopic battery that produces high voltage that creates an ionized shield giving it thrust under gravitational Lake the change always moves in the positive direction as we can see in this diagram there are alternating U shaped aluminum capacitor plates alternating the e-tron that is filled with electrolyte these passes through a c-shape coil a magnetic field as the central accumulator spins under its own mass as we can see here here&#x27;s a better picture of this will within a will it discharges from the top high voltage Iroquois &#x27;el that produces ionized anti-gravity wave lift become you know - I don&#x27;t want to see zero point but masculine sir not that much weight here&#x27;s OTC car 1958 not trying to prove or disprove anything I just know what I&#x27;ve seen all right here&#x27;s the tr-3b or black mantas the new school system I believe it uses mercury and basically upgraded still uses the same principles but just upgraded all-in-one is electricity and different states basically everything can be converted electricity to magnetism the gravity to light it&#x27;s all the same which is that a different frequency and different state say that about other things what is electro pathetic you can stop and read this if you want but others give a basic summary it&#x27;s high-voltage positive and negative it always goes to the positive creates ion Lindor antara gravitational wave we will look up t Townsend Brown and obesity car all right here&#x27;s the few pictures of some lifter models using electrogravitics on the left you can see it levitating on the right you can see the corona and that will change colors do the energy density or the frequency you here&#x27;s some prints on the charge creating the i1 Lander gravity waves you time distortions the faster you go time slows down relatives or of the time the things are moving much slower if you&#x27;re inside the field in Worcester at a high speed for example if you were to leave on a craft of seven days only ten hours with it past your iron it&#x27;s focusing square it&#x27;s focusing space around itself so if I was to leave now I&#x27;d be back in 10 hours in what seven days here&#x27;s another picture tr-3b did right under this craft right under it in in the field time slows down everything is slow out of country here what I feel is everything gyroscopic principles deconstruction of the OTP x1 breakdown of the OTP x1 and three major components looming halt engine flash power crusher Artie&#x27;s cap aluminum haul the aluminum haul our body is built just like in that eases I beam construction molding and rivets the best deduction on this outer Hall is that is comprised of sheets of aluminum had been formed fitted or that is melted cast build my other possibility aluminum Hall there are two cone like shape structures that join together that complete the Rama stable soil craft top Hopkins charge for the bottom central to emulator or battery in the center well the positive comes off the battery the u-shaped capacitor splits on the back side of the u-shaped professor there&#x27;s a rush where a slight contact this all passes through the t-shaped electromagnetic field the Yukon also passes through this same field it&#x27;s been what a fan Neutron is built with the lecture life the aluminum parts or power distribution thrust list braking charge the center pool rises up out of the top using some type of transformer fly back transformer I mean the higher the cabin is pressurized whose office separate battery that runs the electromagnet as Baba here&#x27;s a better diagram you</p>
