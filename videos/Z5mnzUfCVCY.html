            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[music] [music] [music] On September 23rd, 1947, Air Force Lieutenant General Nathan Twining issued a memo to Brigadier General George Schulgan about a very concerning issue that the Air Force had no idea how to contend with. It would become known as the Twining Memo. The memo addressed sightings of [music] flying discs that maintained operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb and maneuverability. The objects were described as circular or elliptical in shape [music] with a metallic or light reflecting surface. pointing was clearly concerned about the national security implications of what he referred to as the phenomenon.</p>
<p>[music] He noted that there is a quote possibility that some foreign nation has a form of propulsion, possibly nuclear, which is outside of our domestic. Nearly 80 years later, military officials and political leaders still share the same concerns. Now, we have incidents when sensors, sometimes even multiple types of sensors, detect things that we cannot explain. UAPs, whatever they may be, may pose a serious threat to our military or civilian aircraft, and that [music] must be understood. That&#x27;s Congressman Robert Garcia, ranking member of the National Security, Border, and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, echoing a refrain heard repeatedly at recent hearings dedicated to the UAP phenomenon.</p>
<p>We should come to this hearing with an open mind and we should not let our existing ideas restrict us on either side. [music] We can&#x27;t be afraid of asking questions and we can&#x27;t be afraid of the truth. Something is in our airspace and it could be a very serious threat. But maybe the best way to understand what these objects actually are is to look at when they first started showing up. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; My name is Andy Stumpf and this is Black Project, a four-part change agents special investigative series.</p>
<p>Look at that thing. It&#x27;s rotating. &gt;&gt; We hear from experts, whistleblowers, [music] and insiders to try to figure out if our government is behind these strange crap. And if so, why are they keeping the truth from the public? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; In so far as the modern sort of sightings era for UAP, I think really did start in World War II. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s Nick Cook.</p>
<p>For years, he was the editor of the esteemed publication James Defense Weekly. For more than a century, it has been the premier outlet covering the defense industry, aerospace, military contractors, and aviation innovation. He&#x27;s also the author of the book, The Hunt for Zero Point. The role at James gave him nearly unparalleled access to not only defense and military officials, but also third party industry contractors like Loheed Martin, Rathon, Northrup, Grumman, and others. After years of seeing highly advanced aerospace innovations firsthand and hearing rumors of secretive anti-gravity programs, Cook became curious.</p>
<p>Could UAPs actually be evidence of black projects working on developing advanced propulsion systems? He began by investigating when military officials first started to discuss crafts that behaved in unexplainable ways. But I think mentally for me it started with the Foo Fighters. This these mysterious balls of light that were seen primarily in the uh European theater of war but not exclusively. So &gt;&gt; encounters with Foo Fighters, as Cook notes, were a strangely common occurrence in World War II. &gt;&gt; It does look like uh from the 1940s onward, US military high command was in fact very interested in this problem even though they said they weren&#x27;t.</p>
<p>[music] Why? Why? What do they think this was? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s renowned UAP researcher and author Richard Dolan discussing the sightings around the time of World War II. &gt;&gt; So you go through the early documents and ask yourself what were they saying about it? And you discover, oh, there was actually quite a few declassified foya military reports that describe pretty fascinating encounters. Air Force pilots encountering solar white discs that fly under their plane and the pilot feels a bump as it goes underneath. It&#x27;s like, &quot;What the hell was that in 1951?&quot; Or a CIA memo to the director of the CIA from his head of scientific intelligence in 1952 that says, &quot;Sightings of unexplained objects at high altitudes and speeds, high speeds in the vicinity of sensitive US installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known [music] types of aerial vehicles.&quot; That&#x27;s pretty straightforward statement. And you know, you read enough of these, you start to think the public persona of the these flying saucers is very different than what [music] was being discussed within the classified world.</p>
<p>And so that&#x27;s what got me hooked. &gt;&gt; The more Nick looked into World War II reports, the more he became drawn into diving deeper. I was actually very reluctant to get drawn into the whole kind of Nazi flying saucer mythos because I came from a very I like to think respectable uh aerospace and defense background. So for me diving into the sort of the Nazi flying saucer myth story from World War II was an awkward place to start. But I felt in order to do the story of truly exotic aerospace vehicles, I mean you can read into that perhaps flying saucers if you want, but if you if I wanted to do that story justice, I had to start with World War II.</p>
<p>Despite his initial awkward feelings about examining supposed [music] Nazi UFOs, Cook decided to visit Germany to look into the SS archives. His research led him to the work of a man named Hans Comler. He was an SS general with overall responsibility for German secret weapons at the end of the Second World War. So from like 1944 through to the end of the war in 45. &gt;&gt; Along with overseeing the construction of several infamous concentration camps, Comm headed Hitler&#x27;s so-called wound weapons program.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Being a technocrat and and an administrator, he had all the secrets at his fingertips. He knew literally where everything was uh going on, uh what it was. He wasn&#x27;t an engineer in the sense that he had detailed knowledge of these programs. But if you were going to make a trade at the end of the Second World War, your life for knowledge, this guy had knowledge in spades. US Air Force Captain Edward J.</p>
<p>Repelt would later write that when World War II ended, the Germans had several radical types of aircraft and guided missiles under development. The majority were in the most preliminary stages, but they were the only known craft that could even approach the performance of objects reported by UFO observers. A CMO from 1952 reported that German engineer and former pilot Rudolph Shrivever had applied for a patent for a flying saucer that could quote rise and descend vertically or remain motionless in the air and had a max speed of more than 2400 mph. Interestingly, Shrivever claimed that the plans for an actual model of his craft were stolen from his workshop in 1948 by agents who wanted to build the craft for a foreign power. Famed British aeronautical engineer Sir Roy Fedin, who worked on the World War II aircraft for the Allies, later said, &quot;I have seen enough of their designs and production plans to realize that if the Germans had managed to prolong the war some month longer, we would have been confronted with a set of entirely new and deadly developments in air warfare.</p>
<p>Whatever it was Germany was working on, if anyone would know the details, it would have been Hans Conler. He literally oversaw all the secret weapons developments at the end of the Second World War in order to get to grips with what I perceived could be a deeply hidden secret in American aerospace, which was a the existence of a an anti-gravity program. I had to do my due diligence in World War II, which meant taking a look at what was said about Nazi flying saucers. So I did I I went through a lot of archive material that had not been accessed before uh to the best of my knowledge. So I started there and I started look using my aerospace and defense background knowledge from my contemporary work into secret stuff that was going on in America in the 80s and &#x27;9s and and beyond.</p>
<p>And I started to look at what the German archives and and American archives said about German secret technology at the end of the Second World War, which could have given rise to the flying saucers and the foo fighters that were reported to have been seen in that theater of operations. I found a lot of very interesting stuff. I think a lot of it had not been turned up before. There were many of the mechanisms that would have gone into a remotely piloted vehicle that could have been mistaken for or or attributed to those foo fighter sightings. Um, there were things like sensing technology the Germans were working on which allowed a remotely piloted vehicle to follow a an American or an Allied bomber stream by latching on to literally the um the smell of their engines which is a phenomenally advanc advanced concept for the time.</p>
<p>Um, I couldn&#x27;t find any evidence that it had been developed into a uh a system or a subsystem. Um, I also found plenty of evidence that they were working on remotely piloted air vehicle technology as well. So, what I was looking for was evidence whether these things had been integrated into an air vehicle, and I couldn&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; However, he doesn&#x27;t rule out that the infamous Nazi bell, an experimental device that was thought to somehow bend space and time, could have actually produced a surprising effect. I personally think now particularly with the benefit of hindsight that this was probably some isotope separation device for the Germans nuclear program which was quite advanced much more advanced than people um tend to think it was and history gives it the credit for at the end of at the end of World War II.</p>
<p>So that is what I think that the bell had it existed really been associated with. But it may have had some uh as I say kind of spin-off byproduct effect which could have been um seen as anti-gravitic. &gt;&gt; It is clear that whatever breakthroughs the Germans had [music] made were of deep interest to the Americans. As World War II came to a close, the US military undertook a mission known as [music] Operation Paperclip. Its purpose was to take the Nazis best scientists and weapons experts out of the country, repatriate them to the United States in exchange for having them go to work on secretive American military projects.</p>
<p>[music] Comler, however, was not part of Operation Paperclip. Beyond being a highranking Nazi official, he was a war criminal. [music] And until Cook and his colleagues investigation, no one knew what actually became of the mysterious Nazi wonder weapons [music] head. And although my book, The Hunt for Zero Point, I looked for him in that book. I didn&#x27;t find him in that book.</p>
<p>I did, however, work with some researchers after that book was published [music] and we did find him. And lo and behold, he didn&#x27;t commit suicide like [music] the six varying testimonies of his death attested to or supposedly did. He handed himself over to the Americans. Um, and that has been a secret. It still is a secret.</p>
<p>But through diligent [music] work by some colleagues of mine who went on to publish a book, very good book called The Hidden Nazi, Hans Camel&#x27;s story was revealed. And it is a story of knowledge of deeply secret technology which was worth the trade for a missgotten life. Not long after Germany&#x27;s best scientists were relocated to America and Commer spilled Germany&#x27;s deepest weapon secrets, something strange began to happen in America. odd craft started showing up and in some cases crashing in remote areas of the country. The kind of UAP era in the states really kind of kicks off in 1947 with uh sightings in the US Northwest, so Washington State to begin with.</p>
<p>Then around New Mexico where of course you have the story of the Roswell crash. Then a plethora of sightings in the US Southwest. Many of them I have to say around nuclear sites. [music] Roswell, the base was home to the 409th uh bomber squadron, which was the first nuclear capable u um unit um aerial unit with B29s amongst which there had been [music] um uh aircraft that had dropped the first bombs on Japan. [music] As almost anyone familiar with UAP lore now knows, in the summer of 1947, something crashed in the desert of Roswell, New Mexico.</p>
<p>So many I mean anybody who was around at Roswell firsthand knowledge is dead now literally. So I mean that&#x27;s the ultimate compartmentalization. I live in Knoxville, Tennessee and you back up to Oakidge National Laboratory and during the war you know they created the bomb for one of them and you know you had thousands of people worked over there and maybe maybe a half a dozen people in the whole thing knew what it was about. That&#x27;s Senator Tim Burchett. Today, the representative from Tennessee is one of Congress&#x27;s leading figures pushing for UAP disclosures despite push back from intelligence and military officials.</p>
<p>I was on one of these shows one time and I told him, I said, &quot;I&#x27;m I want y&#x27;all to know I&#x27;m not suffering from depression and I and and I will not be jumping off a cliff or or shooting in the back of the head six times to commit suicide.&quot; And I I said, you know, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m because a lot of these people don&#x27;t like folks like me. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s long been skeptical of the military&#x27;s account of the Roswell incident of 1947. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re hiding something. They spent tens of millions of dollars uh since at least since 1947. Roswell, you if you look up Roswell, New Mexico, the UFO thing, and it&#x27;s interesting.</p>
<p>Military intelligence comes out one day, literally issues a press release. It&#x27;s in newspapers. Saucer recovered. Then next day they pull this poor colonel out and he&#x27;s got a hold of the remnants of something that looks like a hot air balloon and says, &quot;Oh, we made a mistake. It was a balloon.&quot; You know, they just don&#x27;t make mistakes like that.</p>
<p>A military intelligence to me is like congressional ethics. I really don&#x27;t think it exists. Ladies and gentlemen, it is full-on holiday season. So, if you&#x27;re still looking for an awesome gift that [music] actually has some substance, I highly recommend Firecracker Farm Hot Salt. It&#x27;s a product that I personally use every day and I can stand behind it.</p>
<p>Delicious really is an understatement. It has the perfect heat to flavor ratio that [music] you can fully control and elevates everything you put it on from eggs to steak, chicken, or even something as simple as pasta that you may not traditionally [music] think about putting salt on. The gear is solid, too. It comes in a really nice, well-built stainless steel push grinder that feels right in your hand. It has a great tactile [music] quality that makes it super satisfying to use.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m telling you, you&#x27;re going to want this thing, and it [music] makes an awesome gift. The best part is when you buy one, you&#x27;re supporting a small American family business and you&#x27;re buying something that&#x27;s truly high quality that you&#x27;ll use every single day. Alex [music] and his family have put a ton of love and dedication into this product. And I&#x27;m not the only one that recognizes a good thing when I see it. You can now find [music] this product at Black Rifle Coffee locations to include the one here in Catal.</p>
<p>That should tell you everything that you need to know about the quality [music] of the people and the product. There&#x27;s one small catch. You are not going to find this on Amazon [music] last minute. They make hot salt in small batches and inventory goes very quickly. So if [music] you want this, you need to make your move now.</p>
<p>They are going to sell out. Head over to firecracker.farm and use the code ironclan. All one word, all caps at checkout for 10% off of your order. Do it now and you&#x27;re going to be the holiday hero. [music] Thank you later.</p>
<p>That is firecracker. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; But Roswell wasn&#x27;t the only place that these objects began showing up in the wake of both Operation Paperclip and the Manhattan Project. &gt;&gt; There seems to be this connection and and and there long has been between UFO sightings [music] and nuclear sites and that certainly was the case from 1947 onwards. I mean, even when you look at the initial um sightings over Washington State in 47, um those were connected with um the plutanium production sites that had been installed there during World War II. So, that connection is is is pretty well established.</p>
<p>You then get a lot of sightings over places like Albuquerque. Albuquerque is associated with a base called Kirtland Air Force Base. So literally a butts um the uh civilian airfield at uh at Albuquerque and Albuquerque was also deeply associated with um with nuclear activity. So, and you have a little further to the north, you have Los Alamos, um, which I&#x27;ve also visited. And, um, so those I mean, weirdly, and I talk about this in my new book, which I&#x27;m serializing on Substack, which is called The Light Beyond the Mountains.</p>
<p>There are there are many UFO sightings in 1947 um and orb sightings, those kind of like foo fighter-l like sightings over uh Kirtland Air Force Base and Los Alamos in New Mexico at that time. But weirdly, no one really makes the connection to those foo fighters of World War II. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re dealing with something completely separate, which is a disconnect. I do talk about in the light beyond the mountains and um it&#x27;s a curiosity as we said. &gt;&gt; The orbs so-called flying saucers and other strange objects may have looked differently from each other but they all shared a common trait.</p>
<p>They seem to literally defy gravity and have no visible propulsion systems. This while the military with the help of former Nazi scientists became extremely interested in the idea of anti-gravity technology. I mean, I think this kind of the aerospace angle of things, I think probably came in probably around the 1950s. I mean, we had the the creation of Area 51, you know, to start working on these top secret spy planes and and bringing in [music] leading into the stealth era. And of course, hypothetically speaking, if crashed UFOs uh were kind of being looked into by scientists and these these companies that they could potentially try and incorporate some materials into this this kind of stealth.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s the kind of era where a lot of progress was being probably made in physics as well. Um, so you can kind of combine all those things together and it makes sense that, you know, looking back all these years later that that was kind of the beginning of of what we&#x27;re seeing to this day. That&#x27;s Disclosure Project founder and UAP researcher Vinnie Adams. As he notes, in the years after World War II, the military and defense contractors started working on very strange [music] projects. In his book, The Hunt for Zero Point, Cook recounts receiving a photocopy of a magazine article from the 1950s in the mail while working at Jane&#x27;s [music] Defense Weekly, which sparked some interesting questions about the era&#x27;s quest for anti-gravidic technology.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This magazine article, as you said, landed on my desk at Jane&#x27;s Defense Weekly. Uh, I look at it, it says something like the G engines are coming. It had been photocopied from some 1950s magazine. Don&#x27;t know what it was doing on my desk, so I had no idea where it came from. Somebody must have sent it to me or sent it to the magazine, my magazine.</p>
<p>And so there I am looking at this article and I literally about to throw it in the trash when some names catch my attention in the article. you know names like uh Convey and uh oh Loed and Sperry and you know well-known aerospace names and I&#x27;m sort of I&#x27;m looking at them and it&#x27;s there are these people who are quoted from those companies who are talking about an imminent anti-gravity breakthrough. So, this article I&#x27;m I was about to throw in the trash sort of gets gently retrieved. And I&#x27;m looking around to make sure that I&#x27;m not being overlooked as I&#x27;m reading this thing because it&#x27;s really um uh sort of in the in the lore of my publication at the time, bad form to be reading sort of something as it was kind of that taboo. But as I as I&#x27;m reading it, I&#x27;m seeing um these quotes as I say that are saying a breakthrough in anti-gravidic technology is imminent.</p>
<p>All of these companies are working on it. You know, give us I don&#x27;t know, I think this was in the mid-50s. So like give us 5 to 7 years and we&#x27;ll achieve a breakthrough. So of course, you know, I have an aerospace background. So I&#x27;m going well I know that apart from probably in the Jetsons you know the cartoon series no one is flying around in anti-grip vitic craft by the early to mid 1960s.</p>
<p>So what happened? Were these guys all smoking something or did something happen? Did was there a breakthrough and it just went black? It went secret. At the time, Cook had been working in the aerospace industry for years, and it wasn&#x27;t inconceivable that a technological breakthrough like this could be [music] undertaken in secret. I knew that there was a uh a pedigree in the US for stuff going black when there is a breakthrough that&#x27;s happened or is imminent. So I applied this sort of same logic to [music] the whole anti-gravitics space and that&#x27;s when I decided to go on the hunt of the title which was to go and [music] literally when I went around when I went around my everyday day job was to keep my ear to the ground and my nose to the ground, my eyes open and speak to people sce very quietly about what might have been going on since the &#x27;50s in that anti-gravitics space. &gt;&gt; Cook&#x27;s quest for evidence of anti-gravidic technology led him to the B2 stealth bomber designed and built by the defense contractor and aerospace giant Northrup Grumman, which seemed to utilize some exotic [music] new technologies.</p>
<p>There was a rumor at the time that the B2 stealth bomber employed some form of anti-gravitics to give it an extra little bit of lift. So it&#x27;s not to say that you know it obviously has jet engines but through the work of a guy called Thomas Townzen Brown who had also done some interesting work on electrogravitics um in the 1940s and50s uh there was a there was some conjecture that um some of that Thomas Townsen brand technology had gone into the what&#x27;s called a kind of flame jet generator. It was a generation an electric electrical generation device embedded within the General Electric engines of the B2. Sounded like complete rubbish to me. But I had a colleague at James who sadly is no longer with us, but and his name was Bill Gunston.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a very famous um aerospace writer, very good one. I mean, super knowledgeable. And Bill Gunston said in an article that he wrote that performance characteristics of the B2, its weights, capabilities, the thrust of its jet engines, none of those things added up. [music] I mean, in in essence, what he was saying was that if you put all those things together, the B2 shouldn&#x27;t have been able to get off the ground, but somehow it did. So he then starts talking about all of this anti-gritic technology in the article and Thomas Towns in Brown stuff and he ends enigmatically by saying but I better stop there otherwise I&#x27;m going to go to jail in the Tower of London.</p>
<p>[music] Though Cook says he didn&#x27;t [music] see evidence of anti-gravidic technology in the B2 there is a curious connection to [music] the craft. Thomas Townsen Brown, who performed critical work on the B2, was also an eccentric inventor obsessed with ideas like time travel and anti-gravity. He wrote about his innovation in an article called How I Control Gravitation in 1929 and filed several patents for gravity manipulation devices and even a flying apparatus [music] in 1968. The topic of anti-gravity was going mainstream at the [music] time. Brown was doing some of his most innovative work.</p>
<p>In the decades following World War II, a breakthrough in anti-gravity technology seemed [music] imminent. That is until all of a sudden the programs working on them went dark [music] and so did mainstream discussion of it. And there&#x27;s no better example of this sharp turn than the story of a Chinese American scientist named [music] Ning Lee. She was a physicist who worked at the University of Alabama at Huntsville. Huntsville, as people may know, is associated with rocketry and NASA.</p>
<p>And you know, that&#x27;s where Veron Brown built his rockets. She was trying to replicate the uh they were kind of like anti-gravity experiments of a Russian [music] whose name was is Yvani Pod Kleenov and Pod Kletenov had supposedly discovered an effect wherein when you rotate a superconductor very very fast at very high rotation speeds in the column of sort of air above the superconductor. Imagine that as a sort of like a a a 12in LP that is spinning very fast on a record deck. Um in that column of air above that there there was a measured uh weight drop off a weight reduction of a weight suspended in that column of air of around 2 to 5%. which doesn&#x27;t sound much but actually since that physically is meant to be impossible it was pretty interesting.</p>
<p>So Ningley was trying to replicate that work his work at the University of Alabama at Huntsville. &gt;&gt; Ning Le&#x27;s work in anti-gravity soon gained the attention of some of the most powerful people in the military industrial complex. &gt;&gt; That work I think was supported by NASA to a degree. Anyway, it had some funding from other sources. She then gets funded by uh US Army Missile Command, I think, um shortly after that work, we&#x27;re talking now about the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Um and whilst I hadn&#x27;t met her when I wrote The Hunt for Zero Point, I did meet her after the book came out. So I met her in 2003 at a conference in just outside Washington DC. And I talked to her. I in fact uh interviewed her and um she had some very interesting things to say about what she&#x27;d done. She said that she was, you know, on the threshold of a breakthrough.</p>
<p>This should be uh something that should be for all mankind. Blahy blahy blah. within a year she disappeared and she didn&#x27;t turn up again sadly until she was reported to have died which was a few years ago now. Um so the question is what happened to her in the interim? Ningley&#x27;s story is symbolic of the story of UAPs in anti-gravity research in the time following World War II. Decades after Lieutenant General Nathan Twining wrote that flying discs with strange propulsion systems needed to be investigated in the 1980s and &#x27;90s, the topic went from a pressing concern to the fringes.</p>
<p>Military officials, defense insiders, and aerospace engineers [music] stopped speaking publicly about UFOs. and experimental aircraft in conversations around them were relegated to fringe media and Hollywood blockbusters. [music] Things seem to go dark. Or maybe they actually just went black. So what kind of craft might military special access programs and private black programs be working on? In April of 2016, US Army&#x27;s task force strike, which was composed of the second brigade combat team, 101st Airborne Division Air Assault, arrived in Iraq.</p>
<p>Their mission was to advise and assist the Iraqi military in an operation to retake the city of Mosul, which had been under the control of the Islamic State, who had seized it in 2014 during the violent battle of Mosul. In the months leading up to the push into eastern Mosul later that October, the Army&#x27;s task force would be assisted by the US Air Force to deliver precision strikes as well as to provide intel to our Iraqi allies. Part of those efforts involved the use of a secretive spy aircraft to perform reconnaissance over the region, though it has never been officially confirmed by intelligence officials. The spy plane was likely the Lockheed U2 Dragon Lady. First developed by the Skunk Works Division in the 1950s with covert funding from the CIA, the high alitude plane has been one of the AY&#x27;s most reliable spying tools for decades.</p>
<p>It is able to fly undetected over remote regions and film down to the street level. It was on one of these reconnaissance flights that it filmed something that is still unexplained. It has become known as the Mosul orb. The video of the silver orblike object flying over the city of Mosul wouldn&#x27;t be released to the public by the Pentagon for another 6 years when it was unveiled at a meeting of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. We&#x27;re talking about a classified briefing likely taking place inside one of the secure rooms here at the capital.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s going to be members of the House Oversight Committee meeting with this uh group from the Pentagon that investigates reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena. The Pentagon&#x27;s all domain anomaly resolution office known as Arrow, which investigates reports of unidentified anomalous phenomenon, issued a statement saying that it demonstrated UAP characteristics and behavior consistent with other metallic orb observations in the region. In other words, this wasn&#x27;t the first time they&#x27;d encountered strange floating orbs in a war zone, and it wouldn&#x27;t be the last. The Mosul encounter didn&#x27;t surprise Pentagon officials. Arrow was already familiar with strange orblike objects.</p>
<p>In fact, more than half of the sightings they investigated involved spherical UAP, according to leaked whistleblower documents. Clips of similar objects have also circulated online for years. Videos recorded by US Navy personnel have added a new layer of evidence to the current national debate about UFOs. &gt;&gt; For two long hours on the night of July 15th, 2019, the crew of the USS Omaha detected on multiple sensor systems unknown objects that surrounded the ship as it moved through ocean waters west of San Diego. One of the objects, a self-illuminated sphere at least 6 feet in diameter, flew alongside the Omaha for an extended period and was observed through a thermal sensor in the ship&#x27;s combat center.</p>
<p>Though Arrow has said that many of the reporting sightings they investigated could be attributed to common objects like balloons or consumer drones, hundreds still remain unexplained. [music] I think that what the American people need to know is that the US military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information, still photos, video photos, other sensor uh information, and they have for a very long time. And it&#x27;s not those fuzzy photos and videos that we&#x27;ve been given. There&#x27;s very clear &gt;&gt; high-res, &gt;&gt; high resolution. &gt;&gt; How many how many visuals, graphics, videos, photos? &gt;&gt; I mean, I&#x27;ve been told hundreds, you know, maybe thousands.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s journalist Michael Shelonburgger testifying [music] at the House Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee on Cyber Security, Information Technology, and Government Innovations unidentified anomalous phenomena exposing the truth hearing. He claims that a Pentagon whistleblower gave him documents that reveal a secret program called Immaculate Constellation, which involved a database of encounters with UAP from the military. Orbs were also a common feature. report describes various incidents found in the human intelligence databases. One involved orbs surrounding and forcing an F-22 out of its patrol area.</p>
<p>In another incident, the crew of a Navy aircraft carrier watched a small orange red sphere rapidly descend from a high altitude of 100 [music] to 200 yd directly above the flight deck of a of the CVN or aircraft carrier. There&#x27;s also eyewitness accounts from service members. As we convene here, UAP are in our airspace, but they are grossly under [music] reportported. These sightings are not rare or isolated. They are routine.</p>
<p>Military air crew and commercial pilots, trained observers whose lives depend on accurate identification are frequently witnessing these phenomenon. As UAP researcher Richard Dolan explains, military encounters with orbs date back decades. Though early encounters with the so-called Foo Fighters in World War II saw pilots dodging balls of light during dog fights, several decades later, there seems to be a resurgence in military encounters. There was an explosion of encounters during the 1970s. Why the 1970s? And this is pre- internet.</p>
<p>So, the fact that I have I have more USO cases from the 70s than any other decade, including uh the 2010s comes in second. Dolan has spent years tracking down reports of sightings and encounters and documenting what individuals have seen. &gt;&gt; There are many many cases, military encounters again, where these objects seem to come in, hang out, uh sometimes cause electromagnetic interference as well, but then they they take off. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re coming in, quick visit, and they&#x27;re gone. Uh this has happened in many aviation encounters, and it&#x27;s happened to our aircraft carriers on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>Objects would come in glowing orange spear hanging out over the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier in 1971 for 20 minutes while all communications and weapon systems go offline. It&#x27;s July 7th July 2nd 1971. And we have a we have a name this a man named James Cop who was a communications um um specialist aboard the USS JFK at that time and talked in great detail about this. Um there&#x27;s no reason not to believe his account in my view.</p>
<p>Uh and to the extent that you can check out what he says, things do check out. They corroborate. So this orange spherical whatever, [music] did it come from below the water? Did it come from above? I don&#x27;t know. All he knows is he&#x27;s working communications. They start spewing out gibberish.</p>
<p>And he hears on the intercom someone screaming, &quot;It&#x27;s God. It&#x27;s the end of the world.&quot; And he&#x27;s like, &quot;What is he goes out to look?&quot; He says, &quot;It&#x27;s night time and there is this thing. It was it glowed and it was like these bubbling colors like the sun. It gave off half the amount of light of of daylight,&quot; he said, and it was just there. Uh the ship went to battle stations, general quarters after 30 seconds, and he had to go back to his uh communication station, but he said for the next 20 minutes everything was offline.</p>
<p>As former Jean&#x27;s Defense Weekly editor and author Nick Cook explains, spheres of light were frequently observed during air battles. And whilst there were many descriptions of what a foo fighter was, they seem to boil down to orbs or balls of light um spanning a meter to several meters across. Um, if you want to get down to the meter diameter for one of these things, there there is no technology today that could come up with um uh an explanation for an orb that is propellantless. It is anti-gravitic. It floats.</p>
<p>It It doesn&#x27;t have any aerial surfaces. The orb shape may remain somewhat consistent, [music] but their surface appearance can vary. Yeah, orbs come up a lot uh in in the conversations that I&#x27;ve had with various people from various backgrounds. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the Disclosure Project founder Vinnie Adams. He spent years interviewing investigators, whistleblowers, military insiders, and witnesses to learn more about the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Orbs are a common topic of his conversations. [music] And these orbs, they don&#x27;t always necessarily take on the same appearance. We do have orbs that form more of like a light or or a plasma effect that can blink [music] in and out of our reality, let&#x27;s say. And then we also get these kind of metallic orbs that look like they are just structured. And then we get things in between where they can actually morph from one to the other.</p>
<p>And [music] you know, these these these are quite small. So, you know, it it leads people to kind of hypothesize that they may be some [music] kind of drone or or scout that could be sent out to observe. I mean, we certainly as humanity and humans, we send out scouts and drones and things that to to look into certain things, whether in war zones or even out into space, we send these um you know, unmanned uh objects, let&#x27;s say. So, you know, that&#x27;s a really good theory. &gt;&gt; Even though there are variations in how these orbs appear, one common feature is their unexplainable movements.</p>
<p>They seem to float. The first object was a metallic basketball-sized [music] sphere and it was above a podium and it was looked like it was just levitating above the podium. &gt;&gt; Levitating above the podium. &gt;&gt; So there was space between this sphere and the podium itself. &gt;&gt; Correct.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Early this year, a former Green Beret named Randy Anderson said he was working at a secretive underground facility at the Naval [music] Surface Warfare Center Crane in Indiana. Randy has come forward to well-known podcasters in the UAP area like Jesse [music] Michaels, claiming that in 2014 he was shown extremely advanced orb technology at an underground black site which he says was called the off-world technology division. We moved on down another hallway and got into an area that had a marking on the wall and said off-world technology. [music] said offworld technology that yeah &gt;&gt; whether or not he&#x27;s telling the truth may not be possible to confirm but assuming he is why would officials at the underground facility named the area the off-world technology division why would they let Randy and others see it whether or not it was real or a scup to plant disinformation about real highly advanced technology or actual off-world craft is not verifiable but what is is the propulsionless nature of the orbs often witnessed by military aviators that seem to be able to levitate like the sphere Randy Anderson claims to have been shown. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s really strange how there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any kind of obvious form of propulsion.</p>
<p>And I guess, you know, we&#x27;ve heard many theories over the years about how [music] these things maneuver and what what energy how how they get their energy and, you know, are they fully anti-gravity or there&#x27;s some kind of electromagnetic effect that&#x27;s allowing them to manipulate space and time. [music] And so to the point where, you know, they wouldn&#x27;t even at high velocities, they wouldn&#x27;t make any sonic boom because they&#x27;re not actually flying [music] with any sort of friction against our air in our atmosphere that they could we could see them physically and they look like they&#x27;re they&#x27;re here, but they could just be outside of of of what we understand. Um, I think that, you know, there&#x27;s been a lot of conversations around that, but but also very a multitude of of theories on the actual propulsion systems, but it&#x27;s certainly something that&#x27;s so exotic that it doesn&#x27;t seem like anything that our current levels of physics can understand or even replicate. [music] Sphere encounters even became a common occurrence off the coast of Virginia Beach, where they showed up in the flight paths of F-18s. Here&#x27;s former flight pilot Ryan Graves again testifying before lawmakers in 2023.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; In 2014, I was an F-18 Fox pilot in the Navy Fighter Attack Squadron 11, the Red Rippers, and I was stationed at NAS Oceanana in Virginia Beach. After upgrades were made to our jet&#x27;s radar systems, we began detecting unknown objects operating in our airspace. At first, we assumed they were radar errors, but soon we began to correlate the radar tracks with multiple onboard sensors, including infrared systems, eventually through visual ID. During a training mission in warning area Whiskey 72, 10 mi off the coast of Virginia Beach, two F-18 Super Hornets were split by a UAP. The object, described as a dark gray or black cube inside of a clear sphere, came within 50 ft of the lead aircraft and was estimated to be 5 to 15 ft in diameter.</p>
<p>The mission commander terminated the flight immediately and returned base. Our squadron submitted a safety report, but there was no official acknowledgement of the incident and no further mechanism to report the sightings. Soon, these encounters became so frequent that air crew would discuss the risk of UAP as part of their regular pre-flight briefs. The object that Grave and others encountered were described as clear spheres that had gray cubes inside. The pilots determined that they couldn&#x27;t be balloons.</p>
<p>They were often motionless, even in hurricane force winds. Though as Grave notes, there was a stigma attached to discussing the encounters. [music] The Navy would go on to officially acknowledge 11 incidents that were such close misses that they required pilots to take evasive action. Nothing that we have in our inventory whatsoever within around the world that we know of, first of all, right? doesn&#x27;t mean that American or any other tech is not out there. But if it&#x27;s a foreign adversary, that&#x27;s pretty wild and we better be scared.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d rather it be a UFO. Let&#x27;s be honest. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s Chrissy Newton. She&#x27;s the host of the podcast Rebelliously Curious and a reporter with the outlet The Debrief. The site has been critical to recent disclosure [music] efforts and was where former United States Air Force officer and intelligence official David Grush made admissions about the government UAP programs he worked on.</p>
<p>As Newton [music] notes, some of these sphere-like craft seem to somehow know where military aircraft are going [music] to be. &gt;&gt; Understanding how the heck they can stay up there for so long and also know where they where they are, right? [music] Like knowing where a ship might be and it&#x27;s only maybe intelligence that know or a group of people. So, I think that&#x27;s really wild. We see a lot of that the knowing when nobody else should know and how would they know when it&#x27;s a secret. That&#x27;s petrifying.</p>
<p>And I think those are the most common [music] things we see outside of maybe shapes and speed, right? &gt;&gt; Newton&#x27;s points are backed up by Graves own testimony. &gt;&gt; Mr. Graves, again, I&#x27;d like to know um how do you know that these were not our aircraft? &gt;&gt; Some of the behaviors that we saw in a working area, we would see these objects uh being at 0.0 Mach, that&#x27;s zero air speed over certain pieces of the ground. So what that means, just like a river, if you throw a bobber in, it&#x27;s going to float downstream. These objects were staying completely stationary in category 4 hurricane winds.</p>
<p>These same objects would then accelerate to supersonic speeds, 1.1 1.2 Mach, and they would do so in very erratic and quick behaviors that we don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an explanation for. &gt;&gt; Okay. [music] Have you spoken to um commercial and military pilots um that have seen these off of our east coast? &gt;&gt; I have. [music] I tell you what, this was a wild one when this organization reached out to sponsor the show because I have actually been wearing their product [music] for the better part of a decade. I spent a good portion of every year traveling the world doing public [music] speaking and the only clothes that I wear when I do so are Miz and Maine.</p>
<p>They look amazing, incredibly professional, but they are by far the most comfortable professional/thletic technology wear that I have ever worn. Miz and May makes classic men&#x27;s wear with performance fabrics, so [music] it&#x27;s effortless to look sharp and feel great. The shirts and pants, they look very refined, yet they are stretchy, lightweight, moisture wicking, wrinkle resistant, and completely machine washable, so no ironing or dry cleaning is required. These [music] things are super easy to travel with as well. Mizen and Maine is a veteranled organization committed [music] to supporting those who have served.</p>
<p>They offer a year-round military discount and proudly give back to veteran organizations. Right now, Mizen and Main is offering our listeners [music] 20% off your first purchase at misenandmain.com. Promo code [music] ironclad 20. That is all one word, all uppercase. misin.com, [music] promo code ironclad 20.</p>
<p>And if you&#x27;d rather shop in person, you can find Mizen and Maine and stores [music] in select states. Newton is one of the leading voices pushing for disclosure and regularly interviews some of the most important names working behind the scenes on the issue. Though she&#x27;s now viewed as one of the field&#x27;s leading journalists, Newton&#x27;s introduction to the topic was more personal than professional. Uh my dad had a UFO experience when I believe he was 18 with a group of people up in northern Ontario in Peenrook and he took a picture of a UFO and when I was a little girl he showed me that photo. &gt;&gt; The object exhibited many of the same characteristics as the orb and spheres observed by the pilots.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So it had the sun but you could see the p the the perspective of it which is really really cool. You saw the road and then you saw tail lights, but then over top of a telephone post is where the the UFO was. Now, here&#x27;s the thing. It possibly could have been a drone because it was like later &#x27;7s, &#x27;8s. Drones were being tested then by the American government.</p>
<p>But my dad flashed its high beams at it and it flashed back at my dad. So it was the size of like he said little kids could fit in it which is interesting because Bob Lazar says that when he went into his craft or the craft that he was saw that they were reverse engineering it was like small enough for little kids and then what ended up happening is he took they had a rifle in the back they were hunting and when he took the gun out and he pointed it at the UFO or the one of the guys did to get a better look at it not to shoot it but to look at it through the scope it took off. Now, the wild thing is that my dad called me, gosh, like 3 weeks ago. He was like, &quot;Have you seen like the new George Knap documentary that&#x27;s on Netflix?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I haven&#x27;t watched it.&quot; I said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t had time.&quot; I said, &quot;But I know about it and I&#x27;ve been hearing about it.&quot; And he&#x27;s like, &quot;One of the men has the exact same sighting that I saw that was like a cattle rancher.&quot; And the same thing they did was put the put the gun up to the UFO and watched it take off. Newton&#x27;s father&#x27;s experience was with an orb that seemed to demonstrate some sort of intelligence.</p>
<p>But one of the most famous incidents involving a close encounter with a military fighter jet didn&#x27;t involve a sphere. It did, however, seemed to demonstrate some intelligence. The encounter was with a shape described like a tic tac. &gt;&gt; [screaming] [laughter] &gt;&gt; In recent years, the Navy has declassified several videos captured by fighter pilots, including this one from 2015 filmed off the West Coast. &gt;&gt; The video appears to show an object with an oblong shape like a tic tac flying at unexplainable speeds.</p>
<p>In another incident with a similar object in 2004, the object appears to rotate and has no propulsion system. &gt;&gt; A whole fleet of them. Look on the SA. My gosh, they&#x27;re all going against the wind. The wind&#x27;s 120 knots westing, dude.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not LNS, though, is it? It&#x27;s LS, dude. But if there&#x27;s another thing, it&#x27;s rotating. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; At one of the congressional hearings, pilot David Faver was asked directly about the tic-tac incident. &gt;&gt; Mr. Faver, what what astonished you the most about the the flight capabilities of these tic tac? Very briefly, &gt;&gt; uh the performance.</p>
<p>Absolute performance. It was &gt;&gt; and and you&#x27;re you&#x27;re not aware of any other objects that anybody in the world has in this world that has those capabilities? No, I think it&#x27;s far beyond actually our material science that we currently possess. &gt;&gt; But perhaps the oddest thing about Fraver&#x27;s encounter wasn&#x27;t how the object moved, but [music] where it moved. &gt;&gt; As we pulled nose onto the object within about a half mile of it, it rapidly accelerated in front of us and disappeared. Our wingmen roughly 8,000 ft above us lost contact.</p>
<p>Also, &gt;&gt; after that, [music] with the encounter seemingly over, Favor was instructed to go to his predetermined cap point 60 mi away. That&#x27;s when something odd happened. We immediately turned back to see where the white water was at and it was gone also. So as we started to turn back towards the east, the controller [music] came up and said, &quot;Sir, you&#x27;re not going to believe this, but that thing is at your cat point, roughly 60 mi away in less than a minute.&quot; And though the recent release by the [music] Navy only dates back to encounters in the early 2004s, similar sightings with hypersonic tic tacs [music] have been documented for decades. And if you look at the tic tac, for example, that shape has been reported before.</p>
<p>What you&#x27;ll [music] find is that obviously it wasn&#x27;t called a tic tac. You may have things like butane tanks and things that people were associating [music] with that shape at the time. Let&#x27;s say if it was the &#x27;50s or something like that. That&#x27;s Vinnie Adams again. As he notes, pilots reporting encounters with what they called flying butane tanks date back to the 1950s, [music] long before the white oblong candy entered cultural awareness.</p>
<p>Some of those vessels have also been seen going underwater [music] and reemerging with barely any disturbance to the surface of the water. These have become known as USO or unidentified submerged objects and some have been encountered deep in the ocean. So in terms of actual USO waterbased reports, they&#x27;re relatively rare, but they&#x27;re not so rare that they never happen. We are land lovers. We&#x27;re not usually out in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>And um and then if you are like if you&#x27;re in US Navy and you&#x27;re out in the middle of the Pacific or the Atlantic, yes, you may have an encounter, but then are you going to be easily able to talk about it? Frequently when you look at the Navy reports, uh they&#x27;re fre they&#x27;re often written by Navy guys who&#x27;ve retired and they&#x27;re like either anonymous, frequently anonymous. They may sometimes give their name, but they will almost inevitably say, &quot;This is what happened to me 20some years ago when I was aboard this ship in this body of water, and I feel that I can now discuss it.&quot; &gt;&gt; But part of the reason for the relatively known numbers of encounters at sea is simply a matter of access. USOS could be much more common than anyone realizes. There&#x27;s actually a certain amount of logic for a visitor that comes from elsewhere to want to set up shop under the ocean. There&#x27;s it&#x27;s more of a stable environment in many ways.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got less temperature fluctuation down there. You&#x27;ve got less uh pressure fluctuations. In addition to the traditional flying saucers dating back to World War II, spheres observed by both military personnel and civilians and oblong objects capable of effortlessly traveling between air and water. There is one or more shape that could provide a clue to the mystery of UAPs and their possible origins. Whether from another planet or a military special access program, the black triangle.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; 1997, thousands reported seeing a V-shaped light formation in the sky. The Phoenix lights have since sparked a lot of debate. Was it aliens or is it just earthly explanation still up in the air? Yeah, there seems to have been a lot of waves of black triangle sightings, especially sort of in the sort of late &#x27;7s, &#x27; 80s and and the &#x27;9s. Uh, and globally as well, these triangles have been ranging from from quite small. If you look at the 1980 Bentwaters case, um, Rendlesam Forest, you know, a small triangle was seen there.</p>
<p>But then if you look at things like the Belgian wave, uh, in the late &#x27;8s, you know, you&#x27;ve got very, very large triangles, even through to these boomerang triangles at the Phoenix Lights in 97. You know, I think a lot of what was seen back in that era was potentially, you know, our technology being tested. There&#x27;s good reason for Adams to suggest that the black triangle could be evidence of covert black projects, especially when considering that [music] intriguing quote UFO patents by Dr. Salvatar PZ, an aerospace engineer at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, along with a space-time [music] modification weapon and a high energy electromagnetic field generator. The patents spanning hundreds of pages and featuring dozens of detailed technical sketches depict what seems to be a triangular craft.</p>
<p>These designs include mass reduction devices that could theoretically manipulate gravity, enabling the craft [music] to perform in ways that defy conventional understanding of physics. Ways that would seem to confirm testimonies of individuals who say they&#x27;ve encountered black triangle craft. While the patents, which outline how a black triangle craft could operate, may seem like science fiction, Dr. James Shehy, chief technology officer of the US Naval Aviation Enterprise, [music] doesn&#x27;t just find them plausible. He has affirmed that he believes that they are indeed quote operable.</p>
<p>His comments led credence to the idea that the patents could be a way for the Navy to hide their most groundbreaking innovations in plain sight. Would an adversary honestly believe that advanced weaponry technology would be as easy to find as a Google search? Newton says patents for exotic technologies are more common than you would think, including technologies that would enable a warp drive. Christopher Plane from our team who is an amazing journalist and he has covered warp drive technology like no one else has recently. [music] the accubrary theory that talks about potentially of like wart drive before that there were I believe independently within NASA and then outside of NASA there were patents [music] created by this by multiple groups of people I know specifically one you know but from what I know that patent was you know created and [music] Sunny Herald I worked at NASA on work drive technology and then he left and then started his own private practice around you know I call limitless space that&#x27;s [music] looking into it and still is and is talking about propulsion and all different types of propulsion means &gt;&gt; the theoretical technology could power a craft like the Aurora, a long rumored project from Loheed Martin&#x27;s skunk works program that had the appearance of a large black triangle. According to Lou Alzando, the former senior leader of the advanced aerospace threat identification program, there could be a reason why the government remains less than transparent about what they know about these orbs and other craft.</p>
<p>Cold War was really cranking [music] up. Um, we wanted to look at Russia to see what their ICBM and missile development looked like. So, there was a treaty said we couldn&#x27;t fly over mainland Russia. And so, what did we do? Loheed Martin, Loheed Skunk Works, uh, with the CIA built the U2 aircraft. and the U2 aircraft with a plane that was going to fly so high and so fast that the Russians would not even be able to see it, let alone shoot it down.</p>
<p>And so what happened the first few times we flew it, we succeeded. The Russians didn&#x27;t react. So clearly the plane did exactly what it was intended to do. It wasn&#x27;t until the Russians developed the SA2 surfaceto-air [music] missile and successfully shot it down and paraded the powers uh the pilot in front of the United Nations and the record of the aircraft. Did the Russians admit they&#x27;ve been tracking every single flight? They didn&#x27;t even admit to their own people that they had a problem until they had a solution for that problem.</p>
<p>Right? Why admit there&#x27;s a problem to something until you have a solution for that problem? And the U2 is a perfect example of that. The Russian denied to their people that the US had no capability until they were able to to to shoot it down and neutralize it. And this could be the very same thing here from a national security perspective. Maybe you&#x27;ve got things going on that we don&#x27;t we&#x27;re not comfortable yet admitting there&#x27;s a problem that we don&#x27;t have a solution for. Look at the drones.</p>
<p>Look how look how people are reacting right now to what could potentially be conventional drones and we can&#x27;t even stop that. Can you imagine how people would go [music] literally apoplelectic if they found out that there is some sort of life form out there or some sort of technology out there that&#x27;s not ours that&#x27;s able to do whatever it wants? that does not create that warm fuzzy feeling in in in most people&#x27;s [music] hearts. And I can understand from that perspective, from a national security perspective, why maybe you [music] don&#x27;t want to tell everybody everything. So, how do we determine what these strange objects are and if they originate from our planet? You have to go to the source. Military special access programs and the contractors responsible for building some of the world&#x27;s most advanced technologies, including Skunk Works most notorious secret project.</p>
<p>[music] I do have news directly from the president of the [music] United States that was just shared with me in the Oval Office uh from President Trump directly. An update on the New Jersey drone. &gt;&gt; It looks like a spaceship, right? &gt;&gt; Are you kidding? It&#x27;s like the size of our RV. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s three right there. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a third.</p>
<p>After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons. &gt;&gt; The New Jersey drones, initially spotted in the northern part of the state, now being reported further south. Sightings also now being reported in New York City. &gt;&gt; This was not the enemy. &gt;&gt; In the closing weeks of 2024, something strange began happening around heavily populated areas on the east coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Odd flying objects started showing up seemingly without explanation. The FBI now investigating multiple reports of unidentified drones flying over New Jersey. Some as large as a small car. What started his curiosity soon began to spark national security concerns. &gt;&gt; One lawmaker is calling for a state of emergency, while another has an ominous theory about a foreign adversary.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Speculation circulated. Maybe these weren&#x27;t UFOs from another planet, but maybe they were something even more sinister. &gt;&gt; Many still have questions, including Congressman Jeff Van Drew, who says individuals with high security clearance have [music] a theory about where the drones come from. &gt;&gt; Their concern is that a mother ship has left from Iran weeks ago, coinciding about the time somewhere along the area of the United States. Though initially referred to as the New Jersey drones, they started appearing around areas that were home to major military bases.</p>
<p>Uh we have them at Langley Air Force Base. We have them at Andrews Air Force Base. We&#x27;ve got them all all over the East Coast, West Coast. And we don&#x27;t have situation awareness. And for me, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s problematic, especially in the national security arena, because the taxpayer expects our our our military, our our national security and defense systems, and our intelligence community to always be prepared.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s former senior leader of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program and UAP whistleblower, Lou Alzando. To him, one of the most concerning aspects of the drone activity was how they seem to operate. And yet, here we are with these [music] drones. No one knows where they&#x27;re from. No one knows who&#x27;s flying them.</p>
<p>No one knows how it&#x27;s being done. Some of these things are flying over the horizon, right? So, your line of sight. So, now you&#x27;re talking a sophisticated infrastructure that you either have to have have an airborne asset or you have to have a have some sort of spacebor platform that&#x27;s repeating [music] that signal for you back and forth. Um, longevity, loiter time. The things are the size of a small SUV and able to hover for five, six, maybe, maybe 10 hours at a time.</p>
<p>Look, brother, you know, as I do, right? You know, there&#x27;s two two types of type propulsion really that you can utilize. There&#x27;s liquid propulsion like gasoline or diesel or kerosene, some combustible, right? But at 7 12 lbs per gallon, you chew through that pretty [music] quickly. So, you know, most of your fixed wing platforms can use that type of fuel, JP8 or something like that, but they&#x27;re not going to [music] um have the hover capability, right? They have their fixed wing platforms. If you want to hover like the quadcopters and some of these more sophisticated, most of those are electric powered, [music] battery powered, lithium-ion, and and you don&#x27;t have the longevity that you would simply have with another type of fuel. And so being able to fly in [music] a racetrack formation, right, something that&#x27;s very typical for us as ISR or reconnaissance and able to do so with complete anonymity uh and be able to be deployed and recovered, right, completely anonymously uh and potentially maintained.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a problem, man. That&#x27;s that that is a significant significant problem we&#x27;re facing. British UAP researcher Vinnie Adams frequently speaks with military [music] officials, experts, and intelligence insiders, including DARPA project manager, and Wright Patterson senior research scientist Lieutenant Colonel [music] John Blitch. New Jersey Mayor Michael Melham and intelligence analyst Bob Maguire. [music] He&#x27;s been covering the New Jersey drones issue for months.</p>
<p>And some of the details that he&#x27;s uncovered about the drones over military installations left him deeply concerned as [music] well. I personally spoke to some people who had witnessed these things firsthand both here in the UK and in the US and they were reporting very strange capabilities. These things [music] were outpacing fighter jets. They were silent. They were able to disappear and reappear at will almost like [music] they had control um of the the domain that they were in.</p>
<p>These things were [music] spotted above sensitive military installations that we know have anti- drone capabilities, [music] whether it be geo fences to stop them entering the airspace above these bases or even sort of um these handheld technologies that that can be deployed [music] to to bring them down. Some of these objects were said to be the size of an SUV. Um which obviously isn&#x27;t any kind of terrestrial or or certainly, you know, everyday hobbyist drone. Um there was just so many things that they couldn&#x27;t work out the origin of these objects. Where were they coming from? Where were they going? How were they remaining in place or in the area for many many hours at a time? This is a highly advanced technology.</p>
<p>Could it be adversarial? China, Russia. But if it is, then they&#x27;ve [music] obviously cracked something that we haven&#x27;t or or the US hasn&#x27;t. And that&#x27;s concerning in itself. The nature of classified black programs [music] makes it difficult to confirm what these drones actually are and who is operating them. However, looking at the history of some defense contractors may offer some clues as to what is technologically possible.</p>
<p>[music] In the wake of World War II, the US Air Force recognized that it needed a new generation of jets if it wanted to be able to defend the country against war plananes similar to the ones that had been developed by the Nazis. A young aeronautical engineer at the aviation company Loheed Martin named Kelly Johnson took up the challenge and made the development of a jet airplane the primary mission of the company&#x27;s new advanced [music] development projects known internally as skunk works. Operating out of a small building that was saturated by the smell of nearby plastic factories. Within 6 months, Johnson&#x27;s team developed America&#x27;s first fighter jet, the P80 Shooting Star. The world&#x27;s fastest plane, [music] the jetpropelled P80 Shooting Star, is revealed by the Army Air Forces.</p>
<p>The P80 is heavily armed and reaches a speed of nearly 9 m a minute. Allied air forces now have undisputed mastery of the enemy. Soon they got another request. This one was from the CIA. The agency wanted the Skunk Works Division to build the world&#x27;s most advanced spy plane.</p>
<p>To construct and test it, Johnson moved operations to an air base in Nevada that many people now know as Area 51. &gt;&gt; The area is isolated from prying eyes by the AEC range with lethal reminders of past atomic explosions. &gt;&gt; The end of World War II. How it ended was an absolute turning point in modern American history in in humanity and also in weapons technology. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize finalist and author of books including Area 51, Surprise, Kill, Vanish, the Pentagon&#x27;s Brain, Nuclear War, and other bestsellers that look at military and intelligence history.</p>
<p>Area 51 is is a classified military base inside of a classified nuclear testing range called the Nevada Test Site. The name has changed. I still call it the Nevada Test Site. Inside a classified facility called the nuclear, you know, the Nevada Test and Training Range. It&#x27;s a massive piece of land and it was the perfect place for the CIA to set up a base to build spy planes that could spy on the Soviet Union from overhead.</p>
<p>Very specifically to figure out what the Soviets were up to and whether they were going to start nuclear World War II. The result of Kelly&#x27;s team&#x27;s work was the U2 spy plane. &gt;&gt; An airplane that would cruise well above 70,000 ft. One that would travel almost as far as a B-52 and remain in the air for 10 hours for the first time in jet history. sensitive electronic equipment is being carried to heights where it can search for any number of radio, TV or radar signals and record this information for detailed analysis.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; People who are not familiar with the U2, it essentially looked like a flying cross because the wingspan is so wide and before they were painted black, they were silver and they would reflect the sun. And so there was no such thing as any as a as a as an aircraft that could fly at 70,000 ft. A commercial aircraft flies at like 25,000 ft at the time. So of course people saw this and you know people called up their congressmen convinced they saw a UFO because that&#x27;s exactly what it looked like. Though remarkably advanced for the time, the U2 had critical flaws.</p>
<p>Mainly elements of the design were too big which prevented it from going undetected by enemy surveillance. In fact, one was shot down over Cuba by the Soviet air defense forces. The CIA would have Johnson&#x27;s team work on developing new craft under the code name Project Oxcart. First was the A12, which would eventually fly missions over Vietnam. Next came the legendary SR71.</p>
<p>And for reader or listeners who don&#x27;t know, we&#x27;ll just say if they saw the X-Men movies, the the plane those those superheroes fly is essentially the SR71. &gt;&gt; For context of just how prolific this technology was for the time, even the pilots wristwatches had to use exotic technology to withstand the G-forces that could cause traditional mechanical watches to malfunction. &gt;&gt; Acutron issued to X-15 pilots by the United States government. This was years before Seikko developed the quartz movement that powers many modern watches. Pilots wore Bova Acutron astronaut watches which used a tuning fork oscillator that vibrated at 360 hertz to produce movement which was accurate to 1 second a month.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Kelly Johnson&#x27;s team at Skunk Works was developing groundbreaking exotic technologies at Area 51. Former Nazi rocket scientists were relocated strategically to places like the Army&#x27;s testing facility at White Sands Proving Grounds. There they would make breakthroughs in aeronautical and rocket technology. Aerospace defense contractor Macdonald Douglas continued its collaboration with NASA and the military on groundbreaking projects like the Saturn 5 rocket, the F-15 Strike Eagle, and numerous classified programs that help propel the US into the space age. We have been given the scientific knowledge, the technical ability, and the materials to pursue the exploration of the universe.</p>
<p>[music] To ignore these great resources would be a corruption of a god-given ability. This progress was driven by pioneering aerospace engineers like Dr. Bob Wood, who played a key role in the industry. It&#x27;s perhaps unsurprising while all of these breakthroughs were happening, more and more Americans were seeing UFOs and reporting them to the military. And one of the most common things that people began reporting was a strange black triangle-shaped craft.</p>
<p>The description sounds like the long rumored black project craft from skunk works known as Aurora. The black triangle has been seen over areas as far as Europe&#x27;s North Sea. After a wave of sightings, a British defense briefing note said that there is no knowledge in the Ministry of Defense of a [music] black program of this nature. But it also added, although it would not surprise the relevant desk officers in the air staff and defense intelligence staff, if it did exist, the US military, who were working to keep their black projects secure, saw an opportunity when the UFO sightings related to these exotic craft became more commonplace. Let me give you some insight into your average guy.</p>
<p>Your average dude, especially an outdoorsman, will use a hunter, based off where [music] I live in Montana, will spend at least 10K on a full setup. $2,000 on a scope, $3,000 on a hunting rifle, and maybe that much on [music] a lease, $1,000 in camo, all the scent blocking products. But if you were to ask them to spend 40 or 50 bucks for the best pair of hunting socks that money can buy, they&#x27;re going to ignore it, and they&#x27;re going to wonder why their feet are clammy and cold, and they are uncomfortable [music] all day long. This is where Holo socks come in. These are alpaca socks built for the field.</p>
<p>These are performance-grade socks made from ultra soft baby alpaca fibers. Engineered for rugged conditions and designed to keep your feet dry, warm, and comfortable no matter where your day may take you. They&#x27;re the only socks that will [music] keep your feet warm below freezing and then cooled off when it hits 80°. For a limited time, Holox is having a buy to get to free [music] sale.

You can support the show by telling them that we sent you. &gt;&gt; So, I am the person who wrote some of the most original revelations about what happened at Area 51 with UAP deception campaigns. They were called [music] UFO deception campaigns.</p>
<p>I also have seen documents and report about them of the CIA&#x27;s UFO office out at Area 51 where they realize this is terrific. You know, people think it&#x27;s a UFO. Better that than having our program revealed to the Soviets. [music] Now, does that mean every UFO sighting in the history of mankind is a U2 spy plane? Of course not. Of course not.</p>
<p>But it raises the question that you are raising [music] about what a deception campaign actually is. She explains real black project technological developments [music] are just as mind-blowing as the idea of aliens, especially breakthroughs being made by the Defense Advanced [music] Research Projects Agency, also known as DARPA. &gt;&gt; DARPA&#x27;s job is to create the vast weapon systems of the future. uh they work on programs that are 25 years ahead of what we see and they don&#x27;t necessarily reveal them until they have to. The F-17 fighter jet um that program was no one knew about it for 20 almost 20 years.</p>
<p>[music] So you have to again does that mean every you know does that mean everything is unclassified? Of course not or not known but [music] listen people love to talk about UAPs and you know tic tacs and I [music] get it. I just happen to find the actual things that human beings do and keep secret so much more interesting than the fantasy part of it. I mean, if you read my book, Surprise, Kill Vanish, about the CIA&#x27;s paramilitary operations, you can&#x27;t believe what people are capable of. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; One of the most famous incidents of a UFO deception campaign happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s when a World War II veteran named [music] Paul Benowitz began seeing strange craft flying around his home near Nevada&#x27;s Kirtland Air Force base. After reporting the sightings with officials, he began [music] having encounters with people who had reportedly been abducted by aliens and witnessed the aftermath of cattle mutilations.</p>
<p>He even intercepted radio signals that led [music] him to believe that an alien invasion was imminent. However, it would later turn out that he was a part of an extremely elaborate misinformation campaign [music] conducted by Air Force Office of Special Investigations Officer Richard Dodie. The idea was to discredit Bowitz, [music] who likely had seen secret military aircraft he&#x27;d mistaken for an alien UFO. It became apparent to me that my supplying information to the government through Dodie on the activities of Paul Benowitz Appro and to a lesser extent several other individuals was to be a part of this equation. I also discovered that whatever it was that Benitz was involved with, he was the subject of considerable interest on the part of not one but several government agencies and that they were actively trying to diffuse him by [music] pumping as much mis disinformation through him as he could possibly absorb.</p>
<p>As reporter and podcaster Chrissy Newton explains, his story took a tragic end as Benowitz was eventually hospitalized as his mental [music] condition deteriorated. &gt;&gt; I just literally had this conversation with Richard Dodie last week and he&#x27;s saying that they were not taking advantage of man that had mental health issues. And I do think that [music] is, you know, we know that Paul had some codependency issues. He was already really deeply involved into UFOs [music] and he, you know, no one could change his mind. And Richard Dodie says that, but instead of maybe helping a man or removing him from projects and and giving him government contracts, they should have just left him alone uh and talked to his family and just, you know, found a way not to do what they did to Paul because I think that they [music] really did a number on his mental health.</p>
<p>And Dodie fights with me a little bit on this podcast talking about, you know, saying, well, we were taking care of his physical health. you know, the doctors were looking at his medication and and I&#x27;m saying, well, you know, I said, Richard, I&#x27;m like, it doesn&#x27;t [music] take doesn&#x27;t mean it takes care of your mental health. I said, and you know, you guys weren&#x27;t doing that and you know that and it was the CIA and it was multiple other groups that were working on this disinformation campaign and they knew what was going on. James Defense Weekly editor and author Nick Cook recounts another story involving the controversial scientist Thomas Towns and Brown who in addition to being obsessed with time travel also worked on aerospace black projects. &gt;&gt; Thomas Towns and Brown&#x27;s name is associated with the Philadelphia project.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Project, for those who don&#x27;t know about it, is this mythical, extraordinary story about a warship that [music] is spirited from one set of docks uh to another purportedly through the generation of uh massive doses of electricity around the hull. And of course, you know, you look at that and you go, that is a patently ridiculous story uh and particularly as it was supposedly happening just after World War II. So perhaps you should ask the question. So if that&#x27;s a cover story for something, what was it trying to cover up? For me, the interesting thing, and I talk about this in the hump zero point, um the interesting thing was that [music] at the time that the stories, those stories of the Philadelphia experiment were coming out, which when you think about it was about it was sort of stealth with a small S. At that time, stealth with a capital S was being developed in secret for aircraft like the Loy stealth fighter and the B2 stealth bomber.</p>
<p>So [music] maybe you should ask the question, was that some kind of early preparatory story, a disinformation story to mask appearances or rumors of stealth programs that were beginning to come together [music] in the 80s, uh, the late &#x27;7s and and the early &#x27; 80s, um, that people like Bill Sweetman and I were beginning to look at and investigate. So you know there are there are there are many different forms of intelligence and there are many different forms of counter intelligence. There are hard solid walls that you build in and [music] compartmentalized silos of information that you put in place to protect information. But you may actually also like a little bit of kind of weird top cover as well. And that can be provided by extraordinary and on the face of it highly incredible um stories that sort of have a taint of the uh sort of the original data within.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; When looking at the advancements in military technology developed through black programs and these programs history, it seems very plausible that the recent drone sightings were the result of encounters with advanced human technology. And it seems equally plausible that much of the extraterrestrial discussion could be driven by misinformation efforts. But even experts like Nick Cook think there is something strange happening, especially with the recent drone sightings. &gt;&gt; You know, Colorado farmers were dis were talking complaining about being disturbed by drones. Um, but these drones didn&#x27;t behave like any drones that I really know of.</p>
<p>They shared some characteristics. Some of them looked like um regular quadcopters, but then the reports started to shift and change. They uh they reported to be, you know, car- sized, truck sized, small, you know, 4x4 truck sized vehicles that have persistent loitering capability. Those two things just don&#x27;t go together. Big heavy drones being able to loiter for hours at a time.</p>
<p>Um, that&#x27;s not what conventional [music] drones do. So, you have to then start asking other questions. Don&#x27;t leap to conclusions, but just ask the questions. What could do that? Are there any parallels from history? Yeah. Well, there are there are parallels, as I said earlier, about going back to New Mexico in 1947.</p>
<p>So, what are we dealing with here? It looks like we&#x27;re dealing with something else, some other phenomenon that has a capacity in certain circumstances to mimic what we take as drones. Um, which sounds impossible. So, already I&#x27;m straying into dangerous territory here with my uh my Sherlock Holmesian mantra. But you know at the very least you have to start by asking the questions and not simply jumping to the conclusion that these are conventional drones. Cook has spent years examining UAP and exotic aerospace innovations from a nuts andbolts perspective.</p>
<p>But even after working directly with the [music] people involved in secretive black projects, he&#x27;s not convinced that we fully understand what is happening and if what we&#x27;re seeing actually originates from Earth. And he&#x27;s not alone in this thinking. After years of working with contractors [music] and major aerospace companies, Dr. Bob Wood, who we mentioned earlier, eventually left his role in the defense industry. [music] From there, he would go on to serve as the research director for the Mutual UFO Network.</p>
<p>The [music] group&#x27;s mission is to quote, &quot;Provide a platform for experiencers and UFO abductees to report a UFO or report an alien abduction.&quot; So, what if technology from nonhuman intelligence really is behind the New Jersey drones, UAP, [music] and the UFOs showing up since the 1950s? Well, there might be some pretty compelling evidence that it could be the case. One afternoon in 2011, Dr. Gary Nolan was working at his office at Stanford University when he received a visit from two strangers. &gt;&gt; They literally showed up unannounced and said, &quot;Hi, we&#x27;re here. I work with the CIA.&quot; And the other was a aerospace organization uh executive and um these are the medical cases we&#x27;d like your help on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It was a meeting that would soon alter the course of his life. Dr. Nolan is one of the world&#x27;s leading blood pathologists and today serves as professor [music] in the department of pathology at Stanford University School of Medicine. His specialty is developing instrument platforms and techniques [music] to more effectively study blood related issues. His work also earned him a nomination for a Nobel [music] Prize.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And they didn&#x27;t come to me because I had any special experience in UAP or the phenomena. They were doing complete medical workups on this cohort of individuals about 100 individuals from the military and the defense establishment and the IC and diplomatic corps. Uh and um they&#x27;d asked around and they said, &quot;Well, we want to do um blood analysis for inflammatory events. Uh who&#x27;s the best person we can talk to?&quot; And they said, &quot;Well, you got to go talk to this guy, Nolan, at Stanford. he has the world&#x27;s most advanced instrument for uh looking at blood and giving you a detailed report on these things.</p>
<p>And and that&#x27;s when they showed up in my office and asked me for my help. &gt;&gt; As the two individuals would explain to Dr. Nolan, [music] the patients that were experiencing unexplained issues in their brains had come in contact with quote exotic materials that originated [music] from what the military now calls unidentified anomalous phenomena. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; didn&#x27;t become about UAP until about 30 minutes or so into the into the discussion. And that&#x27;s when I began to look around to see if there was a candid camera somewhere pointed at me from one of the other windows.</p>
<p>What got me intrigued was the data that they showed. I mean, they didn&#x27;t just say, &quot;Hey, these things happened.&quot; They took out MRIs and they showed me the specific scarring within the brain that had occurred. Uh, and then they gave me the detailed medical reports of some of these individuals. And so I helped them. I went out and interviewed some of the individuals personally to make sure that, you know, I mean, I I sort of feel like you have to get involved individually about some of this.</p>
<p>I flew out to to speak with some of these individuals. Um, and I was convinced that they had experienced something real. &gt;&gt; After Dr. Nolan&#x27;s visit from the Pentagon official and government contractor, he got curious and he decided to further investigate claims of secretive government crash retrieval programs. After talking with insiders who claim to work on these programs and whistleblowers inside of the military, he made a startling conclusion.</p>
<p>The US government is in possession of alien craft and is actively attempting to reverse engineer them. &gt;&gt; You know, if you believe the people like David Grush and Carl Nell, Eric Davis, and some other people that I know personally, [music] uh they&#x27;re in possession of a craft, multiple craft. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s an idea that UAP [music] whistleblower Lou Alzando validated during a recent congressional hearing. Advanced technologies not made by our government or any other government are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe. Furthermore, the US is in possession of UAP [music] technologies as are some of our adversaries.</p>
<p>I believe we are in the midst of a multi-deade secretive arms race, one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies. Nolan claims that [music] Black Project funding has allowed defense officials to create technology that will alert them to incoming crafts. &gt;&gt; We have an amazing uh detection system. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Satellites that you spent billions and billions of dollars [music] on putting up when stuff goes arai, they get there first.</p>
<p>Dr. Nolan even suggests [music] that the US government may have technological means to intentionally bring down alien crafts to collect them for the reverse engineering programs. [music] Let&#x27;s say that we have means to bring them down. And let&#x27;s say that some of the things that are brought down were [music] brought down purposefully. Let&#x27;s just think about that for a second.</p>
<p>Here you have a device which at least our best understandings of how it could operate from an academic standpoint. It&#x27;s warping space. Right? So some of the best theories about how this works. I know it sounds Star Trek and Star Trek was maybe ahead of his time or something or who knows. Uh but some of the best theories from physicists who legitimately talk about this.</p>
<p>Somebody your audience could go look up the alubier drive. Uh a uh Mexican physicist [music] who sort of started it off and came up with the right field equations that would suggest it was possible but the amounts of energy required are impossible [music] to access. Right? people have brought down the levels of energy required to um something, you know, still outside of our capabilities, but not astronomically impossible. Um, okay. But you&#x27;re warping space.</p>
<p>Maybe all you need is an electromagnetic pulse of sufficient energy and that would just disrupt the field. Um, you know, I mean, look, it doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t take much more than a blast of wind to push a car off the road. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, you know, similarly, maybe a a blast of the wrong electromagnetic energy or a lightning strike uh would bring the thing down. We have talked a lot about people getting caught in time share scams, falling for pig butchering schemes, or getting those mysterious text messages that you have no idea where they came from.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve spoken with guests who hunt hackers and work to protect people&#x27;s personal information.

<p>All one word, all uppercase. You can also scan the QR code to get started. It&#x27;s one of the few services actively keeping your personal information out of the wrong hands. [music] The extent of the crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs remain unknown and that&#x27;s by design. The reason why this work has long gone unreported according to Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan is because these funds are impossible to track as are the true numbers of people working on UAP in compartmentalized special access programs. But you know your other point was why aren&#x27;t there 500 or 5,000 people? Well, there actually are behind the scenes working on this stuff. Right. At least that&#x27;s what you would conclude if you speak to [music] people like David Grush or Carl Nell or half a dozen other people that I know, some of whom literally work on the programs [music] that they claim are really reverse engineering hidden within black programs. This is an interesting structure of how it&#x27;s how it operates.</p>
<p>You have the open budget which of course has a lot of top secret information of things that are being built. Then there&#x27;s the black budget and the black programs which are barely discussed and are hidden under [music] very obstruuse and abstract names. And then literally the way that this seems to operate is that within the black programs [music] there are subsections and people who are operating on the so-called reverse engineering, right? [music] And but even the black programs don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s what these people are working on. So, it&#x27;s layered within levels of uh special access programs that are nearly impossible to understand. And this is where, you know, David Gush came forward and others have come forward as [music] whistleblowers um to say the money is being misdirected.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re lying on how it is that the money is being spent. Now, this should infuriate anybody [music] in the public to think that your taxpayering your your taxes are going towards programs which you don&#x27;t understand how the money is being spent. First of all, I mean, for all you know, it&#x27;s being spent and going into somebody&#x27;s pocket and they&#x27;re buying a yacht, right? So, maybe you should know that the money is actually being spent or they&#x27;re they&#x27;re not buying, you know, $500 toilet seats. [music] Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>So, there&#x27;s that kind of auditing that needs to go on. But then let&#x27;s say that some of this stuff is real, right? Okay. So, is the money being wisely spent to understand what the technology might be, right? And is it only being spent to determine whether or not it can be used as a weapon? Or are there efforts and this is where my interests come in. Are there efforts to understand the technology in ways that it helps us economy first? Right? Are there in are there discoveries about how technology or instrumentation might be created that could be used for legitimate public commercial purposes, right? For the United States first and then for the world. I mean, look, I&#x27;m I I am a patriot.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what I want to see to make sure that the money that we&#x27;re spending is being done not just for military purposes and I&#x27;m fully supportive of the military, but then when it&#x27;s not obviously usable by the military, that doesn&#x27;t mean you keep it like a dragon&#x27;s horde of gold, uh there might be ways that you can use it publicly to help humanity at large. Nolan&#x27;s concerns are shared by UAP disclosure advocate, congressman, and unidentified anomalous phenomena caucus head, Representative Tim Burchett. He claims that the military has been actively working with defense contractors to secretly reverse engineer craft that did not [music] originate from Earth for a reason. Because the research is being done by private aerospace companies, it isn&#x27;t subject to the Freedom of Information Act requests, making the breakthrough secret and the spending virtually untraceable. &gt;&gt; All this information has been passed on, I think, to corporations that have contracts with the Pentagon, but are not foyable, which means Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>They cannot seize their their documents and and put them out. So there&#x27;s a long trail and there&#x27;s a lot of reasons why it&#x27;s not out there, but I think America needs to know we pay a lot of money. [music] I, you know, I tell people it&#x27;s not about little green men and flying saucers. I mean, ultimately that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll find out, but ultimately [music] we should be, we should want to know where all this money is going. The blurry lines between the work of contractors and the military prevents not only financial transparency, but also hampers insights to what exactly these companies are working on.</p>
<p>Another recent hearing related to UAP led to an awkward exchange between Representative Nancy Mace and whistleblower Lou Alzando, who is a visibly uncomfortable discussing the work of these black [music] projects. In terms of material that&#x27;s given to private contractors, is certain material given to certain contractors because of their experience. So for example, uh if it&#x27;s um related to submerged and undersea propulsion, would it go to a general contractor like General Dynamics? &gt;&gt; Yes, ma&#x27;am. Absolutely correct. Um different contractors have different levels of expertise.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What&#x27;s Lockheed&#x27;s expertise? &gt;&gt; Aerospace, ma&#x27;am. &gt;&gt; In in the UAP space, that&#x27;s all that &gt;&gt; uh &gt;&gt; they would do submerged. &gt;&gt; Uh no, I didn&#x27;t say that, ma&#x27;am. &gt;&gt; Okay. Loheed Martin and others do quite a bit of work both um in our atmosphere in space and and even underwater.</p>
<p>There are there are certain um efforts to it&#x27;s a tough question you&#x27;re asking put me on the spot here. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m ask I&#x27;m looking for the answer. &gt;&gt; Yes, ma&#x27;am. No, they they are involved in a lot. Um I would rather let Loheed Martin explain um the different domains that they are involved with.</p>
<p>Um probably I&#x27;m not authorized to discuss that, but they are involved in a lot of lot of different areas and domains. There was also testimony in the same hearing that seemed to suggest that the partnership between private contractors and the military aren&#x27;t always friendly. At the hearing, Alzando cryptically alluded to a situation in which the CIA intervened to prevent a private contractor from in quote divevesting itself from exotic materials. Does the any branch of the United States government or defense contractors possess technology? Sir, there&#x27;s documentation um that I believe was submitted for the record that was released for release by the US Pentagon by the uh Department of Defense Office of Pre-Publication Security Review and it is uh it states one of the reasons why my predecessor program OAP uh was trying to collect material uh of uh unknown origin. &gt;&gt; Did you su was it successfully collected? &gt;&gt; Um it was not.</p>
<p>What happened is that there was an aerospace contract company that requested to divest itself of the material that was collected in 1950s. Um unfortunately that that didn&#x27;t actually occur. &gt;&gt; So let&#x27;s dive into that. That&#x27;s the um Bigalow Airspace. Correct.</p>
<p>So um there was a journalist Christopher Sharp who who said that Lo there was a transfer between Loheed Martin, Bigalow Airspace and the CIA allegedly blocked this. Can you describe that? &gt;&gt; Um what I can say is that it was blocked. Um why it was blocked I can I can only summize. Um I was part of some conversations later on with some of those contract personnel where they they had told all of us that is [music] accurate. Alzando&#x27;s testimony seems to confirm that the advanced aerospace weapon systems application program a former Pentagon special access program also referred to as OAP was attempting to have exotic material transferred from Loheed Martin who apparently really wanted it gone.</p>
<p>on one occasion was asked by representative Tim Berles of Missouri about a very important story and I&#x27;m glad Berles mentioned this. It is the claim um that during the uh 2007208 OAP years it&#x27;s um the first iteration of what became ATIP that there was an attempted transfer of non-human technology from Lheed Martin to Bigalow Aerospace. Now Bigalow Aerospace was the primary contractor to the OSAP program under the DIA. Uh Robert Bigalow is very good friends with Senator Harry Reid. Reed is the was really the sponsor of all of this OAP program.</p>
<p>And so what we learned about a week before the hearing in a bit of very good journalism was that it looks as though Lheed Martin was going to transfer nonhuman technology to Bigalow Aerospace and that was blocked twice by a senior CIA executive named Glenn Gaffne. So I uh I was very glad when Berles asked Louise Alzando who was at OAP at this time if he knew about the story and was it true and Alzando essentially said yes. This was a really important confirmation. He said from my you know a lot of qualifications of course my understanding is that it was blocked. Um why I cannot surmise.</p>
<p>you know, he he wouldn&#x27;t want to put himself out there, but he gave, I think, very good support to this story and in fact gave a lot of support to it. Um, go through the transcript. So, this is interesting and it makes me think what was the original purpose of OAP? It wasn&#x27;t just a study of the skinwalker ranch. It wasn&#x27;t just a study of UFOs in general. It was very possibly an attempt to uh unbburden Lockheed from its cash of NHI technology because apparently according to this account Lheed didn&#x27;t want it anymore.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t Lheed Martin want to keep a cache of technology created allegedly by non-human intelligence? Though Alzando refrained from speculating, one possible motive could be the reason that those two strangers showed up to speak with Dr. Gary Nolan back in 2011. Contact with the materials caused unexplained injuries. It was another point of discussion at the congressional hearing. Though the military does not confirm it is in possession of materials from UAP crash retrievals, it is paying victims for mysterious injuries incurred while dealing with them.</p>
<p>In your book, you mentioned government employees who&#x27;ve been injured by UAPs placed on leave and receiving government compensation for their injuries. Is that [music] correct? &gt;&gt; That is correct. &gt;&gt; How can the government deny we have recovered craft if they&#x27;re paying people because they&#x27;ve been injured by recovered craft? &gt;&gt; Ma&#x27;am, that&#x27;s a great question. That&#x27;s why I think we&#x27;re here [music] again because I&#x27;ve seen the documentation by the US government for several of these individuals who have sustain sustained [music] injuries as a result of a UAP incident. If Alzando is telling the truth, [music] then there is reason to believe that these special access programs have been operating since at least 1940.</p>
<p>[music] And some experts suggest that the nature of the encounters seem to suggest that the technology didn&#x27;t originate from Earth. We all know there there is black budget tech. There is the ours problem. This has been discussed for many many generations now. Are these things built by us or not us? I gave you a really long-winded answer, but I would just say it.</p>
<p>There is a certain proportion, I think, that is ours. Yes. And there&#x27;s a definite proportion that is not ours. And which makes sense. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re Harry Truman.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s 1947. Your top scientists and generals tell you, &quot;Sir, we&#x27;ve recovered something that doesn&#x27;t seem to come from these parts.&quot; Oh, yeah. And a couple of alien bodies, too. So, you know, you have to now decide what do I do with this information. Do I tell the world? Even if you may think you want to, your advisers will tell you all the reasons why that&#x27;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>You tell the world you&#x27;ve got this tech. Now, you got the Russians to deal with. They&#x27;re trying to get nuclear technology. You don&#x27;t want to share that. Why would you want to share something as exotic as alien tech? No.</p>
<p>So, what you do is you create a very deeply classified program. You make sure you manage the media. You make sure you manage the politicians. you make sure you manage the academic community, all of that. Yes, that&#x27;s easier to do than some people think.</p>
<p>Um, and then you maybe review your policy every few years. But the the fact is there never turns out to be a good reason to give up the secret. [music] It becomes bigger and deeper and better and more profitable, too, because now you start handing things off to private industry like Loheed Martin in the &#x27; 50s and like Rathon and like Boeing and all the others. And now they&#x27;re working with you and now they&#x27;re developing the future and and now when you retire from your three star, four-star position, you go to work for them in a senior executive capacity and your clearances go up and better and you&#x27;re making more money than ever before. So it&#x27;s a really it&#x27;s a great gig for a lot of these people and I think that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking at.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a privatized a lot of it&#x27;s become privatized. Dr. Nolan claims that strange quote meta materials that would have been impossible to engineer at the time were found at these early crash sites. These materials could theoretically be weaponized. metals with extraordinarily uh hard and heat transmissive capabilities, right? That are near superconductors of heat if not electricity.</p>
<p>Um that&#x27;s probably the one that I know ones I know the most of. Um engineered materials that seem to be engineered at the atomic level, uh that are um people have called them metamaterials. I mean, there&#x27;s one of them that&#x27;s very public uh that I&#x27;m not sure about the provenence of or the capability of, but there&#x27;s others that I&#x27;m aware of that uh you know, people just don&#x27;t understand first how it is it that they could make something like that. How would it be made? Because it was found at a time when we couldn&#x27;t make something like that. And it is structured in a way that I mean it&#x27;s even today difficult to understand how some of these things are structured and made.</p>
<p>If Dolan is right that there have been reverse engineering programs going on for decades then much of what is being seen now was made by the US military private contractors or concerningly foreign adversaries. I think it&#x27;s more than that than I think it&#x27;s extraterrestrial or interdimensional or or any of that. I do think and it&#x27;s not that you know a skeptic over here. I do think there&#x27;s something going on. I just think it&#x27;s like 1% or less.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Here is UAP researcher Chrissy Newton. &gt;&gt; But I also do think that foreign adversaries uh especially China are a lot far advanced than we are. We know that they are when it comes to quantum computing, right? And all of that is very very scary. You know, the rand reports that have come out recently says that China is way above quantum computing than we are. And to be honest, if they crack it, they can wipe out all of our systems, right? It it just can change everything for us.</p>
<p>Lou Alzando shares Newton&#x27;s concerns and says that these secret programs have been going on in and outside of the United States for decades, meaning the technology is likely now extremely advanced. Remember, I grew up at the height of the Cold War where it was this winner takes all proverbial chess match between then Soviet Union and the United States. And by the way, despite what people think the [music] Cold War being a cold war, it was. It was pretty hot. There were proxy wars going all over the world, right? Uh and so what we didn&#x27;t want to do is tip off to the Soviets um what we knew about UAP or worse maybe what our vulner what we didn&#x27;t know, what our intelligence gaps were, right? You don&#x27;t want to broadcast that.</p>
<p>We do know that Russia had their own UAP UFO program. They continue to have it. We have it. China has it. Other countries have it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s kind of the worst kept secret at this point. Dr. Nolan claims that the threat of a foreign adversary collecting crash materials before the US can get to it is the real reason that these clandestine retrieval programs have remained such a closely guarded secret. This is what should scare people. What happens if China gets to it first? It&#x27;s pretty clear they It&#x27;s not a US thing.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t show up in the United States only. So if China and Russia have them or God help us um Iran and they get access and understanding to what the technology means first um we might be in a little bit of trouble. National security concerns that this technology is being hidden in black projects and special access programs have become a major theme of recent congressional hearings. My concern whether this technology emanates from us or otherworldly [music] that we know that we possess it and where&#x27;s the accountability? Where are the stop gaps? What are the guarantees that if this were to fall in enemy hands that it isn&#x27;t immediately weaponized against us? That&#x27;s representative Andy Ogles at the unidentified anomalous phenomena exposing the truth hearing. &gt;&gt; It is clear from my experience and what I&#x27;ve seen that there is something out there.</p>
<p>The question is [music] is it ours, is it someone else&#x27;s or is it otherworldly? And Madam Chairman, I would posit that as the legislative body, as the regulatory body, we must know. And anyone who prevents us from gaining access to that information, I would consider that criminality because we have US personnel who may very well be in harm&#x27;s way. [applause] We have technology that ultimately may threaten our very existence. With that, Madam Chairman, I thank you for your indulgence and I yield back. [music] Because of a lack of transparency and presentation of physical evidence, there is still no way to definitively confirm whether the technology being witnessed originated from non-human intelligence, is the work of a secretive black project, or possibly a combination of both.</p>
<p>However, with whistleblowers continuing to push for the disclosure of the truth, we may [music] soon actually get the answer. Until then, it&#x27;s up to the public to push for transparency and follow wherever the evidence leads, even if it&#x27;s to some pretty dark places. I&#x27;m Andy Stumpf, and this has been Black Project, a change agents special [music] series. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music]</p>
