            <p>[Music] we live in a vast sea of energy everything every atom every subatomic particle is in constant motion spinning eternally even in the cold dark absolute vacuum of empty space there exist what new physics is calling the quantum vacuum flux it is The Ether of the Ancients the life force energy of metaphysics are the random fluctuations of this vast field of potential in which space and time are embedded now theoretically and mathematically proven the question no longer is does this Zero Point Energy exist but rather can we tap this inexhaustible resource of free and unlimited energy and manifest new technologies which are both inexpensive and environmentally [Music] safe one thing is certain if we continue on the course of rapidly burning fossil fuels and relying on nuclear fishion the future of our civilization is in grave Jeopardy we&#x27;re at a critical juncture where the ravages of industrial pollution and radioactive waste have exceeded the carrying capacity of Mother Earth our finite reserves of oil and gas will be completely exhausted by the year 2025 at the present rate of consumption large corporate and governmental self-interests ignore this pending crisis and resist chains to the status quo the question must be asked is this the kind of world we want to pass down to Future [Music] Generations emerging on the frontiers of science a pioneering breed of theoretical physicist and inspired inventors are challenging the way we think about harnessing the Unseen forces of nature despite ridicule lack of funding and outright suppression they are confronting an outmoded classical world view when ushering in a Monumental scientific revolution in this program you will witness the groundbreaking work of tireless inventors and Visionary scientists who may hold the keys to True energy Independence for every person on Earth from Nicola Tesla to the reality of coal fusion and Beyond join us as we present free energy the race to zero point [Music] most people would have agree you can&#x27;t get something for nothing there&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch and yet we get our oxygen free from the air we breathe we get sunlight free and water that used to be free until bottle drinking water came along but what about energy we&#x27;ve always had to pay for that whether it&#x27;s wood or coal oil or electricity it&#x27;s always been the rule that you can never get back more energy than what you put in in the first place that&#x27;s a fundamental law of nature physicist of the 19th century figured that out with the first law of thermodynamics the conservation of energy maybe so but science has come a long way since then and laws well there&#x27;s never been one that hasn&#x27;t been broken [Music] at the turn of the last century Nicola Tesla the great inventor who gave us alternating current in the Tesla coil stated electric power is everywhere present in unlimited quantities it can drive the world&#x27;s Machinery without the need of coal oil gas or any other fuel this new power for the driving of the world&#x27;s Machinery will be derived from the energy which operates the universe the cosmic energy with over 200 pack to his name Tesla was well on his way to transmitting electric power without wires when he ran into trouble with JP Morgan and the financial interest of 1901 his ambitious Warden Cliff project to magnify and transmit power to ships at Sea and eventually to provide free electricity for the whole world was scuttled by Morgan leaving Tesla penniless in disillusion the wealthy industrialist of the time knew that their vast plans to wire the world with proper from the mines they owned would be upset if they could no longer control the supply and means of delivery Tesla&#x27;s beliefs about developing technology in harmony with nature conflicted with the prevailing American attitude at the time that mankind was put on Earth to subdue and dominate nature little by little Tesla was denounced as a crackpot and deleted from the historical record at the time of his death in 1943 Tesla&#x27;s truckload of scientific papers were seized by US government agencies who knows what ideas and remarkable devices our world could have inherited if only his genius was recognized when JP Morgan prohibited Tesla from broadcasting uh electric power overseas with Warden Cliff Tower he said I can&#x27;t put a meter on it therefore I won&#x27;t Finance it that literally changed the course of history and for the past almost 100 years we&#x27;ve been uh suffering under that um profit motive of course one could say that mankind was hardly ready to handle the awesome forces Tesla had glimpsed the 20th century would bring world wars and technological innovations far more horrific than ever been witnessed by Western Civilization even before Tesla the groundwork that would lead to free energy had been pioneered by great scientists like Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell in 1831 Faraday modeled his rotating magnet and disc generator after the Earth whose rotation around a molten metal core keeps the planet spinning in a self-sustaining magnetic field his work later resulted in the development of the Dynamo also called a homopolar or unipolar generator the Faraday generator provides the basis for much of what is being done today in the electromagnetic approach to free energy such as with Bruce depalma&#x27;s in machine and peram mahamed tiwari&#x27;s space power generator repeated experiments have detected anomalous electrical outputs greater than that used to rotate the disc the friction and voltage limitations have hampered efficiency and therefore widespread acceptance James Clerk Maxwell best known for his Maxwell&#x27;s equations is reputed to have set things straight with his theories of electrical properties in a way that eliminates Zero Point Energy but Maxwell&#x27;s more advanced work allowed for the existence of an ether a substance finer than air which since the time of Plato had been considered a scientific fact the prevailing belief of the time was that the vacuum was a thin material fluid the so-called material ether which we know today is false the ether is there but it&#x27;s not the observable material fluid farity had reestablished this notion of lines of force but he thought the electromagnetic field or the electromagnetic disturbances in The Ether so to speak was really twanging strings the strings were under tension and when you had a disturbance what you really did was pluck the strings now Maxwell States very clearly that he set about to actually capture exactly what farity was doing in his lines of force in the theory and that&#x27;s what he did Maxwell&#x27;s actual theory is 20 equations and 20 unknowns in Quan which is a higher topology algebra you can do things in that you can&#x27;t dream of in doing in tensors and you certainly can&#x27;t do in vectors and you certainly can&#x27;t do with the theory that&#x27;s taught at our universities All That Remains to be rediscovered and uncovered the now famous mikkelson Mory experiment at the turn of the century failed to detect a stationary ether so classical physics presumed once in for all that it did not exist the case was closed until quantum mechanics reopened the discussion allowing for a new interpretation of how matter interacts with a zero point field most of our scientific Community actually believes that empty space the nature of of EMP of space itself is completely empty devoid of anything and historically it&#x27;s very interesting because in the 1800s and even earlier they believed there was an ether an all pervading substance filling up space and in 1905 when relativity Theory became very popular they said well we don&#x27;t need this ether it&#x27;s empty space is empty then and 25 years or 20 years later in 1925 when quantum mechanics comes into play all of a sudden a new energy appears in equations of quantum mechanics and it has to be there to make the equations work and it has it has to do with fluctuations of electromagnetic field energy at a very high frequency that interacts with everything and they call this the Zero Point Energy and it turns out that all the elementary particles interact with this energy and it becomes a potential energy source that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re discovering today well free energy is basically uh and another word for it is Zero Point Energy it&#x27;s energy that is contained within the vacuum of space and which is virtually undetectable by any traditional means in fact uh the the energy is homogeneous and isotropic the same everywhere the same in all directions and because of that it&#x27;s uh trying to extract it or measure it is sort of like the problem of trying to weigh a beaker of water underneath the surface of the ocean uh what do you measure with respect to what and that&#x27;s been the physicist dilemma and we&#x27;ve gone down uh one very large culdesac this Century uh the culdesac meaning that there is no such thing as Consciousness there is no such thing as this zero point field or this this place from which the energy can come and the answer now appears to be yes because uh theoretical physics and a number of experiments and quantum mechanics show very clearly the existence of this this all pervasive electromagnetic field called the zero point field in fact although Skeptics often point to Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity it was Einstein who in 1920 said there are Ry arguments to be induced in favor of the ISA hypothesis to deny the ISA is ultimately to assumes that empty space has no physical qualities whatsoever the fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize with this view according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities in this sense therefore there exists an EA according to the general theory of relativity space without EA is Unsinkable the term vacuum has been used in several totally different senses uh some Engineers use it to mean you just pump out all the air and that&#x27;s called a vacuum and that&#x27;s vacuum technology that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about we&#x27;re talking about empty SpaceTime we know today for example the lamb shift in quantum mechanics showed that this exchange of energy between the vacuum and the charged particles is in fact real and generates real effects and you can measure it and he was given the Nobel Prize lamb was for doing that kind of measurement and showing it in the physics literature so we know it&#x27;s real experimentally it&#x27;s detected the Casmir Shi for example shows clearly that it&#x27;s there and it does generate energetic effects in your actual materials it turns out that in the modern view the modern quantum mechanical View if you apply that knowledge that&#x27;s been gained there what you find is that the vacuum is fiercely active it&#x27;s a fierce energy flux and going in all directions at all times the energy density of that as estimated by various physicists is extremely high uh for example in one cubic centimeter if you could take the raw energy in that cubic centimeter and condense it into Mass divid it by c^2 you would have more observable Mass result from that than our largest telescope can see in the observable universe and all the stars and planets today and so the the energy that&#x27;s there is extremely dense and extremely Fierce this drives everything that we call physical reality from the quantum level right on up to the observed level in The observed world that we live in everything is energetically driven by the vacuum [Music] the Sea of energy in which the Earth floats was a revolutionary book written by T Henry Mor an electrical engineer and Tesla Enthusiast who in the early 20s began working on a device he claimed intercepted radiant energy from outer space his solid state detector the mor valve was designed with a complex series of semiconductors high voltage capacitors and trans Transformers hooked up to an antenna and a ground wire by stimulating the existing oscillations of space energy his radiant energy device ran for days putting out 50 KW of electricity his public demonstrations attracted newspaper coverage and scientists from Bell Laboratories and the department of agriculture&#x27;s rural electrification Administration although no one could find evidence of fraud neither could anyone explain how the radiant energy device worked during the 30s he developed semiconductors and transistors that were far ahead of their time unfortunately as all too many inventors have suffered when he refused to sell out to powerful interest Moray and his family were threatened shot at and the laboratory ransacked ignored by the US patent office Moray quietly stopped public disclosure of the device after it was destroyed by his assistant Felix frer a communist sympathizer who was frustrated with Mor declined his repeated offers to take that technology to Russia Today Mor&#x27;s Sons John and Richard continue to pursue their father&#x27;s dream in Europe Victor sha Berger&#x27;s Vortex experiments during the 1930s resulted in an advanced understanding of how the spiraling motions inherent in all natural systems reverse the effects of entropy by studying the properties of inwardly spiraling water he created an implosion gener that concentrated electrical charge Victor shurger is one of my heroes who talked about a a possible science based on the the uh inward motion rather than the let&#x27;s explode everything BL break it up and and uh study the atom by breaking it up into the little pieces let&#x27;s study the atom by looking at uh how it wants to move naturally in a spiraling motion and same with u everywhere you look in nature sha Berger&#x27;s ideas became widely known before World War II when he was coerced to work for the Nazis on exotic disc that resembled flying saucers as well as his energy generator in 1958 he traveled to the United States where he was told he could manufacture his devices but he was duped into signing over all of his rights and none of his inventions were ever developed returning to Austria he died a bitter and broken man Visionary philosopher artist and scientist Walter Russell&#x27;s contributions to the understanding of energy are significant even though ignored by mainstream Academia Russell&#x27;s revised periodical table of the elements based on a spiral predicted many unknown elements and Isotopes like plutonium and dyum his cosmological theories about the mystical nature of reality challenged physicists to think in terms of energy light and matter as one [Music] substance there&#x27;s electricity in the air it&#x27;s a common expression and one that&#x27;s true take a comb run it through your hair on a dry day and you can get a static shot sure it&#x27;s electricity all right but could it also be tapped to produce sufficient energy we could all use Benjamin Franklin is credited as being the inventor of the electrostatic motor back in the 1700s but its power output was modest the wimhurst electrostatic generator is a high voltage mechanism developed in the 1800s which can be hand or self-started and will produce dramatic sparking while charging Laden jars today it&#x27;s used in teaching about electricity but its practical applications are considered inconsequential a high-tech variation of the whims device is the testaa or swiss ml converter developed by Paul Balman of the maternity community in Switzerland during the 70s this free energy device is a Marvel that has been in operation for more than 20 years supplying electricity to the small self-sufficient Christian Community many technical experts have come away stumped by its excess output however because the community feels that that the majority of mankind is not ready to be responsible for such unlimited energy they&#x27;re keeping the technology Under Wraps until such time the world is spiritually prepared other researchers like Dr olle jeffo continued to pursue real world applications for harnessing the electrostatic motor his accomplishment I feel is the best is that he used a specific type of electr which is a waxy substance which holds charge and um it&#x27;s like a in many ways a magnet electrical analog of a magnet and he&#x27;s achieved A.1 horsepower motor which is a small device so and this runs continually on atmospheric electricity like the homopolar generator the electrostatic motor is based on the Dynamics of our Earth environment as with wind and solar power they offer real sustainable Alternatives that with only modest gains on efficiency could contribute to the replacement of of our current dependence on fossil fuels are we clever enough to learn from the clues our planet is [Music] providing upon the foundation of innovative thinkers and inventors like Tesla and Mory the Modern Age of free energy research began in the 1950s as waves of flying saucer sightings occurred throughout the United States and while an infant space program was trying to catch up with the Russians launch of Sputnik a man named T Townsen Brown was busy on experiments that defied conventional understanding about electricity gravitation and propulsion along with doctors Paul bfield and agnu bonson brown took high voltage to the next extreme in this rare home movie the earliest experiments in Electro gravitics are [Music] recorded by using High voltages over 20,000 and up to 200,000 volts Brown discovered that highly charged capacitors would exhibit a noticeable thrust in One Direction ction although a warded a patent for his electrokinetic generator no one has ever reproduced his experiment until recently Larry Davenport shown here demonstrating his replication of Brown&#x27;s electrokinetic apparatus explains but when I first began to read brown stuff I didn&#x27;t quite understand the difference between the ion wind devices which there&#x27;s a lot of them out there and some of them are are very efficient as far as producing ion wind and his particular apparatus I finally decided to do Brown&#x27;s work in in uh 1994 I looked at his device I i&#x27; tried several different things and they hadn&#x27;t worked I thought well Brown is supposed to be the pioneer of this or so the people that make the claims in their that get the patents they always refer to his name so I thought I&#x27;ll go back and I&#x27;ll try to do this getting it balanced was real important his method of repulsion specifically was using the charge separation high voltage charge Separation on a vehicle he found that circular craft were better for that application than uh wingcraft however um recently we found through Dr Paul of Violet&#x27;s research that the B2 bomber actually seems to qualify as an electric gravitic craft the military has admitted that it electrically charges the forward Leading Edge of the wings uh there&#x27;s also a very high dialectric being used depleted uranium is used on the forward edge of the Wings and whether or not there are other applications for that technology in that design we&#x27;re recognizing that because the exhaust gas is also negatively ionized that all of a sudden we have the high voltage charge separation that&#x27;s necessary to provide an extra propulsive Force especially at high velocities so electrogravity in that aspect is a very simple process but does provide a good amount of force for a very small amount of energy input as with many other promising inventions developed during the Cold War years the national secrecy act prevented scientists like T towns and Brown from commercializing or even publicizing any technology which could potentially be interpreted as having a military application the Triumph of America space exploration program gave way to the era of limits in the late 70s the infamous energy crisis made us all aware of our dependence on finite resources many adventor promised dramatic results with devices they said would solve the crisis claims of overunity where power output exceeds input were routinely announced but when put to the test most of their crude prototypes perform per poorly or not at all measuring methods were and still are extremely difficult to perform accurately the few that did achieve modest gains and output were dismissed by mainstream Academia and denied patents and without patent protection investors have no Financial incentive to lay out the millions of dollars it takes to mass produce and Market these devices no matter how promising the technology and after all classical Newtonian Dynamics got us to the moon and I Einstein&#x27;s e equal mc² explained that energy could neither be created nor destroyed anything else which seemed otherwise was labeled perpetual motion Unworthy of scientific examination when I started out in 1980 um free energy was something that we didn&#x27;t talk about we talked about it under behind closed doors uh the conferences often were visited by people we didn&#x27;t know and um and the information was spread in various means so that all non-conventional energy which was a phrase we developed was appearing in uh military solicitations so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a controversial topic that at that time actually had the connotation that there was something from nothing therefore it was unscientific and these are a bunch of lunatics who talking and um sooner or later the scientists will educate them about what&#x27;s the um the various laws of physics that are being violated most of the scientists equated any notion of a free energy or overunity device as being a perpetual motion uh machine and therefore utter nonsense you see it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a play on words the scientists interpreted it one way the guys trying to do it are looking at it as an open system now fortunately today we have a type of thermodynamics uh you know Nobel prizes have been issued for it to prene for example uh four systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium that do have they open systems and the energy does flow in from outside and through them those kinds of systems can produce overunity it&#x27;s all perfectly legitimate physics today most scientists are unaware of the literature that the Zero Point Energy even exists mainly because most scientists aren&#x27;t physicists now a few of the I went to school and I became a pH getting a PhD in electrical engineering and systems engineering and not one Professor ever heard of it and yet there it was in the library so part of it is most scientists are specialists in their own area and science today is very fragmented now for those know that the Z Point Energy exists they may argue well it&#x27;s random in its nature and therefore it can&#x27;t be tapped as an energy source but very recent work in thermodynamics by ilot Prine who won the Nobel Prize in 1978 shows how this energy could become self-organized if the proper system&#x27;s conditions could be fulfilled and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening in some of the experiments and some of the inventions that are tapping this this energy and producing anomalous energy another resistance is the physics Community especially that really know about this energy realized if you could R it everything would change the nature of physics would change uh the most important foundation of all physics would then be the Quantum of the quantum energy that&#x27;s in embedded in space and really we don&#x27;t understand it and it&#x27;s extremely mathematically difficult to do computations in it and it turns out it&#x27;s probably going to be the basis of string theory in the future and therefore what seems to be nothing will actually be understood as a field effect as a tapping of um energy that has already available but can&#x27;t be seen um even the radio WS for example the television set is a good example uh if you show that to a primitive tribe it looks like a magical box but it&#x27;s literally converting invisible energy in the air to um to signals and pictures a Paddle Wheel in the river that&#x27;s used to power meal grind corn is a free energy device so is a windmill for example what we mean is we are taking the energy from an ex external source and using it so it&#x27;s an open system and the the environment of the system is Furnishing a flow of energy into the system which the system is then collecting and using primary requirements it has to be an open system it has to have an external source of energy to furnish the energy that we&#x27;re going to use and therefore it&#x27;s no more mysterious than a windmill and now we&#x27;re coming full circle and realizing that uh physics metaphysics that um some of the Notions of the 19th century such as The Ether and the vortex are now being dusted off and those ideas are being melded with uh modern experiments plus quantum mechanics and so forth into this magnificent magnificent synthesis of what I call sacred science of a whole new science a whole new physics in which Consciousness remains or Reigns Supreme and where we don&#x27;t have to follow any particular Guru or leader or or anything like that that we have everything we need in the universe it&#x27;s ours to have right now and these are some of the basic Essence principles that lie underneath the discovery of free [Music] energy the force of inertia is known in mechanics but until only recently it had been considered too weak and difficult to harness for propulsion According to some theorists like how put off inertia like gravity is what occurs when we try to accelerate an object against the zero point fluctuations in the vacuum we run into resistance literally Canadian inventor Roy thornson has developed an inertial impulse propuls from engine which overcomes that resistance using centrifugal force it pushes against nothing and emits no exhaust but it&#x27;s been calculated to be 20 times more efficient than a jet engine [Music] here the thornson inertial propulsion Drive Powers a canoe in a swimming [Music] pool the motor which is housed in a BNS never contacts the water or air in the pendulum test unidirectional force is being generated to keep the pendulum to one side you know that&#x27;s what we want to avoid is when it slap whether or not we can demonstrate is I have with engineering analysis and um and models that will climb an incline will pass us a pendulum test in other words stay on one side of the pendulum consistently and even power a canoe in a swimming pool commercialization of that device is still a very difficult Road and we see that in many inventions but what I like to emphasize is my f overp uh measurement of that is literally 20 times better than the jet engine a jet engine typically commercial jet engine um the dc9 I think is the one that I analyzed has about 016 Newtons per watt and then this is in the metric system now when we look at the thornson he&#x27;s able to achieve. 3. 32 Newtons per watt literally 20 times better than the Gen engine Roy thornson is developing refinements to his system to increase its performance unfortunately like many adventor even with a the US Patent in hand he has yet to find sufficient investment Capital to bring his motor to the marketplace propotion for does in fact [Music] exist we&#x27;ve all seen these little toy gizmos that demonstrate lightning in the bottle it&#x27;s the electric phenomenon called plas discharge various inventors working independently are coming up with some exotic combinations of gases metals and processes to actually squeeze excess electrical energy out of this phenomenon of nature in 1996 Paulo and Alexandra Korea received the first patent for such a device called the pulsed abnormal glow discharge reactor the first of its kind to convert plasma discharge directly into electricity this is a standard Utah inventor Paul Panton has developed what he calls the G fuel processor a plasma generator similar to a super carburetor that actually appears to run on 80% water and is entirely non-polluting this device replaces the carburetor and exhaust and combines them as one unit whereas this end of it acts as a miniature Refinery allowing the engine to run on everything from battery acid and water mixed to crude oil right out of the ground this is Angola crude a 39.5 Gravity the exhaust coming down goes around and comes out here at the far end the center chamber draws some of the heat from the exhaust plus this tube takes some of the exhaust gases takes them up into the chamber and Bubbles them down to the bottom the Bubbles as it comes through the fuel are brought up to the top of the chamber picked up through a tube and fed up the center of the exhaust pipe while they&#x27;re being fed up the exhaust pipe they are in a vacuum and there&#x27;s a heat exchange which occurs this process has been argument argued a few times to be either a plasma field no electrofield we do know that it does have a slight radiation which is not Alpha Beta or gamma and we do have x-rays to show that whatever is coming from the unit does get affected different from stainless steel than the regular steel y when the temperature of the exhaust is the same as the air temperature going in from the air portion up here normally 1 3% more oxygen coming out of the tail pipe in there is in the air we&#x27;re breathing and no carbon at all carbon vanishes I wouldn&#x27;t say vanishes I would say transmuted into some other substance a lighter element because we have an abundance of lighter elements here that are not explained from down here but during the heat process uh there are molecular changes after running this engine from 1983 until now and many times we had it running 88 8 and 1 half hours a day uh we have never had to change a spark plug change the oil or clean it we have taken the head off three times to inspect the inside of it and it&#x27;s been spotless what we have here is the p tone G device fitted to a Ford 2300c 4- cylinder engine as you can see we had we have a a see-through container here which holds the fu as the engine is started air is drawn in by vacuum through the fuel and Bubbles the fuel the vapors of which are drawn off here they travel down this hose into our reaction chamber they go up the reaction chamber and return back out here to be intake to be taken into the engine through this tube this is our air filter and this tube is connected to another valve which are controlled by this linkage operating the air intake and the fuel intake this is the valve that controls pulls the return air going through this tube into the [Music] bumber fuel just now coming up the level uh during the testing with the 2300cc pter we have achieved efficiency up to and including 300% of normal uh if this engine normally got 20 m to the gallon on the highway uh you&#x27;d now be looking at 60 uh our load tests and whatnot have not been completed but we feel very confident that there&#x27;s not going to be a power problem out there that wasn&#x27;t I witnessed the uh demonstrations by Paul Pantone and I was astonished by the claim uh of ability to use any uh fuel or water including mixed with oil and so forth it&#x27;s similar to something that&#x27;s validated already by gunman that&#x27;s being used in the state of Nevada at the moment uh however this is an even more shocking claim uh because it appears that it is truly if it&#x27;s correct and if it can be validated he seems quite open it appears that this may be yet another process which which does some kind of transmutation of elements he claims there&#x27;s no carbon coming out of the exhaust which is would be Unthinkable for putting a a hydrocarbon fuel in even if it&#x27;s mixed with water you have to get carbon out and and he&#x27;s claiming that there are no uh Co or CO2 emissions from this and there appear to be none visually uh that is appear to be no soot of particles coming out of the exhaust so I hold out some hopes for this so our demonstration units that&#x27;ll be going out to about 25,000 Stations between now and the end of the year or early next year are being retrofit as we speak now to include our system in the exhaust pipe and our injector body here with standard equipment that normally is supplied from the factory so that we can get it out to the public as quickly as possible hopefully after being rejected by dozens of us manufacturers Panton now has contracts with several major foreign countries recently several us companies have decided to take a second [Music] look and the fusion between these components in 1989 two physicists from the University of Utah Dr Stanley ponds and Dr Martin fleshman created a media frenzy with their announcement of cold fusion in a bottle although several independent experiments reported similar test results The Cry of fraud quickly went up at MIT and other prestigious universities the debunking was Swift and merciless throughout the history of science anytime there is something that is very threatening to the established ideas such as Galileo&#x27;s Revelations through the telescope and his idea following on others that the earth goes around the Sun not vice versa continental drift uh all sorts of claims that ultimately became validated the ini IAL reaction of science is to say this is nonsense and to reject it and not even to look at the data and I would say that the cold fusion and free energy or new energy phenomena are so threatening to the undermining underpinnings of of modern physics and chemistry and all other sciences that you would get the you get the expected intensely negative reaction the real story about Cal Fusion is that it never died died soon after the announcement in Utah on March 23rd 1989 uh hundreds thousands of people all over the world scientists engineers began to try they began to try to replicate the ponds and flashmen experiment and positive results kept coming in uh of all manner uh including the energy the excess energy far more out than in than could be possibly explained by any chemical action or any previously stored energy the unfortunate situation was that the US Department of energy masterminded a a bogus panel of so-called experts who many of whom were biased from the start against the subject they came up with the expected answer with only with within 3 months and they ratified it within 6 months even as the evidence continued those physicists nuclear physicist that have been working with hot Fusion the toomax this type of thing they have a monstrous amount of evidence that shows exactly what they expect to have happen with nuclear reactions in this hot gas plasma they believe and it&#x27;s a good a good first guess that the nuclear reactions that would occur in a cold fusion cell should be the same well Mother Nature doesn&#x27;t always accept our predispositions to belief therefore Mother Nature says this this is a different environment these are different reactions and hey guys start studying a little harder and find out what&#x27;s going on the problems that occur in evaluating a cold fusion device have not been so much does it work but does it work every time and many uh many scientists are of the opinion that it doesn&#x27;t work every time then there&#x27;s something wrong uh basically the problem has been in the preparation of the metal now this is particularly true in the heavy water experiments of ponds and flashmen certain materials will just absolutely close off the effect of the cells other things are finding additions will promote the effect so there&#x27;s a lot of study going on in that area it&#x27;s over 200 Laboratories in over 30 countries have replicated or Advanced or or or had successes in various types of cold fusion devices the Patterson Power Cell of Clean Energy Technologies of Dallas Texas is one of the most spectacular devices in the cold fusion field it also happens to be the first device that has a United States patent which is also very important it got it almost by accident since there are hundreds of patent applications that the patent office is rejecting what this cell is is it&#x27;s very similar to the pond and fman concept except it uses tiny little metal coated beads with either nickel Palladium nickel or even sometimes just nickel and ordinary water not the heavy water which Pon and fman started with uh and it does produce with a flowing stream of this liquid or electrolyt uh with just a little bit of uh lithium sulfate salt mixed in it uh it produces spectacular energy in in fact in one experiment uh they turn the power off completely and the cell contined to produce 20 watts of power unmistakable for uh at least 14 hours and my understanding is that could go on for a number of days longer uh the typical uh Power ratios of this kind of a cell it&#x27;s very robust totally repeatable is anywhere from uh 10 to a, to one okay when you have even a tiny bit of input power they&#x27;ve had it go over 1,000 Watts with only a watt or so input electricity clearly these cells can be made to to self sustain that is continue by themselves this evening Dennis Cravens is an independent scientist who has done firstand research studying the effects of the Patterson power cell picture the important thing is uh notice over here total excess energy is usually in the mega range if you run through a chemical calculation of how much metal you have in there about 20 milligram turn the crank how many moles is that how much you assume about 100 KCAL per mole for your chemist types of a typical energetic reaction if you can think of one we can&#x27;t think of one but if there was one uh you maybe get 32 kcals if you burned all the metal so we are three or four hours of magnitude more energy out of the system integrated energy out than if we were burning everything chemically if you do the calculations you&#x27;ll find that you can get there it&#x27;s more likely that a few percentage of them are in the millions electron volt region it&#x27;s been revealed recently that the Patterson cell will actually keep producing heat for at least 14 hours after it shut off this is a phenomenal Discovery it has not been advertised or publicized very well but what that means is we&#x27;re actually dealing with a free energy source uh the inventors never use that phrase and for obvious purposes um but the important thing is that it does need need more understanding and and also it has the keys to our U the type of device that we need the interesting thing about the patteron cell too is that as a byproduct it produces hydrogen and oxygen it&#x27;s actually using water any type of water and electrolyzing that water and then just exhausting the hydrogen and oxygen now we could see two views of that for example if we&#x27;re actually forced into a situation where we&#x27;re in an enclosed space and U not able to spend too much time Outdoors which we already spend 90% indoors anyways um the supply of oxygen is very valuable whether or not we even use the hydrogen but it&#x27;s possible we could also store the hydrogen and therefore have hydrogen powered vehicles and use the oxygen IND doors another area that has emerged as a result of cold fusion which is every bit as uh heretical and disastrous to the scientific Enterprise as the overunity and the greater energy out than in is the transmutation of metals uh that is heavy metals in ordinary coal Fusion experiments they have now seen in the metal changes in elements for example the production of copper the production of other Isotopes such as rodium uh the change of Palladium in into other things uh this is confirmed there&#x27;s no doubt about it and it&#x27;s occurring with minimal energy input so what this leads to is an analogy with the old claims of the Alchemists who were able historically they said and there&#x27;s some evidence that they were able to do it to do low energy processes that produced gold from lead or Mercury or other things um this is now being done in Laboratories and every instance I know of in the history of science where a small effect was seen initially to produce something was later scaled up so there&#x27;s it&#x27;s quite possible that our culture will enter an age of alchemy in which low energy processes can make precious metals as we look toward the future I believe we&#x27;ll be able to find ways in which we can create the kind of elements that we need by these low energy nuclear reactions I think we&#x27;ll be able to start adding two or picking apart or changing the nucleus of atoms to be able to get the kind of stable atoms that we need but more important I thoroughly believe that we will be able to take the radioactive materials add a proton or add some changes to it and make those radioactive materials non-radioactive and that is going to be a great Boon to our present uh right to our to clean up the mess that we&#x27;ve left behind from our atomic bombs from our nuclear power plants and of course from things like Chernobyl so in the future we have laid the groundwork with cold fusion by which we&#x27;ll be able to handle a whole array of nuclear changes that here to for have been have been outside of the current model of what can can be done with nuclear reactions there are many power companies throughout the United States that are now on alert and they&#x27;re sending their representatives to Coal Fusion conferences we meet them all the time they give support they um they really will be the Vanguard of uh the new energy age uh I believe that uh any utility company that does not get into this now is doomed because frankly when we have have generators of electricity and heat that can stay in a home or a building uh why would anyone want to be plugged into the grid the wire grid any longer this would make no sense people will argue against that but I think the grid will disappear a remarkable process for sure and one that offers exciting developments in the near future but does the task of extracting energy from our environment really require such exotic Ultra advanced technology that potentially would still put it under the control of large profit-driven interest the rare metal Palladium still have to be prospected mined and purified or are there simpler InDesign low maintenance Technologies available that could be bought off the shelf and installed by anyone for an affordable one-time fee we&#x27;re going to look in depth at several individuals and companies who have been working for years perfecting devices that they claim will do just that [Music] [Music] no one person in the free energy field has been as determined and persistent as Mississippi inventor Joseph Newman since the 70s Newman has been denied us patents repeatedly on his energy machine even though numerous Engineers scientists and even Congressman have testified on his behalf 1968 I invented a bike that would get a wheelie and I used an 80lb flywheel that I had built and took a positive clut out of a 30 horsepower motor put it above the axis of the back wheel a kid get up on it build up in urser on that 80 lb flywheel it engaged that positive clutch immediately the front end jump up off the ground it leave La six on the pavment about that long and kids eyes you know get big as silver dollar they were just a static over it but I had heard the word that a gyroscope was a stabilizer so I went to the library got a book on gyroscopes and when I started reading the mechanical characteristics of a gyroscope the question that had dogged my mind for 3 years how did that current know which direction to go and why was why was it when you went parallel you&#x27;d get nothing I saw the laws of a gyroscope match that exactly if you study the laws of a gyroscope if you take uh this little uh gyroscope here if I can spin it up you can see that it does but I think every kid knows it&#x27;s true now if you pivot that One Direction it goes one way you pivot the other way it goes the other way if I turn it around 180° now if I push it up it goes the opposite direction push it up it goes the opposite direction if I go parallel it does not pivot long as I maintain a parallel position that&#x27;s exactly what happens when you move a conductor through a magnetic field you push down on it the current go in One Direction you push up It Go opposite direction you turn the magnet over 180° everything will reverse you push down parallel to the lines of force uh with the copper wire and you get nothing it told me that the energy in a magnetic field was a gyroscopic particle now I didn&#x27;t care what the rest of the world was saying because they couldn&#x27;t answer my honest question it was obvious to me the energy in a magnetic field consists of gyroscopic particles it is a mechanical essence of Einstein&#x27;s equation of equals n c squ it moves forward at C and it spins it C that&#x27;s Einstein&#x27;s equation of equal MC s it only occurs when you get atom alignment in material I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s conductor iron what it is when the atoms align the magnetic field will appear come outside the boundaries of the material and giv on running river that you can tap into and what I&#x27;m going to show you is an energy technology that&#x27;s going to totally change your life that the status quo power Brokers have been fighting and I&#x27;ll show you the history of it they didn&#x27;t want you to have it but you can see for yourself that this works and the part of this for you to see it is to watch these meters because these meters are going to show you that there&#x27;s more power in this system than flows from this battery the magnet run down this shaft from one end to the other it&#x27;s hex shape with six-sided this blue represents a call running this way the red represents the car running at right angles to it the commentator shows that you break that circuit every 90° so you fire into one car far into the next coil now you notice this gets higher as it&#x27;s running because the batteries start getting charged now this one&#x27;s going from 200 up to 400 you see that there&#x27;s more current being produced by this system then those batteries are capable of delivering because batteries will not produce RF power so the RF power must be coming from the motor now RF power is true power and the way you know this this meter only works by converting the Heat and the heat is converted into electricity because it runs through a resistor it&#x27;s a very accurate measuring device so you well over twice the current is flowing in this system and these batteries are capable of delivering and the batteries cannot produce RF power now this is real power it has to be coming from the system it clearly shows that the energy output of the system is greater than the energy inputed into the system and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been saying that&#x27;s what&#x27;s more than 30 scientists who came to my home from around the world some of them came my way from England signed affidavits that the invention worked um the special Master to the court Mr William Skyler who was a former Commissioner of patents um he was an electrical engineer the federal judge chose him saying his credentials were superb he looked at those affidavits and gave the men the credit they were doe he said the evidence was overwhelming The Invention work there was no contradictory factual evidence and the patent office had knly not followed the formalities of the patent law to us as an observer we see everything as motionless we see objects and they sit still and everything in the shop sitting still and so we think that&#x27;s to us again as the Observer we think the natural state of our planet is non-o motion but when re in reality you get down to the basic Bank up of the atoms of this material and you see that the natural state of the universe is motion the unnatural state is what I have concluded is the lack of motion to The Observer because that&#x27;s when it can it forms into something and becomes a solid mass that will be interacted by other masses sitting close to it that causes is to sit still and not be able to travel because of its attraction so we come along as the Observer and we say the natural state of the of the planets and the universe is lack of motion just like uh we believe that so strongly just several hundred years ago we believe that the uh Earth was the center of the universe and that uh we were everything and they even believe that the Stars even back at keper times was only like a cake full with raisins three miles thick and the stars were little tiny raisins in it and that was our bias and our prejudice based on what we saw that everything should centralize around us and uh I&#x27;m saying now we should open our eyes and our brain to see the magnitude what lays in front of us space travel will become a reality uh our children growing up will have an excitement and a uh a universe to travel into but the values of the human race has to change with that while Joe Newman is still fighting for recog igntion and just compensation many entrepreneurs are racing to be the first into the marketplace with magnetic motors that are built with Hightech Space Age materials and employ microprocessors to regulate pulsations and RPM David Porter of galtech semiconductors demonstrates his recently patented permanent magnet motor called the carousel electric generator this is the latest version of the carousel motor generator uh it&#x27;s a rotary version rotor inside there&#x27;s 18 separate sections what we call a coil section in here 18 make up the outer diameter uh there&#x27;s six coils here that we&#x27;re using to drive the motor and the top here we have an encoder which sends a pulse down to the electronics and basically lets the electronics know where the rotor the rotating part here is in relationship to the coils and tells the coils when to turn on and off uh that&#x27;s done by a specific index point that the encoder has that sets the relationship between the two and the electronics down here in the box is basically a set of uh TTL logic counters it counts the number of Pulses from the encoder and it turns the power on and off to different qu oils depending on where the rotor is at the time we have also hooked up to this system a connection to the computer over here what it gives us the opportunity to do is change the duty cycle on the system we can change it from a pulse rate of one pulse per cycle up to uh 40 pulses per cycle which would be 100% duty cycle uh that is Incorporated in and what we do is change the pulse rate on the computer it downloads the data to the electronics when the index pulse comes around which comes around once per Revolution it updates the data in the counters and that&#x27;s what changes the pulse rate on the system okay we don&#x27;t have an automatic start on the system right now that&#x27;s something that the Intel chip will do we started up at a pulse rate of approximately 13 pulses which gives us a 16% duty cycle it takes a while to spool up um because like I say it works also as its own flywheel so we build up the power gradually the thing about this system is is that everything floats on the magnetic field in there uh you have very little internal friction once the system gets up to the speed it stabilizes as a certain RPM right now we&#x27;re running at about a 30% duty cycle per channel the speed is still coming up a little [Music] bit calculate the speed off of the scope here and we&#x27;re running about 1,50 RPM this white and the green shows the two channels on the motor the little spikes there are the amount of time that each channel is on and the flat part at the bottom is the amount that it&#x27;s off so you can see how much it&#x27;s pulsing and how much time it&#x27;s off and how much time it&#x27;s on one of the analogies we like to use is it&#x27;s like uh if you pick someone up and take them across the street you use a lot of energy if you put them in a tire once you get a started all you got to do is tap a little bit and so you use a lot less energy to move the same load and that&#x27;s what we do we build it up to a high speed and then we just tap it with a little with a little juice as it goes around and we use the inertia built into the system to take it the the rest of the way there so we&#x27;re using a a high-speed pulse on the system what we&#x27;re doing is removing the energy from the magnet the magnet has a specific life they lose approximately 1% a year so we&#x27;re not actually trying to create energy from nothing the system will not run forever it&#x27;s not perpetual motion uh we use the amount of energy that is in the magnets once that energy is used up the magnets can be taken out they can be recharged all we&#x27;re doing is maximizing the efficiency of the electromagnetic flux density that&#x27;s there to the production of electrical output when will we be able to see free energy devices powering consumer products like this electric car well they&#x27;re already here and you may be able to purchase one by the time you see this program in Oklahoma where oil has been King for over a century inventor Troy Reed has been busy in his shop constructing rotating magnetic Motors that he believes will soon revolutionize how we get around and it does work this is a new prototype of the magnetic motor and if I can explain a little bit about what you call a magnetic field all magnets the big old wooden prototype has a system as the motor went over it had attention to jerk jerk over like that if you take this motor here and you take your finger finger and rotate it it doesn&#x27;t have that jerking in it so what I&#x27;ve done I got rid of the crankshaft I got rid of the crankshaft I&#x27;ve got rid of of the the injectors and the system in this motor here as you crank this motor up and like you do the other one the motor will start running and uh what I&#x27;ll do I&#x27;ll energize it on this motor here if you can see these amp gauges over here this will come when we get it up to about 150 volts we&#x27;ll unplug it and we&#x27;ll turn the light on if you turn this around where you can see this side here all the working parts is behind this system here operates from a little computer takes this 5 volts it&#x27;s 150 volt what we&#x27;re going to do turn off all the switches make sure there ain&#x27;t nothing plugged into it there&#x27;s the plug there&#x27;s your 110 volts motor still running you can operate this table Plum around still got energy running no nothing tied up in the back of it nothing on the floor rotate around still running off running electricity so we&#x27;re looking hoping hoping this time next year that you&#x27;ll be able to use it in your home so that&#x27;s another and what&#x27;s good about this you talking about electric automobiles this car this right here can sit in back of electric automobile and generate electric charged batteries up in a car beautiful automobile you can drive it anywhere you want to it don&#x27;t flute the air all the other electric automobiles that I&#x27;ve actually seen has been nothing but this standard transmission this is an automatic transmission car there&#x27;s not a whole lot of what you call junk I would call under cars uh I&#x27;ve seen a lot of electric cars that had a lot of stuff in it only thing that this has has the battery to run the uh radio uh the BL we&#x27;ve got two safety switches over here that can be mounted into an enclosed uh system but we did this where you could see where people can see this car with the technology it&#x27;s a safety switch system this is a controller box a Curtis control box it cuts the amperage down so with the amperage here&#x27;s what&#x27;s real good about electric automobiles all electric automobiles that has sege technology with this in it they Creed heat they&#x27;ve got to have a fan to blow this blow this um this Curtis controller off because it gets hot we don&#x27;t want that to get hot we want to stay that cold cuz once it stays cold you save on all the all the computer chips that&#x27;s in this uh controller so that means you can go farther longer and you&#x27;ll have no problems this electric automobile has got two gauges in front of the shifter on the automatic transmission is called the voltage and the amperage that&#x27;s what I was talking about earlier about amperage on automobiles let&#x27;s see if we can&#x27;t get the amperage to go down instead going up the voltage on this here should say somewhere around 120 volts when we start out there&#x27;s no amperage at all so the gauges is down below here and we&#x27;re getting ready to take and go drive the car and uh you can see for yourself what it does all you do is just take and put it in gear and the motor sounds like a little sports car shifts runs good fantastic automobile drives if you&#x27;ll see the amperage on the Gat see going down amperage goes way down that&#x27;s what&#x27;s that&#x27;s what I like about electric car if you floorboard the car the most it will do would just be about maybe 100 amps and that&#x27;s what we want to do is to keep the amperage down on electric car so it&#x27;ll go anywhere uh really anybody wants to go if you want to take a trip you don&#x27;t have to worry about it going and go plug in the house cuz it&#x27;s called The Surge technology um it&#x27;s a beautiful automobile and I love it and I put a lot of hard work in this car and we&#x27;re going to make it no oil no gas to fol with and the technology is here it&#x27;s going to be here it&#x27;s going to go it&#x27;s going to work beautiful for the whole world for mankind see you around this is your future people [Music] as we have seen so far electromagnetism seems to be offering the most viable path for many contemporary inventors the magnetic motor continues to challenge the overunity barrier but even simpler methods are being demonstrated through common Ingenuity Dennis Lee a better world technology has been struggling to pursue his dream of achieving energy Independence for everyone on the planet held in prison for 2 years without ever being convicted of a crime Lee mounts public demonstrations in major US cities lining up individual dealerships to Market his devices a controversial figure who some dismiss as a fraud and others see as legitimate if outspoken PT Barnum of free power to the people Lee has assembled an impressive line of prototypes and processes including those by other inventors like Ule Brown although he claims it machines are not utilizing Zero Point Energy because they draw heat from the surrounding air his numerous devices supposedly achieve super efficiency rates by recycling excess energy through closed loop systems I built the world&#x27;s most efficient heat pump and uh developed it and these are the evaporators for that heat pump right here they&#x27;re 8 ft High 3 ft wide now the refrigerant we put in here boils at 40° below zero therefore anytime day or night outside in a way in a rainstorm or in a wind storm or hail storm or a snowstorm or just out in a nice hot sunny day or in the middle of a cold night as long as the refrigerant that&#x27;s inside this panel is colder than whatever the air is out here or the phenomenon that&#x27;s hitting this panel then the heat from the air or the Sun or the wind or the rain or the sne or the snow will be transferred in into the refrigerant on the other side because it&#x27;s a second law of Thermodynamics hot goes to cold so if this is the coldest thing outside anything out there that touches it is going to give its heat to it a little bit of heat goes a long way that gas starts expanding like crazy and as it expands it then is drawn into the compressor not through suction I&#x27;ve got engineers and inventors that don&#x27;t like to use the term suction but through negative pressure so as the compressor is creating this negative pressure the gas is migrating to it and so a compressor is a gas pump it&#x27;ll pump gas and so the gas is being pumped by the compressor into the compressor elevated in temperature and even though if you touch this panel it&#x27;s ice cold to your hand and if you touch the line going out of the panel it still lies cold to your hand when it hits that compressor compressor takes all the gas in this space puts it in that space elevates the pressure in the temperature going out of the compressor do not touch that line whenever that thing is on because it&#x27;s 200 to 250° hot and so that&#x27;s where we get the heat all of the heat is transferred in here we then use a compressor to take the uh relatively useless energy that we&#x27;ve got and Elevate the temperature and pressure and make it very useful energy then that heat would be transferred later this is a direct drive compressor this direct drive compressor takes uh Freon from the uh panels and it runs that because this direct drive is uh causing the Pistons to go up and down that gives us heat into the boiler the boiler expands the other fron back through that into a double acting piston that&#x27;s going back and forth we&#x27;re converting with mechanical apparatuses we&#x27;re converting that into shaft rotation that shaft rotation turns this wheel as this wheel turns it causes the compressor to turn as the Compressor Supplies the heat it causes this wheel to turn you might say these two wheels are powering each other and by the way once the freon has taken the heat it then made the power it then goes up here this is a condenser we&#x27;re sucking water out of the bottom of the tank could be the well and we&#x27;re running the water through this pump right here that&#x27;s also driven by the same Drive mechanism running the water into this condenser it&#x27;s the world&#x27;s most efficient condenser at 100° delta T 6 million BTUs and as we&#x27;re then running the water through we&#x27;re making the water hotter but the water will also be being pumped and as I do this I&#x27;ll show you the water being pumped and then also we&#x27;re cooling down the pron which is going into this canister and is being pumped right back into the boiler by a little trombone uh pump that&#x27;s running on the same cylinder you&#x27;re ready to try it let&#x27;s go ahead and try it let&#x27;s turn it on guys okay if you&#x27;re ready mro anytime you&#x27;re [Music] ready okay so it is pumping water from energy taken out of the air and we&#x27;ll light the lights too from excess energy so the lights are being lit from excess energy from the air they&#x27;re pulsing it wasn&#x27;t set up to do that so we don&#x27;t have it stable but we thought we&#x27; just demonstrate the Excess power that we have main thing is it&#x27;s pumping water it&#x27;s supposed to be pumping water that&#x27;s a closed loop because it&#x27;s continuing to go through the boiler and in back I had a heat pump in a walk-in freezer we crank the temperature down to 20° below zero in dead air space now imagine this if you got any background in refrigeration we&#x27;re in dead air space the temperatur is 20 below zero we did it every single Saturday for an entire year people from all over the world came to see it we said bring your own test equipment take the thing apart if you want to we had a $10,000 challenge to find any gimmick or anything in it and every single weekend we cranked the temperature down to 20 below in dead air space and we made water hot enough to burn your hand from we took out of that box at 20 below at a 2:1 cop same average performance of the GE heat pump in America only it&#x27;s 20 below in dead airspace and we challenged all the heat pump manufacturers to come any time you want to either find a hoax with us or bring your unit down and see if you can do that nobody ever came a lot of customers came lots of people people from all the world came Pakistan everywhere so anyway we&#x27;re in here testing this every year every uh every weekend for a year and a man came to the show one day and if what a what a guy this was now we&#x27;re trying to build this thing it&#x27;s going to take two years and $2 million and I&#x27;m raising Capital selling heat pump things to get the money and a guy walks in and he comes up to me at the end of the show and he says Mr Lee I am absolutely astonished I want to shake your hand and I want to tell you I have no doubt you have got the best heating system in the world yours pops everything out there from solar all the way down the line you did it but you need to know me you know why you need to know me because I have built the world&#x27;s most efficient heat engine and you have got the world&#x27;s most efficient heat Source he says if we got together with our two technologies we could become the most dangerous men in the world I thought wow I&#x27;ve never been the most dangerous man in the world I&#x27;ve kind of wanted to be and so you see this man&#x27;s name was Dr fiser now this guy built the steam built proved that they built the steam engine wrong I had the pleasure of building his unit in my research lab and we took his great big unit because why wouldn&#x27;t I want a great big one I don&#x27;t want to put everybody on the grid system with a new system that can exploit them some more with all the arrogance that comes with it I wanted to give people the opportunity to be totally independent of the grid system remember that was my goal so we took the big one we had and we scaled it down into a model not much a little bit smaller than this one it was a little smaller than this it was about that long it&#x27;s about 13 in Long 6 in in diameter and that one was going to be big enough to be able to power all the energy you needed for your house and so I didn&#x27;t want one bigger than that and by the way that little unit could fit in the glove compartment of any americanmade car I went across the United States of America telling my story I told it in every state of the United States and I got a thousand people to join me telling my story we put a media ad Campaign together because the media wouldn&#x27;t cover it so we ran commercials and we did a 60-second commercial cutting a power line and saying you can power your house with no electricity external electricity run your car with a new engine that runs with no gasoline we did a 60c commercial Nationwide as far as we can tell about 10 million people saw it and after that happened that was too much that couldn&#x27;t be tolerated and so I got a letter from the state of California inviting me to come back to California to go to court so I flew back from New Jersey to California to go to court and when I walked into the court the judge said you&#x27;re probably wondering why you&#x27;re here and I said yes I am and he said well because I&#x27;ve been ordered by the state of California to put you in prison and I said well that&#x27;s really interesting you&#x27;re putting me in prison but I&#x27;ve never been convicted of the crime how do I go to prison without a trial and without being convicted and I said you can&#x27;t do that can you and he said well he says I&#x27;ve been ordered by the state of California to put you in prison so that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re going but sounds like you got a hell of a case for appeal that by the way is a quote and I do have the transcript I walked out of prison two years ago and now we have rebuilt our whole national network of distribution of Distributors we&#x27;re in every state of the United States we&#x27;re in every major County of the United States we have people now who understand exactly how the government works exactly how the big boys work exactly how the energy companies work and we&#x27;ve got it all figured out and we&#x27;ve got far far far more technology than we ever had in 1987 we got a lot more money than we ever had in 1987 and we&#x27;re about to rock your world [Laughter] [Music] as if the amazing overunity results of these pioneering inventions are not enough a curious combination of side effects to free energy research involves such things as the transmutation of metals the formation of new Isotopes and yes even anti-gravity levitation effects from spinning magnetic disc conjure up images of UFOs hovering in midair British inventor John Cel has led the way along along these lines but his technique is not the only approach the remarkable works of Canadian inventor John Hutcherson has drawn widespread attention from businessmen and government scientists since 1979 when he began using ultra high electromagnetic frequencies to transform matter in some very unusual ways it has come to be known as the Hutchison effect the objects you are seeing uh moving there is a form of levitation by translational movement meaning that the objects become lighter and can float around the heaviest being the barium cylinder that you see there um with the two wires coming out of it tends to slide around on 7 lbs of its own weight physics of it is self- resonation of what they call ferromagnetic and piso Electric barium tightening uh through a power amplifier and Broad and narrow um bands of electrical energy going into this Crystal so the applications of this in advanced applications using free energy or zero point energy to power it would be in uh propulsion Technologies this is a crystal converter unit that I made about a year ago to see if the principal worked and indeed it seems to work to this day um the principles involve the Casmir effect and uh space charge type of barrier technology in semiconductors and um a Jitter activity called Zero Point Energy that goes through time and space the idea is to get the material inside this to interface face with the jittering action of Z Point Energy and moving on to what they may look like inside I actually bring out a piece here of this material of common minerals and that produced in a special way and I take a reading here I should be getting a higher reading I had a Hot Spot somewhere on here have here almost a half a volt as you can see as one can see there&#x27;s no batteries in this or anything else except just crystalline material with different uh configurations and this is a steady state it&#x27;s always that and has been tested up to a year&#x27;s time and under stress tests also so which made me decide to then of course Mount the same material in cylinders different cylinders of course are are different mixes in in there and I found that uh that some of the cylinders are not as powerful as this material here or this very tiny one here actually this has more power than this large artillery shell unit here and what I want to do of course is to um demonstrate it in a sense of it making actual power that means to turn a small motor okay I&#x27;m attaching this to the base here another lead the top and it should spin which it does so you have basically this kind of material powering Motors of course a very small motor at this time but scaled up in larger amounts of of material and power up to uh several horsepower if needed Hutcherson hopes his simp shake and bake method of producing these crystal energy converters will attract investors who can see the potential of permanent batteries which never need charges non-toxic that will interface with Zero Point Energy in space and time Hutcherson&#x27;s more dramatic experiments border on the Paranormal and have generated more than just a passing interest from US military research Labs we&#x27;ve had about 750 demonstrations of levitation translational movement ments uh metallurgical samples falling apart uh changing into transmuted unknown Metals uh quite a variety of obscure types of effects wood impregnated into uh Metals other objects in metals uh monopole uh magnetic fields written up in many journals um quite a host or a Pandora&#x27;s box of different types of effects on the outer edge of of the scientific uh community in this remarkable series of video clips shot by huderson we see what happens when he fine-tunes the electromagnetic frequencies aimed at Target objects in his garage [Music] [Applause] [Music] on the subatomic level I feel that there is a a dimension shift activated by very conventional electrostatics RF fields that I use and Tesla waves that I use that actually form a keyway that opens up another area of time and space that may activate the 0 point energy fields and Interventional reactions let&#x27;s say to gravitational waves and time waves or Cronin if you wish perhaps we&#x27;re dealing in Cronos and gravitons which are maybe particles and somehow causing a distortion which causes objects to Simply break apart or pulsate in the center uh of staying the field bars and fall apart or to become weightless [Music] [Applause] [Music] here ice cream and a plastic cup [Music] and finally a 70 lb Cannonball [Music] what is um interesting and also frustrating about his invention is that he&#x27;s using a combination of Tesla coil and vandag graph to produce a very disruptive and lifting experiments which in one case for example actually lifts a 19lb bushing uh toward the ceiling just from electromagnetic fields now when we analyze that we find that there&#x27;s um position versus time graph that we can plot and also the velocity versus time but when we actually analyze the um acceleration versus time it&#x27;s um an increasing straight line so we&#x27;re forced as scientists to admit that we have a third derivative effect which um for my mind actually lends itself to anomalous new Force which I call hyper Force U because we have to take a derivative of that to finally get a flat straight line a constantly increasing acceleration so the hutchon effect has been used as a benchmark for a comparison to many other high voltage propulsion devices electrogravity in other words now that we&#x27;ve witnessed the awesome potential of these revolutionary new energy sources some interesting questions begin to surface what are the consequences to the environment to the very fabric of SpaceTime itself once we begin harnessing these little understood forces on a planetary scale remember the promise of nuclear energy that electricity would be too cheap to meter are there downsides to tapping free energy that we may not be able to predict until it may be too late we have effects which can get down now into the very fundamental thing that drives everything the Mind stuff the connection of the mind to the body and everything for example if you were to generate extreme pulses extreme powerful pulses of this so-called scalar potential stuff uh with a hidden internal stuff if you jerk that or hard enough you jerk the normal smooth flow of time stream and what you really do is you snap the body loose from its mind connection you jerk the two loose from each other that&#x27;s instantaneous death at every level every cell dies every germ dies every parium dies every virus dies the whole body dies so obviously if you&#x27;re going to try to take think of energy in those enormous amounts you&#x27;re going to have to be extremely careful you can&#x27;t do that just willy-nilly without risking terrible effects from it so there are some limitations that will emerge on this technology there is a danger however that you may have too much 0 point energy and then of course these things would heat up and explode which has happened a few times with these devices of mine so in essence uh it&#x27;s an interesting technology to get involved in but I notic that there&#x27;s some precautions one needs to take if you&#x27;re having too much drawing of from the electromagnetic Jitter of of 0 point energy you&#x27;re going to get a minor meltdown and I had to clean this area out here once because of a minor meltdown would a new energy source be dangerous for example I would I would say of course you have to respect it I mean it&#x27;s energy so therefore it&#x27;s always potentially dangerous it&#x27;s double-edged and I think it&#x27;s it would take a healthy respect to to investigate it one should be cautious and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s very reasonable I&#x27;ve heard some good things I&#x27;ve heard there could be health effects there could be good effects as well as a potential for detrimental effects I think it&#x27;s like anything else it&#x27;s energy it could be used for good it could be used for bad it&#x27;s up to us perhaps because of their traditional understanding of invisible forces like Chi or key Oriental cultures especially the Techno enthusiastic Japanese and embrace the concept of free energy well respected scientists like senichi siki and sahuji inomata are receiving substantial government and Industry support meanwhile the Japanese of course are beginning to commercially develop various systems uh for example uh a Japanese Consortium funds the paes and fleshman work uh the Japanese Toshiba Corporation is working with enata and various other corporations are coming together to develop free energy options and of course Japan has no vested interest in oil they don&#x27;t have any domestic source so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in their best interest to be the first kit on the Block uh to make little gizmos that will replace our circuit breakers and internal combustion engines to understand this machine uh you need you know mind change hard time shifting yourself you know so far physics ordin science consider only material world but we should think another world as Unseen World and we should recognize that Unseen World and mature world is connected connect you know this energy comes from the other dimension [Music] we&#x27;ll really have a true science when it is accepted in science and a true technology when all the phenomenology is Thoroughly worked out and thoroughly understood when all the models are redone so that we adequately can model this theoretically and we can do engineering we can sit down and design the circuits they&#x27;ll work every time we&#x27;ll have components on the Shelf we can buy assemble and they work we are not at that stage today we are at a stage today which is the birth of the baby we&#x27;re not at the stage where it&#x27;s all already a teenager running around playing uh playing baseball on the baseball lot we&#x27;re at the birth of the baby and the birth is very difficult because it&#x27;s opposed by so many interests the Orthodox scientific Community still uh very adamantly oppose it because they think that it&#x27;s nonsense they think that it&#x27;s this old idea of Perpetual Motion in the closed system creating energy from nothing and that is nonsense you can&#x27;t do that uh there are very strong and very powerful economic interests in the world probably the strongest economic interest in the world which are adamantly opposed to it can you see what this does to the all rich Nations uh can you see eventually can you see what this will do to many things now actually what it&#x27;ll do you&#x27;ll phase the oil petrochemical industry won&#x27;t go away you still need the oil for the materials that&#x27;s in it and the chemicals and so it&#x27;ll be more and more petrochemical industry rather than keep burning and wasting the oil and putting all the pollutants in the uh biosphere so many things will readjust uh it&#x27;s going to rest control from a lot of the great wealthy control Barons who now dominate the largely the economic world and their world is going to change now what you&#x27;re going to see I would predict uh and we&#x27;ll see if history buries this out when those Barons really realize that this stuff is for real and it can be made to work and with the internet and with free publish and computers and everything they can no longer contain the information and it&#x27;s very embarrassing to keep killing the inventors that they stopped that about 15 years ago uh at some point you&#x27;re going to see an overwhelming availability of funds become available when the funds become available the scientists will change over into it because they go where the money goes they&#x27;re bought and paid for simple as that you can&#x27;t do research unless you got the funds you cut off the research grants professor gets without a job he he leaves the university and so science is simply bought and paid for in this country and much of the world when the money goes the science will go to it now that will put the sharp young graduate students own it finally with some funds to do the experiments and work on their doctorates and so forth you will have a very rapid assimilation and advancement of a totally new and extended electromagnetic science at the time you get to a certain stage in scientific development sometimes to stages where you&#x27;re faced with problems and barriers and sort of forc to rethink and Go in different directions I think we&#x27;re seeing that one of those peculiar time periods in the history of science where we&#x27;re going to overturn some cherished models not not too much but make some changes and they&#x27;ll open the door to an enormous amount of new technology in electricity and magnetism in nuclear reactions in motor development in battery applications in space space flight and perhaps in anti-gravity uh I think there in creating scarce elements from plentiful elements I think we have just reached a plateau now where the the world door is opening to what a millennium of new science we&#x27;re talking about real life Hardware we&#x27;re talking about experiments in science that are telling us Beyond any reasonable doubt that we have technologies that will will enable us to be free from the bondage that we now feel free from uh some of these economic uh constraints that we&#x27;ve created for ourselves because you see if energy is free and it will be very shortly food is Free Housing is free then we&#x27;re free to create our express our creative gifts and not be like drones and we&#x27;re also free to explore our greater selves and it&#x27;s going to be a very exciting time coming up the future of the world as seen by conventional thinkers or even many far reaching thinkers is tame compared to what a coal fusion and free energy is going to do no aspect of human culture will be Untouched by the this energy Revolution the very fact that the material that covers 70% of the the planet&#x27;s surface will now be available as a fuel source and and the uh fact that water makes up a huge percentage of our bodies and this is a fuel and a source of energy this is going to have incredible uh psychological and religious and historical and geopolitical implications the Middle East uh picture and the strength of the uh oil interest there is going to be drastically altered uh air pollution will be abolished in most cities that are now affected by the internal combustion engine and uh space travel which is a favorite subject of mine will be transformed the ability to travel to the planets and to the Stars will be um given a gigantic boost one that I never in my lifetime expected uh as an engineer who deals with those things some people are saying that the title of my book The Coming energy Revolution is a bit fearsome that Revolution implies a sudden radical change and that uh the status quo uh will suffer and uh that people whose jobs depend on the status quo will will suffer U so perhaps evolution is a better to way way to look at it but one way or another our leaders our political leaders our Business Leaders our utility company Executives have to address the change over to clean energy sources and it&#x27;ll probably come from abroad so it probably will happen fairly fast I&#x27;m not really concerned myself about a radical shift because people seem to be on the verge of Readiness for change a lot of fear but also some positive anticipation and maybe it takes an unraveling of what we have to put together a cleaner more sane world is mankind ready do we have the maturity to handle it are we giving matches to a baby that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the question well the first answer is we&#x27;re kind of backing ourselves against the wall if we maintain a status quo we&#x27;re doomed anyway it looks like we&#x27;re going to get a shot by having this energy available to us if we&#x27;re not mature enough to handle it well I guess we&#x27;re doomed either way we have a chance to survive a chance to go on but it will take in a way a Consciousness transformation understand there Consciousness movement and things like that that people are starting to wake up it&#x27;s not just a me game now it&#x27;s a we game and as we learn to work together and have empathy for one another we can transcend the old selfish Consciousness which has caused all the problems and all the wars and everything else into a recognition that we are a planetary being [Music] we&#x27;ve only been able to present a handful of adventur and their remarkable devices in this program they hundreds if not thousands of people worldwide scientists engineers entrepreneurs are are actively working right now researching and developing this phenomenal technology to the point where it can be successfully scaled up and mass marketed we are at a pivotal Crossroads in human history can we as a society release our fears associated with the violence of of the past and embrace the unknown can we cast aside our rigid skepticism in favor of an open-minded Spirit of inquisitiveness our very survival may depend on how we answer these questions we hope we&#x27;ve given you enough of the necessary information with which you may base your future decisions regarding this exciting New Field one that will will soon affect all of our lives and the Very fate of our planet Earth as well I&#x27;ll see you at the Finish Line the race is on [Music] [Music] the the the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if you were fascinated by the amazing Technologies and Concepts you&#x27;ve just witnessed now you can get even more valuable information and details from the new energy series five fulllength videos 9 hours of in-depth conversations and demonstrations of free energy systems explore the worlds of inventors and theoretical physicist who are changing the paradigms of science Volume One features Tom be in particle physics any electrical charge is automatically a broken symmetry now what this means is there is a virtual Photon flux a violent flux exchange between the vacuum itself which is f f with this virtual Photon flux volume two John Hutcherson I feel that that is also true I think the M connect is also a uh coherer of frequencies and transmit them out and then lock this doorway into space and time this motor here Drew 12 1/2 amps volume three Joseph Newman this motor right here only draws 7 and 1/2 amps and look at the size of the propeller look at the size of a propeller look at the size of the motor look at the size of the motor now this is exactly what I teach throughout my book I taught it to Dr Hastings I&#x27;ve taught it to the world that the larger you make the mass then the the smaller amount of power it will take and the more power it will produce volume four highlights try re this is an old mechanical device it&#x27;s got It&#x27;s got two inner Wheels on the inside and two outer shell Wheels with magnets they got eight magnets on this side eight magnets on the inside here let&#x27;s see
