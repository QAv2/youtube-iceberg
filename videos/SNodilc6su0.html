            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>you have a new idea of what makes cold fusion work and it&#x27;s based on a survey of over two decades of experimental results can you talk about what the data was telling you well the data let&#x27;s see how do I put that there&#x27;s two aspects to this Theory the one aspect is what can&#x27;t be possible because of Nature&#x27;s particular characteris ICS and the other is what you have to explain in terms of the data and the data show that you have to explain helium you have to explain trium you have to explain transmutation and then you have to explain the absence of any serious radiation so that&#x27;s basically what you have to explain and then you have to explain it in a way that doesn&#x27;t conflict with any other laws of nature nature and that&#x27;s where I think many of the theories have got into trouble that not only have they pick they pick and choose which of these things you have to explain they try to explain the ones that&#x27;s easiest for them to explain of course they choose and then they choose to have that reaction occur in the nuclear in in the chemical uh structure of of generally padium garide and I think they&#x27;re playing in the wrong sandbox so so they essentially are not adequate in explaining this for two basic reasons they have not explained everything and they explain it ways that conflict with basic chemical experience well you&#x27;ve had the idea about a nuclear active environment for number of years now yeah since 1996 I I published that can you talk about your thinking and how you&#x27;ve recently been able to identify what you believe is the nuclear active environment well it was a process of of elimination and to some extent trying this in the laboratory and trying that and having it fail so early in my experience I also thought it probably had to occur in the Lattis because you know there was no place else but something very unusual about the lus had to be involved and then the Big Challenge was to try to identify something so unusual about one of these excuse me one of these lates that it could in fact initiate a nuclear reaction well after much thinking and and tossing out ideas it became apparent that there was nothing in the lattice that could possibly support such a reaction and and not be in in conflict with the laws of thermodynamics so so where where do you go well the first step was to say okay maybe it&#x27;s nanot tubes maybe it&#x27;s generating nanot tubes in there because nanot tubes would have a little hole in the middle in which the nuclear reaction could occur so we explored trying to make Nan in the laboratory we found and discovered a good deal about um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the state-ofthe-art is really far Advanced I mean people know how to make nanot tubes and and we tried to duplicate them that way and we got essentially nothing to work and then it became clear too after some analysis that nanoes would be very unlikely in most of the successful experiments I mean even if they would work and and they might work if you made them but it&#x27;s not Universal it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s present in every single successful experiment well then I started looking to see what could be and the only thing that could be in fact is has been seen as being present would be cracks well that&#x27;s a crazy idea and it was only thanks to my um partner Brian scandin and his theory of the way in which the electrod behaves that it made sense because I could apply that theory to the crack mhm and so once I had a a plausible mechanism then I had a plausible environment the two together became all the more plausible and then once that became you know once I realized that that was happening that that that worked I started predicting well I could predict 12 things that nobody else even thought of that you would expect to see have happen I could explain how Trum is made so far none of theories have explained that I could explain what happens with light hydrogen Rossi&#x27;s assuming that it&#x27;s uh the formation of copper it&#x27;s a transmutation reaction that&#x27;s absolutely impossible based upon my theory my theory says this he&#x27;s forming draria now nobody so far has looked for detarium in the light water system or the light hydrogen system so that&#x27;s a prediction when they find it then I will have a party can you describe the difference between the nuclear active environment of a crack and what called a vacancy yeah vacancy is the absence of a atom in a normal lattice for example padium deuteride is a face Center cubic lattice and you have a series of positions in that lattice occupied by padium and then you have an interlocking but equivalent sublattice occupied by detarium and all of the positions well if a position is vacant if the atom isn&#x27;t there where it should be it&#x27;s called a vacancy and you can have a vacancy in the metal subl latus if the plaum happens to be missing or you can have which is more common a vacancy in the detarium sublattice if a deuteron is missing and those are the ones that are usually missing but now a crack is a separate structure it has no relationship to the lattice itself either physically or chemically it happens to Simply have formed because of stress having to be relieved it&#x27;s a normal way in which stress is relieved is to generate cracks I mean crack Generation Um is one of those phenomena that people try to avoid I mean normal technology does not like cracks so they do everything they can to avoid them but they know very well how they&#x27;re produced and they&#x27;re obviously produced in the Fusion phenomena could the reaction be occurring at a V at a in a vacancy in the lattice no because that again is in the chemical environment now in principle let&#x27;s say you have a metal atom vacancy in order for a reaction to occur several uterin have to come into that vacancy simultane L find themselves close enough together that the kolong barrier is no longer an issue because so long as they&#x27;re a certain distance apart and nothing ex is between them they&#x27;re repelling one another they only can attract one another when they get close enough for the What&#x27;s called the strong force to take over so somehow or another that confinement that is in the lattice has to force these two Deuter Rines to get close enough well it makes no sense first of all there&#x27;s no energetic reason for two deuterons to go into the a site where the lattice wants a Palladium see the Palladium are where they are at because the lattice finds that to have the lowest energy and it if it didn&#x27;t it would have found another com combination another way monoclinic hexagonal could have been any one of a number of things but it chose face centered cubic because that gave the Lost energy well if you put two deuterons into where it wants to have a Palladium that&#x27;s going to take more energy cuz if it didn&#x27;t they would already be there and if they were already there it would not be a face in a cubic lattice see so once you have nature having set up having built the house you can&#x27;t use the house for something else suppose the high loading uh stuffs detarium into the lattice couldn&#x27;t those duum be squeezed together inside a vacancy yeah but they all go into the non-metal atom vacancy they don&#x27;t go to the metal atom vacancy there are very few metal atom vacancies because the lattice really wants that to be perfect that gives the lowest energy there there&#x27;s no reason because every vacancy means that a certain amount of energy has been wasted it has not been utilized and if you put a a Palladium into that vacancy you gain some energy and the lce wants to do that it wants to go to the lowest energy state so it wants to put a Palladium there not a deuteron but now you have a whole bunch of places that the deuteron could go in preference to that where it wants to go so this is called a defect structure because it normally has a whole bunch of vacancies in the nonmetal Su lanus and you can fill them by raising the pressure the higher the pressure the more of them get filled you can you can put more in if you go to low temperatures but that&#x27;s the normal chemistry and when they go into those positions they&#x27;re not able to cause a nuclear reaction they&#x27;re too far apart your assertion that the cold fusion reaction doesn&#x27;t occur inside the latest is based on what well it&#x27;s based upon the fact that the lce cannot do anything that violates the chemical laws they cannot do anything that violates the laws of thermodynamics the laws of thermodynamics are so thoroughly beded they&#x27;re so well known that you you simply cannot violate them that&#x27;s like violating the law of gravity you you just don&#x27;t do it and so in order to create the conditions for a nuclear reaction to occur you have to violate those laws in various ways now physicists will say Well they&#x27;re not violating the laws because they&#x27;re only causing a single atom or a single electron to do something weird and and that&#x27;s fine single atoms and single electrons can violate the laws of thermodynamics statistically because the laws of thermodynamics apply to the the the average to the the total number of atoms but if you have too many violating it then the average starts to shift from what the laws of thermodynamics predict to something that it does noted ICT and so long as you say okay maybe just a few of these weird things happen I I would have no complaint but in order to make one watt of energy you have to have 10 to the 12th events per second occur so you have to have a lot of basic changes take place in that structure well once that many take place you violated the laws of thermodynamics so it&#x27;s a matter of magnitude if you&#x27;re only looking at a few isolated occasions that happen once in a while fine no problem it&#x27;s when you start making it happen enough to generate the kind of power that Co Fusion does in fact produce that&#x27;s when you get in trouble um how important is it for you to begin with the EXP expent Al data when you&#x27;re thinking about what&#x27;s happening in that&#x27;s absolutely essential that&#x27;s the only thing that matters there is no reality other than that everything else is Pure Imagination and everybody has a fantastic imagination and these guys are particularly good at that and they&#x27;ll find ways of making the the whatever imagination that they have work by making assumptions and unless they can demonstrate that those assumptions have some relationship to reality their imagination also so it&#x27;s one imagination superposed upon another imagination so what you get is a structure that&#x27;s based upon absolutely nothing and you have to start with what is known and then you might not be able to explain everything but whatever you explain has to fit precisely with what&#x27;s know no imagination is permitted um does this idea apply to all the different kinds of reactions that we see occurring in Palladium with Nickel in biological transmutations can you say that this idea of yours uh will uh work in all of those cases it has to that&#x27;s the only uh if it doesn&#x27;t then my idea isn&#x27;t right but yes it it would apply to everything and what I&#x27;m saying is that the cracks it doesn&#x27;t matter what the cracks are made from for example there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a technique called U Photon um electrom migration that mauno and several other people uh demonstrated you have a it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a u niobium oxide with a number of impurities in it it&#x27;s a parasite structure you put a voltage across it put two electrodes against it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an insulator essentially and and you put electrodes across and you put a voltage so that a very small current flows and then you put this into terarium gas and you discover that that it makes excess energy and it makes helium well this is nothing like padium deuteride it&#x27;s not a metal so what could possibly be there that would be present in these other systems while cracks prosite type structures are susceptible to cracks and the reason why the current the volage is placed across it is to cause a current to flow which moves the deuterons because they&#x27;re ions in there to find a crack they wouldn&#x27;t be moving otherwise there&#x27;s hardly any concentration so that the reaction rate would be trivial but they start to move and as they start to move they&#x27;ll hit a crack that happens to be there by accident in a random position and enough of them hit that crack and now there&#x27;s enough of them to fuse you write that this mechanism uh will work with all the Isotopes of hydrogen are you including tridium in this yes yeah the tridium fusion reaction makes neutrons see trium when you make trium you make a few neutrons it it uh doesn&#x27;t make as many as the hot Fusion people want there you have to for every trium you have to make one Neutron it&#x27;s a one to one relationship but in this case it&#x27;s about 1 million to one but neutrons are produced and I think the neutrons are produced when high when trium which is now there because you made it fuses with a deuteron and that generates the neutron um do you see reactors that use tridium uh as a fuel as opposed to light hydrogen or nickel do you see that as a a future possibility for uh a commercial no no not at all in fact is you really don&#x27;t want the tritium is going to be an an unhealthy byproduct because if let&#x27;s say you use light hydrogen you&#x27;re going to be making dyum the dyum concentration builds up and when it fuses with the protons that are already there that will make trium making trium is not very energetic and it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s an inhibited reaction it it doesn&#x27;t like to make trium but tridium is a poison radioactive poison so if you don&#x27;t know that your sample is accumulating trium you can get a very nasty surprise so you don&#x27;t want that and the re consequences are that you probably don&#x27;t want to use light hydrogen um light hydrogen is very convenient right now but once people discover how to make the ER active environment switching to duum would be better because pure duum does not make trium it makes only helium those are my predictions M mhm um you&#x27;re describing these reactions as occurring in a a kind of a stack a line where you have either uh light hydrogen nuclei protons uh and then an then an electron and say another proton and an electron and um this particular uh stack of material in a crack when it be begins to resonate forms the nuclear product can you speculate on how this separate particles and these nuclei and electrons collaps to the to the new material well by a Sher probability chance there&#x27;s a crack form it has to have the right size and then because of diffusion let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re just using protons they diffuse and they start building up a concentration in the crack and the lowest energy Arrangement is for an electron to be between each one that that gives that balances the charge and that that creates a symmetry so that&#x27;s going to have a lower energy from a purely chemical point of view all right once that builds up to a sufficient number and perhaps something else happens who knows maybe little you know vibration from some Source some something triggers it and that can just be the normal temperature vibrations because everything&#x27;s at Atomic level is vibrating all right so so these things start to vibrate in line and when they do because you have charges moving you have the prospect of photons being generated now the system knows that if it collapses it&#x27;s closer and closer together it will give it will gain energy because the end product is a nuclear product that has less mass than the S total so it knows that that&#x27;s the direction to go so it just keeps giving all photons each time it gives off a photon it collapses a little more another Photon a little more a little more meanwhile vibrating photons are streaming out and then finally the last Photon goes off and it becomes a deuteron because the electron that was between them gets sucked into the final product and then that&#x27;s deuteron now there now that deuteron if there happens to be another proton or another deuteron in there it can start the process all over again and if another deuteron happens to be there then it can make helium or if a proton happens to be there it will make trium and that is a non-standard type of reaction that&#x27;s a non-standard type of reaction that nothing about this violates conventional Theory it adds to it this is a new undiscovered phenomenon what is the relationship between the frequency of these photons and the mass of the nuclei well the the the the lighter that is the hydrogen will vibrate faster than the heavy which would be the deuterons I mean that&#x27;s just the way things work if you just have billiard balls in there and springs between them that the lighter billiard ball would would vibrate faster than than the heavier one would so it&#x27;sall bowling ball right so so it it it&#x27;s pure what would I call it conventional physics in that sense now what we&#x27;re finding is that the radiation that&#x27;s coming out of the light hydrogen cell is quite energetic it&#x27;s energetic enough to be seen when it gets goes through all the absorber that&#x27;s in the walls of the apparatus uh pantelli saw this radiation I&#x27;m seeing this radiation and but in the light in the heavy hydrogen system on the other hand the radiation is at such a low frequency because this is vibrating slower that it does not get out and when people have looked for it it&#x27;s been at least a 100 times less energetic than the heavy hydrogen system so the the observations are consistent with the idea of the basic requirement that something that&#x27;s light is going to vibrate faster than something that&#x27;s heavy mhm and is there an equation for this no there will be but there presently is not H we&#x27;ll be looking for that yeah right um how might these cracks be repopulated once they&#x27;ve uh reacted once the material in the C crack has reacted and they form formed a new nucleus uh how does that nucleus get out and or does it and uh can more material go go in to continue this process yeah the process is continuous it it&#x27;s random uh if let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s made some deuterons in there the deuterons can diffuse in or out I mean the walls of the crack are totally permeable hydrogen as an atom or the nucleus diffuses very readily through these materials so you know by random chance it build up a concentration in there did its thing converted to dyum let&#x27;s say the dyum then has a choice it can diffuse out in which case it&#x27;ll be replaced by a proton more likely because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s in the general environment or it can stay there and another proton comes in and it starts to fuse and it makes trium instead and then the trium is sitting there and it can diffuse out just like if because all these diffuse just the same or it could find a proton and fuse with that in which case you get a neutron Neutron out of it or it&#x27;ll can diffuse with a deuteron and get a neutron out of it so it it&#x27;s a continuous it the crack is not destroyed the crack is a manufacturing um tool it&#x27;s just simply there and atams go in fuse and the products to fuse out maybe or they stay there more stuff fuses it just simply is an assembly line of the fusion process mhm can you talk about how important the electron is in this string of particles why is the electron so important well that&#x27;s the only way you can hide or reduce the cool on barrier you need something with an opposite charge if you have just two protons sticking next to you they both have a positive charge they&#x27;re not going to get anywhere close together and so you have to have something negative so that they can get close enough together but the other thing you in order to make tritium see if you if you take a proton and a deuteron and fuse them you&#x27;ll get helium 3 let&#x27;s say you could do that by some aerious process and and a number of theories have proposed to do that but experimentally you don&#x27;t make helium 3 directly you can see it as a Decay product of trium because trium gives off an electron by normal Decay making helium 3 but you don&#x27;t get helium 3 as a primary so the only way you can get helium 3 by the primary is for the electron to also go in along with the proton and the uon the electron has to be sucked in and then it later decays away in the normal man that it does with tritium that&#x27;s the only way you can get it so if that&#x27;s the case if that&#x27;s the only way you can get tritium then it&#x27;s also the only way you can get helium the the electron also has to be sucked in and then that opens up a whole can of worms because now you get helium four I mean you get hydrogen four rather hydrogen 4 does not Decay normally into helium 4 and but it has to for the cold fusion thing to work so right there normal nuclear expectations break down so we&#x27;re waiting to see what what happens um when electrons go in and out of nuclei it&#x27;s believed that they make neutrinos right have neutrinos been detected from cold fusion experiments uh no um there&#x27;s been some thought that people have tried it but there was no guarantee that they were actually making the cold fusion process work at all unless you have some evidence that you actually initiated the basic process there&#x27;s no point looking for these products that&#x27;s the nice thing about radiation is that then you can tell that it&#x27;s happening right away immediately it&#x27;s a little more difficult if you&#x27;re trying heat because then you need a really good calorimeter or if you&#x27;re looking for helium that&#x27;s also a little tricky because you have to really good M spectrometer but radiation makes it really simple to know whether it&#x27;s actually happening or not but when those measurements were attempted to look for neutrinos all that was not uh taken into account as far as I know is it a prediction then of yours that there should be neutrinos no my prediction is that there will not be neutrinos but if electrons are being sucked into nuclei and then reemitted possibly later what&#x27;s up with that well that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where the relationship to the standard model uh starts to be important see the nutrino are they&#x27;re coming and going are based upon hot fusion and nuclear reactions that are energetic that are let&#x27;s say normal beta Decay for example trium when it decays um gives off a beta that beta does not have the energy that it should have based upon the change in mass that extra energy is proposed to go off as a nutrino that that&#x27;s how the nutrino was originally demonstrated it to be real You&#x27; get a when whenever a beta Decay occur you didn&#x27;t get the energy that you expected so there had to be another particle so that&#x27;s how the nutrino gets involved now in C Fusion these are made in ways that are quite different the mechanism is different the Decay is different we know that the decay of tridium involves a nutral that&#x27;s fine that&#x27;s ordinary decay but would for example the M the making of deuteron by this strange resonance structure also involve a nutrino if it did then the amount of energy that you get out when you measured and compare the amount of deuterons number of deuterons to the amount of energy it would be wrong and that&#x27;s a very important measurement because if it is right then the nutrino is not involved in which case the standard model is it&#x27;s not correct it&#x27;s not being applied it can&#x27;t be applied to the cold fusion phenomena now you might ask well why can&#x27;t it well then that Opus up a whole can of worms that probably would result in a Nobel prize from somebody wow well some experiments have shown very closely the relationship between heat and helium production so what does that mean for this nutrino situation um that means that if it is making hydrogen 4 which then decays you it would have to Decay by Beta emission that beta emission does not involve a neutrino I mean for the model to be correct the electron has to go in under all circumstances it has to go in to make detarium it has to go in to make tritium therefore it would have to go in to make helium 4 if it goes in to make helium 4 you get hydrogen 4 you don&#x27;t get helium 4 as a result that electron has to come back out but normal hydrogen 4 does not Decay that way and so something weird is happening there so it&#x27;s really important to unlock the weirdness of that particular reaction because if this is an exception if the electron doesn&#x27;t get sucked in then the my whole model starts to fall apart because where in the heck does that electron go it has to be there in order to hide the coolon barrier it&#x27;s there in the other two reactions so why isn&#x27;t it there in the helium so you&#x27;re saying that the electron is sucked in uh because it has to be sucked in for two of the reactions and then therefore why would it be sucked in sometimes and not others that doesn&#x27;t make sense so you have to have it all all it&#x27;s got to be a universal [Music] sucker um well I&#x27;m going to have to think about that stuff so we&#x27;ll get back on that nutrino issue um can you just mention some of the elements of this Theory this new idea of yours that remain unsolved what what&#x27;s missing so far in your idea well the evidence for supporting uh the assertions I mean we have evidence for trium that that&#x27;s the the only real evidence we don&#x27;t have any evidence for diarium at this point if if Rossy and other people who are using that the light hydrogen to make energy would choose to look for detarium and hopefully find it then I&#x27;d have another leg to the stool but I need three legs now we have to start looking more carefully at the helium production and and then that gets to be really interesting and that there you&#x27;d almost have to look for um I don&#x27;t know quite how you go about doing that it&#x27;s very clear that helium is the major reaction product it has the correct energy so it means that whatever is happening is not consistent with the way you expect and and so something really weird is going on there that says maybe something very important about the mechanism of this resonant phenomenon um have you been able to test your idea in any way and uh how are you going to be able to confirm whether this idea is right well if we can uh get fine duum when we use light hydrogen that&#x27;ll be very uh very reassuring uh if we can identify this radiation as coming from such a reaction that would be very reassuring um if we can find the tritium has a relationship to the duum to padium I mean duum to prodium ratio that would be reassuring so yeah there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a number of kinds of experiment that can be done that this predicts the outcome and if those outcomes match predictions then I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to be I&#x27;m going to have a party well Dr Storms uh uh you gave a great lecture today thank you for talking with us okay thank you</p>
