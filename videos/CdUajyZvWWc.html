            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel where we go over uh different mostly theories of everything all-encompassing theories that can affect your whole life um and uh you know really speak to uh every aspect of uh of life and uh we are in the middle of doing a lot of stuff on the reciprocal system of theory today is video number 204 on the reciprocal system and this was a system of theory or Theory of Everything That was first advised by Dewey B Larson back uh way back starting in about 1930 he eventually worked out his uh two fundamental postulates in the 1950s started writing books from there based on a deductive process so he has his two postulates takes those two postulates and basically you know if this then that if this then that and develops an entire theoretical universe so he&#x27;s basically saying this is what the universe would look like if these postulates were true and then he Compares it to the universe that the scientists had observed and measured and in 90 of the cases uh there is an identical match uh in 10 of the cases uh the scientists Legacy scientists have been proven wrong or at least been shown to be wrong um they haven&#x27;t picked up on this yet uh but so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking at with uh Mr Larson&#x27;s work we&#x27;re looking at his 1979 book called Nothing But motion and that kind of encapsulates his theory in general that we live in a universe of motion and for Larson the uh idea of motion motion is the relationship between space and time that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time you can think of motion as basically a fraction and either space or time is the numerator of the fraction and either time or space is the denominator of the fraction but it can be a little bit more difficult because space and time uh have their coordinate aspects meaning that they can be multi-dimensional XYZ coordinates even in some cases more than three dimensions and uh space and time uh that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time and then they have their clock aspects clock time time is always getting later and later and later and this is a flow of time but in no particular Direction that&#x27;s What Larson calls a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but has no Direction and then we also have clock space the flow of space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and that was observed by the Hubble telescope way back in the 1920s where they observed that all of the galaxies are moving away from each other at least all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and then clock space and time also have their discrete units only there is no continuity of space and time there they come in chunks very small chunks but chunks nonetheless um and one chunk or one unit of space in one chunk or one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is basically one over one equals one so the speed of light is one uh in this universe and then there is a part of the universe a half of the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light that Larson calls the material sector this is the half of the universe that we&#x27;re familiar with and then there is half of the universe that Larson calls the cosmic sector that is all moving faster than the speed of light this is the half of the universe that we know very very little about but we could learn about this half of the universe because of the generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time so what we know about the material sector can be extrapolated to the cosmic sector and all we have to do is reverse the rules of space and time and you can see that with the coordinate space and the clock time in the material sector we have coordinate space and clock time the we see three dimensions of space and we&#x27;re moving through time getting later and later and later but in the cosmic sector we see three dimensions while we do not see it but um there exists three dimensions of time and clock space we are space is always getting farther and farther apart uh and so you can see that there&#x27;s just a reversal of the roles of time and space and that uh enables you to extrapolate and understand what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector Larson does that here in this book that we&#x27;re looking at nothing but motion especially uh in some of these later chapters here that we&#x27;re working on number 15 right now called cosmic ray decay cosmic ray a cosmic ray is basically a cosmic atom so earlier in the book he covered atoms what an atom actually is and it&#x27;s basically a combination of several different kinds of motions at first you have a photon at the core of the atom that is a simple harmonic motion which is in Larson&#x27;s World a combination of a translational motion and a vibrational motion at 90 degrees of the translational motion the combination creates a sine wave or a simple harmonic motion now Larson&#x27;s sum of Larson&#x27;s successors have challenged that and especially kvk nehru and also Bruce Perrette have said that they believe that the photon actually comes from a by rotation to a combination of two rotational motions counter rotating and that also yields a a the interference of those yields a sine wave so that is the model for the photon that never uses Larson disputed that until he died uh but uh they&#x27;ve done some tests on it and uh I think their idea makes a little bit more sense to me but we will hash that out later on so uh as of right now Larson you know in this book Larson&#x27;s saying that the photon has uh is a translational motion combined with a vibrational motion going 90 degrees uh to the translational motion now that creates the photon which is at the core of subatomic particles uh when you&#x27;re talking about an atom you have two photons at the core of those atoms and then you take those photons and you rotate them and that&#x27;s what creates the atom so an atom has a three number rotation um of rotations uh for their notation and so you have a b and c numbers the first is a PR uh primary two-dimensional rotation the second is the two-dimensional uh secondary rotation and then the third is a one-dimensional electric rotation which is optional and so those those three numbers create uh atoms now he&#x27;s moving into the cosmic sector and he&#x27;s determining what the uh what what&#x27;s going on with the cosmic atoms and uh he&#x27;s looking at cosmic ray Decay which means that a CO when a cosmic atom comes across the boundary to the lower than speed of light sector the material sector um which is as a result of an uh a powerful explosion generally from a star or a Galaxy and then that cosmic ray has to Decay because it is not stable in a material environment um and he&#x27;s pointing out the steps of the Decay generally the atoms that come over are uh generally Cosmic hydrogen or Cosmic helium but then they Decay up the periodic table until they get to Cosmic Krypton which has a notation of three three zero and he says that you you uh when you&#x27;re talking about atoms uh the max is four four zero and so when you flip that three three zero you end up with one one zero which is uh equals two massless neutrons so that&#x27;s uh the idea for Larson&#x27;s process of cosmic ray Decay that it starts out from cosmic hydrogen or maybe Cosmic helium decays all the way up to Cosmic Krypton and then uh once it gets to Cosmic Krypton it flips over to become two massless neutrons and then those are stable okay we&#x27;re gonna start right here uh in the middle here where he he just got done talking about um decaying uh the first kind of first couple steps of the Decay up to uh C lithium five okay further increases in the inverse mass of the residual Cosmic atom by successive editions of single atomic weight units would be possible but the probabilities favor larger steps as the material equivalent of a cosmic increment continues decreasing the one unit increment in each of the Two Steps from cosmic helium-3 to Cosmic lithium five is therefore followed by a series of increments that are uniformly one atomic weight unit larger in each successive Decay except for the step between Cosmic nitrogen 14 and Cosmic neon 20. where the increase over the size of the previous increment is two units on this basis the two one unit increments that produce C lithium five are followed by a two unit increment to C beryllium seven a three unit increment to C Boron 10 and a four unit increment to C nitrogen 14 and then a six unit increment to C Neon 20. these Decay products are not capable of retaining both of the gravitational charges or isotopes um isotopic mass of their precursors but they keep one of the charges and all of the cosmic elements identified as members of this section of the Decay sequence have masses which include a 931.15 gravitate electron volt million electron volt gravitational increment as well as the basic equivalent of the cosmic element which is 1862.3 over the atomic number a million electron volts the indicated life of a cosmic atom with one gravitational charge after dropping into the range of one-dimensional motion is about 10 to the minus 10 seconds these theoretical masses and lifetimes are in agreement with the observed properties of the class of transient cosmic ray particles known as hyperons as indicated in the following tabulation Okay so Larson is saying that c lithium 5. is equivalent to the physicist Omega particle and the Larson calculated the mass of that particle as 1676. according to the physicist is actually 1673.</p>
<p>and the lifetime is 1.3 times 10 to the minus 10 seconds then we&#x27;ve got C Boron 10. that&#x27;s the PSI particle x i um and that&#x27;s 1304 million electron volts observed that&#x27;s 13 21. and the lifetime is 1.67 times 10 to the minus 10. then we have C nitrogen 14 which is the sigma particle and that is calculated by Larson theoretically as 1197 Mega electron volts by the physicist it is also calculated at 1197. through their observations and measurements and then the lifetime of that particle is 1.48 times 10 to the minus 10 seconds then we have C neon 20 the Lambda particle and according to Larson&#x27;s theoretical calculations this should be 1117 million electron volts and according to the physicist physicists observations it is 1116.</p>
<p>million million electron volts and the lifetime is 2.52 times 10 to the minus 10 seconds the masses given are those of the negatively charged particles positive electric charges and other variable factors introduce a fine structure into the numerical values of the properties of the particles that has not yet been studied in the context of the reciprocal system The observed Decay pattern is in agreement with the theory so far as its general direction is concerned that is all of the members of the series decay in such a manner that the eventual result is C Neon it is still uncertain however whether the Decay always passes through all of the stages identified with the normal sequence or whether this sequence is subject to modification either by omission of one of the or more of the steps or by A variation in the size of the ejections of time displacement the C beryllium 7 atom Mass 1463 Mega electron volts for instance is not listed in the tabulation as its identification with an observed particle of mass 1470 Mega electron volts is rather uncertain this does not preclude its definite identification as a Decay product eventually it may be noted that in this connection that the Omega particle C lithium-5 was found only as a result of an intensive search stimulated by a theoretical prediction However the fact that the last three members of this Hyperion series which were the first to be discovered and are still the best known are separated by only one Decay step suggests that there is little if any deviation from the normal sequence in those cases where the full range of Decay from C helium to C neon is involved when we examine the properties of gravitational charges at a later stage of the theoretical development we will find that the stability of these charges is a function of the atomic number the mathematical expression of this relation which we will derive from Theory indicates that the stability limit for a double gravitational charge in the terrestrial environment Falls between the material equivalence of C helium 3 and C lithium five this accounts for the previously mentioned fact that c lithium-5 and the elements above it in the cosmic series are incapable of retaining two gravitational charges but the center of the zone of stability for these elements is closer to the plus one isotope meaning one gravitational charge then to the zero isotope the basic rotation and for this reason they are all singly gravitationally charged as indicated in the preceding discussion from C silicon 27 upward in the cosmic series the center of the zone of stability is closer to the zero isotope and these elements carry no gravitational charges so as a result you don&#x27;t have to multiply that uh I guess 10 uh 10 to the minus 2 second multiplier into the calculation for the lifetime uh and also add in that 100 931.15 uh Mega electron volt unit for the gravitational charge either without the gravitational charge the mass of C silicon 27 the Decay product resulting from a seven unit addition to see neon 20 is 137.95 megavolts and the low speed lifetime is about 10 to the minus 8 Seconds the corresponding observed particle is the Pion with measured mass of 139.57 megavolts and a lifetime of 2.62 2.602 times 10 to the minus 8. pions are frequently reported as products of observation of observed cosmic ray events initiated by primaries as we will see in the next chapter such production is quite feasible where there is a violent contact of some kind with the release of a large amount of energy but direct production of pions in Decay is not consistent with the Decay pattern as derived from Theory the apparent direct production is however understandable when the relative lifetimes of the Pion and the earlier Decay products are taken into consideration there is no reason to believe that normal decay in Flight will result in any change of Direction ejection of massless particles will take care of the conservation requirements without the necessity of directional modification because the entire Decay process up to the production of the Pion occupies only a very short time compared to the lifetime of the Pion itself it is unlikely that the usual methods of observation will be able to distinguish between a Pion and a cosmic particle undergoing a complete Decay to the Pion status in flight okay I think we&#x27;re going to stop right there now uh have heart because this is uh probably the most one of the most difficult chapters in Larson&#x27;s entire ovra and uh it&#x27;s very theoretical um like I said yesterday I&#x27;ve read this chapter uh multiple multiple times and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve even understood any of it so I&#x27;m excited for myself but for you you know you may have to listen to me uh go over this chapter multiple times before you get it and you might have to look consult a physics textbook to kind of figure out what the uh scientists are saying but what&#x27;s important here is that Larson is basically taking on the entire scientific establishment there are thousands of scientists that are trying to understand this and Larson is able to figure out himself by himself with uh his reciprocal system of theory okay have a great day and we&#x27;ll see you next time</p>
