            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel and uh this is an educational Channel we&#x27;re going to be looking at uh well in general we look at uh theories of everything and uh things that can improve your life in every aspect if you were privy to them and uh today is video number 316 that we have done on Dewey be Larson reciprocal system of theory and um Mr Larson was an engineer who lived in the 20th century uh born in North Dakota in 1898 died in 1990 uh he moved out west uh he was a World War I vet and then he moved out West to Oregon went to college out there and uh uh became an engineer at a I think mining engineer here and um Portland and um stumbled across uh was working on uh some smaller problems trying to make some advancements uh but and stumbled across um you know some kind of eye-opening things and pursued them to their um to their uh ends and ended up developing a full-blown Theory of Everything a a system of theory basically he has uh set up two postulates and from there he deres an entire theoretical Universe um and from that Universe he wrote books on all kinds of different subjects including chemistry and physics and astronomy but also even some uh economics and some of the the social sciences or even the liberal arts and um the basic idea behind larsson&#x27;s theory is that we live in a universe made out of motion not not matter and not energy but motion for Larson motion was the relationship between space and time and uh space and time both have three dimensions uh because they are reciprocals of each other they have identical qualities uh space and time are basically uh two components of uh the numerator and denominator of a fraction uh that is motion so motion is uh you know some kind of permutation of time over space or space over time um but they but they come in multiple dimensions coordinate space and coordinate time and then they&#x27;re also progressing uh what Larson calls clock space and clock time the clock uh with the clock the time is always getting later and later and later and later and with clock space the space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and then space and time are also both quantized meaning that they have a there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space um and by a corollary then you only have time because the universe is made out of space time or motion and so it&#x27;s got to be one or the other or both so if you don&#x27;t have space then then you only have time Larson calls that the time region and if you don&#x27;t have time then you because you don&#x27;t have a full unit of it if you have less than one unit then you only have space Larsa calls that the space region and between those two you have what uh Larsson calls unit speed one unit of space in one unit of time space over time time is speed and 1/ 1 equal 1 uh this uh unit speed is the speed of light so in Larson system the speed of light is really the background or the reference point the zero point the null point the origin The Ether of the universe and half of the universe is moving actually f faster than the speed of light Which flies in the face of Einstein&#x27;s dictum that says that the Universe uh the fastest the speed limit of the universe is the speed of light that&#x27;s only true for what Larson calls the material sector that sector of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light but in the cosmic sector the sector moving faster than the speed of light uh that is uh that doesn&#x27;t pertain to that uh that&#x27;s part of the universe that Einstein didn&#x27;t know anything about um and um so he took th that postulate the second postulate is basically that the Universe conforms to the uh uh rules of ordinary mathematics its uh primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian and and that actually is under some dispute by some of his followers but uh the first postulate is the main uh gist of it and then he derived a theoretical Universe from that we&#x27;re looking at an article that he wrote uh I think it&#x27;s a paper that he gave back in the early 1980s that is called scaler motion and I believe this is the fourth installment of that and so if you want to get uh start at the beginning you want to go back about three episodes and uh and listen from there uh but so we&#x27;re taking over kind of in the middle of the article uh Larson talks about uh scalar motion now scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction um like a clock or like a balloon with spots on it you blow up the balloon all the spots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction you suck in the balloon all the spots are moving toward each other but in no specific Direction really the only direction of scalar motion is either in or out and um that would be like time uh space the progression of space now uh that progression of space OB obtains in um The Cosmic sector so in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and clock space those are unfamiliar to us in general but in the material sector much more we&#x27;re much more familiar with that that is uh coordinate space and clock time and uh Larson is talking about how scalar motion uh is a is a Bonafide aspect of the universe uh and that you know scientists know all about it the Hubble telescope identified that the distant galaxies are all moving away from each other but they haven&#x27;t uh they haven&#x27;t determine the significance of scalar motion and so Larson is giving it sign significance especially a kind of motion that he calls a distributed scalar motion which is really if you take that balloon that&#x27;s expanding and then you also rotate it at the same time then you would have a what he calls a distributed scalar motion and he says that you know a one-dimensional distributed scalar motion is a charge a two-dimensional distributed scalar motion uh electric charge a two-dimensional distributed scalar motion is a magnetic charge and a threedimensional distributed scalar motion is gravitational charge um and um he so he is basically saying that you need uh three dimensions of space in order to define a onedimensional scalar motion so that there is a lot of motion in scalar because scalar motion has three dimensions so there are two other dimensions of scalar motion that cannot be described in the reference system in our XYZ coordinates our XYZ coordinates are are only capable of representing one dimension of scalar motion okay let&#x27;s start up right here an increase in the time while the space is constant results in a decrease in space per unit time and therefore causes a change of position in space an increase in space with time uh remaining constant decreases time per unit space and causes a change of position in time so here we arrive at the concept of motion in time this concept is perfectly familiar to those of you who have been dealing with the theory of Universe of motion and a great deal of what I am saying now is very much the same as what I was saying years ago when I was first explaining that theory so it&#x27;s old stuff to you but it has quite different s a quite different significance in the present context the extent to which we can now derive these conclusions from established facts greatly strengthens the position of the theory many individuals have rejected our conclusions without any serious consideration simply because they conflict with ideas of longstanding that have had no basis other than aump to begin with but now that we are able to show that these conclusions are consequences of positively established facts that option as I said with regard to another item is no longer open scientists have no option but to accommodate themselves to the facts the you would think anyway the system of scalar motions that we can represent present in the spatial reference system the onedimensional motion that I was talking about earlier can be duplicated in time because of this SpaceTime symmetry so that we have another system equivalent to the scalar motion system that is represented in our reference frame the derivation that I am giving you now Deals Only with scalar motion and we&#x27;ll have to leave vectorial motion for consideration at some other time because I haven&#x27;t brought that within the factual limits yet but we can consider this point that gravitation is a scalar motion and that consequently all gravitating objects are included in the inverse system this includes all material objects it follows that the inverse system is at least coextensive with the system that is open to Observation whether or not it is an exact duplicate the inverse system that I have been talking about is a system of maximum speed the system that we are well acquainted with that we deal with on our ordinary uh reference system is a system of minimum speed now I want to take a brief look at some of the things that happen in the intervening area first we need to look at some of the primary processes that are involved the progression of the natural reference system is outward A Plus or positive Motion in our usual language it is limited to one unit because that is the maximum that we can have in a system of discrete units um gravitation is capable of extending to two units before it reaches a net resultant of one negative unit uh and to so from positive one to negative one I believe is what he&#x27;s saying and to that one negative unit we can apply outward translational Motion in one dimension here we again have a range of two units and that is from negative - 1 unit to positive one unit the same is true in each of the three dimensions that gives us a total separation of six units of speed from one zero to the other from the zero in the material sector to the zero in the cosmic sector I think so far I have been talking about full units of course when we exclude fractional units we don&#x27;t have anything but full units but we can we can produce the equivalent of a fractional unit by adding units of the opposite kind that is units of motion in time n units of motion in time are equivalent to minus one over n units of motion in space so that we accomplish a resultant of less than one unit by combining one full unit with the oppositely directed fractional unit from the other direction this is the first speed range the range for from 0 to 1 unit it is the range of our ordinary experience the speed range that&#x27;s represented in the spatial reference system it&#x27;s not possible obviously to exceed one unit by any kind of a subtraction from a single unit which accounts for the limitation on the speed in one dimension but there is nothing to prevent the addition of another unit so that in the next speed range we have two units minus a fractional unit this same the same is true in the third speed range it&#x27;s necessary to keep in mind that the first of the two units is a unit of space and that there is a unit of time in the same dimension there is a unit of space from zero space to Unity which is the unit of both space and time and another unit from this unit level to zero time as opposed to zero space thus the second unit of motion is in time then in order to add a third unit we have to go to a second dimension so that again we have a dimension of space on this basis the speed from zero to one unit is in space that&#x27;s the ordinary motion that we are acquainted with a speed from one unit to two units is in the same Dimension but it is in time so this is the second dimension of motion he&#x27;s talking about here a speed from two units to three units constitutes that unit of speed in time but adds a unit of speed in space so that it&#x27;s two dimensional these are the major characteristics of highspeed motion as we derive them from the reciprocal relationship that we have have just found in order to give a meaning in terms of our physical observations we have to resort to the identification process again the most energetic energetic processes that we know of in the universe are explosions of stars and galaxies if any objects with speeds in these intermediate ranges that I have been talking about actually exist they must exist as objects of that kind so let&#x27;s look at them all violent explosions generate some lowspeed products and we see those lowspeed products expanding away from the site of the explosion usually at high speeds those products are not of particular interest to us now because they are in the lower speed range I mean he just got done saying you know from the sight of the explosion usually at high speeds and in the next sentence he says those products are not of particular interest to us now because they are in the lower speed range but that&#x27;s what he means uh they are in the lower speed range meaning that they are less than the speed of light less than unit speed but they are high at high speeds because they are very fast from the our normal reference system they&#x27;re just not at the speed of light but they&#x27;re very fast so he&#x27;s just tripping over his own words right here and making it just utterly ambiguous all over the place this is a very important passage I mean this whole what I&#x27;ve been reading this whole day here is very important but it&#x27;s really difficult to extract the information at least for me me on this so we&#x27;ll go back to the beginning of the sentence those products are not of particular interest to us now because they are in the lower speed range the ordinary speeds of our everyday experience but in Motion in the second speed range a change of position the change of position is in time so that the motion in that speed range produces the same kind of a cloud of expanding particles but this time they are expanding into time because of the reciprocal relation between space and time that I have been just talking about the cloud of particles expanding into time decreases in size as seen in the spatial reference system uh so that we observe such a cloud of particles as a very small object of very high density which remains in essentially the original location and such an object can of course be identified with the Stars that we know as white dwarfs so here then we can identify objects in which the speeds are in the second speed range from Unity to two units this is another con conclusion we reached theoretically but now we find that we have sufficient evidence to establish it as a consequence of positively established facts we also have evidence uh that there are explosions of galaxies and since these are very much larger objects our own Galaxy contains something like 10 to the 11th power solar masses 100 billion times the size of one star the explosion of a galaxy is very much more violent and we can therefore deduce that some of the products of that explosion will probably enter the third speed range as I pointed out a short time ago that should have two consequences because it has a two-dimensional motion it&#x27;s in this uh second dimension of speed one dimension of which is in time and another in space that kind of an object will be moving rapidly outward as well as decreasing in size like the white dwarf star such an object will therefore be the equivalent of what we might call a white dwarf Galaxy not a Galaxy composed of white dwarf stars but a Galaxy that has the property properties of white dwarfs we can easily identify this as uh one of the objects known as quazars now to summarize what I said I have not been able to find the kind of a crucial experiment that I and others have been looking for but by means of a systematic analysis of previous experimental work I have uncovered two hitherto unrecognized facts of a crucial nature the kind of facts that would have been obtained from crucial experiments if I had found such an experiment or two of them these new crucial facts are first the existence of distributed scalar motion and second the limitation of all scalar motion to discrete units with the benefit of these new critical items of information many of the unique features of a universe of motion including multi-dimensional motion Motion in time speeds greater than that of light and a second half of the universe can now be presented to the scientific Community as established facts rather than as theoretical speculations this should Aid very materially in the continuing effort to secure cure the serious consideration that has thus far been so difficult to obtain okay now that is the end of that article um that information the information is there it&#x27;s it&#x27;s all there uh at least the way I understand the reciprocal system he summarizes it there it&#x27;s difficult to extract the information from that article you may need need to listen to this video uh a few a few times over uh before you get it I&#x27;m going to at a some point uh when I get time which is hard to come by um to try to kind of reformulate uh some of these uh some of these positions of Larson into a language that maybe at least will be more amable to me and hopefully will be to you as well um because I know Larson says what he means and he means what he says but sometimes things get ambiguous and I know it&#x27;s not completely his fault I believe he&#x27;s a good writer but you know he&#x27;s having to identify so many new Concepts and you know use different words in different ways and it&#x27;s very difficult for him to establish a language that everybody can really understand um I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s really larsson&#x27;s fault it&#x27;s really The public&#x27;s fault for you know kind of um not being exposed to to uh you know different like ways of uh of speaking and in different nuances of language and also not really being uh very uh willing to persevere uh to actually figure out what he means um and instead just assuming that he means nothing or nonsense or giberish and or just being inconsistent he&#x27;s he&#x27;s consistent with the the language that he uses but sometimes uh he uses two words to express the same thing um and and some words that he uses are sticky they you know Dimension and Direction um these these kind of uh words sometimes uh have double meanings and um like I said I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all his fault it if you blame him you&#x27;re expecting too much because I mean what what do you want from the guy he came up with a a theory of everything you know a theory of how everything in the universe operates and it&#x27;s logical and consistent um he&#x27;s just one guy he he didn&#x27;t have you know he didn&#x27;t have an army of researchers behind him uh checking his work and proofreading his papers uh he didn&#x27;t have um you know graduate students or whatever working for him uh he didn&#x27;t have any of those benefits he was pretty much doing this on his own so I give him credit and you know you just have to kind of put up with uh some of the difficulties and try to try to persevere through them so uh hopefully you&#x27;ll do that and hopefully I will also be able to help out uh a little bit um as a person who I think knows what he means but sometimes I might see that he doesn&#x27;t exactly get to the main point of what he&#x27;s trying to say okay uh thanks for tuning in today and uh we will uh see you tomorrow have a great night</p>
