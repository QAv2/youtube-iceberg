            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Guys, welcome to part two of our session on the journals of Jacqu Valet. In our previous session, we looked at how Valet documented the origins of the modern UFO disclosure movement, how he traced it back to whispers coming out of the White House about a confirmation process in early [music] 2013. We then showed how this correlated really well with a surge of information coming out of NASA and a lot more presidential conversation around the topic of UFOs. Ultimately giving permission to the population to start believing there may in fact be some truth to the idea number one that there could be life out there beyond our own planet and number two that the topic of UFOs may in fact need to be taken seriously. Finally, we ask the question, what was it that was ultimately driving disclosure in the first place? It turns out that in Valet&#x27;s journals, he documents how the group felt an existential [music] threat had been detected, that something was coming and that the phenomenon constituted a threat to the human population.</p>
<p>And it was on that sober note that we wrapped up part one. But believe me, if you thought that was explosive, then wait until we dig into part two because today we are looking at Valet&#x27;s entries where he documents his meetings and interactions with Tom Dong during the moments when he was getting all of his information from his mysterious group of advisers. If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to know the inside story behind To the Stars and the strange mysterious advisers who lingered in the shadows. If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what Jim Seivian and Chris Melon really thought about what Tom Dong was saying, and if you&#x27;ve ever wondered what it was that Dong was actually saying behind closed doors, you&#x27;re going to want to stick it out for this video. Ultimately, this isn&#x27;t just about some obscure organization.</p>
<p>This is about the group that sits at the beating heart of the modern UFO disclosure movement. It&#x27;s a tale about who you can trust, of strange mythologies, of even stranger and more mysterious advisers, and a schism between factions within the UFO disclosure movement. By the time we&#x27;re done with today&#x27;s session, the way you think about what&#x27;s happened over the last 10 years will change forever. But before we get started, I think we need to set the tone by reminding ourselves of exactly how strange Tom Dong sounded when he first came out in 2015 and 2016. &gt;&gt; Then there&#x27;s this damn one issue of UFOs, right, where I&#x27;ve been studying it for so long.</p>
<p>So I was able to pull off a coup in regards to what anybody in this field has ever been able to pull off. &gt;&gt; I am not naive naive to this subject. &gt;&gt; It it doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m dealing with some [music] very important people and these things are just starting to happen one after another, one after another. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been told four different times to be very careful.</p>
<p>So I I would I went to them with a thesis. There&#x27;s a lot of things that I [music] can&#x27;t talk about. People have to trust trust me on this. &gt;&gt; And so I&#x27;m sitting here telling these guys this. I&#x27;m going something smells fishy to me.</p>
<p>Really fishy. Right at that point when I said that is when I got a communication that came through that says meet next to the Pentagon on this date and this time showing you it&#x27;s dude my life has been like unreal for the past year. But just know that there&#x27;s something that can happen with young adult people everywhere to realize and put down their weapons. So right when I said [music] that is when I got some very very very serious looks. I said we&#x27;re going to introduce you to some people and that&#x27;s how I got in because I hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>And guess what? They know this. Can&#x27;t describe these people. I&#x27;m not allowed to. Someone sat down across the table from me and I had to do some really hardcore explaining. Person pounds on the table and says, &quot;This is the story of the millennia.&quot; That&#x27;s exactly how I felt my entire [music] life.</p>
<p>You want to know why I got brought into the most secret groups ever? Is because I went in there and I said, &quot;You know, something&#x27;s wrong here. Let me tell you the way I see it.&quot; And they said, &quot;Okay. During those early interviews, Tom tells an astonishing story about how he managed to weave his way through the defense and intelligence community to reach the people who he claimed held the secrets about UFOs. At the beginning of that story, he talks about how he met a top aerospace executive at an openhouse event. And one of the first things we get from Valet&#x27;s journals is confirmation that this story is indeed true.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s Jacqu Valet. Tom writes truthfully that he was first contacted during a summer morning in 2015 when I got a call from an old friend. The man was recently retired from the Skunkworks which had an openhouse where Tom was invited to introduce the top executive. He seized the opportunity to pitch an idea for a project that could help the youth lose their cynical views of the government and the department of defense. Following this connection that he made at the skunk works, Tom was introduced to another individual in Washington DC, which then led to meetings at the NASA headquarters.</p>
<p>Now, I think it&#x27;s really important to mention something here for the coherence of the story that we&#x27;re building because when Tom Dong met with a senior executive at NASA, he recounts what he was told. &gt;&gt; So maybe maybe share with us what is their agenda? Why would they work with you? Why would they release information in incremental bits and pieces? &gt;&gt; Well, I think you know I I I believe and this is me speaking for just myself. I I think that information was being released in incremental pieces for a very long time and I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not you know the one that ever decided that or made that happen. I mean that this has been going on for a long period of time. But for myself I I think it&#x27;s the right time and place.</p>
<p>I remember I was at NASA and I was uh having a meeting with one of the the the top people there, one of the top five people there and I made everyone leave the office and I said, &quot;Hey, I just want to let you know what I&#x27;m getting ready to do.&quot; and I laid out the entire plan and this person looked at me, took a deep breath and said, &quot;This is a very, very good time for this, you know, or it&#x27;s a very, very good time for this.&quot; And I remember that just staring at this person going, &quot;Okay, so something&#x27;s already in the works.&quot; It seemed like to me, you know, &gt;&gt; for those of you who&#x27;ve watched part one, perhaps you can see how this lines up really well with the surge of information coming out of NASA all of a sudden starting in 2013. We have no way of knowing. But perhaps this is what this senior NASA executive meant by this being a very good time for Tom to start his project. I.e. this confirmation plan had already begun and it involved NASA and this roll out of information that we documented in part one.</p>
<p>But beyond these NASA meetings, things began to accelerate. Tom would find himself on an aircraft going back to California where he would meet with one more person before being introduced to an individual that he simply calls the general. Now, when Dong first came out saying these things, we had no way of knowing whether or not he was telling the truth. He just sounded crazy, very much like in that montage that I shared a moment ago. But in the thick of the 2016 presidential election between Donald [music] Trump and Hillary Clinton, a treasure trove of emails was released from the Clinton campaign, specifically John Podesta&#x27;s private email server.</p>
<p>And when people began to dig through those emails, they found something astonishing. Tons of emails between Tom Dong and John Podesta talking about UFOs. Podesta&#x27;s staff were referring to a UFO [music] project, whatever that means. Now, importantly for our purposes, there&#x27;s an email in there where Tom references two very important people that he would like to meet with Podesta. He says that they were principal leadership relating to our sensitive topic.</p>
<p>I think you can guess what that means and that they were in charge of the most fragile divisions associated with it. Not long after this, there is a call set up between John Podesta and Tom Dong and three other individuals. Those individuals were Robert Vice, the president of Loheed Martin Skunk Works, General Michael Kerry, a brigadier general from the United States Air Force, and General William Neil McCassland, a brigadier general from the United States Air Force, and the commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. If you haven&#x27;t heard about Wright Patterson Air Force Base, then you simply haven&#x27;t been in this field very long. I will never forget the feeling of digging into these Wikileaks emails for myself when I first got interested in this topic.</p>
<p>It was a total right of passage for me realizing that there was indeed some truth to this astonishing story that I&#x27;d been hearing from Dong in these interviews. But what I have always craved and I wonder if some of you might feel the same is to understand who the other advisers were. We know from the likes of Jim Semivan and Peter Levender, individuals who&#x27;ve worked closely with Tom Dong, that there were in fact 10 original advisers. And here in this email, we only got access to three of them. Well, luckily for us, in Valet&#x27;s new journals, we get new insights.</p>
<p>Here he is describing his first initial meeting with George Nap and Tom Dong. In that 5-hour meeting with George and Tom at the Mandalay Bay, I was struck by the fact that the names of the people mentioned had never appeared before. Not even Pete wardens. These men and one woman are unrelated to the Collins elite and seem immune to arguments about fundamentalism that have so plagued the Lone Stars. A couple of points here before we dig into this new name that&#x27;s been revealed.</p>
<p>Firstly, who are the Lone Stars? The Lone Stars was a loose group of scientists who were mostly associated with the ORSAP program who continued to meet even when that program stalled and eventually was shut down. So, Lone Stars refers to Jacqu Valet, Gary Nolan, Eric Davis, Kit Green, and a whole bunch of other people. The reference here to the Collins elite is interesting as well. And it also hearkens back to the ORSAP program. Valet and his colleagues had faced the reality that religious fundamentalists deep inside of the Pentagon and in [music] many agencies in the defense and intelligence community were purposefully trying to shut down any effort to study the phenomenon and to prevent disclosure and conversation about it.</p>
<p>This had preoccupied his and his colleagues minds as a deep source of frustration when trying to get to the truth of what the phenomenon was. And Valet is encouraged here because the advisers that he hears about from Dong are not associated with that group. Now on to the really fascinating point here. We have a specific name that has been referenced. It is a man called Pete Warden.</p>
<p>So who is Pete Warden? Well firstly he served in the United States Air Force for over 30 years ultimately rising to the rank of a one-star general. Following his time in the Air Force though, he went on to NASA as where he would eventually become the director of NASA as now for the eagle-eyed of you, you&#x27;ll have noticed that I referenced him in our former video because when NASA began rolling out their astonishing series of news about the findings of the Kepler mission about planets, Earth-sized and super Earthsized planets in habitable zones, really shattering the narrative about whether life might exist out there in the universe. Well, you&#x27;ll never guess who was at one of those conferences chairing it. It was Pete Warden. Very interesting that an individual associated with the roll out of this NASA information also turns out to be one of the advisers of Tom Dong.</p>
<p>And perhaps it makes you think again of that clip from Tom Dong earlier where he talks about how a senior person at NASA told him it was a very, very good time for this. I think by this time we can start to piece quite a few things together. Finally, Pete Warden would also be associated with the breakthrough star programs and various forms of SETI. Ultimately, he&#x27;s an individual tightly linked to the topic of whether there is life out there in the universe and how humankind could identify it. And he was one of Tom Dong&#x27;s advisers.</p>
<p>Now, luckily for us, even though there are no more names shared, there are just enough hints within Valet&#x27;s journals for us to start doing some educated guesswork. Let&#x27;s get back to the good book. Now, a text message out of the blue from Tom Dong. I&#x27;m having a face tof face with Admiral Blank in Austin. So, how put off Under Secretary Melon and I are going to meet afterwards.</p>
<p>Would you like to come to Austin and have another meeting on July 19th? The answer was easy. Now, this journal entry gives us some really useful hints. Firstly, we know that this Admiral was in Austin during 2016. The other thing that we can piece together from other parts of LA&#x27;s journals is that Dong had multiple fourstar level advisers. Now, we&#x27;re going to come to that entry a bit later on in this video, but for now, just put that on the plate with these other details.</p>
<p>So, we know there are four star level advisers and we know that Dong went to go meet an admiral in Austin in 2016. Now, you might be thinking, &quot;Wow, Jason, that&#x27;s really not very much data.&quot; But believe me, when we piece these things together, we can actually create a short list, which I think you&#x27;re going to find quite compelling. as we are kind of burying the the remains of this thing and we I say a little prayer over this uh this cross we put up there and um as I get through saying it all of a sudden one of the guys turns to me and goes, &quot;Hey sir, take a look up there.&quot; And right above the ridge line, I see what looks like a parachute flare. I&#x27;m thinking maybe one of our guys is, you know, shooting parachute flares. There&#x27;s one and there&#x27;s two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and they&#x27;re kind of hovering up there and looking around thinking, &quot;What in the world?&quot; And the guy says, &quot;Uh, hey sir, how many of those do you see?&quot; And again, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s this kind of glowing orb and it&#x27;s just kind of floating up there and there were nine of them.</p>
<p>And there were nine victims on the plane and uh and it was up there for 10 or 15 minutes. They all kind of hovered up and then one by one they just kind of went up. &gt;&gt; The individual being interviewed in that clip was fourstar Admiral William McCraven. And I wonder whether Dong may have in fact met him during his outing to Austin in 2016. The reason I wonder that is not just because he shares a story about mysterious orbs implying that there may in fact be some truth to this and there is a genuine mystery there, but also because McCraven was the chancellor of University of Texas Systems between 2015 and 2018, which would place him right in Austin, right at the time that Dong went to go and have this conversation.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s not even the juiciest detail that [music] we have. Investigative journalist Seymour Hirs made the claim that McCraven and other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were in fact associated with the Knights of Malta. And for those of you who are relatively deep in this world of UFO law, you&#x27;ll know that the Knights of Malta have occasionally been tied to the topic of UFO secrecy and UFO control. Now, I don&#x27;t really understand the inner workings of the Knights of Malta. I&#x27;m going to be looking at them in the future and I don&#x27;t know whether they are the kind of group that would relentlessly cover up the truth about the UFO issue or may in fact be somehow involved in the modern disclosure movement.</p>
<p>I simply don&#x27;t have that information. So the jury&#x27;s out on whether or not we can put more chips on McCraven really being an adviser. But it is fascinating to see how all these details line up. But McCraven isn&#x27;t the only admiral that we can place in Austin in 2016. Another four-star admiral who has constantly been associated with infamous UFO law was based in Austin during this time period and that was fourstar admiral Bobby Ray Inman.</p>
<p>During this time he was teaching courses at the University of Texas. And if there is anybody who has been involved in the UFO topic and may in fact have inside information, I think we can all agree that Bobby Ray Inman would be on the list. Once again, there is no way to definitively confirm that it was him in this meeting. But as we&#x27;re going to see when we look at our next speculated adviser, Admiral Inman may have some of the qualities required to qualify for Tom Dong&#x27;s list of secret advisers. Now, this next fourstar is actually a general, and it&#x27;s not an individual that you can deduce by reading Valet&#x27;s journals, but it was revealed accidentally by Tom Dong during his 27 interview with Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, I&#x27;m sitting with this guy. He was like not that long ago was director of CIA and he went on to be director of NSA. Right. When I sat down and told him about the book, you know what he says to me? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; He goes, &quot;I didn&#x27;t read much science fiction as a kid, but I read a lot about Greek mythology.&quot; And looked me in the eye. I said, &quot;Well, you&#x27;re gonna love the last page of my book then.&quot; He&#x27;s like, &quot;Am I the only person who has ever been both director of the CIA and director of the NSA is the fourstar general, Michael Hayden.</p>
<p>Hayden has been embedded in the depths of defense and intelligence for his entire career and his think tank, the Hayden Center, has even recently held events focused on unidentified anomalous phenomena. Very interesting. Once again, there is no way to definitively prove that Dong was referencing Hayden specifically. But interestingly, the only other individual who could have come close to such a description would have been Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who is both director of the NSA and then deputy director of the CIA. He doesn&#x27;t quite meet the qualification, but he&#x27;s the only other individual who could possibly have met a description of that kind.</p>
<p>So, now we&#x27;ve got three individuals that we can put into the maybe category. And I think it&#x27;s probably time to stop speculating about who these deep dark advisers really are and get back to Valet&#x27;s journals for some of the most fascinating insights that he gives us. Because Valet doesn&#x27;t just document hints about who the secret advisers were. He also shares exactly the narrative they were telling to Tom Dong. And believe me, it&#x27;s stranger than you thought.</p>
<p>As Valet speaks with Dong more and more, he moves from being impressed about his advisers to becoming worried about what they&#x27;re telling him. He documents an interaction in an entry from June 2016. Tom Dong calls me about the latest WOW revelations from his advisers. The new story line goes back to the Greek gods creating a hybrid race of Nordics, hence the German [music] esoteric traditions that led to the German sourcer prototypes in the 1930s. But the full power wasn&#x27;t realized by the Nazi until they went to South America, gained the ancient Mayan knowledge, and those Nazi are in Antarctica.</p>
<p>None of this makes sense, but highpowered military leaders are involved along with senior managers at the skunk works. As Valet would continue to meet with Dong, he would keep documenting the strange and mysterious things that he was hearing from his advisers. Firstly, [music] that there are hypothetical Nazi geniuses in the wings, presumably the wings of our world [music] today. Next, they&#x27;ve been saying to him very clearly that the Nazis had contact with the phenomenon. Next, Valet documents multiple topics that Dong&#x27;s advisers were covering.</p>
<p>Nazi sources, Antarctica, claims of contact in South America, and speculation about Roswell. Well, next you might ask, what was it that they were saying about Roswell? Valet continues, &quot;In the cockpit of the crashed disc at Roswell, they found two bodies, an Atlantan and a German pilot,&quot; Tom said flatly. And finally, Valet documents Tom meeting with an admiral who brought up ancient Greece, Athens, and Sparta, the Athenians, and the bugs. For those of you who&#x27;ve listened to the original Dong interviews, he often hints at some of these topics. Antarctica, Atlantis, the Nazis maybe having done some pretty impressive stuff, but he never fully ties it all together.</p>
<p>But here in these journals, we get a consistent clear narrative of exactly what he was being told by his advisers. And it looks like it goes something like this. There are different species of non-human intelligences. Firstly, there are these Atlantean Nordic beings. And then there&#x27;s what he calls the bugs.</p>
<p>These groups clearly have been in conflict based on the journal entries. Whether that&#x27;s in the original Atlantean world that he was being told about, potentially in ancient Greece, in Sparta and Athens, and even in the modern world today, [music] the Nazi made contact with one of these groups, presumably the Atlantean Nordic group, because [music] later a German Nazi would be found in the crashed disc at Roswell with one of these Atlantean Nordic beings. According to the same mythology, the Nazi went to South America and not only had further contact, but discovered some sort of strange ancient Mayan mystery which helped them in their quest. And those Nazi ultimately ended up in Antarctica and were doing something down there. Most importantly, those Nazis that are being described in that mythology are also being described as being in the world today.</p>
<p>And this is important because [music] it takes the story that Dong is being told from just an interesting myth to something that is a tangible reality in how we think about the world. And the idea was that this story would be disseminated to the youth. As we&#x27;re going to see a little bit later, that program continues and its implications could be profound not just in terms of how we think about nonhuman intelligence, but maybe even the idea of whether or not we would invade certain countries. As Valet would continue to meet with Dong, he would be struck by attention that he was facing. On the one hand, he was deeply impressed by the quality of his advisers and on the other hand, he was totally shocked by the strange things that they were telling him.</p>
<p>In multiple entries, he documents this tension. First starting in June of 2016, the 29th of June 2016. As Tom&#x27;s plans become clearer, I push back on his pronouncements about hypothetical Nazi geniuses in the wings. The 7th of August, 2016. The first book issued by Tom Dong&#x27;s company follows Nazi scientists to Argentina, then to Antarctica, where they supposedly have a military base.</p>
<p>I told him that makes no sense. Is that a meme that somebody is reviving to be popularized by Dong and why not by Annie Jacobson who suggested the object that crashed at Roswell was German sent over courtesy of Stalin? Why is the same legend popping up in a novel inspired by American military brass? And finally on the 14th of January 2017, Chris Melon came over for dinner. me spoke of To the Stars Academy, which I&#x27;m still invited to rejoin in some capacity, but I can&#x27;t align myself with it. Here lies the paradox. Tom&#x27;s backers are among those who must know about the sequestered hardware, but what are they trying to do? The fact that Valet can&#x27;t align himself with Tom Dong&#x27;s plans and the To the Stars Academy initiative [music] is deeply revealing.</p>
<p>It reminds us not to think in black and white when it comes to this movement, not to assume that all the individuals that we associate with UFO disclosure are necessarily aligned or think the same way. And as we&#x27;re going to see, it&#x27;s not just Valet. Next, it&#x27;s Jim Semivan. Now, this next entry is quite difficult to read, and it&#x27;s phrased quite strangely, but it seems as though Valet is having a conversation with someone he describes as a podcaster. At one point, Valet asks him about Tom Dong.</p>
<p>And this is what the podcaster says. He&#x27;s been told that the Roswell tale in Annie Jacobson&#x27;s book was true about German technology dropped in the desert. Now, following this statement, Jim Seivan has [music] something to say. Jim Seivan exploded when he heard that. Why in the hell are these four star guys talking like this? Obviously flustered and angry, the man went on.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also a violation of federal law to fool the American people by posting false data, classified or not, targeting 12year-old kids dot dot dot. It&#x27;s one thing to know that Valet is concerned about this Nazi mythology, but I would never have guessed that Jim Seivian, who continues to work in the company, had questions and doubts about some of these stories. We don&#x27;t know what conversations he had or with whom or what information he saw or how he might have ended up believing that this initiative was actually a good thing. And I genuinely mean we just don&#x27;t know that. And my assumption is that Semivan is a stand-up guy.</p>
<p>Just my personal opinion. But he wasn&#x27;t the only person who was having to do a little bit of extra thinking about what was going on. In another entry, Valet documents how Christopher Melon was thinking about all of this information. The dust settles on the Delmare meetings with Jim Semi Van taking a direct interest in Tom Dong&#x27;s projects. Chris Melon has responded warmly to my note.</p>
<p>He must have heard about my skepticism about mixing up Greek gods with Nazi sources. So he pointed out that the group could be providing a potentially useful inoculating function to help prepare the public against what could someday be a shocking and disruptive revelation perhaps. But how does the Nazi connection help? The idea of an inoculating function is a really helpful analogy. Let&#x27;s imagine that there is some sort of existential threat impending. Whether or not it&#x27;s coming in 2027 or 207 doesn&#x27;t matter.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s say that it is known by people inside of the defense and intelligence community that at some point a future generation is going to be confronted by some shocking and devastating information. It&#x27;s going to completely change the way that we think about our place in the world and could lead to the destabilization of our society if we are not properly prepared for it. The idea of slowly introducing a mythology into the world that could help young people slowly acclimatize to the big concepts actually makes some sense. Why not slowly adjust people before revealing the real information? Perhaps this also makes sense of this distinction between confirmation, this initial soft wave, and then real disclosure, which may be destabilizing. By doing confirmation first, you take a bit of the risk out of the full disclosure.</p>
<p>The idea on paper sounds relatively reasonable and you can see how the to the stars academy project was tightly aligned with this. The secret machines franchise fiction and non-fiction trickling new ideas into the consciousness. Then you&#x27;ve got the most recent book as well, Time Rider and the Trinity book. And now there&#x27;s even another one being written that Jim Seivan has hinted at. But all of these aren&#x27;t simply mythologies about gods waring in our skies in our ancient history.</p>
<p>The To the Stars Academy project has consistently pushed a strange Nazi narrative. In the Secret Machines books, a Nazi theme is prevalent throughout. In the most recent release that they&#x27;ve just dropped, Time Rider, AJ Hartley specifically documents how some of the characters are supposed to represent a Nazi group. And so this world of the future we&#x27;re talking about like 2157 is a world that is they say the sort of pinnacle of human evolution and the mission that Bowie that is our central character is sent on is he is told to preserve their version of the present by going back into the past to prevent people from interfering with it. And it&#x27;s this is a sort of classic time travel trope, but yeah, the alphas represent, for want of a better term, the kind of evolution of a sort of Nazi ideology.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And Jim Semivan has even talked [music] about the fact that they&#x27;re going to be releasing a new book soon, which specifically deals with what happened to the Nazis after the war. &gt;&gt; What do you make of the in that book like the Project Paper Club aspect of it and the secret machines? there&#x27;s like a there&#x27;s a kind of major theme of that um that you know had some of them working on the UAP program and stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s this goes back a while. You know it&#x27;s [music] um we have a we have one TTS is working on a a story now.</p>
<p>I I can&#x27;t get into too much detail, but basically based on how that began and where it where it went to after the war in South America and and then who got involved and how it got trans. &gt;&gt; Is that going to be uh fiction or non-fiction story? &gt;&gt; Uh it&#x27;ll have it&#x27;ll have to be fiction. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a lot of Nazi stuff. Now, you might be thinking to yourself, look, it&#x27;s just a bit of mythology. It&#x27;s just a bit of weird storytelling.</p>
<p>it isn&#x27;t going to have that big of an effect. But before you make that judgment, let me read you a quote from the most recent third book in the Secret Machines non-fiction trilogy. In the book, Lenda and Dong document word for word a message that they received from one of Dong&#x27;s advisers. And it says this, &quot;Tom, my own sense of taste and proprietary is to leave modern German citizens and especially the modern German [music] state out of it. Expat Nazis and their spawn hiding in South America.</p>
<p>Game on.&quot; This note is dated to 2016 in the middle of the period when Valet was having his conversations with Dong. What&#x27;s so important about this is it shows that his advisers were not simply building a story about Nazis from the distant past, but instead were postulating an aggressive stance against supposed neo-Nazis living in South America today. This, I believe, is what has Valet so concerned. The to the stars academy mythology could easily be manipulated to trigger geopolitical consequences. The most frustrating thing about all of this is we have no way to validate whether the Nazis really did make contact with a non-human intelligence and whether that same group of Nazis persists in our world today and does constitute some sort of threat.</p>
<p>Despite this, someone from Tom&#x27;s advisory group seemed to have a deep obsession with a Nazi threat in the world today and wanted of all people to share this with Tom Dong. Someone who is specifically positioning himself as giving influence to the coming generation. But if you think that&#x27;s disturbing, this final detail I&#x27;m going to share with you in the video today is going to rock your world. There is another individual who is associated with the to the stars academy movement who seems to have been influencing the way that Tom Dong was thinking. This person has been associated with some of the most far out Nazi conspiracy theories that have ever been articulated.</p>
<p>According to Ryan Bledsoe, he and his father Chris Bledsoe met with the people from To the Stars Academy and sitting shoulderto-shoulder with them was an individual called William Tomkins. And I forgot to mention this part um just a few minutes ago when we were talking about um Tom and Lou, but something that did occur was when they were trying to make my dad a core member of TTSA. They were offering to produce a movie about us and they wanted dad to sign a contract where he would have a monthly retainer fee, $15,000 a month for the rest of his life. &gt;&gt; They would use the Chris Melon uh you know Chris Melon, he&#x27;s one of the core members. &gt;&gt; I do.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; He would fund the movie. It would be like a, you know, a big budget Hollywood movie, but there was a catch. It had to be spun in a way that there was reptilians that eat people. So, here&#x27;s what happened, right? Dad flies out to LA and he meets with Tom and he he meets with uh Bill Tomkins who at the time of dad meeting him, he was like 93 years old.</p>
<p>Do you know who this is? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You know Admiral Bird? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; From the 40s, right? So they had the whole like fleet go out to Antarctica and they said they saw like saucers and uh went to the edge of the world and they talked about like there&#x27;s a eighth continent, right? And all all that stuff. Bill Tommpkins was involved in that whole story.</p>
<p>He was naval intelligence and the idea that they spin is that he was basically the engineer that designed the spaceships for the secret space program. Right? I think it&#x27;s a bunch of garbage, but it&#x27;s what they were telling dad that we fight wars all throughout the galaxy and you know, we&#x27;ve been to the moon and and and there&#x27;s reptilians there with a base and they flicked us off when we landed and we never went back cuz we&#x27;ve been too scared. And for those of you who don&#x27;t know, William F. Tomkins served in the Navy and would later go on to work in the world of aerospace for the Douglas Aircraft Company and TRW. Those were legitimate roles that he had.</p>
<p>But later in his life, he would begin to share strange stories about what he claimed the Navy was up to with nonhuman intelligences and even stranger narratives about what the Nazis were up to, too. Here is a summary of some of the most far out things that he was saying where the Draco reptilians made an agreement with Hitler, the Third Reich, and the SS. Then they [music] would organize and structure German space navy battle groups using these vehicles all out through the galaxy in conjunction with the Draco reptilian space navy and do the same thing to all those other planets out there in the galaxy. The Navy had been involved with the German facilities in Antarctica and the Draco reptilian facilities in caverns in the Antarctica. &gt;&gt; How did you learn that your secretaries were indeed Nordic extra Nordic extraterrestrials? &gt;&gt; She simply opened up and started telepathically putting stuff in my head like so fast I couldn&#x27;t even keep keep up with it.</p>
<p>uh answering the problems, coming up with major problems, answers to them. She answered over 50% of all of the major problems of Apollo. Honestly, when claims are this far out, my BS detector just goes way off the charts. I could be completely wrong, but I believe that information like this is purposefully disseminated into the UFO community to throw us off the scent. And maybe one day I&#x27;m going to find out that I was missing a hot lead here and an opportunity to really understand the inner workings of what&#x27;s been going on in our world.</p>
<p>But for now, I think an individual like Bill Tomkins sets off massive alarm bells. What does this mean about the To the Stars Academy movement? Because now we don&#x27;t simply have four stars whispering strange things into Tom&#x27;s ears, but it seems he was also permitted to spend time learning from people who were pushing out the most insane conspiracy theories that we have in our community. With such ideas swirling around the brain of Tom Dong and intermingling into the initiatives of To the Stars Academy, it&#x27;s no wonder that Valet is concerned. And perhaps this also explains why later on in his journals he begins to postulate that there may indeed be a false flag plan at play. And remember this is coming from an individual who has studied the phenomenon and definitely believes that it&#x27;s real.</p>
<p>But despite this, he begins to wonder whether or not such a plan could be rolling out. And strangely enough, of all the people he finds himself agreeing with, it&#x27;s Steven Greer. Tonight, Greer gives a webinar in Vegas about false flag operations. This time, he may touch a genuine topic. He claims that covert interests are laying the foundation for a false flag alien threat and a militaristic project 1940s to the present.</p>
<p>If you think this was just an off-the- cuff thought, well, think again. Just under a year later, Valet would add another entry. Greer now says that disclosure serves secrecy, which reflects my own thinking. He points to false flag operations and the disinformation of the public. Let&#x27;s just be super clear here.</p>
<p>Jacqu Valet believes in the phenomenon. He also believes that that phenomenon constitutes a threat based on the huge amount of research that he did for the ORSAP program and the Capella database that he put together. And finally, he also even recounts in these same journals how the group of ORSAP scientists that he spent time with believed that a threat had been detected and that something was coming. That same valet is also speculating that there could be a false flag coming as well. And it&#x27;s no wonder when you look at all the pieces.</p>
<p>From Valet&#x27;s perspective, he understands why people like Jim Seaman and Chris Melon would want disclosure. He also understands the high caliber of the individuals who are advising Dong. But he can&#x27;t understand this strange mythology around Nazis who exist in the world today being permeated into the minds of the youth. As we wrap up this video, I want to share one more entry with you which I think is deeply telling. In 2017, Valet documents a comment from Jim Seiban.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a left foot and a right foot. Jim Sean observed obviously concerned. The left foot doesn&#x27;t know what the right foot is doing. There&#x27;s a strong possibility that we&#x27;ll be shut down without knowing why or by whom. The next time you hear somebody saying that Jim Seivan is the big guy who&#x27;s behind it all, come back to this journal entry.</p>
<p>The next time someone tells you that Chris Melon is connected to the control group who really has power over all of this, come back to these journals because I think the picture that gets built is a lot more complex than that. In the shadows, you have these four stars whispering strange things into the ears of Dong. Then you have people like Bill Tommpkins, basically just a UFO guy, also whispering into Dong&#x27;s ears. Then you have the likes of Jim Semivan and Chris Melon who find themselves involved in this project, but clearly don&#x27;t believe everything that&#x27;s being shared. And then you&#x27;ve got people like Dr.</p>
<p>Jack Valet, who wants UFO disclosure, but can&#x27;t align himself with this strange initiative. UFO disclosure is messy. It&#x27;s not monolithic. Not everybody is aligned and not everybody understands exactly what is going on. As Jim Seivan said, there&#x27;s a right foot out there which is dictating things that he doesn&#x27;t necessarily have access to, but it&#x27;s pushing things forwards from the shadows.</p>
<p>And for what purpose, we don&#x27;t necessarily know. The truth is there are likely multiple factions who have different outcomes that they want from this entire movement. Whether it&#x27;s these shadowy people from to the stars or whether it&#x27;s some of the religious groups that are out there trying to reframe the disclosure narrative in a way that suits their worldview. Be thoughtful, be skeptical, and always come back to valet for now. I think we need to wrap up.</p>
<p>I just want to say a couple of things. Please do subscribe. Please like, share, comment, all of those things because they have a huge impact on the success and the reach of the channel. And the sooner we can build the channel to a certain level, I might be able to do this full-time. Now, maybe that doesn&#x27;t matter to you.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m sorry for asking you, right, that&#x27;s very much a me thing. But if you&#x27;re enjoying these videos and if you find them genuinely insightful, I&#x27;ll be able to do more of them at a higher quality once we reach a certain level. On top of that, if you really do believe in this content and you&#x27;re finding it to be an antidote to the madness of the disclosure community, there is a Patreon linked in the description. I would be honored if you joined and you can even join as a free member and there&#x27;s lots of extra content on there, including a deep dive on all this stuff I&#x27;ve talked about which will be released soon because we literally have only scratched the surface. But with all of that said, my name&#x27;s Jason Samosa.</p>
<p>This has been Jason Samosa&#x27;s Huology Moments. And until next time, cheers.</p>
