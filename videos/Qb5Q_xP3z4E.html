            <p>Did you know NATO&#x27;s chief auditor was found dead with a bullet in his head and zero gunshot residue on his hands? December 16th, 2017, Anden, Belgium. Eve Shandelon&#x27;s body was discovered in his car, 140 km from home. A single gunshot wound to the head, his service weapon lying beside him in his non-dominant hand. For months, he&#x27;d been investigating NATO&#x27;s black budget operations and suspicious arms deals. He told family members he felt threatened, that someone wanted him silenced.</p>
<p>The official ruling, suicide. But forensics told a different story. No powder burns, wrong hand placement, no logical reason to drive so far. His final investigation into financial corruption within the military alliance died with him. The case was quietly closed.</p>
