            <p>um I&#x27;m going to do something a little bit out of the ordinary here we&#x27;re going to give three people a chance at an additional three minutes so Mr merchant do you want to keep going why don&#x27;t you come back to me Mr chairman Miss Luna if she&#x27;s on the issue on that list sure uh chairman I&#x27;d like to submit for the record an article by news nation and it follows Mr grush&#x27;s full interview for the record without objection thank you um Mr grush why is it that you referred to the phenomenon as non-human intelligence why deviate from the basis of extraterrestrial life I think the phenomenon is uh a very complex and I like to leave an open mind analytically to specific origin when you say specific origin are you referring can you elaborate on that for those that might if it&#x27;s a traditional extraterrestrial origin or something else that we don&#x27;t quite understand uh from either biological or astrophysics perspective yeah just like the keep an open mind on what it could be yeah okay and referring to your new news Nation interview you had referenced specific treaties between governments article 3 of the nuclear arms treaty with Russia identifies uaps it specifically mentions them to your knowledge are there safety measures in place with foreign governments or other superpowers to avoid an escalatory situation in the event that a UAP malevolent event occurs uh yeah you&#x27;re referring to actual a public treaty in the U.N register it&#x27;s funny you mentioned that the agreement on measures to reduce the risk of outbreak a nuclear war sign in 1971 unclassified treaty publicly available and If you cite the George Washington University National Security archives you will find the Declassified in 2013 specific Provisions in the specific Red Line flask message traffic with the specific codes pursuant to article 3 an article uh also situation two which is in the the previously classified NSA archive what I would recommend and I I tried to get access but I got a wall of Silence at the White House was the specific incidents when those um message traffic was used I think uh some scholarship on that would open the door to a further investigation using those publicly available information thank you and then my last question with 51 seconds remaining you mentioned white collar crimes potentially being um taking place in regards to a cover-up can you please elaborate I have concerns based on the interviews I conducted under my official duties of potential violations of the federal acquisition regulations the far thank you very much chairman I yield the remainder of my time</p>
