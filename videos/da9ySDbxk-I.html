            <p>filing a patent is completely utterly useless to do yes I think people would be after to your life so I thinking that free the free the free energy oppression conspiracy theory something that began in the mid 19 century and it&#x27;s a theory that claims that big government organizations and big uh corporations they don&#x27;t want people to have access to free energy and when you talk of free energy you&#x27;re talking about very low cost like very low cost um energy that can be able any person can be able to come up with and also mostly when people talk about this they&#x27;re talking about petal motion machines you have papetal motion machines C Fusion Cal Fusion was being done by somebody called Eugene malov and he was unived sometime in 2004 he was killed and the police say that it was a robbery case and some of the people in this field who have passed before we know the most common person is Stanley May then Stanley May came up with a water fuel cell he said that he can be able to retrofit a car and the car can be able to run on water fuel like you retrofit a car then it runs on water fuel and not electricity remember this was some time back when um when like many people are depending on gasoline to be able to use their Cur and this this concept of free like the concept of EV was not there that time I mean it was but it was not like anybody can be able to do it so Stanley Maya came up with a water fuel cell and he said that I can be able to retrofit any car and car will be able to run on water he was able to do it on his car that is what he said but when some three experts went and looked at the car they realized they said that it wasn&#x27;t anything revolutionary and that it doesn&#x27;t work again um he was in a court and they say that this was a case of like fraud and the investors who had put money in wanted their money back he was fined to pay something around 20 $25,000 so he had to pay $225,000 and um what happened to him is there&#x27;s some time I think this was March 20 March 1998 he was having a dinner with some Belgian investors then he ran a outside and say that they had poisoned him after running outside he fell down and he died but when the police came and checked they say that after doing some autopsy and all that they say that they don&#x27;t find any case of somebody being killed or anything close to it like it wasn&#x27;t a poisonous case but rather the police said that it was just a case of cerebral an anism or something close to that like a brain issue or something and and people believe that it was just a cover up so you&#x27;re saying that yes free energy separation exist else government cannot control people easily so that is what people believe in the free energy conspiracy theory claim yeah that it is a way that the government is trying to control the People by forcing them to be able to use only the energy which is available suppression let me try let me change the thing do you believe there is oparation uh with this technology there is yeah and I think sometimes some of the stuff is a bit fake that um yeah yeah I don&#x27;t know it does seem a little bit disingenuous in some aspects yeah yeah yeah I saying that I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of people come to my email saying that they want to share about free energy they&#x27;ve been able to discover or come up with then when the date comes I tell them now can we do it today or tomorrow uh when tomorrow comes they say that they can&#x27;t do it because they fear for their life and sometimes I feel that somebody maybe is just lying going to pick something that happened maybe in the past and they start playing that in their life as well like do you feel maybe that&#x27;s the case or some people are genuine they have the technology but people are after their life yes I think people would be after your life you have to accept that you can&#x27;t not um be aware of that if you get what I&#x27;m trying to say yeah that&#x27;s like one of the main issues why yeah it&#x27;s so controversial but um you you have to take the good with the bad you can&#x27;t be like Oh I&#x27;m not going to put that information out there because I fear for my life you understand you have to put things in place to deal with it like for instance open sourcing it and um yeah you know making sure you get as much public um attention so then that act as a form of protection as well the fact that you&#x27;re out in the public and everybody can see you and you be as transparent as possible so that will act as a layer of protection but you you you have to take the good but the bad you be extremely um uh yeah as transparent as possible and yeah I&#x27;m not trying to say it&#x27;s going to it&#x27;s not bulletproof obviously it&#x27;s not because you can get shot by a bullet I&#x27;m just yeah the reality is you put you with that kind of thing you have to be um yeah you have to put yourself out there but uh yeah I hear you talking about the suppression and you know it goes way back I&#x27;m a little bit of a historian when it comes to this stuff yeah and when Tesla and uh Nathan Stubblefield guys like that as soon as the bankers or any kind of financial institution got involved with these guys that&#x27;s where the suppression and the control started so for example say like Tesla if you take an electrical engineering course today they don&#x27;t even talk about he&#x27;s not even mentioned when in my personal opinion when you start electrical engineering that should be one of the first guys mentioned in the course if it wasn&#x27;t for him we wouldn&#x27;t have the modern day that we have today but because he had an issue with uh JP Morgan and he wanted to do the free energy from his Wen Cliff Tower he cut all the funding off he says why would I want that I can&#x27;t put a on go ahead I was going to say that now do you believe like the disc comment from lero he&#x27;s saying that in in US end real free energy working generator will be confiscated when inventor files for a patent yeah filing a patent is completely utterly useless to do they have a section 113 in the US Pat off office and get screened by the military all right not by civilian get screened by the military if they if they deem it as a military interest or um uh something that will be uh a danger to National Security they&#x27;ll put a ban on to put in a blacklist and that happens to a friend of mine the other the device back in he was getting the patent around 1994 and had all the documentation it was tested by Georgia Tech MIT really reputable institutions but they wouldn&#x27;t sign off on it so you know to make a long story short they went you know ahead with the patent and the government seized it so that was around 1994 it was called the MRA device I see even yeah even like solar panels they&#x27;re not allowed to be over 22% efficient they will not p</p>
