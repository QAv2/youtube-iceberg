            <p>the jogan experience but anyway that&#x27;s where we were heading this one day so we all packed up uh we&#x27;re in batty Nevada which is the burrow in I can tell you that&#x27;s where we always hold up at and we take off from there every morning to go do the am and the PM push that&#x27;s what you call it when the war is on you call it the push so we had one in the morning called am push one in the afternoon PM push so we were all heading up for the am push in a convoy there&#x27;s three vehicles probably about three to four people per vehicle um I&#x27;m in the lead vehicle with the ranking guy he&#x27;s he&#x27;s driving and I&#x27;m right behind him and then there&#x27;s another gentleman in the passenger seat across from the driver and then there&#x27;s a young lady next to me and we&#x27;re all going up and uh the ranking guy had been there the week before and he had seen the Craft um Fly by CU that that was and that one&#x27;s out there on the internet you can pull down the video there&#x27;s a report that goes along with it that show there&#x27;s a video that we can watch right now right now yeah what would he search search for um let me think Nellis test range UFO 1994 who filmed this this was filmed by The Operators on the Range because you&#x27;re we&#x27;re putting these pilots in a risky situation by playing war with them but we training them so if there is any kind of a mishap or a pilot or plane goes down everything needs to be recorded So they have this is it right here yes so this is being taken this video is being taken by one of these cameras that&#x27;s up up on the Range and along the bottom you see that this uh is also trying to lock on to the craft so it can you know follow it as it goes in and out because this is the kind of way that you want to track if there&#x27;s a craft that is having problems and this is moving very radically right so this is what my the ranking guide saw can I pause you for a second this track is this manual or is this like some an automated system it&#x27;s an automated system so the automated system is having a hard time locking on locking on to it yeah if it locks on you&#x27;ll see a big spike and that means that it finally locks on right now it&#x27;s trying to but something is stopping it from locking on and they think it was the craft and it&#x27;s moving like crazy side to side all over there&#x27;s actually a recording that goes with it where you got you hear the guys going hey does anybody know what this is what what&#x27;s going on here can we hear that get on here I&#x27;m [Music] okay don&#x27;t [Applause] know okay the the the sound is terrible yeah they need better mics honestly working up there but I&#x27;m sure but but he&#x27;s saying what is that I don&#x27;t know we&#x27;re having a hard time locking on to it right right this is the video operator so this the following week after this happens this video is taken uh the ranking guy who had been there the week before and saw this thing flying he takes us in this when you you go on the Range through this one gate here it goes up a little ways and then there&#x27;s a contonment area it&#x27;s got a very small place where you can change your tires get gas uh you know just m you know minor maintenance to get your butt home if you have a car that&#x27;s busted and then in the back of that kin area there&#x27;s two Huts that look like campers really glorified camper so the video operators are in the one that&#x27;s off to the uh the north east of the the contonment in the very corner of it and the ranking guy just says we all have to go in here we&#x27;re going to go talk to the video operators we have to do this and uh and this was because the week prior everybody came back to Garrison or back to the our unit um and they had seen this thing and they were all talking about this UFO so we go in there and there&#x27;s the video operator he has us all right our names down whether we were there and saw it the first week or not then he makes us all sit down and watch that video and he says do you know what this is and we&#x27;re like no and then he just said okay thank you and then we as after everybody that was there saw it and had wrote their name down we were allowed to leave and that was all that was required and um so I was like what was that all about but then as I&#x27;m exiting this lady that had been sitting against the wall on the far part of the uh this little Hut that we were in and uh she like grabs my arm and she just says there&#x27;s somebody on the Range don&#x27;t talk to him and she was really really freaked out and I&#x27;m like thanks strange freaky lady I&#x27;m got it and I&#x27;m like whatever so I we all hop out we get in the vehicles and then start taking off towards Quartz Mountain because right at that contonment area there&#x27;s a hard right there&#x27;s a hard right that goes off to Quartz Mountain and um about a mile half a mile to a mile down that road it&#x27;s all dirt road up by the way um there&#x27;s this guy looks like he&#x27;s wearing a uniform like we are you got batt dress uniform on um so he&#x27;s he&#x27;s sees us and he starts to look like he&#x27;s running and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s got this really weird run like his arms are kind of flailing behind it&#x27;s like he was running against the hurricane wind and it was like he was going to fall over at any time and I was like yeah it&#x27;s a bit windy today but ain&#x27;t that bad so it looked really strange and then I began to notice his skin tone would looked like he might be hypothermic and I&#x27;m thinking oh crap this dude&#x27;s been out here it&#x27;s freaking freezing out here because it was a very cold day and the wind was blowing it was you know those cold days where it didn&#x27;t matter how many layers you had on and um so as we&#x27;re getting closer I&#x27;m talking to the the ranking guy hey we need to slow down so uh anyway uh I&#x27;m thinking this guy&#x27;s probably in big trouble I need to to pull off my jacket I need to give him something to get warm real quick so I&#x27;m starting to do that and we&#x27;re approaching and by the time we I get my jacket most of the way off uh he&#x27;s right there uh at the you know the corner of the the front of the car and I so so he looks pale is that what you&#x27;re saying you look like an albino with a very bluish kind of undertone if you can imagine you know so you you&#x27;re assuming like a you&#x27;re you&#x27;re immediately associating that with like he&#x27;s freezing yeah because that&#x27;s that&#x27;s all I could equate it to and then um as I&#x27;m starting to open my door to try to you know administer Aid to this guy um the dude in the front passenger seat screams he&#x27;s got no ears and I thought that was pretty rude because I was like the guy&#x27;s in trouble does he have a hat on does he he&#x27;s got a hat on and he&#x27;s got bdus that look absolutely clean pristine and when you&#x27;re U range you do not wear your your cleanest uniform you&#x27;re in a dirty environment you wear your scuffed up boots you don&#x27;t take them with you so he&#x27;s got clean battle dress uniform United States mil very out of place yeah it looks very out of place when I I finally do that but anyway I step out onto the roadway and this guy screams that he&#x27;s got no ears and I just thinking it&#x27;s really rude and then it closed the door and I look up and he&#x27;s got no freaking ears and his eyes are twice as big and I just I&#x27;m like yeah what the hell did I just walk into this guy&#x27;s not from around here how far away from him are you um probably from me uh just a few feet yeah just a few just talking distance okay and um I&#x27;m starting to freak out but but then he starts to talk to me and it&#x27;s not my language but it&#x27;s coming to the the understanding is like coming into my mind about every word he&#x27;s saying cuz uh so he&#x27;s actually saying words he&#x27;s say saying words but it doesn&#x27;t sound like anything I&#x27;ve heard before but you&#x27;re understanding what he&#x27;s saying but I&#x27;m understanding so I know there&#x27;s a telepathic thing going on here and it calms me down at the same time because I&#x27;m having to respond to him and he&#x27;s like hello I&#x27;m having trouble with my craft I need some repair material do you know where I could find some trenum and this is what he&#x27;s talking to me about and I&#x27;m like you mean titanium CU I didn&#x27;t know anything about trenum at the time uh but titanium he&#x27;s like no it&#x27;s not it um and I I&#x27;m like well at this point in my career I had just left the program so I knew where Dreamland was and I pointed to the mountain range CU you can see for for days in the desert but I pointed towards the mountain range and I said uh dreamlands just over there and and this wave of emotion hit me like disgust like I am not gonna talk to those barbarians and murderers you know wow so he was saying that to you like his reaction to going to the military base was exactly yeah I was not not like it he said I am not going to talk to those people um and then I was like well shoot and it was barbarians and murders he he literally that was what he called them yes and mentally that&#x27;s what it was but the emotion trinitium is this a real thing well that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve had a lot of friends there&#x27;s analysts also that were on the the top secret uh Network that were trying to help me understand what material we were throwing everything at him we&#x27;re like is it this is it this and he&#x27;s like and finally that&#x27;s the one when they hit trenum I was like that&#x27;s what it was um that&#x27;s what he said and what is trinitium it&#x27;s a type of uh well can he bring it up on the yeah sure because it should pop up on Wikipedia pretty quick but um it has some properties that probably work but are you saying trinitium yeah tritium is uh that&#x27;s the stuff that&#x27;s in Loom like in your watch when your watch glows that&#x27;s uh or you know they they make those where they it&#x27;s they&#x27;re basically radioactive isotopes that stay lit so like if you get like um Marathon watch Marathon makes military watches and the the it doesn&#x27;t need like this car this watch you need the light and light charges the loom and then when it&#x27;s dark out you could read the hands for like a few hours the thing that they used to put the end of the guns right exactly they still do a lot like Sig has look prum also put is it&#x27;s I did that that&#x27;s not giving me much so trinum chunky glow in the dark glitter what is that oh these are all like these are game web sites oh I see okay so it&#x27;s tritium then maybe mispronouncing but tritium is that&#x27;s that radioactive isotope that&#x27;s the stuff that emits light yep so emits a weak form of radiation yes rare Radioactive isotope of hydrogen with a half life of 12.3 years mhm okay so this is what he&#x27;s asking me for so he&#x27;s asking you for that stuff tridium yep and I&#x27;m like I don&#x27;t know where to get oh look at that it&#x27;s used in boosted fision weapons and thermonuclear weapons oh great that sounds pretty right I wonder what the [ __ ] it&#x27;s doing on your wrist is there this is what we this is what the best image that we have what he could have looked like oh boy can you send that to Jamie yeah I I don&#x27;t know Jamie&#x27;s number but I we&#x27;ll find a way to is that an iPhone or an yeah is that an iPhone if I had my phone I would but it&#x27;s out there I think yeah air drop it to Jamie do you know how to do that there was that how dare you not know how to do that and there&#x27;s a thre diim works with UFOs you better know how to do that well there&#x27;s a three-dimensional image of The Craft as well that is really spoton from what I saw that day yeah um because not only did I see this guy running towards us and talking to him but off the shoulder of the on the north side of the the roadway that&#x27;s where the craft was just resting on the the desert floor and that&#x27;s I got a really good look at it at that point and uh it this guy did a 3D rendering of the description and it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s spot-on as I&#x27;ve ever seene it&#x27;s almost perfect so he asks you for tridium you tell him dream this is what it looked like this is what the guy looked like pretty close to it yo the nose the nose was a little bit rounder on the end but uh that was is a really good rendition but yeah his his eyes just his eyes almost came out to he on the temple wow and that would freak me out it it freaked me out I mean honestly I&#x27;m not an easy guy to get you know to get freaked out but that really put that like you&#x27;re you just saw an alligator pop up out of the water kind of thing right so when you tell him go to dreamland it says I&#x27;m not going to go where those murderers and barbarians are and then what happens um and he said no so I was like well where else can I possibly Point him to because I&#x27;m like I don&#x27;t know any metallurgists or whatever so I&#x27;m I&#x27;m thinking to him to me to myself and I&#x27;m and I related to him I said well I&#x27;m taking College CL classes down in the you know in the city of Vegas you know Las Vegas uh at the community college but I have a a geophysical uh Professor that I&#x27;m I&#x27;m you know taking a class from maybe he has a metallurgist friend and he&#x27;s like so you&#x27;re thinking at this time though it&#x27;s a metal I am yeah right cuz you&#x27;re thinking it&#x27;s some kind of like titanium some some type of right right and there&#x27;s also when he this is the 3D image of what the craft looks that is almost as spot on as I&#x27;ve ever seen that is about it right there that&#x27;s almost exactly what I saw resting on the desert floor and so you trying to find different people that you can connect this being to yeah and what is it saying to you while you&#x27;re he he he thought that that was a good idea I think or he was like hm May made him he was he had that that kind of H and he wanted to take action so he just he doesn&#x27;t really even say goodbye he just kind of turns and off he goes back to his craft and I&#x27;m thinking well okay and uh I get back in the car um and sometime during that conversation with this entity I remembered looking over at my friends in the car and they had the weirdest look on their face like they&#x27;re all zonked out um totally zombied um like they couldn&#x27;t even they were just drooling on themselves were they just because they were flabbergasted or was something was going on well I figured out that maybe he W it was done by this entity because uh none of them seem to even remember the incident only a few people seems to remember that we stopped that we had talked to somebody on the roadway but it was mainly the people that were in the back of the the Convoy so they didn&#x27;t see it up close like you did like we did the people were how far away would they be uh they&#x27;d probably be a good uh two car lengths behind us that&#x27;s still enough to detect whether or not someone looks blue though right correct and that&#x27;s probably what they saw but you know me I&#x27;m kind of wide and I&#x27;m big I was very muscular back then and you&#x27;re standing in front of this thing so they&#x27;d have a difficult time cuz this guy stood about a good half foot shorter than me and so they probably could see his arms from time to time maybe catch a glimpse of his face or something um so they probably didn&#x27;t get a very good view because you if you&#x27;re looking at me I&#x27;m standing right next to my door mhm and they behind me kind of almost off obfuscated by just the angle that they&#x27;re looking at him so it could all the windows are tinted in those Vehicles mhm</p>
