            <p>[music playing] GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: I&#x27;m in Poland, at the former headquarters for Hitler&#x27;s subterranean weapons project to investigate the secret work of the Third Reich and their apparent interests in the occult, ancient wisdom, and possibly even advanced</p>
<p>extraterrestrial technology. At the height of World War II, the Nazis engaged their top scientists to develop a number of what they referred to as Wunderwaffe, or wonder weapons.</p>
<p>Weapons that were so diabolical and so scientifically incredible, they would turn the tide of the war against the Allies. According to testimony collected just after the war, one of these top secret projects</p>
<p>was codenamed Die Glocke, or The Bell, and it was believed to be a serious attempt to create a time travel device that could soar through the sky and eventually maybe even reach the speed of light. But following the war,</p>
<p>no trace of the bell was ever found, only a handful of drawings. I&#x27;m determined to find out whether or not this device actually existed. And if so, could it have been</p>
<p>based on designs left behind by ancient astronauts. Could there really be a link between extraterrestrial visitors and the Third Reich? My name is Giorgio Tsoukalos. I explore the world that exists between reality and speculation, the</p>
<p>known and the unknown. What we&#x27;ve been taught by mainstream scholars is not the whole picture. But I&#x27;m convinced that every day, we are one step</p>
<p>closer to the truth. [music playing] During the Second World War, it was widely believed that the German Army possessed the most technologically advanced military on the planet, boasting an arsenal that</p>
<p>included guided missiles, jet aircraft, and precision bombers. Adolf Hitler planned to use this weaponry to defeat the Allied forces and create an empire that would rule the world. But after they were</p>
<p>defeated in 1945, more than 1,600 German scientists were brought to the United States as part of Operation Paper Clip. And there are some who believe that these diabolical minds brought secret</p>
<p>knowledge that may have had an extraterrestrial origin. I&#x27;m in Ludwikowice, Poland, with Igor Witkowski, author of &quot;The Truth About the Wunderwaffe,&quot; or wonder weapons. In 1997, while working</p>
<p>as a military journalist, Igor was shown original documents by a Polish intelligence officer concerning a top secret Nazi project titled Chronos, and a mysterious weapon known as Die Glocke, or The Bell.</p>
<p>Because Chronos in ancient Greek mythology is also the name of the Titan god of time, there are some who believe that project Chronos involved the study of time travel, and Die Glocke might have been part of</p>
<p>some type of a time machine. We are turning left, and we&#x27;re just about to enter the valley in Ludwikowice, Poland, which was sort of a Nazi equivalent of the Area 51, I guess.</p>
<p>GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Igor is taking me to a place called the Henge, which is believed to be a former Nazi science laboratory and the headquarters for project Chronos. So this entire valley</p>
<p>was sealed off. And for what purpose was it sealed off? I mean, what-- what was so secret about this area? Under this valley, there is a huge mine that bankrupted before the war</p>
<p>and was taken over by the SS for-- for their purposes because it&#x27;s-- it&#x27;s something the size of a medium-sized city, underground. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Interesting. OK.</p>
<p>IGOR WITKOWSKI: Yeah, it&#x27;s here. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Wow. I mean-- I mean, I&#x27;m speechless right now. I mean, I-- I don&#x27;t even</p>
<p>know what I&#x27;m looking at. So this is what they&#x27;re referring to as the Henge. It looks as if it&#x27;s made of concrete.</p>
<p>And I mean, it&#x27;s a very interesting structure. So what can you tell me about this? IGOR WITKOWSKI: It appears for the first time on the aerial photographs</p>
<p>in September of 1944. So it certainly has been built shortly before the end of the war. Mhm. IGOR WITKOWSKI: And</p>
<p>the entire valley was dedicated to research and development purposes. And this is one of the objects here. And do you think</p>
<p>that this had something to do with them building the Wunderwaffe and the Glocke? There is one clue about it. The entire valley was sealed off from the outside world, and this structure stands in the very center of the security rings.</p>
<p>The security rings consisted of lines of fortifications. Guarding rooms, bunkers, gates, blockades for tanks, and even lines of trenches, which is something very unusual, because this place was never</p>
<p>close to the front line. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Interesting. According to Igor, the entire valley is honeycombed with chambers, tunnels, and subterranean</p>
<p>laboratories, all once dedicated to the development of futuristic technologies. So this here is ground zero for the Wunderwaffe. And looking around, there&#x27;s some</p>
<p>power plants over here which would require a lot of energy. And one has to wonder, what was it for? The SS general Hans Kammler has built here an enormous industrial research complex.</p>
<p>And this power plant here, which consumed around 1,000 tons of coal per day, was used to power all that undertaking. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Leading the search for the Wunderwaffe was Nazi scientist Hans Kammler.</p>
<p>Some claim that Kammler was the most important officer in the SS and masterminded the development of cutting-edge projects based upon ancient knowledge. Some have suggested that</p>
<p>the Henge was designed to test the Glocke, and that large chains would have been attached to the bizarre structure so that the bell-shaped craft would not fly away prematurely. But the Henge is nothing</p>
<p>compared to the vast network of tunnels and chambers which lie hidden underground, the place where many believe Die Glocke, or The Bell, was constructed. This is very creepy down here, very creepy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s [inaudible],, cold, it is damp. According to Igor, Nazi Germany&#x27;s prisoners of war were forced to participate in high-tech experiments here at the Henge.</p>
<p>This is the guard room. There was a machine down here. These halls were for throwing grenades. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Wow.</p>
<p>I mean, this is crazy. IGOR WITKOWSKI: Yep. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Exactly how many of these experiments were conducted is unknown, but it has been documented</p>
<p>that many former participants suffered nerve damage, and even a condition where the skin was coming off the participants&#x27; faces, as though they had been exposed to high levels of radiation. So do you think that</p>
<p>The Bell might have been a-- a type of a propulsion device for an anti-gravity machine or something like that? The Germans were using a phenomenon which occurs when a high-energy vortex of some kind is separated from the outside world.</p>
<p>And it is causing an anti-gravitational effect. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: According to reports discovered after the war, some have suggested that German scientists</p>
<p>had been experimenting with anti-gravity technologies and had been developing a type of vortex engine powered by mercury. The idea was that the mercury would spin in a gyroscopic manner</p>
<p>within a closed system and create lift, seemingly defying gravity in much the same way many modern UFO sightings are described. Are you aware of any blueprints that were ever discovered of this Wunderwaffe, the way</p>
<p>it might have been shaped, the-- the way it might have looked like? Somewhere here. Yes. You see, it&#x27;s something that resembles a bell.</p>
<p>And it is portrayed here as a part of some larger propulsion system. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: A time machine device embedded in something that looks like a flying saucer.</p>
<p>Could such a device really exist? And if it did, could it really travel through time? You know, the first thing that jumps out at me is that they named this thing here the Vril Number 9.</p>
<p>And Vril is something that refers to power in ancient Tibetan and Sanskrit texts. So why would anyone use this? It&#x27;s this very obscure term, this whole Vril thing.</p>
<p>What can you tell me about why or how this Vril was actually used in this context, here? What they have discovered is that one may induce gravity from electromagnetic forces. Vril, in this case, seems to be the most accurate description of the force that</p>
<p>we are discovering. According to Igor, The Bell disappeared at the end of the war, along with its mastermind, Hans Kammler. And there are those who</p>
<p>speculate to this day that both escaped through a window in time. [music playing] I&#x27;m at Castle Ksiaz in Lower Silesia, Poland, a former development headquarters for many of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s top secret weapons,</p>
<p>known as Wunderwaffe, or wonder weapons. Author and researcher Igor Witkowski has brought me here to show me what he claims to be authentic Nazi documentation for a device which some people believe could</p>
<p>have been some sort of a time machine. Igor, do you think that maybe The Bell that they also sometimes referred to as Die Glocke was a type of flying craft? It was a combination of some flying machine with weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>It seems that The Bell was the main part of a propulsion system of a flying craft, not a flying craft itself. But we don&#x27;t know the rest of the picture.</p>
<p>GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: It has been widely reported that the Nazis had an almost fanatical desire to locate and study ancient religious texts and artifacts which they believed possessed great power.</p>
<p>They were also fascinated by the occult and the study of the forbidden or so-called dark arts. Although much of this ancient knowledge was lost at the end</p>
<p>of the war, much of it was thought to be taken by the Allies as spoils of war and may have served as the inspiration for many of the advanced communications and weapons systems in use today. IGOR WITKOWSKI: The very</p>
<p>idea of generating gravity was based on scientific discoveries that they had made. They were open also to the idea of incorporating knowledge from the ancient past and the very possibility of other intelligences</p>
<p>in the universe. This all seems highly advanced for its time. It was such an advanced idea, the most secret research project carried out</p>
<p>in the Third Reich. And I have a very interesting document here which is signed by the General Kammler, and says that it was engaging all the forces of the SS at the end of the war.</p>
<p>GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: The way Igor describes The Bell reminds me of the numerous accounts in ancient Hindu texts of the Vimana, airships that could stop on a dime and change direction at top speed, seemingly defying</p>
<p>the laws of physics. The ancient Sanskrit text, the Mahabharata, describes an earthly arrival by these ancient spacecraft which curiously resemble modern day UFO accounts.</p>
<p>Today, most mainstream historians identify the stories of the Vimanas as works of fiction. But in India, some Hindus regard them as history.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the Nazis had somehow rediscovered an alien technology that existed on Earth thousands of years ago? And if so, where did they get such detailed information? In his 1993 book, &quot;Secret Societies and Their Power in the 20th Century,&quot;</p>
<p>author Jan Van Helsing wrote that a UFO crashed in Germany&#x27;s Black Forest in 1936, three years before the start of World War II. According to his account, Hitler&#x27;s SS troops took possession of</p>
<p>the downed craft and carried it away to their top secret headquarters at Wewelsburg Castle. There it is believed that Nazi scientists began their attempts to reverse engineer technology found aboard the damaged craft.</p>
<p>As I said goodbye to Igor, I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about the idea that the strange designs I&#x27;d seen of the Nazi bell reminded me not only of Hindu Vimanas, but also of stupas, an ancient, bell-shaped design that Buddhists believe</p>
<p>had mystical powers. After leaving Poland, I traveled to Switzerland to meet with my good friend and mentor, Erich Von Daniken, the founding father behind what&#x27;s known as the ancient</p>
<p>astronaut theory. So do you think that extraterrestrials are responsible why we have this stupa motif today, in this particular shape? ERICH VON DANIKEN: You see, we always were copiers.</p>
<p>We saw some Vimanas which had the shape of a stupa, so later, we made copies out of the stupa. The-- the cultures in the past, intellectually, they may have been brilliant,</p>
<p>but they could not understand the technology. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: The stupa dates back thousands of years and is believed to have been inspired by early burial mounds in which the deceased were seated in an upright position</p>
<p>and covered with earth. Later, the stupa was thought to represent a seated Buddha. And over the centuries, its basic bell shape became refined with the</p>
<p>addition of more and more elaborate designs. You know, some people have suggested that the stupa shape itself, or, you know, that whatever vehicles were described in the past, might have had the possibility of-- of time travel.</p>
<p>Do you think that such a thing is possible? [exhales] Nothing is impossible. Nothing is impossible. I would not exclude</p>
<p>this completely. Because who knows what the future brings? Exactly. So I&#x27;m in the Swiss Alps, consulting with Erich Von Daniken about Die Glocke,</p>
<p>also known as The Bell, to see if he thinks whether or not the Nazis may have been developing a time travel device based on ancient Hindu and Buddhist designs, designs that perhaps were directly inspired by ancient extraterrestrial technology.</p>
<p>You see, the stupa is a-- the shape which you find in the Mahabharata, in the old Indian epic. There, small vehicles, called Vimanas, had the shape of a stupa. Since that time, people</p>
<p>always copied stupas, because stupas had to do something with the god and with heaven. There are numerous accounts in ancient Sanskrit texts that describe Vimanas and stupas, ancient chariots of the gods.</p>
<p>And they were described as flying chariots made of gleaming metal with amazing maneuverability in the air, with powerful weapons that could annihilate the enemy from afar. Some were even described to</p>
<p>be able to cloak themselves. Now, while mainstream scholars interpret these events in divine and symbolic terms, the ancient astronaut theory suggests that this is rooted in misunderstood technology, and that they were</p>
<p>perhaps witnessing extraterrestrial craft. You see, for example, here, this is the so-called [non-english] in Indonesia. It&#x27;s a gigantic temple. And it&#x27;s just composed</p>
<p>of hundreds and hundreds of stupas. Now, these stupas are not empty. In every stupa, inside is the young Buddha. And what is the</p>
<p>young Buddha doing? He&#x27;s using his hands, you see, to manipulate some control. Because according to their belief, the stupa is the small vehicle with which you reach the big vehicle.</p>
<p>The big vehicle is surrounding the planet. The small vehicle comes down to Earth and goes again, but just to the big.</p>
<p>So you have to manipulate some controls. And do you remember, Giorgio, we have this famous plaque of Palenque, Mexico. And there, this</p>
<p>young ruler, Pakal, is sitting on this sort of chair, manipulating some controls with two hands. If you turn it a little, you have exactly the same pictures as young Buddha</p>
<p>sitting in a stupa. And you see, when you take any Indian temple, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the temple is a young temple. By young, I mean maybe it was</p>
<p>constructed just 50 years ago. Or it is an old temple, the temple is 2,000 years ago. It doesn&#x27;t matter what. On top of every</p>
<p>Indian temple, still today, you have a so-called Vimana. Vimana is again the flying machine from mythology. But it was not mythology,</p>
<p>but sometimes it was reality. And sometimes the Vimana has the shape of stupa again. What do you say to people who suggest that the ancient Indian epics</p>
<p>are nothing else but a product of fantasy? This is all garbage. It was real. It was reality. The Vimanas always came from the so-called cities in the sky.</p>
<p>Today we would say mother spaceship. You know, there are some that have suggested that some of the Nazi scientists were inspired by Sanskrit texts.</p>
<p>Do you think that&#x27;s a possibility? Yeah, that&#x27;s true. That&#x27;s true. We know from some diaries of these scientists that they studied</p>
<p>ancient Sanskrit texts, and they were influenced. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Erich then shared an interesting story with me about one of the German scientists he&#x27;d once met in person concerning the Wunderwaffe developments.</p>
<p>You see, Wernher von Braun was the one who launched up Saturn V to the moon. He was a student of Professor Dr. Hermann Oberth.</p>
<p>Hermann Oberth is what we call the father of rockets. They were studying Hindu and-- and the Veda texts, definitely. Because when he</p>
<p>was an old man, I had the chance to speak together with Hermann Oberth. And I asked him about these things. Did you work at some kind of</p>
<p>stupa, a kind of secret weapon. He said, yes, we did work, but we never finished the work. If we would have finished it, we would have won the war.</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much for-- for answering some of these questions. And, you know, I&#x27;m not sure yet where I will go next in this investigation, but this was</p>
<p>invaluable information. Thank you very much, Erich, as always. Thank you, Giorgio. You can come to my archives.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s endless. It will never end. All the links and stories together. It all comes together.</p>
<p>Absolutely. It&#x27;s always fascinating to talk with Erich. And speaking with him made me wonder if maybe Die Glocke wasn&#x27;t only designed to be a</p>
<p>part of a time traveling craft, but perhaps was also designed to be a time traveling craft. Because he kept on saying how the ancient people often reported seeing stupa-shaped craft coming down from the sky.</p>
<p>But was the mysterious bell-shaped object simply known as Die Glocke really capable of space travel? And if so, could it reach the kind of incredible speeds necessary to enable it to travel through time? GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:</p>
<p>Human beings have dreamed of traveling through time for hundreds of years. In 1905, Albert Einstein proved that time travel is, in fact, achievable, based on his famous theory of relativity.</p>
<p>Since then, scientists have been trying to develop a time machine that can travel both forward and backwards in time. And some propose that the best way to manipulate time is by creating an artificial</p>
<p>time vortex or wormhole. Even NASA is developing warp drive technology that would allow us to exceed the speed of light, and in so doing, travel into the future. And now I&#x27;m back in the</p>
<p>States, in Pittsburgh. I still have some questions about time travel, and there&#x27;s no one better to ask about time travel than Stanton Friedman, a nuclear physicist.</p>
<p>So I&#x27;m really looking forward to meet with one of the greatest minds in ufology today. Stanton. Such a great time to see you again.</p>
<p>How are you? Just fine. It&#x27;s been a while. So thank you very much for taking the time to meet with me and to answer some of my questions.</p>
<p>Not at all. I actually went to Poland to look at the henge, because allegedly, the Nazis were working on this bell-shaped weapon called Die Glocke, and which they were able to</p>
<p>manipulate space and time. Clearly something went on, but what was it? There&#x27;s no question. The German technology was outstanding.</p>
<p>And before the Second World War, certainly they were ahead of the United States in many areas of technology. What is your opinion on the feasibility or the reality of time travel? Well, there are areas</p>
<p>where we know it works, as a matter of fact. As you get close to the speed of light, time slows down. How much? Well, it depends on how close you get.</p>
<p>GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: In Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, time dilation refers to the passage of time being affected by the laws of nature, such as differences in gravity and velocity. This phenomenon may</p>
<p>be best illustrated by comparing an atomic clock on Earth with another one in space. Even though both clocks function perfectly, the clock in space will run slower due to the bending of space-time by the forces of gravity.</p>
<p>So I wanted to know, since time travel is theoretically possible, if the Nazi scientists could have achieved it during World War II. Could you surmise that this bell shape or cone shape in any way, shape, or form, is conducive</p>
<p>to manipulating time and space? Whether it has anything to do with time or not, I don&#x27;t know. I like the symmetry of it. Because I expect anything with time is symmetrical.</p>
<p>If Hitler&#x27;s guys had figured out how to build a time machine or an anti-gravity machine, or some entirely new physical craft, they would have used it during the war.</p>
<p>I cannot believe that Hitler would have withheld it. What if they couldn&#x27;t complete what they were working on, and it just so happened to be that America grabbed it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen no signs of that. However, I finally got 156 pages of top secret Umbra, NSA UFO documents. You can read one sentence per page.</p>
<p>Everything else is whited out. The CIA, yeah, the CIA released a bunch of blacked out documents. Some of them have six words you can read, some eight words you can read.</p>
<p>And people say, there&#x27;s no cover-up. Well, there is a cover-up. It&#x27;s very hard to say anything is impossible.</p>
<p>Well, Stanton, this has been a great honor. I&#x27;ve learned a lot, and your contribution here has been invaluable. So thank you very much.</p>
<p>- My pleasure. - And I&#x27;ll let you know-- I&#x27;ve learned something too. --how all of this goes. Good. Right.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m in Southern California, about to meet with Dr. Bob Frisbee, a retired aerospace engineer, and we&#x27;re about to conduct some wind tunnel tests on a bell-shaped object.</p>
<p>I want to find out whether or not a vehicle with this shape is suitable for flight, because we still don&#x27;t know if Die Glocke was designed to be some kind of spacecraft. Giorgio, welcome to the NASA</p>
<p>wind tunnel at Cal State LA. This is awesome. So this is where the hardcore science takes place. Absolutely.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been all over the place investigating this idea that the Nazis built this strange weapon called Die Glocke, or The Bell, and that this might have had something to do with a time travel device, which I find very intriguing.</p>
<p>In order to do something like time travel, you&#x27;re going to need very large energies and masses in very odd configurations in order to make the equations of general relativity come out the way you want them to.</p>
<p>You touched upon something that I&#x27;ve always found very interesting. Because yes, it is conceivable that time travel is possible, but the energy requirements for that would be so vast that</p>
<p>even if we combined all of our available energy resources today, is it correct that we don&#x27;t have the energy resources to actually fire up the engine? To make something like this work requires an enormous amount of mass to warp space-time.</p>
<p>So if we somehow had an enormous amount of negative energy, we could warp space in just the directions you need and the way you need to do things like anti-gravity, warp drives, wormholes, and potentially, time machines.</p>
<p>I love it. In this investigation, when I read up that maybe the Nazis were working on a bell-shaped energy device that some have proposed might have been a time machine or something like that, my</p>
<p>mind, you know, was blown. What do you think? Well, first of all, Germany invented relativity and quantum mechanics. So intellectually, they had more than enough horsepower to actually come</p>
<p>to grips with the science of something like this. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: The idea of time travel being possible is very exciting to me. And the concept that a person could travel not only through space,</p>
<p>but also through time, is even more incredible. But was the mysterious bell-shaped object simply known as Die Glocke really capable of space travel? And if so, could it have reached the kind of incredible speeds necessary to enable it</p>
<p>to travel through time? That is what I needed to find out. Giorgio, I&#x27;d like to introduce you to Dr. Wu.</p>
<p>Hello. Good to meet you. How are you? Welcome to the Wind Tunnel Lab, gentlemen. This is great.</p>
<p>Yeah. So this is it. Yeah. Today we&#x27;re going to measure the aerodynamic drive.</p>
<p>GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Now, of course, in the vacuum of space, drag is not an issue. But a craft that&#x27;s also designed to maneuver on Earth would need to be aerodynamically sound.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s fire her up. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: I&#x27;m meeting with retired aerospace engineer Dr. Bob Frisbee. I&#x27;ve asked him to test a</p>
<p>stupa-shaped object in a wind tunnel to determine if it is aerodynamically suitable for flight. If we can prove that the object could not only fly, but be capable of reaching the incredible speeds necessary for space travel,</p>
<p>then it&#x27;s just possible that the German Die Glocke might actually have been capable of time travel. Let&#x27;s fire her up. [buzzer] [whirring] And then when we increase the air speed, you can see the drag</p>
<p>will be increasing. Where do we see the air speed? Right here. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Aha. As Dr. Wu increases the air</p>
<p>speed within the chamber, a drag sensor measures how efficient the object is in terms of aerodynamic resistance. CHIVEY WU: Yeah, we&#x27;re almost reaching 100 miles per hour.</p>
<p>GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: OK. So I think that&#x27;s-- we have more than enough information. And so now we can look at the data? Yep.</p>
<p>GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: When Dr. Wu showed us his evaluation of how the bell-shaped design performed in the wind tunnel, I expected that it would produce a lot of drag, because it doesn&#x27;t look</p>
<p>anything like a rocket ship or the sleek, aerodynamic designs associated with most flying machines. So what does this mean? How efficient is this shape? It&#x27;s a comparison with other shapes like a spherical ball. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:</p>
<p>The wind tunnel test indicated that the bell shape is about twice as efficient as a sphere. I&#x27;m surprised how aerodynamically sound the stupa actually is. Even though it looks like it</p>
<p>would be terribly inefficient, it&#x27;s better than the simplest sphere. I mean, that is very interesting. That is surprising, for sure.</p>
<p>If the tests prove anything, it&#x27;s that appearances can be deceiving. In May of 2014, an aerospace company called SpaceX unveiled version</p>
<p>two of their Dragon spaceship, designed for travel into deep space. And this ultramodern spacecraft, like the Nazi bell, bears a striking similarity to ancient stupas.</p>
<p>Dr. Frisbee, thank you very much for answering some of my questions. And those wind tunnel tests were incredible.</p>
<p>This is a way of opening the possibilities as to what can be going on in the world and the universe around us. Those are the only questions that we ask, because this is something where people have</p>
<p>forgotten that science, in the end, is an adventure. I now know that the design for the Glocke is aerodynamically sound. But what I still don&#x27;t know is whether or not the device was ever constructed.</p>
<p>To find out the answer, I traveled to Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, the site of a now famous UFO crash involving a mysterious bell-shaped object. On December 9, 1965, a brilliant fireball streaking across the sky</p>
<p>was witnessed by thousands of people as it flew over Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Several hundred people saw it come crashing through the trees into a deep ravine. These witnesses also reported</p>
<p>that the US Army later arrived on the scene, placed the object on a flatbed truck, and quickly took it away. To this day, the military has denied that this event even took place. My first stop is to meet with</p>
<p>Stan Gordon, a local researcher who is an expert in the 1965 Kecksburg crash. This is one of the photos I took in the mid-1980s. This is where we</p>
<p>found what appeared to be a pattern of tree damage. These were actually all physically knocked down. OK. OK.</p>
<p>Now, as you went down into the wooded area and form a trajectory, well, then you found the fact that as this thing moves along it, it knock-- tops trees out. Some trees were broken</p>
<p>in the same direction. Right. Clearly there was something there. And there were</p>
<p>reports in the news? Well, the newspaper accounts are quite interesting. The story made the national news. So it was picked up by</p>
<p>not only the local papers, but it was also picked up by the national media as well. This was from our local &quot;Greensburg Tribune-Review.&quot; GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Look at that. Unidentified flying object</p>
<p>falls near Kecksburg. STAN GORDON: Army ropes off area. Interesting. OK.</p>
<p>In your investigations, did you come across any reports whether or not there were any people inside this object? Because in the Roswell story, we always hear how they carried away bodies, and that one of those</p>
<p>bodies allegedly was alive. So is there anything similar in this particular case? There have been very interesting accounts which suggest the possibility that someone or something may have been inside the object.</p>
<p>Mhm. What do you personally think the Kecksburg object was? Well, but I can tell you, there&#x27;s various theories on it. It ranges from being a very</p>
<p>sophisticated power source to some type of anti-gravity machine, and to, in fact, a time machine. A time machine? Is it at all possible that Die Glocke, or the Nazi bell, and the UFO that crashed in the woods at Kecksburg are one and the same? And if so, what happened to it? And could there be an</p>
<p>extraterrestrial connection? I&#x27;m in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, with local researcher Stan Gordon, about to look at a full-sized model of the UFO that allegedly crashed here in 1965. According to reports, it looks</p>
<p>very much like the German Die Glocke, and I can&#x27;t wait to see it with my own eyes. So this is it, huh? STAN GORDON: That&#x27;s correct. Yes. Wow.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go take a little closer look. I mean, this is pretty interesting. Is this-- I&#x27;m telling</p>
<p>a story behind this. Is this a-- an exact replica of the eyewitness report? STAN GORDON: Well, this is a mock up of the object that reportedly fell here back in 1965.</p>
<p>GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: The Kecksburg UFO looks almost identical to the designs and drawings I&#x27;ve seen of the so-called Nazi Bell, and it&#x27;s sort of blowing my mind. So what can you tell me</p>
<p>about the size reference to the eyewitness reports in comparison to this replica, right here? OK. Well, according to eyewitnesses who were up in the ravine and were standing only several feet away from the object, they estimate that this</p>
<p>thing was approximately maybe about 10 to 12 feet, maybe more in length, and about 8 to 10 feet in diameter. And the popular term here is that this is called the Acorn, right? That&#x27;s correct.</p>
<p>Well, one eyewitness said it looked like somebody took liquid metal and poured it into an acorn-shaped mold. There&#x27;s no rivets. There&#x27;s no seams.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no weld marks. There&#x27;s no fuselage, no windows, no doors. And on that raised up back area, what really caught his attention and others</p>
<p>were these unusual markings that were raised up off the surface and looked more like symbols and letters. I&#x27;m going to just take some-- some pictures for my archives. This has a perfect acorn shape.</p>
<p>So can you actually take me to the crash site? STAN GORDON: I can take you up to the general area a lot of the activity took place that evening. Sounds great.</p>
<p>All right. So let&#x27;s go to the crash site, yeah? OK. GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: I know this is crazy to think about, but did a time machine built by</p>
<p>the Nazis during World War II really crash land here in Kecksburg in 1965? I mean, it&#x27;s highly speculative, and I&#x27;m not saying that this is what happened. But just the possibility is mind-blowing, and I can&#x27;t wait to see the area</p>
<p>where this thing touched down. So this was the general area. Right. It&#x27;s-- it&#x27;s deep inside of the wooded area.</p>
<p>So you&#x27;re telling me it&#x27;s down there. In this general, right. Yeah. OK.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can-- and so from what direction did it approach? Well, the object came in roughly from that general area, went out towards the mountains, out towards Laurelville. Then the object turned</p>
<p>and began to track back towards Kecksburg, went a little further out and made another turn, and then came down into the water ravine. So multiple turns. Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, this would indicate to me that it wasn&#x27;t necessarily a flat-out crash, but maybe they were looking for a clearing to land safely. Well, this object, whatever it was, apparently, it had made</p>
<p>an unintentional landing. It crashed through the woods. It knocked down trees. And then it ended up down on the bottom of the ravine.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s interesting. I would love to go a little bit closer to see if we maybe can spot some of those knocked over trees. Maybe they still exist.</p>
<p>So in this place, you&#x27;re telling me that there used to be trees that were cut off in some sort of a pattern where the thing allegedly came in? Well, we had found what appeared to be a-- a pattern of trajectory.</p>
<p>We had found some trees were knocked down in the same direction. Other trees with the tops knocked out. This is quite fascinating.</p>
<p>After visiting the site of the Kecksburg UFO crash, I&#x27;m fascinated by the eyewitness accounts of what appeared to be an acorn-shaped spacecraft and its similarity to the designs for Die Glocke that were discovered after the war.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the technologies the Nazis were developing toward the end of World War II were based on ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts? And was their plan to construct a time travel device made possible by reverse engineering</p>
<p>extraterrestrial technology? Two facts are certain. Dr. Hans Kammler, the man in charge of the Nazi Die Glocke project, disappeared after the war.</p>
<p>And in 1965, thousands of people witnessed a UFO that they described as looking almost like an upside down bell, one that changed direction like someone was inside steering it. Although a connection</p>
<p>between these two events has not yet been proven, I am sure that one day, we will achieve some type of technology that will allow us to travel not only through space, but perhaps also through time, in search of aliens.</p>
<p>[whoosh] [clunk] According to Igor, The Bell disappeared at the end of the war, along with its mastermind, Hans Kammler. And there are those who speculate to this day that both escaped</p>
<p>through a window in time. Some people have suggested that the stupa shape itself might have had the possibility of time travel. Do you think that such</p>
<p>a thing is possible? Do you think that such a thing is possible? [exhales] Nothing is impossible. The young Buddha is using his hands to manipulate some control.</p>
<p>You have exactly the same pictures in Mexico sitting in a stupa, the flying machine. reported seeing stupa-shaped craft coming down from the sky. But was the mysterious</p>
<p>bell-shaped object simply known as Die Glocke really capable of space travel? And if so, could it reach the kind of incredible speeds necessary to enable it to travel through time? What is the feasibility of time travel? Well, we know it works.</p>
<p>Germany invented relativity. Intellectually, they had more than enough horsepower. Let&#x27;s fire her up. Did you come across any</p>
<p>reports whether or not there were any people inside this object? ROBERT FRISBEE: There have been accounts which suggest that someone or something may have been inside the object. [music playing]</p>
