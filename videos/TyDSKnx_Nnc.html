            <p>[music] What&#x27;s up humans and welcome to a new octivo. Happy Tuesday everybody and happy Virginia UFO National Press Club event day. Thank you to James Fox for providing a lot of different content that we&#x27;re going to use in order to expand the message and to echo uh a very important event that took place today in Washington DC. One of the American side speakers that I was not expecting and probably for me one of the biggest surprises of the event was none other than Dr. Jacqu Valet who is in my opinion one of the godfathers of eupfology one of the most important and knowledgeable people of all this he&#x27;s been involved throughout like since project blue book up until today he needs to be listened to his books are very important for the topic alongside John Kels and I think that having him on the event was very important and a major major contribution and something that really surprised me is that he left what seems to be uh the running theory that he currently has about what might be going on.</p>
<p>And this really surprised me because he said something along the lines of the phenomenon appears to be an extraterrestrial phenomenon empowered by advanced artificial intelligence. That was wild to hear. But let me show you the video that he shared with everybody of what he thinks about the Virginia case, how much credence it has, and this new theory that he believes and this new theory that is currently in his mind of what we might be dealing with. So here it is. &gt;&gt; Jacqu Valet, I&#x27;m speaking at the request of Mr.</p>
<p>James Fox because a few years ago I initiated the system of multiple databases used by the DIA sponsored program at Bigalow Ayerospace as a cleared member of a scientific team charged with study of UFO UAP phenomena. The data warehouse system contained data about 260,000 screened reports of anomalous objects in flight and hundreds of reports of creatures live or dead associated with crashed or landed vehicles of unknown provenence, including some similar to those in Virginia, thus providing useful multinational and historical context. My current research is taking us to deeper levels with new onsite analytical and physical research on historical cases such as the 1945 case in San Antonio, New Mexico. the 1964 case in Soro, New Mexico also and the 1965 case in Valencol in France. In those and several others, new physical and environmental data was collected.</p>
<p>The observations involve a total of seven creatures, generally similar in size and general body shape to those described by the witnesses in Virginia, Brazil, and by Mr. Fox, providing both context and statistical support for current and future findings. In particular, all the creatures just mentioned breathed air normally. Beyond this, I currently serve in a private capacity on the scientific advisory board of the French government national center for space studies, CNES. [snorts] That unit has actively researched the UFO problem since 1975, including national cases of close encounters [snorts] with the presence of occupants.</p>
<p>A number of which I have also studied on site. It should be clear, however, that I do not represent any of these government organizations in this or any other context. The Virginia incident of 1996 in Brazil, researched and documented by James Fox, fits within cases already known in scientific and medical records. many of which have remained classified. Relaxing the classification requirements while preserving security of essential facilities such as the nuclear labs would make it possible to inform and enlist the scientific community at a higher level.</p>
<p>Action by the executive branch to allow more open exchange would be worldchanging. As the Virginia case proves, allowing more open contact at an international level will yield better understanding of the global issues. The current segmentation of the data hinders any serious research into what appears to be an extraterrestrial phenomenon empowered by advanced artificial intelligence. Open archives do exist to some extent describing the physical and biological environment of the crafts and their occupants. Soro and Valencol in particular, two unclassified cases officially deemed unidentified by multiple government agencies have yielded evidence of traces, recovered materials and environmental effects.</p>
<p>But we know that much more is available. The Virginia case presents exceptional new knowledge beyond what was already known. It improves our information in two fundamental ways. First, in the ability to reconstruct what happened to the craft and its occupants from beginning to end. And second, in the professional description of the anatomical and behavioral features of the live creature recovered by authorities within a short time of the crash and to the point of its death.</p>
<p>By this achievement, James Long and Perilous project has opened up an entirely new field. &gt;&gt; So, a couple of things there. My good friend Sander Jones from the Dreamland Motel actually has a wonderful video that sort of overlaps with what Jock said about his theory. Um, it&#x27;s called the cosmic internet theory from Sander. I&#x27;m going to leave it in the description.</p>
<p>very interesting uh but I wasn&#x27;t expecting for Jock to say this and I found it really interesting also where he spoke about the beings and the biological aspect of this case and how uh as we were told from the beginning of the year that biologics was going to be a major part of the conversation and what Dr. Dr. Jacqu Valet is talking about here directly coincides with this. He&#x27;s been looking into cases with biologics. He&#x27;s been studying the biologics and the all the characteristics of these bodies in detail.</p>
<p>And I just can&#x27;t wait for whatever he comes out with because I would presume that he&#x27;s gonna probably come out with a paper, something that may or may not be peer reviewed in the future. uh but he&#x27;s working really hard still in his 80s. So, thank you to Dr. Jacqu Balle for still being very present in this whole conversation. And thank you to James Fox again for a wonderful uh presentation at the National Press Club.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think about this. What do you think about Dr. Jacqu Valet&#x27;s running new theory? Um what do you think about this AI uh being involved uh with extraterrestrials? He&#x27;s going back to the ET hypothesis despite being the man who talked about multiple possible hypotheses in password to what do you think about that sort of like a little change of pace isn&#x27;t it &gt;&gt; describing um a technology but there are really around the technology there are a number of uh psychological and if you will even you know let&#x27;s use the word psychic effects associated with it. One of the most important findings that uh has been made about this phenomenon is that it is global in scope. In other words, it&#x27;s it doesn&#x27;t belong to the French or the Americans or the British or uh there have been waves of sightings uh usually lasting about a few weeks or a month or a month and a half over very uh in very concentrated fashions in certain areas of the world.</p>
<p>There have been such waves in Western Europe in 1954 for example in this country in 1947. We know of waves in the Soviet Union, in China, in Australia, especially in Western Australia. And what is typical about these waves is that the the people from all these different cultures around the world are describing the same thing in their own terms. What they are describing is an object that seems to be able to to maneuver. It seems to be a technology seems to come to the ground and leave traces.</p>
<p>And there have been rings especially that have been found uh burned circles that have been found very commonly in Australia that uh are absolutely identical to uh things that have been cataloged in this country in France. There is now a catalog of such traces that encompasses more than a thousand sightings. &gt;&gt; And what do you think about Dr. Jacqu Valet&#x27;s work overall and the phenomenon in general? And also, what do you think about the differences between these beings and all of the other accounts of alleged beings? Uh, the Virginia case beings clearly have major stark differences compared to the other gray aliens. Why do you think that&#x27;s the case? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll be reading. You like the content you see? I&#x27;m going to ask you to like, share, hype, comment, subscribe, and hit the bell icon. That&#x27;s all you need to do in order to help us and it is what helps us the most. So, thank you. But if you want to support us in other ways, there&#x27;s a few links down there you can choose from.</p>
<p>You can also become a member in YouTube. You can become a member on Patreon. We have merch on Patreon. Uh depending on the tier, you get merch sent to your home after three months on Patreon. Or you can also support us through KG.</p>
<p>or also uh I would like for you to help us get uh a review up on Spotify so we can get noticed by the algorithm because we&#x27;re in Mexico. That would really help us and help the channel go a long way on Spotify. We were just accepted to the partner program to the partner program. So, we really need your help there. Anything you choose to do is always appreciate it.</p>
<p>So, thank you. And that&#x27;s it for me today on this video, but I&#x27;ll see you guys in the next one. Remember, stay curious and inquisitive like Dr. Jacqu Valet always. Bye.</p>
