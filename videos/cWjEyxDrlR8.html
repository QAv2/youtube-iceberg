            <p>What if I told you Google was born in the CIA? Yeah, that search bar you use every day. Its roots might trace back to spy agencies. In the 1990s, the CIA and NSA were desperate to track terrorists across the growing chaos of the internet. So, they started funding high-tech research, especially search algorithms. One of their investment arms, Inqell, poured money into tech that could find patterns, track connections, and even predict behavior.</p>
<p>Guess what came out of that same research bubble? Google. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin got early funding from DARPA, the US military&#x27;s advanced research wing. Some of their academic advisers tied to intelligence work. And it didn&#x27;t stop there. For years, Google stayed very close to Washington inqel even considered investing.</p>
<p>But Google grew too fast, too big. So, did the CIA create Google? Not exactly, but they definitely helped build the world that made it possible. Keep that in mind next time you type something into the search bar. They might not own Google, but they were watching from day one.</p>
