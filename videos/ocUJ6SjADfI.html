            <p>okay guys I&#x27;m trying to explain to you what I&#x27;m talking about basically let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s you know no electricity and this is a graph of voltage so AC electricity is basically like this it&#x27;s going up and down the voltage goes from positive you know 110 deposit to negative 100 in tens if there&#x27;s like a 230 volt change it&#x27;s bouncing back and forth this type of electricity allows you to you know have different windings of coils and changing the voltage over electromagnetic forces that&#x27;s called AC electricity this is the way we transfer electricity from one place to another then there&#x27;s battery electricity which is basically if this is the line the voltage is just here and when you put a load on it it drops a little bit and then it comes back up then you charge it and then this charge is whatever but it&#x27;s all staying on one side of the line so these are the two types of electricity that we have in the world it&#x27;s basically AC electronics and DC electronics and there&#x27;s ways to convert from this form of electricity to this form so basically if you want to convert it you&#x27;d put like a diode it&#x27;s a one-way valve in electricity and that would just cut out this second half of the pulse and then you put a capacitor and that&#x27;s how you&#x27;d go from AC to DC because the capacitor would take up some energy from there and some energy from there to make up for the time when there&#x27;s no electricity so basically you&#x27;d end up with a line that&#x27;s something like that that&#x27;s what a AC to DC converter does the third form of electricity which is gravity to gravity is basically DC electricity and a little bit of AC electricity it&#x27;s sort of like this this is their a flat line you basically shoot all the way up you have a pulse and then you shoot all the way down and depending on the speed of the pulse you create a gravity wave that way the speed of the down you also create gravity that way wave that way but the speed of the pulse depends on the time so if you had a pulse that was like let&#x27;s say went up really quickly and then went down like sort of like that at that angle and this pulse time over here was let&#x27;s say that was 10 milliseconds or something like that and this space over here was 90 milliseconds so what happened is the pulse that is this way of gravity the gravity pulse that went that way would be let&#x27;s say a 100 power the pulse that goes this way would be at much less than that because what creates the gravity pulse is not the voltage it&#x27;s not anything related to the voltage it&#x27;s related to the voltages speed um change over time so if you had so if you had a very short pulse even with low voltage you can you can create gravity when you have high voltage it gives you more time to to make that pulse because you know you don&#x27;t have to you don&#x27;t have to work at extremely high speeds and then so long as you allow the discharge time a longer time than that the pulse backward because there&#x27;s inevitably gonna be a pulse backward would be nowhere near as strong as the pulse forward also they found that every time you cut the milliseconds of the time over the voltage change so if you did if you reach the peak whatever that voltage is gonna be let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s a million volts if you reach the peak in 5 milliseconds the power the gravity pulse would be not just 2 times stronger it would be 10 times stronger so it&#x27;s like an inverse hockey puck sort of effect so this way the 90 millisecond pulse backward is not just 10 times weaker it&#x27;s a hundred times weaker so it&#x27;s only like one tenth of the pulse that way so basically what we&#x27;re going for is a very quick pulse upward and then a slow discharge way and that will create a gravity pulse on the craft and that&#x27;s how you fly these are the three forms of electricity you got ac/dc which is what we have in batteries and all that type of stuff and then you have gravity this actually happens naturally inside of an atom if you have an atom spinning yet the little electrons that go around it the electrons are turning toward you and creating like a voltage pattern and they do that in every direction so they&#x27;re creating like a spike when it as it&#x27;s coming toward you and then there&#x27;s like the tapering off that&#x27;s why mass has gravity it all fits together</p>
