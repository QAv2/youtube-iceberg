            <p>John Greenewald: I&#x27;m now going back to you remember that line where I said that there was an amendment and that amendment to the contract of the original bid solicitation, there were three different versions of the ASA bid solicitation that you can all download.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t have to take my word for it. I&#x27;ll link the Wayback Machine link below as well, including I believe that the sam.gov link is still active.</p>
<p>And you can download the different versions and the changes to that bid solicitation as it morphed. Since it had been posted, meaning they can amend things, they can add things that can change things, and so on.</p>
<p>One of the things that they changed in the chronology before bass ever been on the program was to change that the bitter whomever one of the prerequisites was that you had to have an approved facility to house that classified information.</p>
<p>That was a requirement. But remember, those documents said that bass had yet to receive that approval at all, for their facility in fiscal year 2009.</p>
<p>So nothing was classified. And in fact, if you recall, Robert Bigelow said he spent his own money to modify his building, in what he says, I believe preparation for meta materials are something that he was supposed to get, but never</p>
<p>did. All of that made it seem like wow, he was really investing in this program, and really wanting to essentially split the cost with the government. In my opinion,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s a stretch now, because now one of those amendments was changing that requirement to it wasn&#x27;t being required. And it was like, how convenient for Robert Bigelow, before he ever been on the program, that in August, before he submitted the</p>
<p>bid, they changed that requirement, then in this internal documentation, it reinforces he didn&#x27;t meet the requirement. He later did, because he invested his own money.</p>
<p>But that wasn&#x27;t that was under the guise that he did it to kind of help the government. No, he needed to do that. That was what he needed to do to get into the classified creation of</p>
<p>all of those reports. But what all of those reports then translated to was only one in the 38 dirges, that&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s been withheld. Other than that, he never created any, if</p>
<p>option year to option, year three, option year four, if they all got executed, there would be 10s of millions of additional dollars that could have went in, and by him modifying his building and getting that classified status, what then he could do was get more money, but then potentially get a SAP</p>
<p>status. And then he would really be essentially sitting pretty in regards to information access, financial access for contract extensions, spending, and potentially have offset moved out of Dia into an agency that it was more more appropriate</p>
<p>for, for that r&amp;d effort, and so on. And you can kind of fill in the blanks that it potentially could go on for years if they accomplish what they what they wanted to accomplish. So I&#x27;m</p>
<p>ending it there because it really shows what we&#x27;ve been told in a different light. And remember, I say moving the goalposts. Well, before that evidence came out, it kind of</p>
<p>made it seem like he was investing in this program with his own money. And he was under the impression he was going to get material from the government. But in reality that</p>
<p>was a contractual obligation that he did not meet and per historical evidence that anybody can cite. They changed that requirement. Conveniently, miraculously, coincidentally,</p>
<p>weeks before he submitted the bid. So yet again, even more evidence the writing was on the wall, that this was all created for him.</p>
