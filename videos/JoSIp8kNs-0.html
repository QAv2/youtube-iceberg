            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>welcome to the electrogravitic experimental results this is the sixth video of the electrogravitic experiment which is the third experiment in the new electromagnetism version 5 experimental supplement and new electromagnetism version 5 is the fourth book of ethereal mechanics that&#x27;s why this has a long code ethereal mechanics book four experiment 3 video 6 this is being released to patreon members on the 4th of August 2024 it will be a YouTube Premiere 5 September 2024 okay this is a photograph of the experiment in operation this is the thermal imaging camera of this exact same this comes from the same uh Fleer camera so what we have here for those people that are unfamiliar with this experiment we have current running around a square Loop uh hundreds of amps and at the corner of the loop where the current has to take a right hand change of Direction charges are accelerating which creates an inertial effect that can be picked up to a coil that is placed right near the junction okay and we&#x27;re running this two ways the first one is a 30 gauge copper wire we&#x27;re we&#x27;re trying to run that with 100 amps but our our op amp in here was howling so I decided to drive the power transistor directly from the pulse generator and that limited us to get about 75 amps through the through the uh 30 gauge wire uh this is the thermal image and you can see the hottest part is 128 degrees it&#x27;s not really hot to the touch it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re at 0.1% Duty it has plenty of time to cool but you know the thermal imaging camera makes it look like it&#x27;s like molten lava in the little Channel okay uh the pickup coil is 100 turns of 30 gauge wire and that&#x27;s tied into a time 100 amplifier we&#x27;re going to show you the full video you get to see this uh outside of this picture the other experiment that we ran we Rand it after we filmed the little video is we used 14 gauge nichrome wire so in this video we&#x27;re going to demonstrate the experiment and again the two experiments there&#x27;s one with 30 gauge copper wire another one with 14 gauge copper wire and we&#x27;re able to get that one up to 60 amps and let&#x27;s just say it outright we obtained strange results my friends this is a rabbit hole for the ages this snippet was filmed while taking the data for the 30 gauge copper experiment and the effect in that was so small that I thought the experiment was null it wasn&#x27;t until I started doing the nichrome experiment after I took the video that I realized the effect actually is there and then was able to zoom in on it and we&#x27;ll show you the results and and when we look back at the Copper results they&#x27;re there we just have to zoom in uh to express those results so again when I&#x27;m filming this little snip you&#x27;re about to see I&#x27;m basically talking in terms of this was a null result and even if it were a null result that would be okay because I told my patreon members a while back that a null result would actually be more interesting this is a nearly null result but we also have other anomalies so we got a lot of good stuff out of this experiment and we&#x27;re going to be improving the experiment to pull this effect out we&#x27;ll talk about that more in a minute let&#x27;s go to this video this is the full power results of the electrogravitic experiment let me show you the scope okay these are the sculpt pulses of the experiment let me explain what they mean the red line is the input pulse coming from our pulse generator right now the the pulse generator is set up to have a half a millisecond rise time A 1 millisecond duration and then a half a millisecond fall time we did the slow rise and fall time to keep these little yellow pulses tame okay the blue Trace is the current in the circuit okay each box going up is 20 amps so we&#x27;re at 2 4 4 six uh almost 75 amps okay and the reason why we can&#x27;t go any higher is because we are at the limit of our voltage the maximum voltage that we can put out on this pulse generator is 10 volts because we&#x27;re driving the transistor directly in the original design we had an op amp driving the transistor which would have been able to drive it to a higher voltage but the op amp was howling because we had too much distance between the op amp and the controlling transistor here we have a basically an open loop control so there is no possibility of this howling and in fact we&#x27;re actually getting a nice signal uh the current is is not doing too bad as far as following the pulse this little downward ramp here is caused by the fact that the wire is heating up and the resistance is going up which is dropping the current in the emitter but it&#x27;s not too bad and that&#x27;s one of the reasons why I reduced this pulse from 10 milliamps I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;ve reduced the pulse with from 10 milliseconds to about 2 milliseconds is to reduce this droop in the pulse caused by the wire heating up and it&#x27;s actually pretty stable for 1 millisecond which is good because we&#x27;re in less probability of burning up the wire and because we have a much shorter pulse width um I&#x27;ve only really have connected two of the four capacitors uh to keep the voltage across the transistor reasonably constant okay let&#x27;s get back to the last trace the gold Trace is the voltage measured at our pickup coil this little square coil here that is perpendicular to the emitter coil here the emitter coil is a single strand of 30 gauge copper the pickup coil is 100 turns of 30 gauge wire and that&#x27;s going into our time 100 amplifier the newly designed one and that&#x27;s giving us a nice clean result which is halfway decent now these downward pulses you see here and the upward pulse you see here those are due to the inductive coupling The Source wire to the pickup wire and because we have inductive coupling it means that our pickup coil is not perfectly aligned let me show you what I mean okay I&#x27;m going to put slight and I wish I had two cameras so I can show you the what I&#x27;m doing and show you the pulse Trace at the same time but I&#x27;m going to put um a slight amount of force in this Direction first I&#x27;m going to twist this guy just like this I&#x27;m just going to apply a little bit of force just like that hardly move it and twist it this way okay now when I do that you&#x27;re going to see those fangs are going to get worse they&#x27;re going to get bigger okay so that means that this guy here is cocky a little bit this way so now what I&#x27;m going to do is I&#x27;m going to put the force in the opposite direction and twist it a little a little bit this way which will align it better and it will cancel those forces now let me show you that so now I&#x27;m going to apply a little bit of force and you can see they pretty much go away okay that was the intent but the 3D printing actually wasn&#x27;t bad cuz we&#x27;re only off a slight tiny bit okay so now so I&#x27;m going to leave those fangs there because those fangs aren&#x27;t really bothering us too much in the middle here in this little section of the coil that&#x27;s where we should see the effect and we don&#x27;t the only thing we get is this little artifact over here which I can&#x27;t explain we do have an other artifact that&#x27;s moving along but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not synchronous to our experiment that is noise coming from somewhere else but let me do this for a minute let me increase the sensitivity of the scope okay and we can see that that pulse there that this guy this guy is a curious anomaly he is synchronous to us cuz he doesn&#x27;t move he does get affected by the noise that rolls underneath him but for the most part he is solid with the experiment now let me do something else I&#x27;m going to change I got to move my CA camera to the other hand hold on I&#x27;m going to change the pulse width to 3 milliseconds okay and that artifact is still there we don&#x27;t see any other artifact okay so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s causing this artifact here this is very intriguing very intriguing again another experiment where we got something that&#x27;s unexpected okay and the other thing that&#x27;s going on is we&#x27;re not seeing what we should be seeing what we should be seeing is a is a pulse here in the yellow that corresponds to the current in the circuit which means our our electrogravitic pulse as predicted by the software is not there now that until we figure out what this is we&#x27;re going to assume that this is maybe not it that this is something else I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know what this guy is let me turn on the thermal imaging camera okay you can see the heat on the coil the coil is kind of blocked by the pickup coil but you can see it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hot I mean it&#x27;s not really that hot okay it&#x27;s 13 3° F which isn&#x27;t bad now the more important thing is that the corners should be hot according to other people what they&#x27;re saying and it makes sense the corners are not hotter why aren&#x27;t the corners hter that little star should be tracking the hottest thing in in the picture and the only reason why it&#x27;s going lower toward us is because that&#x27;s a closer point if I put it more evenly over the top of this okay it&#x27;s bouncing between all parts of the wire not necessarily the corners the corners are hotter this is not showing that they&#x27;re any significantly hotter okay and the amperage that we&#x27;re putting through this like I said is about 75 amps so we should have seen something if the effect were true according to the theory oh and the other parts that are getting hot here are that&#x27;s the transistor which is at a nice chilly where&#x27;s the temperature oh there 110 degrees fenit a hot summer day that&#x27;s pretty cool okay everything else is stable capacitors are stable all right so that is the demonstration of the electrogravitic experiment okay so this is a screenshot of the copper uh let me explain again I know explained in the video this is the output of the pulse generator which is driving the base of a power fet directly uh we can only go to 10 volts on this so we couldn&#x27;t get the power fet um to produce enough power to the targets or the source wires in order to get the full 100 amps because according to the theory the effect goes up by the square of the current I&#x27;ll say that again the effect goes up by the square of the current okay this is a measurement of the current through the source wire and you can see if for the copper there&#x27;s a slight downward Trend in this that&#x27;s because the wire is heating up and the resistance is increasing and therefore the current through the wir is decreasing slowly this here this is what we&#x27;re calling A induction Fang the fangs result because the pickup coil is not perfectly aligned and it is coupling some of the inductive effects of the source and I kind of like it it kind of shows us that those inductive effects are there so no one can argue that the effects we&#x27;re seeing are inductive effects because the inductive effects only occur when the currents doing time changing time changing that&#x27;s when we see them so when the current&#x27;s rising up we get the current the voltage in the pickup is in One Direction when the current&#x27;s decreasing we get the pickup current coil shows the opposite direction okay you will also notice that we have an anomaly in the middle I have no idea what causes this anomaly some of the thoughts are is that there may be a RFID tag in the room I&#x27;m running the experiment which is getting excited by the really intense magnetic field and it&#x27;s chirping back I don&#x27;t know um but this does not but this is synchronous to the experiment so it looks like it&#x27;s an artifact of the experiment because when I change the pulse width that stays in the same place okay so that is the anomaly and we&#x27;re going to talk a little bit more about that in a moment now the effect that we should see if it were positive should be 50 molt rise above the Flat Line an anti-g gravitic result would be the opposite direction as you can see here by looking at this data it doesn&#x27;t look like this thing even moves off the line that&#x27;s why when I did the video that&#x27;s what I was assuming okay but let&#x27;s go in and let me show you how to interpret what the scope is showing you okay when the fangs are normal nor when I mean normal they&#x27;re not affected by anything else okay the Fang tops should be flat except for the places where the current&#x27;s at very low because in those low current ranges the transistor is barely on and there&#x27;s a nonlinear effect there so this is how the fangs should look if there&#x27;s a completely Zero Effect and the null result the signal between the fangs would be at the same level as a signal outside the fangs again the fangs would be flat topped so a null result occurs if there is no effect or the level of effect is too small which I think worked out partially or gravitic and anti-g gravitic effects are both present this gravitic and anti-g gravitic effect is what new electromagnetism V3 said there should be okay so any V3 these the effects canceled let&#x27;s just keep on going so just because we have null result doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re out of the woods yet but let&#x27;s just go on before positive result the expected gravitic effect should look like a flatten version of the current pulse sloping sides flat top Etc and then when we add this to the fangs this is what we&#x27;re going to get we&#x27;re going to get a slight sloping of the Fang tops and we&#x27;re going to get a slight displacement off of the zero line okay but we can also get an anti-g effect which is basically everything going in the opposite direction because it&#x27;s negative going we have a little extension of this slope here and also when we&#x27;re when we&#x27;re recovering uh that&#x27;s going to cause us to basically uh put have a little slope on this guy also this guy might end a little higher off the line before it recovers we do in fact see that now the slope here will does depend on the relative amplitude of the Fang so in most cases we try to realign the copper pickup coil to minimize the fangs which minimizes the inductive couple so if we take a closer look at the results okay here&#x27;s the copper 100 molts per division now you can see we have a slightly degradating slope on the current here the current is very constant so the temperature of the nichrome isn&#x27;t affecting the resistance as much as the temperature of the copper is affecting the resistance but here we definitely see the slope of the Fang as would be expected for an anti-g gravitic effect and the opposite slope of the opposite Fang and we definitely have a displacement off the line now it looks like we do have some kind of of what do you call it DEC curve in there that&#x27;s exciting that we don&#x27;t know why curves it should be a in there but it&#x27;s a got a Decay curve don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s causing the Decay curve still don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s causing this anomaly here and over here when we looked at it closely look at that the green line touches the bottom of the flat line okay it&#x27;s in line with the Flatline which means it&#x27;s slightly anti-g gravitic here the slope kind of shows it&#x27;s anti-g gravitic over here and the other side of the anomaly it goes gravitic with the appropriate slope up here that&#x27;s very exciting looks like the anomaly has something to do with it almost like what we were saying before that there&#x27;s both gravitic and anti-g gravitic effects and they&#x27;re out of phase that&#x27;s very exciting but that&#x27;s just Theory right now we have to do a lot more work on this this is going to be a major Rabbit Hole okay but you can see that we&#x27;re getting something a little smaller than I&#x27;d expected but then again I have been complaining all this time that I think the published values for the material properties are not valid but that&#x27;s another thing to be worked out another day okay now so what I did is I took the copper we did take high resolution measurements down to 10 molts for the copper we placed the green line on and sure enough the earlier per part looks anti-g gravitic after the anomaly it goes gravitic and then I worried well maybe this is coupling into the effect maybe this slope because this is a current change and because our fangs are still there maybe this is coupling into it maybe that&#x27;s the reason why this side is a little higher because when the current goes down that drives the coupling up and that would correlate with that but if that were true then this side should be above the line too because that&#x27;s downward going so there&#x27;s a conflict here so what I did in the next experiment is I realigned the coil to minimize the fangs because if I minimize the coupling of the fangs then that also minimizes the coupling of this slope to this curve and if you look really really closely we have an anti-g graphitic effect almost all the way across okay and it&#x27;s there I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s one pixel but it&#x27;s there and I think we got a blow up of this yeah so what I need to do is next weekend I&#x27;m going to go down and look at this in more detail um but minimizing the Fang does in fact decouple this from this measurement here very very very interesting so the experimental path for we lots to do going to check all the math all the simulations the scope connections everything to see if there was a sign error because this looks like we&#x27;re getting mostly anti-g gravitic effects okay I was expecting gravitic effects okay and reconcile lower than expected amplitude um can it be reconciled as gravitic and anti- gravi cancellation at the same time and the reason why we see anti-g gravitic is because the anti-g gravitic is slightly more than the gravitic that is very possible because the effect we should be seeing should be about 10 times bigger than what we&#x27;re actually seeing and so what it might be is that we got both effects they&#x27;re cancelling each other and there&#x27;s just a little bit more anti-g gravitic and that&#x27;s why we see a slight anti-g gravitic effect again we&#x27;re going to revisit the ne5 and recheck all that MTH because we to see if that same idea applies to us and then if we can find a way then later to put the gravitic and anti-g gravitic out of balance maybe that in involves much more resistive wire I don&#x27;t know okay then we definitely have to understand the cause of the anomaly this is of great importance because the anomaly is about the amplitude we&#x27;re looking for strangely enough we need to get the op amp working now we got to put that back in so we can drive the high to higher current currents and also keep the current constant we don&#x27;t want that current sloping while we&#x27;re trying to take the gravitic measurement and then we need to improve the pickup coil alignment to minimize the fangs and the inductive coupling so that&#x27;s got a lot of work lot of work ahead of us on this but this is exciting because we&#x27;ve got a carrot now so for the production path forward this could throw a monkey wrench in and so what I&#x27;ve decided to do is I&#x27;m going to post to the senior patreon members the brid officers and the first officers I&#x27;m going to put up a questionnaire how we want to proceed there&#x27;s option one stop all production and premieres and just stop all video production and focus on this reconcile this now this could take months I mean the patreon members would get their statuses every week of where we are maybe every other work depending how busy things are uh and this actually may result in new electromagnetism V6 depending how disruptive it is to the existing nav5 okay the second option is to place a caveat and the nav5 paper saying we got some interesting results the results of this of of the this section of the paper U is on hold until we reconcile the experiment but we&#x27;re going to get the piper published with that caveat anyway get it out to everybody um just with the caveat saying we&#x27;re not finished here basically is what it&#x27;s saying um and then finish up the any5 videos and papers and the cosmology video series I have a potential release date on the last slide of when things will be released if we go this route um and then then finish up the cosmology video series and be able to return to this experiment either by uh winter break 2024 or early 2025 or we could option three is to do a 50/50 where we kind of do number two at half speed we do a Premiere every other week and we work the O so we do odd weeks and even weeks kind of deal that&#x27;s another possibility so um even though this is being shown to my patreon Members First to those it&#x27;s going to be eventually published to the premiere to YouTube uh you YouTube folks everyone out there in the video in in the public world that&#x27;s watching this listen I could get a lot more work done this faster if I didn&#x27;t have a j o to go to but right now my j o is the number number one funding for this Venture your help would be greatly appreciated five bucks a month isn&#x27;t going to kill you okay come to my website this is out of date I don&#x27;t have all the videos uh linked in here yet but I will I will catch this up someday um but but the the Ethereal mechanic stuff is all up to date for uh the electrogravity stuff is up to date so if you go in here you&#x27;ll find all the electrogravity stuff new electromagnetism V5 I update the videos for that right now if you want to find all the videos for this you just got to go to this YouTube to the YouTube channel and type in N5 and the tag for the video series will come up okay this is the blog site big shout out to Sebastian again if I could get my j o out of my hair I would be able to have a lot more time to spend here um but I shout out to Sebastian for doing this and taking care of it thank you very much uh this is the YouTube site you can get there by ethereal mechanics.com usually sometimes this works sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work if not just go to YouTube search for ethereal mechanics and look for the picture of Julie with the ring of fire um and then basically go to playlist all of the videos will be in their own playlist whether they&#x27;re transv variant electrogravity we don&#x27;t have any eonic pronic ones yet vortx algebra rules of acquisition when they&#x27;re produced cosmology when they&#x27;re produced and all the N5 videos should be they&#x27;re not going to be in order yet so just go by the sequence number this is the potential release date if option two is chosen we&#x27;re going to keep our every Thursday night for uh public releases and these are the patreon releases these videos have already been released to patreon I think we released them last year before we got onto the electrogravitic experimental build um and we&#x27;ll begin repr producing the remaining videos for the N5 uh starting next weekend to get this out of the way okay this assumes that we put the electrogravitic experiment on hold until we get all the production done anyway thank you very much</p>
