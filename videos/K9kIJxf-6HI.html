            <p>hi and welcome back over the last few weeks we&#x27;ve been talking about anti-gravity and UFO propulsion systems what exactly the aliens have in their UFOs I have no idea but what we have on earth we do know a bit about so let&#x27;s talk a bit about gravity now gravity is odd we know that magnetism has an attraction for us you can actually feel an attraction from a distance so there is obviously a force which is coming out of the magnet and we can see that with iron filings you can see waves of magnetism yeah with eltra see you can also see that there&#x27;s a force and you can measure it 9 volts but with gravity my anvil it&#x27;s just heavy but there&#x27;s no force that we can measure coming in zooming coming off it let me just gravity works in a very different way it&#x27;s all to do with mass but that&#x27;s rather old-fashioned if so was gravitational force maybe we can make anti gravity just imagine even partial anti gravity would transform aviation I mean airplanes slightly lighter it turns out that people like Boeing are actually working on anti-gravity they have a program called grasp gravity research advanced space propulsion who would have guessed I mean this is in public domain so let&#x27;s look today at what the big defense contractors are looking at and possibly what they&#x27;ve achieved in an excellent article in jane&#x27;s defence weekly by nick cook Nick writes Boeing the world&#x27;s largest aircraft manufacturer has admitted it is working on experimental anti-gravity projects that could overturn a century of conventional aerospace propulsion technology they&#x27;re closely looking at the work of EGF knee potluck of a Russian scientist who has experimented with superconducting technology in both Russia and Finland in a BBC interview on an excellent film called Project Green clue a Jennif said this one of my colleagues who was living at that time just came to the laboratory and said guys what are you doing here and he was smoking his pipe and he blew his pipe over the cryostat and the smoke went close to the Christ that heat some unseen Beria and very fast went up this gravity field is in our case propulsive and as you can see the repulsive force is pretty big in a document made public by Boeing from the grasp team they said they&#x27;ve been working on an antigravity beam for inches 10 centimeters wide that is successfully repelling objects more than a half mile on kilometer away with negligible power loss they go on to say such technology could be engineered into a new weapon system capable of vaporizing objects [Music] and this blockbuster objects placed over a rapidly spinning disk of superconducting material lost up to 2% of its weight what we&#x27;re seeing here is a report about existing technology [Music] a 2% weight loss from a Boeing b-1 bomber which reduce its weight by this much also these reports were made public in the 1990s now 20 years later I believe we have anti-gravity drives yeah oh my god it&#x27;s rotated the truth is out there</p>
