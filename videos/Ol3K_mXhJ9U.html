            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I&#x27;m Tim Ventura and we&#x27;re joined today by Dr. Eugene Ponloinoff, a chemist and expert in material science known for his experimental research into gravity control and shielding with YBCO superconductors. Dr. Pogllinoff made global headlines in the 90s for his experiments with gravity shielding in rotating discs made from ceramic superconducting materials. His accomplishments include collaboration on physics theory with Dr.</p>
<p>Ning Lee&#x27;s team, consulting on materials engineering with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center gravity research team and co-authoring papers on gravitational impulse experiments with Dr. Giovani Modi. Dr. Pllinoff graduated from the Moscow University of Chemical Technology, got his PhD and spent 15 years at the Institute for High Temperatures in the Russian Academy of Sciences. got a second PhD from Tamper University of Technology in Finland and has been featured numerous times in major broadcast and print media outlets around the world.</p>
<p>He joins us today to discuss his ongoing research into emerging physics. Eugene, welcome. It is I&#x27;ve never seen you in person before. This is a tremendous pleasure. &gt;&gt; Hi team, I&#x27;m also very glad to see you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Is wonderful. Wonderful. I I have been waiting. Let me see. I I think we&#x27;ve known each other 20 years now.</p>
<p>This is the first time we&#x27;ve done a video call. So, let me start out. I should ask, you are in Finland right now and you&#x27;re in your your office there. What have you been doing? Cuz we haven&#x27;t done an interview, I think, in about 5 years. So, could you help catch me up on what&#x27;s going on in your life? What has changed? How your research has gone? All of that? Uh well I uh at present I live and work uh in Finland.</p>
<p>Uh I&#x27;m connected to uh Tamper University. So I uh teach my students and also uh lead the scientific work. Uh usually uh I supervise uh the activity of some small laboratories who work on gravity all over the world. I also meet my colleagues uh in different uh countries. Uh lately I was uh traveling extensively uh mainly in Europe but also to China.</p>
<p>Uh sometimes I go to Russia because there are a group of Russian professors who work in this direction too. Uh so my life is uh full of activity. Uh if we speak about personal life uh I can post that my younger daughter is in high school now and her uh favorite subject is physics. Uh and she knows about gravity everything that is possible to find in the textbooks and sometimes she argues with her teacher of physics uh which is quite natural. Uh but uh they always come to a good compromise.</p>
<p>So that is that&#x27;s the situation. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s wonderful. That&#x27;s wonderful. I have a 15-year-old daughter as well and mine mine just argues with me though. So um let me get into an overview of your work for the audience.</p>
<p>There is so much that you&#x27;ve done. You have created such a tremendous legacy of research. So starting out in the 1990s, you were researching gravity shielding with rotating YBCO superconductors. Then in the early 2000s, yourself and Dr. Giovani Modinazi used a Marx generator discharge onto a superconducting emitter to create a beam of gravitational force.</p>
<p>And then later when we spoke in 2020, you would describe a completely new experiment using what I understand was an ion impregnated gold foil on a rotating metal disc that generated a gravitational shielding effect without using YBCO superconductors. So these are three very unique projects and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s interesting to see this progression also. Um, have you done any more work on these experiments since we&#x27;ve last talked? &gt;&gt; Uh, yes. Uh, before we uh continue this discussion, I would like to say that we no longer use the term gravitational shielding. M &gt;&gt; it was the uh term that we used many years ago because when uh the objects changed their weight we thought that it was connected to the gravitational shielding by superconductor.</p>
<p>Uh later we came to a conclusion that it is not shielding but uh modification of the local gravity field uh close to our device. And so at present uh we use the term modification of uh gravity. Uh uh our first experiments were with uh rotating superconductors. Uh it was a very useful material. Uh as superconductors allow to obtain any um configuration of the magnetic field and they can uh froze it.</p>
<p>uh in space uh so that we could use this uh configuration. Uh my second experiments uh sorry second experiment was u uh generating of the discharge with max generator through a superconductor and uh the results were published uh in uh 2012. Uh there is um an electronic book uh which is uh I hope this can be ah okay &gt;&gt; uh this is electronic book. &gt;&gt; Yeah gravity superconductor interactions theory and experiment. &gt;&gt; Our uh article was um titled study of uh light interaction with gravity impulses and measurements of the speed of gravity impulses.</p>
<p>uh a fundamental work with Joani Monza and that was uh I think a good um achievement with superconductors and uh finally uh we came uh to a point where we decided uh not to use uh superconducting materials for uh for uh special configuration and with uh our gravity generator we uh chose another variant which is uh rotating uh magnetic fields. Uh of course uh at the first stages uh we tried uh to rotate uh a normal uh disc. uh every uh metal disc when rotated at high speed uh creates uh torsion fields around itself. Uh these uh these effects were used by German engineers during the second world war. They made uh a whole combination of three discs rotating in different directions and they were able to uh create the devices uh that were levitating and propagating in space.</p>
<p>Uh according to my knowledge uh both uh American part and Russian part got the drawings uh of German engineers and tried to replicate but failed. Uh there is a small uh small secret there and it took me many years uh to solve this problem. Uh the point is that uh the disc uh should have unbalanced rotation. &gt;&gt; That means wobbling if you want. Uh so uh and the speed of the rotation should be big enough because we&#x27;re working with small discs and small masses.</p>
<p>Therefore, we use the rotation of up to 15,000 rotations per minute and we have a very clear and uh measurable and observable effect. Uh this is a repulsive force that goes from the disc. So these are uh torsion fields that the scientists were looking for. Uh some scientists even now do not believe this. they have their own criteria but uh we decided to work with uh this uh phenomenon and uh we reached some success.</p>
<p>Uh so uh later again we came uh to the conclusion that there is no necessity to rotate the disk. uh but it is possible to rotate only magnetic fields because it gives practically the same uh uh picture. We create vortexes in uh physical vacuum or ether if you like and uh rotating magnetic fields is uh gives much better effect much stronger effect. And if we speak about uh a possibility of interstellar travel, definitely rotating heavy Marsism is not a good approach. But u rotating magnetic fields is a key to propellerless propulsion.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, so that brings us to your latest experiment. you&#x27;ve described using tooidal solenoids with complex windings that are operating near the terraertz frequency range that produce a levitation effect lasting about 15 to 20 seconds before they overheat. So the limitation really wasn&#x27;t the the the device I guess in terms of the you know the effect itself. It was just heat buildup inside of the coils. You described using copper and I believe copper silver coils for a little bit better conductivity and I guess your team has solved this issue and so this is something that you can do better with in the future even can you tell me a little bit more about these experiments? &gt;&gt; Uh yes uh so uh tooidal uh transformers are now very popular in electronics.</p>
<p>uh they are usually uh winded uh across some uh core inside. So we can use a normal uh solenoid a normal coil and then wind a tooidal solenoid around uh this uh initial coil. uh at this combination uh uh electric field and magnetic field do not have the difference of 90° but uh they uh are coherent and they are directed in the same uh direction. Uh the most interesting part is that uh again we should use uh the principle that the system should be asymmetric. We have that asymmetric principle in bifil brown experiments.</p>
<p>You made a lot of experiments with the lifters and uh uh uh we have uh tooidal configuration but uh we decided to change it. Uh so uh I will demonstrate uh this uh drawing as you can see. So uh with red lines uh we see the central part that is a normal uh normal coil and with green light uh we have uh a tooidal solenoid which is winded over this normal coil. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And it is symmetrical because if you see that the angle here is not uh equal to this angle.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s again the key to success. Uh actually when we build our current installation uh this angle is even steeper. So it&#x27;s a this is a cross-section of course it&#x27;s a simplified view but it&#x27;s a cross-section of the uh device that uh will fly to other planets uh in some years I hope. Uh so this is uh an interesting thing and again we use uh different frequencies a combination of frequencies uh sometimes uh two different frequencies uh with a difference of about from 10 to 11 times. Uh uh this configuration gives a possibility uh to use the full force and uh when we uh test the devices with this shape we have um pretty stable levitation force uh but of course uh the system does not fly entirely into the air.</p>
<p>First it is situated on the table. Then some part of it begins to move &gt;&gt; and only one part moves because uh the other part is heavier because of the wires that go there. &gt;&gt; Uh the field uh the torsion field is building and it takes some seconds and then the whole system goes into the air and uh we can keep it there for several seconds. Then we feel that uh there is an unpleasant smell of burning insulation because we are working at the maximum possibility of our uh wire. Uh it&#x27;s in the laboratory and uh it takes a lot of time to make all the windings.</p>
<p>uh but uh this is quite a success and uh can and will be used uh for our future work. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s that you know what I I hadn&#x27;t considered that but now that you mention it. So every time you burn through the coils you have to rewind it since it&#x27;s a custom winding that&#x27;s a lot of work for each test but it must be incredibly rewarding to see it levitate. Now you had described this as generating what you&#x27;ve described as large forces for levitation. Can I ask how much force have you been able to generate and how much power did do you think it took to generate that effect? Uh well frankly uh the system uh takes several uh kilowatts &gt;&gt; and uh we use uh Tesla technology and Tesla approach uh I mean Nicola Tesla uh to um for our power supplies because there should be a special uh shape of the um signals that go uh of the frequency that we send to these coils.</p>
<p>Uh also it takes a lot of work uh to find the resonance frequencies where the effect is the maximum uh tremendous work. Now we you we can use the computer programs but anyway it&#x27;s time and time consuming and efforts consuming. Uh how powerful is installation? Uh the fact that um the coil u the whole device uh weighs from half a kilo up to three or 4 kilos and it is able uh to lift itself in the air. uh it&#x27;s quite uh interesting uh so we can&#x27;t appreciate give the values how powerful it is but let&#x27;s say as Rolls-Royce it&#x27;s powerful enough uh to be used for practical applications &gt;&gt; well and it is so exciting it&#x27;s exciting to see the progression of your work too as you described earlier you started out with rotating devices devices and you&#x27;ve gone to rotating fields and that is a prediction that many others have made over the years. So it&#x27;s amazing to see that and then from your initial you know again what was called gravitational shielding or now gravity modification from that initial effect which was a very slight effect now you have something that is lifting off the table.</p>
<p>So this is amazing. This is amazing progress. I you know I let me be one of the first to congratulate you on this because it&#x27;s absolutely tremendous. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you. But uh it seems that uh the progress was fast.</p>
<p>I began working in this area uh 33 years ago and the first article appeared in 1992 in the journal of uh it&#x27;s called physica c and at that time the article was called a possibility of gravitational shielding by high temperature superconductors. So 33 years of work is a big period and I can&#x27;t say that uh this is all I invented or on the members of my team. We gathered the knowledge that existed in the world uh during the last years and we studied uh theories, we studied experimental installations, we discussed it with many people and uh this is the result uh and the combination of uh knowledge from different uh fields of physics. Uh but uh I agree that this is the way to follow. Well, in terms of the physics, one of the things you had mentioned this earlier is um you&#x27;ve described this device to me in email and prior videos as a gravitational well.</p>
<p>That is what it is generating where the experimental device continually falls into the well. Again, that&#x27;s a very relativistic description of the effect. And the reason I wanted to clarify that for the audience is this does not appear to be repulsive effect. Right? In other words, you&#x27;re not pushing against the table, the workbench, or the floor. This is creating basically an area of reduced gravity above the device and it falls upward into it.</p>
<p>Would that be accurate? &gt;&gt; Yes, that is absolutely accurate. Uh we don&#x27;t push this time. This time we have a kind of attraction because the field that uh exists or the field that appears uh over uh the windings of the solenoids uh it&#x27;s first of all uh it it can be uh as big as half a millimeter. It can be 1 millm and then goes up to uh several millimeters. And uh this area uh from the point of view of physical vacuum is not so dense as all uh the area around it definitely uh this u area with less density is filled with the object.</p>
<p>So our the whole uh solenoid goes up. Uh and at the same time when it goes up it uh brings this uh torsion or close to gravity field together with it. So it is moving up all the time and bringing that uh source of uh motion together with it. uh depending on the uh on electrical parameters uh the field can be bigger or smaller. So we can regulate the speed uh of um of the device that goes up also.</p>
<p>Uh when we speak about the same uh the construction that we have here uh usually this part is uh is steeper goes here uh uh the uh vectors of uh of the torsion fields they&#x27;re perpendicular to the surface. So perpendicular here perpendicular here. uh when we have steep angle here uh the device is more stable in the atmosphere much more stable uh so uh that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s how it works. Yeah, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. And you know, the the way that you described this as well as your prior experiments, this reminds me of so many things.</p>
<p>When you had talked about having a wobble in the disc several moments ago, that reminded me of Alexi Chirkov&#x27;s Graiflier, right, which has been out there on the internet for a while. And what you&#x27;re describing with the coils reminds me in some ways of an experiment that Dr. John Brandenburgg did with his GM theory. So it is amazing to see this convergence I guess from different paths of experimentation and research and you know you are right in the middle of it you know especially working with torsion physics which is something that so many different people have experimented with and theoretically modeled and I I think that there are so many unknowns there but also one of the challenges that I&#x27;ve seen is um the the the description the word or the the meaning of torsion means different things to different scientists depending on their background and where they come from. Right? Even within electromagnetism, I guess there are different interpretations of it.</p>
<p>And so that that has been kind of a challenge for people. &gt;&gt; Uh that&#x27;s right. We usually use uh the works of academician aim. He gave the theory of motion fields. uh he died several years ago but he left his scientific school and he predicted u many things but uh when he was alive he had no confirmation how torsion fields work.</p>
<p>Now we have this confirmation and uh it is we can easily reproduce and demonstrate to people uh torsion fields. It can be organized at any university. Uh we need a good vacuum chamber, a rotary pump, high uh speed motor and the discs uh made according to u our requirements and we can demonstrate. So uh this is not a secret and uh this is a big breakthrough. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s amazing.</p>
<p>you&#x27;d mentioned uh Anatoli Akimoff I believe and then uh he had done work with uh Gennady Shipoff who I&#x27;ve interviewed in the past and and so there there is this amazing amount of work there and one of the things that I understand from the past is during the cold war torsion physics research in Russia was very popular there was a lot of work done in that area whereas in the west that research went in a different direction. And so from everything I understand, there is still a ton of knowledge, expertise, and information in the the Russian scientific establishment that we just don&#x27;t have in the west. &gt;&gt; Uh not exactly. So uh there are many similar moments uh where if we analyze uh the theory of put of h and roa uh the theory of energy fluctuations of vacuum uh a lot of things common with the theory of uh torsion fields. Uh also uh modern scientists uh call uh that ether physical vacuum.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh uh a friend a good friend of mine u professor Paul Violet uh published a book called quantum kinetics where he gives the equations uh for uh different properties of this physical vacuum because it can be polarized, it can have bigger density, smaller density. uh we can create vortices inside uh this physical vacuum and so we use uh this uh information for our practical devices. Uh also speaking about different theories in this field. We also use Maxwell theories and Maxwell equations but uh as some professors in Britain provided me with Maxwell equations which were originally written by him not uh the simplified version uh simplified by Heavyside which is now being taught at all universities.</p>
<p>So there is a big difference and I&#x27;m thankful to my colleagues for their help. But uh speaking about uh theoretical approaches, I should say that uh during the last 50 years uh the governments of different countries and scientific associations spend a lot of money in the field of uh uh theoretical gravity research. uh the money was given uh in the United States, in Russia, in China, in Italy, uh in Britain and also in Europe by European Space Agency. Uh there were many experiments that were organized uh in NASA in some small um laboratories also in military laboratories uh in European space agency, British aerospace and uh we now combine the theoretical knowledge that exists in this field and experimental knowledge and the cost of all the experiments and theoretical ical research during last 50 years was over2 billion US. So it&#x27;s a great amount of data and this data is crucial for uh our advance in this field.</p>
<p>So when we uh now approach uh some investors and say we are ready to work they usually look at us and say well you come emptyhanded and we say no we come with a knowledge at least two billion in knowledge plus our experimental experience. So that&#x27;s the situation in this field. Yeah, there there&#x27;s there is so much that you are drawing from. There is an incredible legacy. I&#x27;m actually working on as a side project.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m doing a write up on a timeline of superconductors and gravity. I had a short version and I have been using AI to go through old documents and pull out information and I mean dozens and dozens of pages of just references. You know, there are so many papers that have been published, experiments that have done, and it&#x27;s been bits and pieces here and there. And so, for you to be able to bring this together is absolutely tremendous. Now, I I wanted to ask if there have been any other anomalous effects that you&#x27;ve seen with the new experiment, such as like red or blue shifting of light, gravitational lensing effects, or or possibly even small changes in timekeeping devices.</p>
<p>And and the reason I asked that was I thought, you know, if this really is a gravitational effect, it would be interesting to see if you start to see some of these other relativistic changes happen. Uh well uh all the effects you are talking about are usually studied by astronomers because they require very big distances and uh uh I was not concentrated uh on these uh things uh the science is uh too profound in this field and I&#x27;m uh usually I regard myself as a person who makes the experiments. Uh but my friend uh a good friend of mine Joani Monza he knows all the theories and u we both do not believe in time travel but he says Eugene we should keep our uh research in such a way that it doesn&#x27;t contradict Einstein&#x27;s theory and we analyzed all our activity all our results and came to conclusion that it is in good accordance with Einstein&#x27;s theory. We do not contradict him. We al also do not contradict Newton.</p>
<p>On the contrary, we uh studied uh the works of Newton and it helped us a lot. Another thing that I wanted to ask about was uh again you have moved away from using superconductors and I recently visited Glenn Tony Robertson&#x27;s lab in Huntsville and I was able to see his work with superconductors. I did learn a couple of interesting things there. NASA had there was a rumor that they had attempted your experiment with gravity shielding and didn&#x27;t see results. and he clarified for me NASA never attempted that experiment.</p>
<p>They ran out of funding before they were able to try it. So that is on his list. That&#x27;s one of the things he&#x27;s working with. Um so it&#x27;s good to clarify that with you. The NASA never attempted it.</p>
<p>Your results still stand and still need experimental replication and validation. The other thing that was interesting was when I met with him, he showed me how difficult YBCO superconductors are to work with. They are heavy. They&#x27;re brittle, very difficult to keep cool, and very difficult to manufacture. And then on top of that, there was a melt texturing process that he and others have experimented with.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t think anyone other than yourself has been able to really perfect that. So I wanted to ask are YBCO superconductors in some ways an outdated technology just because they&#x27;re so difficult to work with. &gt;&gt; Uh uh in my opinion uh high temperature superconductors are still very useful. Uh speaking about uh the experiment uh for 3 years I was a consultant a scientific consultant for Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville and uh there were practically two groups there. One was uh the own group of NASA and that was called the delta G experiment.</p>
<p>Uh the other group was at the University of Alabama uh under the guidance of Dr. Ning Lee and uh uh when I was working there uh I was u hired via subcontractor which is called uh superconducting components uh and uh the firm is in Columbus, Ohio. So we collaborated with all these groups and also used the help of Argo National Laboratories and that was a nice period but a very difficult work. Uh also people at partial space flight center are a bit busy with their own experiments. Every person in NASA has five, seven, 10 projects running simultaneously which is not good in from my point of view.</p>
<p>uh all the experiments of that time uh were documented and there is um uh a documentary uh made by uh German um uh scientists uh German uh producers and that was close simmering and uh in this uh this video is available on the internet. It&#x27;s in German. Uh it was made 25 26 years ago and it gives you a direct picture what was achieved at that time. And uh uh David Novver was responsible for delta G project and all experimental data uh in in NASA. So uh a brilliant scientist and even in the film you can see that how he measures the uh anomalies in uh gravity um gravity on his gravity equipment.</p>
<p>Uh so some small effects they uh noticed but they were working with a very small disc in size in diameter. So that&#x27;s why their uh information were their results was were so little. But uh Ning Lee, an outstanding uh professor of physics, very bright lady, uh she made her own experiments, the University of Alabama, &gt;&gt; and at first she succeeded uh getting uh money from NASA, but then NASA refused the funding and she had to go on on her own. But her brother gave her a present like u half a million US dollars for the continuation of her experiments. It&#x27;s all in the uh the documentary and she managed to repeat my experiment uh in a full scale.</p>
<p>uh when uh she repeated all the uh experiments uh the funding to NASA was stopped and uh the whole uh information together with all the equipment of Ningle was uh transferred to the department of defense and she became a scientific director of the laboratory and continued working uh uh in some secret atmosphere. But uh scientists never obey the formalities and when even working for the American military she sometime discussed several things with me. She used to give me uh phone calls and we discussed it. We uh exchanged emails and uh the most interesting thing I remember from that time if a phone call comes during night time that is definitely Ningly &gt;&gt; with her problems uh because uh she could not uh remember the time then when it is day in the United States we have night in Europe. uh but uh they reached a certain success and uh I don&#x27;t know the details uh anyway uh that was u a very useful period of time and uh the work with superconductors is of course uh a good thing to do.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. So there is there is still merit to experimentation with those. Although I think that the work you&#x27;re doing with solenoids as well as the work you did with the gold covered disc is incredibly interesting and I love the fact that you have delved into aimov and torsion physics because I feel like that is something that really deserves more attention and more investigation. And so these are really really exciting areas. Um so let me see again you have worked with so many of these big figures Dr.</p>
<p>Ningley at AC gravity uh Glenn Robertson and the NASA gravity research team uh Ron Koser you mentioned him I believe David Novver uh you&#x27;ve also worked with Dr. George Hathaway uh Dr. Giovani Modazi and so many other people. You were part of this remarkable community that is developing this. Now these are just the western scientists.</p>
<p>Um there are also many scientists in Russia that you&#x27;re working with, right? And one of the challenges has been these communities don&#x27;t talk to each other as much as they could. &gt;&gt; Uh yes, that&#x27;s right. Uh unfortunately uh Russian professors sometimes also work on uh closed projects and they are not exactly uh the experts in on gravity. Uh some of them work with uh spaceships, some of them work with uh electronics with satellites. uh some work with solenoids, some work with high temp uh high voltage discharges.</p>
<p>So uh I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m an expert uh or in every field. So uh I&#x27;m not afraid to come to them directly and ask I don&#x27;t know this please explain how it all happens what is the mechanism how we can increase the parameters and so on and uh uh well some of the professors occupy high positions at Russian universities and uh it&#x27;s not good to uh pronounce their names uh openly. I didn&#x27;t uh get the permission. Uh but from my experience uh with western technology, I also have a lot of friends in Great Britain. I go there rather often because the flights are cheap, not as to the United States.</p>
<p>And uh uh Some professors in Britain support me officially, but when I come sometimes they say, &quot;Eugene, please forgive us for we have sinned.&quot; And uh some people asked about your experiments and we gave a negative opinion because we remember professor Lewway was uh thrown out of Imperial College and we want to retire in honor. So please uh forgive us and of course I forgive them. Uh speaking about uh my activity in Canada um I was cooperating about two years with George Heatherway. He is an outstanding engineer. He had a nicely equipped laboratory in Toronto.</p>
<p>And uh for two years we were working and we understood each other perfectly and we got many interesting ideas and uh he built a very good installations. He is a mechanical engineer but &gt;&gt; if it&#x27;s okay I I wanted to ask about funding because you have a startup company in place from what I understand you have projects that you want to move forward with. um you know have you been searching for funding sources to develop like a a a craft or are there a series of experiments? What what is your what is your approach there? Uh well uh funding is of course extremely important because uh our plan was to create an international laboratory uh busy mainly not with uh science but uh with engineering. So we have uh completed the stage of science and would like to move to engineering. uh uh the problem of funding uh in the United States is a bit difficult because uh people do not understand the scale of this research.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They think it is one of the small projects uh made somewhere in the basement or in the backyard. And uh sometimes people uh ask Eugene, can you make a small model of of your device uh and can you demonstrate it to us? Uh the small model will cost uh much more than the real one and uh uh all the equipment should be practically the same. So it&#x27;s difficult. Uh but what uh is a bit surprising that uh sometimes people say uh we can find money but uh you should uh Dr.</p>
<p>You should uh send us uh all the docu documentation uh the detailed description of your installation uh uh calculations drawings everything everything then we shall analyze it perhaps we shall replicate it in some and then maybe if you we need your help we&#x27;ll give you some funding u the approach that does not work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh at the same time I was approached by a Chinese businessman about 5 years ago and uh the point is that they require no proof. They analyzed all the situation with their scientists and they are good. They are really good.</p>
<p>Uh they have money. Uh I asked about 200 million. They can say they said we can double this &gt;&gt; but you should make uh everything uh during one year and I said guys it&#x27;s absolutely impossible. I&#x27;m a hardworking person but and then uh they practically agreed to my conditions but uh then COVID uh came and this um everybody was sick. So China was separated and uh we had to stop uh this activity.</p>
<p>At the same time uh if we ask uh do American people have enough money? Oh yes definitely. Marshall Space Flight Center has a budget of five billion uh dollars uh every year. Uh so if we ask uh 50 million per year and uh the for the international laboratory somehow it&#x27;s possible to find it. Uh I think that uh our purpose is to find a wise investor. That means a person who understands uh what this uh technology can bring to the world and to him personally and uh wise means he&#x27;s uh he&#x27;s patient and will wait for five six or seven years.</p>
<p>Uh I think that uh we should uh as scientists we should work with the investors explain to them what when and how make it absolutely transparent but uh I&#x27;m a scientist so uh I need some help uh from you from other people who are busy who are uh fans of this field. uh maybe they could uh find some uh wise people. I&#x27;m sure it can be done. It can be done both in the United States, in Europe. So, &gt;&gt; you know, that is one of the reasons that I am so excited to be able to help you get the message out there.</p>
<p>I mean, if anyone deserves the opportunity to put together a research lab, it&#x27;s you. you have over 30 years in this area and you have worked with some of I mean so many of the key figures right people like Dr. Ning Lee um you know then as well as highfrequency gravitational wave researchers a lot of those figures are no longer with us you are still here you have the expertise you have the knowledge you have the connections so you know again I&#x27;m I am incredibly honored to be able to help you get that message out to people. So thank you for that for that opportunity. &gt;&gt; Yeah let&#x27;s hope for the best.</p>
<p>Well, Eugene, I should probably close for today. I, you know, I am more than happy to do future interviews with you. I would love to invite you back. I will, while we&#x27;re recording, I will get that on camera so people know that I am ready, willing, and able. And uh I guess I should close by asking what is coming up for you in the next uh few weeks, next few months.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s uh a good question, but the answer is very simple. I consider myself and my colleagues and people who work in this area to be common normal people. That means we are honest, hardworking, kind. But we have a dream. We have a dream uh to make a continuing mission to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilization.</p>
<p>to boldly go where no one has gone before. And uh this is a dream of American people. This is a dream of people all over the world. In a way, even Elon Musk is inspired by this dream. So maybe his help would uh change the situation.</p>
<p>I know that uh uh our road to success will be extremely difficult. uh but uh I want to use the support of uh good people from all over the world and I&#x27;m absolutely sure that and uh this is possible and my feelings uh deep in my heart I do believe we shall overcome someday. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Well, Eugene, let me thank you again so much for your time today, sir. &gt;&gt; Uh, thank you team.</p>
<p>I appreciate your efforts, what you are doing with the conferences, how you keep this site and uh, thank you for your tremendous work. &gt;&gt; I want to thank everyone in the audience for staying tuned for this remarkable opportunity to hear updates from Dr. Eugene Pogllinoff. And now I want to share with you a video that he sent me in preparation for our interview where he describes even more about his latest research. Hi team, it&#x27;s always nice to see you again.</p>
<p>As always, you are doing a great job. I&#x27;m always glad to greet all people who are watching this side. people who have a dream to go to other planets and I hope in the nearest future it will become possible. Well, speaking about the journey uh to the world of gravity, uh no, it was not my choice. I never uh dreamed that I would ever study this field because by my education and professional training I am an expert in material science, chemistry, partly physics but uh gravity it was uh something extraordinary.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t say that uh it was a coincidence first of all because I don&#x27;t believe in coincidences and uh second thing that there are too many aspects that are combined in this research. Uh so no it is not a coincidence but uh you know God works in mysterious ways. Therefore, everything uh seems to be planned nicely or not so nicely in a better world. How it all began. I&#x27;m studying gravity for more than 30 years, actually 33 years.</p>
<p>My first article appeared in 1992 in the magazine of Physica C and the article was named the possibility of weak gravitational shielding by high temperature superconductors and uh at that time I was working at Tamper University of Technology uh working with superconductor actors both bulk and films. Uh the phenomena that uh we discovered was quite unusual and we were trying to get some explanation theoretical explanation but the subject was too complicated and we could not find any good explanation at the same time. And maybe it&#x27;s a coincidence uh in the United States at the University of Alabama uh Dr. Ning Lee and Dr. Douglas Thor uh were studying and were preparing a theoretical platform and they were trying to connect electromagnetism and gravity and this they started solid bodies.</p>
<p>So uh and they practically made a revolutionary theory but they were lacking the experiment and it was difficult for them to go on with their theory. Luckily they found uh my article. Um at that time it was already published in um another article was published in uh LOS elements database and uh they organized um a joint research with the specialists from NASA. Uh the experiment was called delta G. Uh it was a unique experiment and uh one day I got a phone call from Ning Lee and uh they offered me to participate in this experiment to come to the United States and to be a scientific consultant for this project.</p>
<p>It was a nice time. First of all, taking into consideration that the whole initiative for this project came from John Glenn. I met him several times and he helped me in difficult critical situations at Marshall Space Flight Center. Uh speaking about NASA, uh the team was really good. I have the warmest impression and very good memories about that time.</p>
<p>Uh really nice team. Uh I worked with uh Ron Koser uh Tony Robertson uh David Novver and a group of engineers and scientists who were experts in their own fields and dedicated a lot of their attention and efforts to this project. Uh the reaction of the scientific community at that time was uh was different. uh some scientists who belong to the to an old school uh said it was all nonsense. Absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>Impossible because it is impossible to argue them and to give several proofs was absolutely impossible. Uh there were also young scientists who supported the idea. Young people are also they&#x27;re very active. Uh they don&#x27;t have any dogmatic rules and they do not feel the press of the um politically correct science at different universities. So they definitely welcomed this uh this work.</p>
<p>But uh also there are scientists who are responsible for the progress of human civilization for all that is happening on this earth because they are wise and their knowledge in different fields causes deep respect. So I&#x27;m very much uh indeped to the help of Halputoff. We exchanged several emails. We spoke on the phone. He always said that this direction uh experimental gravity research is a great thing to do and also his theory of energy fluctuations of vacuum was very helpful to us on the later stage.</p>
<p>uh also uh um some people uh some well-known scientists like Jack Sarfati this name is known in the United States he also appreciated this work and supported me and in general Jack Sarvati has a reputation of a slightly crazy scientist but everybody respects him because he is really wise and his knowledge goes to the most profound levels. So I&#x27;m grateful that he paid attention to this work. Uh speaking about uh Europe uh well I have a very good friend of mine professor Javani Modernza from the University of Bzana in Italy and from the beginning he gave theoretical explanations to all experimental results that we got and we published several articles together. He is a brilliant mathematician by the way and he is familiar with all um existing theories of gravitation. So he helped me to study many things also.</p>
<p>Uh at present he is considered number one in the field of quantum gravity. It&#x27;s a separate science. We&#x27;ll maybe discuss it a bit later. And uh uh if we speak about uh the attitude of common people and media uh the attitude of journalists was different. Uh some supported me, some were against.</p>
<p>Usually uh they could not have their own opinion because the subject is too difficult. But uh sometimes they asked for their opinion from the leading professors in Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford and depending on what they heard they gave their opinion. So some were for me, some were against me. Actually I forgive them all uh for those mistakes, technical mistakes that they made in their articles. But uh I&#x27;m grateful to them as they caused the interest to this problem.</p>
<p>Without this interest um it&#x27;s difficult to work. Common people. Common people are our neighbors. They are practically always honest, hardworking with open heart and they always welcomed me. I got a lot of letters and I continue to get a lot of letters, emails.</p>
<p>People want to go to other planets. They want to boldly go to where no one has gone before. And they somehow feel that this is the only way to fulfill their dreams. That&#x27;s why they supported me. That&#x27;s why I understand them.</p>
<p>They understand me. And I&#x27;m trying to surprise them even more. How gravity research is related to different aspects of modern physics. The base theory. A very difficult question.</p>
<p>uh not because it is difficult no I know all the answers but uh within the frame of our conversation I won&#x27;t be able to explain everything and to answer all the questions but uh let&#x27;s say that uh when working uh in the field of experimental gravity research when trying to build a gravity generator which is the heart of a Future future flying saucer made man flying saucer. Uh there are many aspects of physics that we should know in detail and take into consideration. That&#x27;s why I never work alone. I have a team of people who support me with a advice uh with their clear vision sometimes only in their field but that is quite enough. So uh there are people from different countries who support me.</p>
<p>Uh so in order to be uh successful in this field of course I had to study different approaches theoretical approaches to gravity. It was a very hard work. The subject itself is difficult. a lot of mathematics. Uh sometimes there are big contradictions between the theories but uh what seems to be important only combining uh various approaches various experimental approaches uh we can understand what is going on and somehow try to understand the mechanism of gravity.</p>
<p>uh uh there were different approaches in history. We know the works of Bifil Brown. I remember Tim Ventur also managed to build very interesting devices. So it was electrogravity. uh we know the works of uh John Hutcherson who used mainly electric fields in his laboratory.</p>
<p>Uh there were the works of uh uh professor deuina from Brazil where he used high frequency modulations and uh antennas in the form in the shape of tooid. Uh we have uh our own experiments with high temperature superconductors and all these experiments are based on the same principle. They use the ether. The term is uh not new. It appeared many centuries ago.</p>
<p>Modern physicists usually call it physical vacuum. And the idea is that uh the space even inside deep vacuum it&#x27;s not empty. It&#x27;s filled with very small subatomic particles. Uh these particles have very small some sometimes small sometimes a bit longer lifetime and uh our matter is born from these particles and then when it is deteriorated again it returns to to the state of these particles. uh some scientists uh still uh deny the idea of physical vacuum but I&#x27;m quite satisfied that the scientists in Russia accept this idea uh hell put accept this idea and many serious scientists also accept this including Isaac Newton who wrote more than 400 years ago that in his opinion The interaction between two bodies also celestial bodies without any intermediate matter or media between them is absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>So I believe him. I spent several weeks at the library of the British Museum uh studying the works of Newton in the original zerox copy of course but it was a nice experience I became much clever I hope uh if we speak about Einstein in his earlier works he accepts uh ether very well then for some time he rejected ed the idea and said that it was the vacuum was entirely empty. Then he came with the idea of space-time continum and returned back to the idea of ether because he explains gravity as bending of the space-time continum. But if there is emptiness inside there is nothing to bend. So without ether the explanation becomes impossible.</p>
<p>Now there is a certain uh interesting aspect in this field. Uh we know uh electric field, magnetic field uh strong field, weak field and gravitational field and so on. uh not so many fields but as we found in some old books translated from Sanskrit in India there are many types of fields uh the general they say about 36 fields including force fields biological fields we know only part of them [Music] There are some discussions in scientific literature about torsion fields. So torsion field is a field that is created by a rotating body. Uh the most uh intensive torsion fields can be obtain obtained with the rotation of metal bodies but practically every body when it is rotating at high speed produces torsion field.</p>
<p>Some people would say we have no proof but I have proof. I managed to build several installations. So uh this experiment can be easily reproduced at any university where people have a good vacuum chamber, a rotary pump, a high-speed motor which allows us to reach um 20 25,000 rotations per minute and a disc made according to our specifications. uh 5 years ago. It it was the last time when I reproduced this experiment in Czech Republic in Prague together with professor Yandra and so just demonstrated people that torsion fields exist.</p>
<p>Uh in Russia there is a whole theory of torsion fields produced by academician Akimov. uh but at the time when he was alive and he made his theory he had no experiment. Now we have the experiment and his theory can be easily proved and we use this theory to go on with our research because in many aspects in our opinion torsion fields are similar to gravity fields. Maybe not entirely similar but in many aspects they are uh so uh combining all this information that we have and uh also applying the knowledge of different uh areas uh in modern physics because uh when I work with um let&#x27;s say gravity generator. I need people who know solenoids, who know high temperature uh high voltage discharges, uh who know material science, uh cryogenics, uh thermodynamics, lots of things.</p>
<p>So combining all these and using different theories from Pov&#x27;s theory of energy fluctuations of vacuum plus uh Russian theory of torsion fields uh we can create really amazing things. Uh the breakthrough in our work came when we were first um rotating metal disc under the conditions of high vacuum with high speed. So we could show and measure and uh demonstrate to everyone the force field that it produces. Later we came and uh by the way on uh this principle was also used by German engineers during the second world war. They made uh flying discs.</p>
<p>[Music] So now we know their secret because u the drawings of their installations are available in Russia. they are available in the United States but they don&#x27;t know the secret. The secret is the unbalanced rotation. Uh I might return to this later if there is a certain interest. Uh now we decided not to use rotating objects because it&#x27;s bad for interstellar travel causes vibration and different effects.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not good. We decided to rotate magnetic fields and the rotation of magnetic fields creates the effect which is practically the same but uh can be much more intensive. So the levitation force of the device using rotating magnetic fields is at least 10 times more than with a disc. Uh if we speak about rotating magnetic fields, uh the interest to this problem was pretty big in the United Kingdom when professor Sorl published some of his results and at present there is a big difference big interest from China. Uh they have a certain group working with according to the technology of professor Sorl but using modern materials and they made some success under normal conditions.</p>
<p>So perhaps they would use it in space. Uh and again the secret uh of uh this uh solution to rotate uh magnets or to rotate magnetic fields. When we rotate magnets, we should create unbalanced rotation. That is the key to success. When we deal with rotating magnetic fields, we should use asymmetric configuration.</p>
<p>A symmetric configuration similar to a certain extent to what we have with bifel brown. And uh if there is no asymmetric configuration uh there is no disruption of the flow to tell you in well uh but I uh I don&#x27;t discuss this at present because otherwise I will tell you all my secrets and that would be a disaster. Uh, what else? Uh it seems that Newton and Einstein were the only people who were interested in gravity. The rest of the world prefers to use airplanes, trains and submarines and that is all. Uh except Elon Musk who is an outstanding person and I&#x27;m a great fan of his.</p>
<p>But uh the question is about uh Newton and Einstein. Uh so as I already mentioned u Newton was absolutely sure that uh there is there is some substance some thin substance that fills all the space around us and only interacting with that substance. All the planets and all the move and galaxies move and everything that we have in atomic structures is is born and so on. Uh uh also speaking about Newton, if we uh look at modern books, textbooks for school children and for students, we will see that when they formulate the law of Newton, they will say that according they say according to Newton, all objects that are thrown into the air have a tendency to fall down on the Earth because they attracted by the earth and that is not the case. Newton wrote not because but as if.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t you see that there is a big difference between because and as if. So the law of attraction is only our desire to explain how it all goes. Uh the mechanism of gravity u in many aspects still remains unknown. But uh there are many things and many characteristics of ether that we can use to our advantage and we can build flying vehicles and use them for the exploration of space and uh on the earth as well. Uh so I do not go against Newton in anything at all and uh people who usually accuse me of going against Newton.</p>
<p>They never studied the works of Newton in the original. So before accusing me, please uh go to the British library to the library of the British Museum, find the materials and then we can talk. Also uh British scientists are very conservative. So Professor Leateweight really greatest scientist of his time discovered a lot of nice things. They also accused him of going against him and he was fired from London Imperial College.</p>
<p>What can I say? Breits are breeds. No offense please. Uh now if we uh talk about Einstein I already answered that sometimes he was accepting earth or sometimes he was denying but all his theories prove or demand require the existence of the earth otherwise everything becomes nonsense. Also uh if we speak about uh general theory of relativity not special but general uh general theory of relativity describes relative motion that is motion of one object uh against another object. So what we are dealing with is rotating of the object around its own axis.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not relative motion. It&#x27;s absolute motion. And absolute motion cannot be described by the theory of relativity. It&#x27;s not applicable. Uh speaking about uh special theory of relativity, there are some [Music] uh let&#x27;s say points uh that Einstein took into consideration from the beginning.</p>
<p>He said let&#x27;s admit that the life of speed is constant. So on so there are several aspects there. Um if we follow these aspects there might be some contradictions. If we understand that the theory of special relativity is in great uh contradictions with quantum physics. uh then we again come to a conclusion that uh maybe this theory is not applicable to the structure and to the properties of ether.</p>
<p>Uh the speed of gravity is an interesting subject. Some people say that it is equal to the speed of light. Some people say that it is practically instant. In our experiments uh with pulse gravity generator, we found the speed of gravity to be equal to 64 C. It was a very serious work.</p>
<p>took several years of the work of my group and lots of my free time. Uh, we got the most um unique devices from Paris, from the we used atomic clock, we use some other devices. I&#x27;m grateful to the people who helped me with this and uh under normal conditions we made several experiments with very serious scientists, good physicists. I don&#x27;t consider myself to be a physicist. I&#x27;m a chemist.</p>
<p>So I&#x27;m allowed to make mistakes. They are not allowed to make mistakes. uh 64 C according to our measurements. At what stage we are let&#x27;s say that in order to study gravity to understand all small details and so on we need years and years of work that would be unacceptable entirely. Okay.</p>
<p>So, uh I spent 33 years working in this field. Uh me and the members of my team and all the scientists who are on our side of the barricade. Uh we now have tremendous knowledge. In fact, we collected the knowledge of different groups in different countries for the last 50 years. Also we studied many things that were made before that both in theoretical aspects and practical aspects.</p>
<p>Uh now we think that uh we are able to create a working prototype of a artificial gravity generator which will be the heart of the flying vehicle. This flying vehicle will be able to propel in normal atmosphere in space and underwater with the speeds exceeding all possible existing equipment on the earth. Uh the scientific stage of this experiment is practically completed. we have the existing technology and the knowledge how to build such devices. Uh we base our knowledge on the fact that uh in the laboratory uh we uh made tooidal solenoids of pretty complex winding pretty complex configuration.</p>
<p>uh they demonstrated the ability uh to levitate. And uh uh the point is that uh when we test these things in the laboratory, we work at the maximum possibility of the uh what of the wire can stand. We use copper and uh copper silver wire alloys. Uh but our device was able uh several times to levitate for only several seconds. Let&#x27;s say 15 seconds, 18 seconds, 22 23 maximum.</p>
<p>Then we had then the insulation uh was heated to to a big value and uh we had shortages in the circuits and uh the work of the whole year or two years was ruined because and our technicians were terribly disappointed because they worked very much. They showed it. But actually uh to organize the cooling of these systems to use another wire to use another configuration it&#x27;s absolutely possible. So uh the existence of the solid levitation and big values of levitation force we managed to get at the laboratory. So now we think it&#x27;s possible to go to a larger scale to attract people to create that artificial gravity generator.</p>
<p>If you speak uh how to understand how all this works let&#x27;s say that when we are rotating magnetic fields uh under certain configuration and combination of these fields uh we can obtain uh the vector of electric field and the vector of magnetic field which are usually at 90°. we can make them coincide. They go in one direction. So this is important. Second thing uh important that uh we should use the frequencies uh that are close to uh terraertz radiation.</p>
<p>And um we should also use uh um what we call it uh a symmetric configuration. The combination of these parameters give us a possibility to create small tornadoes or vortexes in the ether. And uh these vortexes first of all penetrate everything but they uh at initial stage they go slightly over the surface of the device or the surface of the windings of our solenoids. Um as soon as uh the whole installation is covered with these fields uh and we can control these fields and direct them to any direction in space that we want. Uh we get a levitation force.</p>
<p>So our cruel uh device is going up and it brings that field that&#x27;s small field let&#x27;s say 5 10 mm even slower if it is 1 mm it&#x27;s quite enough. Uh so the device brings this field with it and it continues to go up because this uh small layer means that we have a kind of gravitational [Music] well and our device is moving in this well. So as if falling on the bottom of this well which we observe as the device flying up in the atmosphere with a big speed. So that&#x27;s how we imagine it. Uh speaking about the difficulties in this field, practically I never got any funding to organize this work.</p>
<p>So this all these years I was organizing this work uh using my own resources which are absolutely limited. I am um not rich at all or penny less whatever you choose. uh and using the laboratories at different universities, the experience of other groups, the help of many people, common people, scientists, uh just good honest people. So if uh we find a possibility to invest good money into this project, the result is guaranteed and we can reach amazing heights in this field. I&#x27;m absolutely sure.</p>
<p>So uh as I said uh the scientific stage of this experiment is over. It is successfully completed. we go to the engineering stage. uh but you can imagine that it&#x27;s a very serious work which requires the help or joint work of physicist uh expert in chemistry, material science uh experts in avionics uh uh people with good mathematical abilities, computers because uh there is no one we can ask for an advice. It&#x27;s an entirely new pioneering field and uh we clearly understand that um the expenses will be pretty big.</p>
<p>If we speak about let&#x27;s say boring 747 and we want to increase slightly the length and uh to increase the uh power of the engines uh and just to put eight or six rows of passengers inside to make it slightly bigger. Planning all this, calculating and making the first plane will take 2003 300 million US only this thing and we are dealing with a new technology which is much more complicated. So uh we&#x27;re looking for wise investors. I don&#x27;t want to use uh this side for attracting people. But hopefully this is the only rational decision if people really want to conquer space and to go to Mars and other planets.</p>
<p>In our opinion, it&#x27;s the only solution artificial intelligence. It&#x27;s the topic which is now overwhelming and feeling all the internet. Uh sometimes people ask artificial intelligence different questions. They get good answers, sometimes very detailed answers that can help people. In our case, uh the lack of knowledge, the lack of data uh doesn&#x27;t allow our friend artificial intelligence to create the device and to give us the advice in what field to propagate.</p>
<p>But at the same time uh you can see the cities of the future uh built by artificial intelligence. There are many nice films uh on the internet and uh there are different vehicles flying or hovering there. But how they do it? Uh it is assumed that they have either anti-gravity technology or artificial gravity. I prefer the term artificial gravity. How to make this? Uh this task was left to us.</p>
<p>So we will try to fulfill the needs and the expectations of common people. Uh the future of the world if well the future of the world will definitely change because uh instead of the planes there will be flying discs all over the earth. These flying discs will go to the moon to the Mars to other planets. Uh they have certain advantages over the existing fleet because they produce no noise, they produce no heat uh pollution, they produce no radioactive pollution, they have no toxic exhaust gases. So they are really what our civilization is hoping for.</p>
<p>Uh they will be pretty reliable and uh rather cheap as compared to all current methods of transportation. And uh uh finally I would like to uh express my sincere gratitude to Tim Ventura who is an outstanding person, very kind person, attentive um thinking uh for his uh tremendous work in this field because American anti-gravity is known all over the world. This is the site I should say at the sharpest end of modern physics and the team makes really a great um uh conference organizes this conference and so all the people can share their opinion on different aspects of modern physics. And uh I watch this these presentations. They help us in many aspects and without the common efforts of the scientists all our progress would be impossible.</p>
<p>So thank you team for being the best of the best. And as always, may the force be with you. I also think it would be interesting for our viewers uh to find the books which I uh use every day in my work. uh and which each of these books uh gives a grain of knowledge and by collecting all these grains will make a nice poetry. So first of all uh the book by Paul Lavlet uh secrets of anti-gravity propulsion it&#x27;s pretty thick very clever we discussed many aspects of antiggravity propulsion with Paul he was a very good friend of mine and he passed away that was terrible hit for me.</p>
<p>So uh also Paul found uh published a book which is called subquantum kinetics and in this book he gives the equations uh which describe the ether the ether or physical vacuum because the ether can be more dense less dense it can be polarized It can be organized in such a way that there are uh different vortexes in it. Because the main idea of gravity propulsion is uh the sentence which comes from very old books. Swirl and you shall and you should and you shall levitate. Swirl and you shall levitate. Uh I also uh use sometimes the approaches of Nicola Tesla.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s a nice book by Tesla. Sometimes I uh try to understand how ether works and I&#x27;m not afraid to look into the books which are not textbooks but which have some deep knowledge inside like this one for example or called ether physics also speaking about gravitation we should definitely know the classical approach to gravitation because without it the understanding of all the other things would be impossible. So there is a small book called gravitation but a very good one. Uh among theories of gravitation uh uh there are many popular books. Um so uh sometimes they are very useful.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are very good ideas there and the writers who wrote these books they&#x27;re mainly journalists. They do not understand how precious this work is. So, uh there is a book called UFOs and anti-gravity piece for a jigsaw. Pretty thick. I also use it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not bad. Then there is a book man-made UFOs. And here we have what we inherited from German engineers during the Second World War. Again, it&#x27;s a lot of material and it&#x27;s all useful. And uh uh there are uh books that are at the border of series and not series.</p>
<p>Uh and again very useful like uh this one and uh finally uh every scientist has some complimentary material that helps him to achieve give good results. And I also have this, it&#x27;s called the anti-gravity handbook. Lots of good ideas. There are many other books, articles, ancient manuscripts and what I am also collecting these are the conversations with my colleagues all over the world. We want to make it a better place and we will succeed.</p>
