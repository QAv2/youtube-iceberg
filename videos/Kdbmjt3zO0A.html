            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel where we look at um theories of everything all-encompassing theories um contributions from uh crackpots their Magnum opuses and um their life lifetime accomplishments and uh we try to put them into context and um see how you and and me can um benefit from these things and uh how we can make sense of them and um you know put them into a paradigm shift today is our 356th video on dwey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory Mr Larson lived in the 20th century and died in 1990 he uh left behind a a bunch of books and articles and an organization uh structure and a few people that were willing to um extend his work revise slightly and U Move try to move it forward uh the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe that is made entirely of motion uh not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy or force all three of those things are actually merely varieties of motion as is every other scientific quantity that you can name uh they are all uh forms of motion and motion is characterized as the by Larson as the relationship between space and time so all of these different scientific quantities are fractions with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator the relationship in both cases of time to space or space to time is motion and when Larsson refers to motion he&#x27;s generally referring to what he calls scalar motion and a scalar motion is a uh motion that is distinguished from like a vectorial motion uh that is motion in a specific Direction a scalar motion is a motion that does not have a specific Direction the way you would visualize this is by taking a balloon and putting a bunch of dots on it when you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other the farther away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction um and that is a scalar motion that&#x27;s a scalar Motion in space space itself is expanding all of the dots are moving away from each other farther and farther and farther apart um but again no specific Direction until you assign a reference point when you arbitrarily determine that one of the D is motionless then you can begin to start measuring the directions of those different motions but that is an illusion that comes out of uh the assignment of a reference point it&#x27;s not an inherent qual quality of the motion itself the motion itself has no direction and uh this is also seen in what in the clock in time in terms of time the clock is always getting later and later and later but it&#x27;s not moving in a specific Direction it&#x27;s just getting later and uh so Larson refers to this as clock time and clock space so clock space is the movement of the dots um in all directions and just to point out that that applies not only to the dots but it applies to the spaces between the dots they are all moving away from each other as well it&#x27;s the fabric of space itself that&#x27;s moving apart or expanding but it also works in the other direction as well uh if you suck in the balloon all of the dots are moving toward each other that is a scalar motion as well now uh another prong of this is uh really coming from larsson&#x27;s first postulate he had two fundamental postulates that he put out in the late 1950s after many many years of kind of ironing it out and um then he took his two fundamental postulates and from them he derived a theoretical Universe how that universe would look if these two postulates were correct so the first postulate is you know the universe is made out of motion um which he originally called space time but then he began to call it motion instead and motion is a relationship between space and time and uh space and time have their coordinate aspects uh their clock aspects and their coordinate aspects now coordinate space and coordinate time is another aspect and that basically means three dimensionality uh we understand clock uh coordinate space XYZ coordinates or volume we understand three dimensions of space but there are also three dimensions of time um merely because time and space are reciprocals of each other um just to refresh your memory in case your math is Rusty uh you know the reciprocal of three is 1/3 3 over 1 or 1 over3 you&#x27;re basically inverting a fraction um and when you multiply two reciprocals they multiply out to be one and um all reciprocals have the same qualities but they have them kind of in a different order you know in this case three and one you know in the case of the first number it&#x27;s three over one and in the case of the second number it&#x27;s 1 over three so they have the same qualities and so too with time and space um so if space has a certain quality time also has that quality uh even though we might not be able to see it so clearly like for example clock space and clock time we&#x27;re pretty comfortable with the clock the concept of clock time time always getting later and later and later but clock space is uh more unfamiliar concept but it it stems from there being clock time and so too with coordinate space we&#x27;re comfortable with that concept of three-dimensional space but it also applies to time clock time I mean coordinate time uh time also has three dimensions under certain C circumstances and then um time and space also come in discrete units only they are um there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time and you have to have a full unit before you have anything if you don&#x27;t have that full unit of space or time then you don&#x27;t have space or time and um for for space that unit is approximately 4.56 * 10us 8 m um or about 500,000 of an inch and then for time it is 1.52 * 10 the minus 16 seconds so uh you would end up having um trillions of them quadrillions of them in just one second and these are discrete units so uh it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s continuity in this universe uh there are um discret frames but there are so many of them and they&#x27;re coming by so quickly that uh you don&#x27;t notice in the same way that you won&#x27;t notice that is uh that em motion picture is a bunch of still frames um flashed before your eyes all in a rapid succession it looks like it&#x27;s continuous but it isn&#x27;t and uh if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time space over time it being a fraction so therefore it&#x27;s a motion and in the case of space over time space over time is speed the car is moving at 15 miles per hour 15 miles of space and one hour of time if you have one unit of space in one unit of of time you have the speed of light and um Larson refers to that as unit speed 1 over 1 equals 1 and this unit speed in the universe of motion is the background or the state of rest or The Ether the origin the reference point or the uh calls it the progression of the natural reference system this is the background of the um Universe of motion which makes sense if you have a universe of motion you have motion before you have anything else motion precedes everything and um then from that motion you are either going faster or slower that would be a displacement from a up or down um and you basically have uh a number line or a scale so one is at the center as it is in all reciprocals as I mentioned all reciprocals when you multiply them together you get one so this is a multiplicative system not an additive system you know with Legacy science you start from zero and you go + one -1 + 2 - two or whatever in the reciprocal system you start at one and if you go plus you go to two but if you go minus you go to 1/2 if you go plus two you go all the way to three if you go minus two you go all the way to 13 and so on and so forth so they balance each other out by multiplying to one and if you go in the direction of you know one 1 2 3 four five that&#x27;s the positive direction then you&#x27;re moving faster than the speed of light if you&#x27;re going in the negative Direction then you&#x27;re moving slower than the speed of light so lson says that the speed of light is a boundary of the universe and that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light half is moving slower than the speed of light you&#x27;re your first of these as the cosmic sector and the material sector respectively we reside in the material sector um this is where we have our coordinate space and our clock time but if we crossed over that boundary and moved into the cosmic sector we would have to invert uh the roles of space and time so if we cross over to the cosmic sector past the speed of light and we move to the faster than speed of light area sect sector or the cosmic sector we would experience coordinate coordinate time and clock space three-dimensional time with space always getting farther and farther and farther apart so that&#x27;s kind of how it works um now um he then had the second fun met Al postulate which is basically not as important as the first but it just goes that the universes um follows the rules of ordinary commutative mathematics its uh primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian now we went through a paper uh a couple weeks ago written by Dr Bruce pet um that kind of took Larson to task on that second postulate in particular and got rid of a few of the terms there um and he prefers to say the universe is um the universe follows the uh rules of ordinary mathematics it&#x27;s magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is projective so he gets rid of the projective geometry for ukian geometry um so you might want to look at that uh paper um if you um if you&#x27;re wanting to know about the postulates now today we&#x27;re looking at another paper from Bruce pret uh he has them numbered rs2 101 102 103 104 we&#x27;re at number 107 today it&#x27;s called Mass and gravity rs2 is the our reciprocal system 2 the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system that Dr pet did along with Dr kvk Neu um who kind of teamed up on um some revisions of the reciprocal system that uh maintain the spirit of the reciprocal system and the you know the basic ideas but uh Revis some of Larson&#x27;s deductions and um what she Larsson admitted that he was fallible uh in those areas and so this paper here is called mass and gravity it starts with the background as discussed in the last paper RS 2106 which is called dimensions and displacements which we did just before this Larson refers to units of motion that comprise the two aspects of a scalar Dimension speed uh which is s overt um from 0 to one and energy which is t/ s which is from 1 to Infinity so greater or less than unit speed or unit energy either way unit that&#x27;s 1 over one so he&#x27;s really referring to the material sector and the cosmic sector three dimensions with two aspects resulted in six units of motion which he then splits in half to create the three speed ranges for the material and Cosmic sectors so in both the material and and the cosmic sector you have three speed ranges which you calls low um or um low intermediate and Ultra designated as one minus X low speed 2 - x intermediate speed and 3 - x ultra high speed the range number defines the maximum unit of Motion 1 to or three and the minus X some fraction thereof you know so 2-2 or 2 - 1/3 2 -4 and so on speed ranges are discussed in more detail in the universe of motion which is Larson&#x27;s book on astronomy as an explanation of the inverse density gradient of white dwarf stars which comes from the intermediate speed level and the anti-gravity motion of quazars and pulsars which comes from the ultra highspeed level the third level with both motions taking place in equivalent space instead of the normal space of our reference system equivalent space is the time equivalent of space um or the space equivalent of time um we don&#x27;t see time we only see space so if something is occurring in time we see it in space but we see the inverse of it in space because space and time are inverses and so if something occur so this is basically your white dwarf star a white white dwarf star is a star that is exploding uh at faster than the speed of light so when it explodes uh faster than the speed of light into the intermediate speed range it um is exploding in time not in space and when something is exploding in time we don&#x27;t see time we only see space and so so we see something exploding in time as something imploding in space because that&#x27;s the inverse and when we see something imploding its space it looks like a white dwarf star very very small and very very dense so um the ant uh speed ranges are discussed in Universe okay um the reason being that not that only a single scalar Dimension can be completely expressed in the reference system again this is from his paper from uh the other day that um there are there require three dimensions of space to describe one dimension of motion of scalar motion so there are three dimensions of scalar motion so we are not able to actually perceive all of the dimensions of scalar motion we only really can perceive one at a time here he says the reason being that only a single scalar Dimension can be completely expressed in the reference system with the other two Dimensions modifying the expression of that coordinate information via equivalent space so when a star is exploding uh into time we see the star in space and we see it&#x27;s modifying uh motion which is the implosion in equivalent space so when we go beyond the speed of light then we start seeing in both space and equivalent space but we don&#x27;t see the whole motion we&#x27;re just seeing a it as a modification of an already existing motion this is at variance with the equivalent space concept used at the particle and chemical levels discuss just in larsson&#x27;s book nothing but motion which is generally on Atomic physics where equivalent space is treated as the spatial expression of temporal motion granted this does work for the second unit of motion the energy but does not work for the third speed in a second dimension because the third part of motion is already space and therefore cannot be an equivalent space at the same time um now just to uh make it very clear to you um this is all quite confusing to me as well so um I&#x27;m just trying to uh write it out and go along with it um I don&#x27;t uh there&#x27;s a few things here that I&#x27;m very puzzled by uh but um that&#x27;s kind of how you have to work with the reciprocal system you have to accept the fact that you&#x27;re going to be puzzled and that you it it probably will work it itself out eventually but uh in the short term you know it might be a struggle in Gustav Leon&#x27;s book of the evolution of forces which came out in 1908 he discusses the difference between mass and weight as they were interpreted by the 19th century researchers conventional science treats mass as Force divided by acceleration typically the acceleration of gravity the older approach is to treat mass as weight divided by velocity um so Mass um yeah it&#x27;s force over acceleration um that is uh t/ s to the 2 power and that is divided by S over t to the second power which which is acceleration uh that totals out to be T the 3 power over s the 3 power but in the more uh older approach or with the more modern approach you have um uh with the older approach we have weight over velocity and here he&#x27;s saying that weight is uh t to the 2 power over s to the second power and that is divided by space over time and that is also T the 3 power over s the 3 power which is mass so that may or may not be of any importance at this point the older definition is actually closer to the reciprocal system atomic model because particles and atoms are defined by magnetic and electric rotations an angular velocity in larsson&#x27;s ABC displacement notation the A and the B magnetic double rotations have the dimensions of t T / s * T the s t s equals t t 2 power s the 2 power the same units leban refers to as weight the electric rotation is an inverse spatial angular velocity s overt matching the velocity component the older definition of mass precis precisely matches the a b c displacement structure of particles and atoms used by Larson um Mass equals magnetic uh rotation uh over electric rotation um yeah t/ s uh the quanti a^ 2/ s/ T in the reciprocal system the concept of mass is mathematically determined by the net temporal displacement of the atom its angular velocity in time the magnetic rotation therefore accounts for the primary mass of any particle or atom which is then slightly Modified by the electric rotation in equivalent time the time equivalent of space being the reciprocal concept of equivalent space now I don&#x27;t quite get that either because I&#x27;m under the impression that we&#x27;re using equivalent space because we don&#x27;t see time we only see space and so if something is occurring in time we perceive it it really is occurring in time but we perceive it in space as the equivalent of that by the inverse postulate but I don&#x27;t see why we would need a concept of equivalent time because we don&#x27;t see time so anyway but maybe it is that we do see time in the material sector within the time region um which is the region of less than one unit of space um anyway that is where we&#x27;re going to sum it up right here uh the next section of this article is called gravity of the situation and so we will go into uh you know his discussion of gravity um being not entirely satisfied with this discussion of M pass I have to say but uh again that is kind of the nature of working with the reciprocal system is that uh you need to be able to suspend disbelief and just let the uh information wash over you and uh decide at a later Point whether to accept it or reject it but not before you&#x27;ve seen the whole picture and um you know that&#x27;s where I am with Larson still is I I really U you know believe in his his Concepts and how it how it works the system itself the Simplicity of it but um applying it is a different matter and sometimes the applications are rather strained and so it&#x27;s hard to figure out uh you know the full picture that&#x27;s why we need like thousands of people working on this okay um hopefully you&#x27;re not too confused and that you come back tomorrow to listen to the rest of this article and uh thanks for tuning in today have a great day</p>
