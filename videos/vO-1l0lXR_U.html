            <p>[Music] The remarkable works of Canadian inventor John Hutcherson has drawn widespread attention from businessmen and government scientists since 1979 when he began using ultra high electromagnetic frequencies to transform matter in some very unusual ways. It has come to be known as the Hutcherson effect. The objects you&#x27;re seeing um moving there is a form of levitation by uh translational movement meaning that the objects become lighter and can float around. The heaviest being the barium cylinder that you see there um with the two wires coming out of it tends to slide around on 7 lb of its own weight. Physics of it is a self-ressonation of what they call a ferroagnetic and piso electric barium type name uh through a power amplifier and broad and narrow bands of electrical energy going into this crystal.</p>
<p>So the applications of this in advanced applications using free energy or 0 point energy to power it would be in uh propulsion technologies. This is a crystal converter unit that I made about a year ago to see if the principle worked and indeed it seems to work to this day. Um the principles involve the casmir effect and uh space charge type of barrier technology in semiconductors and um a jitter activity called zero point energy that goes through time and space. The idea is to get the material inside this to interface with the jittering action of zero point energy. And moving on to what they may look like inside.</p>
<p>I actually bring out a piece here of this material of common minerals and that produced in a special way. And I take a reading here and I should be getting a higher reading. I had a hot spot somewhere around here. I have here almost a half a bolt as you can see. As one can see, there&#x27;s no batteries in this or anything else except this crystalline material with different uh configurations and this is a steady state.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s always that and has been tested up to a year&#x27;s time and under stress tests also. So, which made me decide to then of course mount the same material in cylinders. Different cylinders of course are different mixes in there. And I found that uh that some of the cylinders are not as powerful as this material here or this very tiny one here. Actually, this has more power than this large artillery shell unit here.</p>
<p>And what I want to do of course is to um demonstrate it in the sense of it making actual power. That means to turn a small motor. Okay. I&#x27;m attaching this to the base here. Another lead to the top and it should spin which it does.</p>
<p>So you have basically this kind of material powering motors. Of course, a very small motor at this time, but scaled up in larger amounts of of material can power up to uh several horsepower if needed. Hutcherson hopes his simple shake and bake method of producing these crystal energy converters will attract investors who can see the potential of permanent batteries which never need charging, non-toxic that will interface with zero point energy of space and time. Hutcherson&#x27;s more dramatic experiments border on the paranormal and have generated more than just a passing interest from US military research labs. We&#x27;ve had about 750 demonstrations of levitations translational movements uh metallurgical samples falling apart uh changing into transmuted unknown metals.</p>
<p>uh quite a variety of obscure types of effects, wood impregnated into uh metals, other objects in metals, uh monopolar uh magnetic fields written up in many journals. Um quite a host or a Pandora&#x27;s box of different types of effects on the outer edge of of the scientific uh community. In this remarkable series of video clips shot by Hutcherson, we see what happens when he fine-tunes the electromagnetic frequencies aimed at target objects in his garage. [Music] [Applause] [Music] on the subatomic level. And I feel that there is a a dimension shift activated by very conventional electrostatics, RF fields that I use and Tesla waves that I use that actually form a keyway that opens up another area of time and space that may activate the zero point energy fields and interventional reactions let&#x27;s say to gravitational waves and time waves or kronons.</p>
<p>if you wish. Perhaps we&#x27;re dealing in chronons and gravitons which are maybe particles and somehow causing a distortion which causes objects to simply break apart or pulsate in the center uh of stainless steel bars and fall apart or it could become weightless. [Music] here. Ice cream in a plastic cup. [Music] and finally a 70 lb cannonball.</p>
<p>[Music] Oh [Music] What is interesting and also frustrating about his invention is that he&#x27;s using a combination of Tesla coil and vandagramraph to produce a very disruptive and lifting experiments which in one case for example actually lifts a 19lb bushing uh toward the ceiling just from electromagnetic fields. Now, when we analyze that, we find that there&#x27;s position versus time graph that we can plot and also the velocity versus time. But when we actually analyze the um acceleration versus time, it&#x27;s an increasing straight line. So we&#x27;re forced as scientists to admit that we have a third derivative effect which um for my mind actually lends itself to an anomalous new force which I call hyperforce uh because we have to take a derivative of that to finally get a flat straight line a constantly increasing acceleration. So the Hutchinson effect has been used as a benchmark for a comparison to many other high voltage propulsion devices.</p>
