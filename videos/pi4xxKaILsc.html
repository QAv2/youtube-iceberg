            <p>hello YouTube my name is Alex and today I want to talk to you about one of the most misunderstood and greatest men in all of science and he is not very one though his name is Thomas Townsend Brown and he invented a practical way to understand the link between electricity and gravitation and the the the apparatus he produced of course he produced many apparatus over his lifetime but the one I&#x27;d like to talk about today is his electrogravitic thrust producing apparatus and that&#x27;s just a fancy way of saying it turns electricity into force and it does so without the use of ions now if you look up Thomas Townsend Brown the Byfield Brown effect or ionic craft you basically see an asymmetrical capacitor which uses balsa wood and styrofoam and often aluminium foil in the creation of electric wind which is a fully ion driven force and his force was trying to isolate the gravity component and eliminate the ion component of the force production which is what makes his work really unique and there&#x27;s just not any information out there hardly on this subject you can find information in his three published laboratory notebooks available on rex research calm which is where i&#x27;ve found the information i use to produce this and i made a video about this a few months back this is an electro druidic thruster producing apparatus sorry one of the electrodes was backwards it has three elements unlike a normal capacitor which is on the made of two he found that the asymmetry of three electrodes actually aided in the process of producing this effect and in my further videos where I&#x27;ll talk about Wilhelm Reich and others will find that this is a recurring theme using capacitors using high voltage and using three elements is a recurring theme in a lot of people&#x27;s work who were exploring alternative energy systems subtle energy etc so getting - his apparatus is produced in three parts we have the innermost electrode which is spherical we have the middle electrode which is porous and we have the upper electrode which just has a large surface area and is a canopy shape now the middle electrode is also a canopy shape the reason it&#x27;s porous is because we want to aid in the production of a corona from this metal electrode and I know that sounds suspiciously like an ionic craft because a corona basically means the production of copious amounts of ions around this central electrode but it was found that these thin wire electrodes in the center worked even in vacuum in fact better in vacuum and worked when they were completely encapsulated in dielectrics so the whole point of his research was to find that link between gravity and electricity and using an apparatus very similar to this he was able to do that when I tested this apparatus I used various different power sources and I was only able to get force production using an electrostatic power source which is a very interesting phenomenon because I used ACDC from a variety of sources very high voltage and in a very similar setup to when I used the Wimshurst generator but only the Wimshurst electrostatic machines seem to produce this effect for me and I wanted to produce a video basically talking about this guy his his life and how misunderstood he was so in college he I had a professor called dr. by field who suggested to him that a capacitor was the ultimate way to interrelate gravity and electricity and he pursued this for the rest of his life he joined the Navy when he was pretty young and donated his entire electrogravitic laboratory to the US Navy at the same time once the Navy really got a good look at what he was doing in this laboratory they pulled him out of the typical Navy duties he was stationed on a submarine if I&#x27;m not mistaken and they put him to work in the black projects from what information is available in all to further his research on this topic this is one of the reasons it&#x27;s extremely difficult to replicate his work because he had very very good funding and a lot of time and experts around him to help him produce these effects to isolate the ideal power sources circuitry etc and this stuff does not find its way into most of his laboratory notebooks but we do know from his laboratory notebooks we have a general idea of where his head was at and he produced some absolutely incredible things in a previous video I also talked about how he produced electricity from rocks and I have a circuit diagram here which shows how he created a high voltage bias across rocks and barium titanate capacitors in order to get readings out of the rocks themselves to see what was going on in the gravity wave field he discovered that gravity was actually being transmitted in waves and it fluctuated diurnal meaning that during the day time it had you know a jump and during night time it decreased these gravity wave intensities and there&#x27;s actually after that you could see here when you use barium titanate and granite to map out the self potential it&#x27;s called of these different materials and thereby he was able to map out the gravity wave phenomena not too long ago Nobel Prize was given to three gentlemen who claimed to have discovered the gravity wave but Thomas Townsend Brown was doing this over 50 years ago so he was a pioneer and an amazing man and although my electrogravitic throat thrust producing apparatus is not producing enough for us to move the whole apparatus as a whole it is producing enough movement to continue my research in this field and like I said it is a very difficult and expensive thing to read serge siou progress is slow but i wanted to talk a little bit about his work into electro hydro dynamics as well so electro hydrodynamics is the movement of fluid or other material using electricity and this is directly related to his work with electrogravitics and one of the apparatus which he produced for this purpose was shown here this is on the Thomas Townsend Brown family website library and he biased to rotating members one with high voltage positive the other with negative and he was able to increase the flow drastically of air coming from between these two and the reason this is related to his electrolytic thrust is not because of the ion wind phenomenon as many think but actually it&#x27;s related to the divergence and convergence of electrostatic fields that is actually what this design is based to do it&#x27;s it creates a divergence towards one electrode a convergence towards the other of the electrostatic field and forms the electrostatic field in a more or less hyperbolic manner which when you do that because that&#x27;s not typically done in nature it creates unstable forces and gravity it was found to be related to that phenomenon itself and so I just wanted to produce this video and briefly talk about his work explain my apparatus from my other video on my channel and i really suggest you look into him further read his laboratory notebooks and this guy was really incredible so thank you for your time and go ahead and like subscribe and comment below</p>
