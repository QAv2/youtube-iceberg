            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>so after my first video in pursuit of anti-gravity part one I got a visit from the Men in Black sedans and helicopters who informed me that I must never make a part two okay so that&#x27;s not entirely true although I&#x27;m pretty confident I&#x27;m already on a number of government watch lists but I haven&#x27;t scored a bingo yet at least not that I know of however after posting that video I did have an old friend get intrigued by the research now like many of you guys he too had fooled around with these lifters 20 or 30 years ago and at that time he just concluded like so many of us did that the lifters worked because of ionic wind now that&#x27;s neat that is super cool I mean hey to build a drone that flies effectively silently that would be pretty cool it certainly has its place but he put it aside as a curiosity now watching my video he too went back to ask an awful lot of questions for which he didn&#x27;t have answers because he was an old friend and because he was interested we dialogued extensively and I shared with him so much more about the discoveries I&#x27;d made that I alluded to in that first video but did not say I was trying to walk everyone through the process of the discovery I had had right you know what I learned how and why and I had every intention of continuing on with that and explaining all of these other probably dozens of little points of discovery of which most of them were discovered by accident so he started conducting research as well both trying to replicate my experiments and he did some brilliant thinking out of the box and came up with even more experiments that were really complementary to my research and at the same time we were making all of these fascinating discoveries and observing often bizarre effects that I still cannot explain we kept joking that we could write an entire issue if the Journal of irreproducible results just from our research it was a continuous string of bizarre and unexplainable effects and observations however commercial applications of our discoveries quickly became evident and we had been funding This research out of our own pockets of course so my friend who shall remain nameless for the moment went to the owner of the business for which he does a lot of research and development and the owner and that business and that country shall remain nameless for the moment before you knew it we had Financial backing to pursue all of this research that of course meant I had to stop talking about it so now here we are almost two years after I posted that video in pursuit of anti-gravity part one I am proud to say we now have a patent pending as a direct result of that research and that patent is probably only the first of many because as I&#x27;m about to carefully share this went in so many directions that I did not expect in almost every single one of those directions had immediate commercial value also in the meantime you guys pumped up the viewership of that video to where it&#x27;s currently at what around 11 000 views and a whole pile of fascinating comments and questions some of which which I wish to answer and discuss in this video so please be patient with my tempered responses as you&#x27;ll understand I&#x27;m walking a fine line here of sharing as much as I can with these guys without giving away trade secrets that a company just spent a whole pile of money on to support us in obtaining through what has been incredibly fun and fascinating research and if the patent goes through and we can develop commercial products then we&#x27;ll have more funding with which to pursue the other lines of research for example at the time of making that video I was also simultaneously pursuing several lines of research that were related to the lifters and potential anti-gravity for example I am still working on a solid state gravity detector now the implications of such a device are huge several years ago I tried my hand at mapping gravitational anomalies across 1800 kilometers of Ontario here in Canada and I learned pretty quickly just how difficult it was to measure variations in gravity it could be done but it was tricky because the variations were just so small so now when it comes to research where I&#x27;m potentially generating a gravity field or gravity well the ability to measure Point gravity is really useful for example I can now you know map the shape of a of a gravity field and get a solid measurement on the effects of changes to the gravity generator right or he used such a detector for a feedback loop on a Half-Life 2 gravity gun or whatever you know the industrial commercial and scientific applications are endless and such a sensor would be invaluable if you are trying to generate a gravity or anti-gravity field now Andres pareda I hope I said your name right sorry if I didn&#x27;t posted a very good question about the dielectric taking lessons from a capacitor he suggested that if you swap out the dielectric for something with a higher K Factor would that increase the force generated by an asymmetric capacitor excellent question Andres and this was a huge Avenue of research I had already followed before my friend got involved in fact TT Brown emphasized this over and over again in his papers as a major line of research towards developing this anti-gravity or electrogravidics so that everyone understands what we&#x27;re talking about remembering that a capacitor it&#x27;s an electronic component which is simply two plates separated by an insulator in electronics these two plates are virtually identical in size in our gravity generator the whole point of Discovery here was TT Brown as a 16 year old boy discovered that if you have a capacitor with one plate smaller than the other in surface area it&#x27;s asymmetric and if you charge it with a high voltage it produces this mystery force in the direction of the smaller plate so the insulator and the capacitor can be just about anything that insulates and in the case of my experiments with the the lifter I was using air as the dielectric all insulators have a dielectric constant represented by the letter K air has a dielectric K of about one and if you look at this chart produced by Honeywell you can see the K values of hundreds of materials interestingly water has a very high K value but as you can see most materials have a k of two to five typically some have very high K values in the 20s or even 59 which is very considered very high so if I make a capacitor that has an insulator and say it has a capacitance of 10 microfarads and I replace the air with ABS plastic which has a k of around two or twice died of air I will literally double the capacitance of the capacitor merely by swapping out the insulator so if I were to use say acetamide which at room temperature has a k of over 40 . that same capacitor will have a capacitance of over 400 microfarads so Andres proposed that by using a different dielectric in the asymmetric capacitor will it also increase the thrust the short answer is yes but it gets really complicated really quick and this is where I had already put in a pile of research because you can easily get materials which have a very high K value titanium oxide or titanium dioxide for example which typically have K values approaching 100 and where do you get titanium oxide it&#x27;s the most common white pigment used in paint and cosmetics so literally go down to your hardware store and spray paint your asymmetric capacitor with white paint and you have just added a very high dielectric to the mix add dozens of coats and each coat increases the thickness of the dielectric now then you have materials like barium titanate with a K value over seven thousand or calcium copper titanate which has K values of over ten thousand now the problem with these materials they&#x27;re they&#x27;re ceramics so to apply them to your lifter you have to fire them at extremely high temperatures or bind them with a glue of some sort using the glue drastically reduces the K value because your glues always have a low K value and now you&#x27;re mixing materials of extremely different K values together right however I came across this research paper from 1929 where they were getting K values of 18 000 from Rochelle salt crystals now Rochelle Soul crystals are easily grown as a matter of fact a lot of homeschoolers use them as a science fair project because you can use materials found in your kitchen cream of tartar and baking soda you can grow these crystals easily in your home lab the crystals are especially fun because they are also Piezo electric so if you you know tap them they generate electricity and you can even generate electric Sparks in a dark room if you hit them hard so don&#x27;t get me started on the rabbit trails with the Piezo electrics cost more more rabbit Trails however this brings me to a couple of other comments you guys made so the Truman zoo and the human race both suggested experimenting with shaping of the electrodes in the asymmetric capacitor which I had already experimented with and many many of these guys making these lifters had also experimented with so I will simply defer to what others on JL Ed Labs reported for example my research was inspired by Dr Paul laviolette&#x27;s comments on the B2 stealth bomber and specifically its shape but not just the shape of the electrodes but the shape of the dielectric as well so this is what led us to researching how to make complex shapes with these complex dielectrics for example in that 1929 paper on the Rochelle salt crystals you&#x27;ll notice that they cut the crystals along different axes and found that the K value changed drastically depending on which axis you cut then there&#x27;s the question of do you polarize it while the crystal is growing does it retain its polarity over time does the polarity have an effect on the force generated by the asymmetric capacitor so we developed several ways of creating shaped dielectrics and even polarizing them while they were created which I won&#x27;t share the technical details of here nor the results of our research except for one point which we discovered the hard way with the Rochelle salts it&#x27;s true the K value was through the roof I made an experimental capacitor where you could easily swap out the dielectric to measure the K value of different materials the Rochelle salts produce capacitance values that force me to modify my test bed because the values were literally off the scale I would zero the scale using air as a dielectric and then I couldn&#x27;t measure the dielectric of the Rochelle Soul crystals because it was too high but the real problem surfaced in that we discovered that the Rochelle salt crystals effectively made a zener diode with a very low threshold voltage now I forget it was like two and a half volts or three volts or something um so what would happen is it would clamp our voltage and we couldn&#x27;t apply high voltage across our lifter that we needed for our Thruster to work but here we go again with offshoot research that I have to be careful what I share because we developed ways of Rapid crystal growth and shaping this could be applied to Super capacitor manufacturing or at least that&#x27;s the way I see it that&#x27;s one application most super capacitors have a very low maximum operating voltage anyway typically two and a half volts so that&#x27;s a rabbit Trail I would like to pursue titanium oxide is also the pigment used in white 3D print 3D printing filament so while it&#x27;s not the best dielectric we could literally 3D print a dielectric in any shape we needed but it wouldn&#x27;t be polarized it&#x27;s using a glue to bind the titanium oxide but it was still much higher dielectric than air and it was shaped so a ton of viewers commented on the lifters working or not working in a vacuum and that this was a very important line of research I wholeheartedly agree and that is exactly why I custom built a very large non-conductive vacuum chamber with a clear window for filming Force measuring gear and bulkhead connectors with which to connect sensors and of course the high voltage needed to run the experiments Nomad prospector implied he actually conducted vacuum chamber experiments which showed his lifter didn&#x27;t work and in fact it sounds like that&#x27;s a hilarious story with with that about not using a fish aquarium for vacuum chamber um yeah I agree that brings pictures to mind that sounds like it would be a nasty explosion or implosion regardless let us not forget that experiments conduct conducted at multiple facilities over the past several decades have demonstrated that yes these devices do generate a Thrust in a vacuum posted a video of one of these experiments conducted in 2003 by gravitic Inc at NASA&#x27;s Leaf facility it was of Paramount importance to me to conduct vacuum chamber tests because everybody including myself including my research partner even including the Mythbusters we had all at some point concluded that the lifters were operating merely on ionic wind so if you remove the error no more wind therefore whatever Force you are left with has nothing to do with ionic wind so I took one of my triangle shaped Lookers stuck it in the vacuum chamber and sucked it down now one of the best things you can do in science is make a prediction right so my research partner made a prediction he predicted that with the increase in vacuum the thrust would dwindle down to zero I predicted the thrust would drop by one-third compared to what it produces at atmospheric pressure I won&#x27;t tell you how or why I came up with that very specific number except that it was based on the dozens of hours of research I had been conducting so I fired up the vacuum pump and would charge the lifter every few minutes and measure the force it was producing as the vacuum increased it completely defied our predictions and expectations and that the thrust it produced didn&#x27;t decrease it increased and dramatically so now he and I are still debating on why it did it and at this point in time I think we would agree to disagree and that more research needs to be conducted to determine who is right and why because we&#x27;re both sticking to our guns however some of you will already see where I&#x27;m going next with this and in fact a couple people even brought this up in the comments I could only get the vacuum down so low now because it&#x27;s counterintuitive but error at a lower atmospheric pressure actually has a lower breakdown voltage so the moment I got the chamber down to about 0.5 bar a plasma Arc would jump between the Exciter wire and a Collector Plate now it was quite pretty but the incident that plasma flared up it would instantly carbonize the balsa wood frame of my lifter the carbon turned my Balsa frame from an insulator into a resistor and my lifter was instantly ruined because now even at atmospheric pressure the carbon acted as a resistor conducting the high voltages I literally had to build a new new lifter which I then promptly destroyed in the vacuum chamber in the exact same way then I switched to using plastic straws for the frame now this helped but you still have the problem with the plasma formation until you get a very hard vacuum in the chamber I couldn&#x27;t get a vacuum down enough and I haven&#x27;t been able to get back to that research because my personal life has taken many twists and turns the past couple years however this led to still yet more offshoot research where I was trying to make plasma to generate some effects So currently I&#x27;m looking at developing a new and improved plasma Thruster for use in spacecraft for example and also a nuclear fusion reactor which produces no radioactive waste and through a couple of different techniques May produce electricity directly from the nuclear fusion taking place in the plasma there&#x27;s been a ton of YouTubers who have built home Fusion reactors which are seriously cool like the plasma Channel but also very very dangerous because they produce some seriously nasty radiation on that note in terms of safety please note that both my research partner and myself have been using a geiger counter on occasion when conducting our research mostly checking for x-ray radiation I mean we&#x27;re using high voltages and we&#x27;re observing very very bizarre reactions so who knows what else is going on so if you&#x27;re doing this at home be checking for things like x-ray radiation back in my early 20s I probably shot x-ray beams right through my brain when I was making a binocular headset using two cathode ray tubes the problem was I was unknowingly running them way over voltage so CRTs are already bad for that they can produce x-rays under normal operation but now you run them 25 percent over voltage well let&#x27;s just say that they gave me X-ray vision but not in the way you would think so in the case of the plasma in the chamber or the lifters in open air so far we have not had any detectable radiation of any kind except of course for a whole lot of EMP however on that note wolf Stein made an interesting suggestion on YouTube run the GPS program on your cell phone placed near the experiment if you&#x27;re actually generating gravity it should interfere with the GPS signal this is actually very a very interesting concept and I was checking for that using two stopwatches because gravity Alters time which is why GPS satellites have a slower running clock on board because they need to keep precise time with clocks on Earth but the lower Gravity the satellites are in makes the clocks run faster because time is running faster there where the gravity field is weaker so the problem I discovered would also apply to your quite brilliant idea there Wolfstein the problem was that the high voltages mess with nearby Electronics it will have an alternating frequency to it and the first time I ran the stopwatch experiments I got super excited because I came back after letting it run for an hour or so only to see that the stop watches were out of synchronization by hours and the problem is further complicated when you electromagnetically Shield any nearby Electronics because as I also quickly discovered electromagnetic shielding may actually double as gravity field shielding so I don&#x27;t know that for sure yet and I can&#x27;t tell you why I have that suspicion but it is something to ponder it was actually a Super Genius friend of mine who suggested this uh for example he just said hey Metals conduct electricity and heat so who is to say it is not also a conductor of gravity hmm anyway it turns out the EMP the gravity cell was generating generating and putting out it was basically resetting the time and date on the stopwatch that was close to it I had to watch it and sporadically the time and date would jump to random settings so also after doing some more research into time dilation it turned out that the dilation was exceedingly small so that even if I was generating a very powerful gravity field it would probably take experiments that were at least you know months long before I was able to see a difference in time between control clocks and experimental clocks the Voyager space probe for example is still communicating with Earth from deep space way outside of gravitational fields yet it is transmitting within the bandwidth of the designed radio frequency so I instead decided to focus on researching the solid state gravity detectors however an offshoot of this was using my geiger counter and putting some radioactive rocks literally right on top of my anti-gravity cell and powering up the anti-gravity cell I have some girl Canadian Shield rocks which are uh pretty hot radioactively right so if the cell is producing genuine gravity then it will be dilating time and the half-life of the radioactive elements should also be altered and quite possibly that detection rate detectable as a change of radiation emission rates in other words the Isotopes half life should also change so this is another area I&#x27;m still researching I had problems with my geiger counter at that time that I didn&#x27;t know about so I&#x27;ll get back to it another research Rabbit Trail which ties in with all this is methods of gravitational shielding this has been an area of research for a number of labs around the world and becomes important if you&#x27;re trying to generate gravity right all right so I&#x27;ve already droned on way too long here sorry gang I wanted to give you guys an update and also thank you for your excellent comments and questions most of which I haven&#x27;t been able to get to because either I can&#x27;t answer them uh because of proprietary concerns regarding our patent or just because of time uh hopefully I&#x27;ve given you a taste for some of the answers and hopefully you&#x27;ll stay tuned as I hope to put up more videos on this specific Topic in the future so have a great day ladies and gents</p>
