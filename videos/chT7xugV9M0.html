            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel my name is Thomas and I do videos on educational matters uh today we&#x27;re uh doing I believe our I don&#x27;t know I think it&#x27;s our 29th video here on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson um he Larson um worked out this theory in the 20th century he died back in 1990 and since then the theory has been updated um by a number of different people but especially Dr Bruce Perrette and um but he died back in 2020. and so um I think the theory is really very important and very impressive um but I also feel that it uh is in danger of being set aside and forgotten so I&#x27;m trying to um you know put it back out there so that some people can become aware of it and uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a hard it&#x27;s a hard Theory um you know really in order to kind of get to understand the theory you really ought to need to have read a few of Larson&#x27;s books um because if you just read one or one of them or so you end up kind of thinking oh he&#x27;s just getting he&#x27;s just pulling this out of no place where is he getting this from but once you see that you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve read a few of his books you see that he applies the same way every time it looks arbitrary a little bit at first but you can see the consistency and you begin to be able to see where he&#x27;s getting stuff from how he&#x27;s getting it and what his process is so that&#x27;s a little bit why we looked at his uh book called the outline of the or his his uh speech called the outlining the deductive development of the reciprocal system and um now we&#x27;re looking at his last book beyond space and time now the basics of Larson&#x27;s theory is that um just to recap briefly um you know the the universe of the Greeks was the universe of matter and then 2500 years later Einstein comes along and he says equals m c squared therefore uh energy equals matter times the speed of light squared they can be converted one to another and so the universe looks like it&#x27;s made out of matter but it really ultimately made out of energy Larson comes along uh later that Century um 25 30 years later and he says well uh if equals mc squared and energy can be converted to matter and vice versa that means that neither one of those things can be mo the most fundamental thing in the universe and there&#x27;s something that underlies both of them and he says that that thing that underlies both of them is really kind of like the c squared part is motion Mo the universe is made out of motion and other people have come up with that in the past but they have never uh been able to make it work because they didn&#x27;t like redefine motion or Define motion precisely for Larson motion is the relationship between space and time so uh basically you end up having a fraction uh x amount of space in y amount of time or vice versa a y amount of time in x amount of space and both of those relationships are motion along with all the other relationships that we know from scientific theory acceleration magnetic charge compressive pressure um you know density uh matte Mass energy uh Force those are all relationships between space and time now uh the in Larson&#x27;s uh postulates he basically says that space and time are reciprocals of each other that&#x27;s where we get the name the reciprocal system space and time are the same but they are reciprocals of each other they don&#x27;t exist separately they only exist together in motion and uh so he basically takes uh that kernel uh he has two postulates um takes those two postulates and applies them step by step if this then that if this then that to [Music] um his theoretical universe so he basically constructs a theoretical universe uh based on those principles and then Compares it with the actual universe that the scientists have discovered through measurement and observation unfortunately um some of those measurements and observations have been fudged and they screwed up Larson&#x27;s Theory because Larson believed in them but um we&#x27;ll get to that eventually later now today we were looking at um basic uh at beyond space and time so this is his final book that was published posthumously after he did all his books on physics and astrophysics and chemistry and astronomy and all of the hard Sciences he uh his wife published this book after he died about metaphysics and um we&#x27;re here in chapter five which is called levels of existence and he&#x27;s uh this is where we left off he&#x27;s basically attempting to um explain life whereas where life is coming from you know he&#x27;s looking at chemicals the chemical uh world and he&#x27;s saying that chemistry evolves or it progresses um based on aggregation you know these particles are all putting themselves together um and then he&#x27;s he&#x27;s distinguishing that from The evolutionary process so uh you know he&#x27;s saying that the process of aggregation proceeds slowly because of the very low probability of the right kind of contacts in the biological realm Evolution on the contrary the increase in complexity is inherently cumulative a protein molecule could form directly from its constituent atoms if the right atoms were available in the right positions at the point of formation [Music] um just as the anthocene molecule is known to do but is not not conceivable that the coalescence of any number of single-celled organisms could produce a polar bear The evolutionary process as we find it in living organisms is not merely a matter of aggregation like the formation of a molecule is a long process of gradual development by trial and error in which the new is derived from the old by modification rather than mere addition another striking point of difference is that in biological evolution the new replaces the old either partially or completely whereas in the inanimate process of aggregation the new and more complex structures are always a tiny majority the relative proportions of various structures being determined almost exclusively by the relative probability of their formation the dinosaurs which once Reigns Supreme in their environment you know again Larson is using these um you know facts but then he gets from science um that are mainly merely speculations you know about the dinosaurs and so on the dinosaurs which once reign supreme in their environment are now extinct but any chemical compound whichever predominated in a particular environment still predominates in that environment the Sands of the Mesozoic Era when the dinosaurs roam the Earth were grains of quartz just as the sands of today again we find that living organisms are unique in their ability to utilize food that is they can extract from their environment substances that are composed wholly or in part of the materials needed for the growth of the organisms they can break these substances down into simpler units and can Recon constitute them into the specific forms that can be used by the living bodies inanimate structures on the contrary can only grow by obtaining from the environment some kind of matter that is capable of being added directly the most that they can do in the way of adapting existing material uh to their use is to pull a Loosely bound atom or Atomic group away from some other structure an even more significant difference is connected with the basic physical principle known as the second law of Thermodynamics inanimate matter obeys the second law implicitly whereas living matter behaves in a matter that seems to defy the law by way of illustration a wooden fence post will burn if any part of it is momentarily exposed to a high temperature the second law says that any naturally occurring process such as this combustion of the fence posts results in a decrease in the availability of energy and accordingly we find that the available energy in the carbon dioxide water vapor and Ashes the principal conduct combustion products is substantially less than that of the original fence post a naturally occurring reversal of the process would violate the second law of thermodynamics since Recreation of the fence post from the products of combustion would increase the availability of energy but this is just exactly what happens in The Living World a Seedling tree takes the carbon dioxide from the air extracts the water and the constituents of the ashes from the soil and within a few years it has recreated the fence post as a treat we cannot take the stand that the growth of a tree is not a natural process unless we give that term an altogether different meaning than it now possesses the meaning that is utilized in the statement of the second law is therefore evident that the living world and the non-living world are not governed by the same set of rules okay now um in his uh his long-winded manner he uh goes over a little bit of the um uh the word I use is historiography but you know what the literature uh along these lines and some of the greats Percival Bridgeman and uh you know other people who have philosophized about this um but I&#x27;m trying to get to the point where Larson it really explains in his system what is life um and we we started talking about that before um where it has to do with this inter-regional ratio and that uh there&#x27;s a um there&#x27;s a a huge amount that gets lost in the translation when you are working from one sector of the universe to another they&#x27;re basically there are four uh different sectors of the universe with the speed of light dividing two from Two and then the uh so this side is really this what he calls the time Space Universe even though he probably should have called it the space-time Universe this is the part that we&#x27;re familiar with the material sector that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light and then this half is the cosmic sector moving half faster than the speed of light but then within those two sectors there&#x27;s also a mini sector uh here he calls it the time region here he calls it the space region and um the boundaries there are the unit of space and the unit of time so everything over here that&#x27;s within a unit of space uh crosses this boundary and goes into this other world which is all time everything is time because it can&#x27;t be space because of the discrete unit postulate within his first postulate uh that time and space are in discrete units they&#x27;re quantized meaning that you can only have one unit of time or or multiple units of time but you cannot have half a unit of time or a third of a unit of time once you get less than one unit of time or space either one then you have to flip it over and go with the reciprocal aspect meaning that you&#x27;re in the realm of time over here in the realm of space over here so there&#x27;s really three boundaries and they create four different sectors now but if you are trying to make measurements or glean information from a sector that you&#x27;re not in we&#x27;re in the time space region meaning we&#x27;re in this slower than um slower than the speed of light range of the material sector but we are in the larger than one unit of space Realm of the time space region we&#x27;re not in the time region so if we go to the time region or if we go over to the space-time region we are crossing a boundary and then when you cross a boundary you have to um put a reduction on the um information that you&#x27;re getting from that other sector so if you look across to that other sector and you see one you know um one unit you actually have to multiply that by the inter-regional ratio to to figure out how many units there actually are there so when we see across the boundary we only see a small fraction of what&#x27;s going on there and Larson calls that the inter-regional ratio um and he uses a a formula to arrive at it uh the inter-regional ratio usually for atoms is 156.44 um which is really like 2 to the seventh power times 9 over 7. uh the the result is uh 11 over nine I&#x27;m sorry um and so that and uh but it also could be 10 over 9 depending on certain circumstances so he he adjusts the inter-regional ratio but then when you&#x27;re dealing with uh you know he says that the universe is made out of space and time space and time are in three uh dimensions three scalar Dimensions um and then when you cross into the atomic realm it&#x27;s really four dimensions and so when he&#x27;s uh when he&#x27;s translating over from the cosmic sector into the material sector he has to use this inter-regional ratio 128. um to the fourth power um and then multiply Again by eight so the number that he ends up getting for this inter-regional ratio from across the uh the boundary is actually two to the 31st power um which is approximately uh 2 billion so when we are translating from Once from that sector to our sector we are uh only really able to see one two billionth of what&#x27;s going on there um and where he&#x27;s saying that there needs to be I&#x27;m trying to find it here in this chapter and as Larson is want to do he goes on and on and on and on and on and on uh about certain things and then he gets to the point but when he gets to the point it&#x27;s you know after 20 pages of having to labor through it and so nobody ends up seeing his important points because they gave up um sifting through all of his stuff um but uh so that&#x27;s really where he&#x27;s getting where life comes from is that um it&#x27;s a one-to-one uh he says that life is a one-to-one um communication or control of a material unit and a cosmic unit so the cosmic unit he calls it the control um unit so this Cosmic unit and the cosmic the moving faster than the speed of light has to do with metaphysical matters that are Beyond physical um in particular things like communication and thinking and memory and Consciousness in general and control and he says that the the cosmic unit takes control over the material unit and that&#x27;s really what constitutes life um but the only way that that can happen is if you have a one-to-one um uh reaction between the two uh it takes one control unit to control one physical unit but the problem is that you got this inter-regional ratio of basically two billion a little over two billion to one so what that means is that uh in order to basically occupy one of these Cosmic units um when we see one of these Cosmic units that means that they are actually two billion of them so one material unit is not going to be able to accommodate uh one Cosmic unit because when you have one Cosmic unit you really when you see one Cosmic unit you really have two billion of them and so he over here at the material sector you actually need to have uh two billion units in order to satisfy the need uh you know to just occupy one of the units that we see of the cosmic unit so he says that you know you have to have an aggregate of 2 billion um atoms you know in order to be complex enough to occupy one Cosmic unit and he says that you know that is DNA so DNA is the most complex molecule that we&#x27;re aware of or at least at the time he was writing this and uh DNA is the really the um least complex unit that will do the job that will occupy those life units or control units so um that is his explanation I will try to find how he goes through the inter-regional ratio here and we&#x27;ll discuss that tomorrow but that that&#x27;s just how he comes up with life and we&#x27;ll get into that further tomorrow</p>
