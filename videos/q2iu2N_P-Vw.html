            <p>the american physicist tanzan brown believed that lifters create their own localized gravitational fields this gravitational field is relative to their energy formed by high voltage electrical charge radiating from the emitting wire at the top of the lifter if we look carefully we can see a purple corona-like glow of light radiating from the emitting wire if our eyes worked at a different wavelength we would be able to see and everything is radiating light waves of electromagnetic radiation continuously objects interact with the particle wave duality of light continuously forming new electromagnetic waves in a new theory this universal and continuous process forms the time continuum or arrow of time itself therefore the uncertainty and probability of everyday life is the same uncertainty we have in quantum physics</p>
