            <p>What if the act of paying attention could change everything? Not metaphorically, but literally. What if your focus, your gaze, your conscious awareness had the power to influence the fabric of the universe? This is the doorway to the observer effect. In quantum physics, the observer effect refers to the phenomenon where the act of observation alters the outcome of a quantum event. In the famous double slit experiment, particles behave like waves until they&#x27;re observed. Once measured, the particles collapse into a specific location.</p>
<p>Observation determines outcome. Let that sink in. Before being observed, the particle exists in a state of probabilities, multiple possibilities, all coexisting. But the moment a conscious observer is introduced, the infinite collapses into the finite.</p>
