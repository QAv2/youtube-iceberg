            <p>there&#x27;s a popular saying that money is the root of all evil and in some cases like the items on today&#x27;s list that might very well be true in today&#x27;s list bomb we cover the top five suppressed inventions these are world changing inventions that look like they were purposefully shelv starting off today&#x27;s list at number five hemp products many people don&#x27;t actually know what hemp is this is hemp not the leaves that are Smoked by marijuana users but rather the stem the stem of the marijuana plant has production uses like no other material on the planet some of the possible uses include hemp paper and cardboard hemp clothing that doesn&#x27;t wear out hemp Plastics and building materials hemp biofuel for cars and hemp even has nutritional benefits now some may ask why would such a useful material be suppressed well it appears that a few select individuals are responsible with the biggest culprit being that of the dupond company who holds a great deal of the patents associated with plastic and products made from it they were allegedly afraid of the competition from hemp fiber and lobbied the government to make hemp illegal on the grounds that its leaves could be smoked number four a safer cigarette with over 440,000 deaths per year one would think that safer alternatives to stand cigarettes should have been available a long time ago well they were or rather they almost were apparently several companies designed safer cigarettes that had a great deal of the carcinogens removed unfortunately these safer cigarettes never reached the masses because selling a safer cigarette created the legal and marketing problem of admitting that existing cigarettes were unsafe number three the cure for heart disease what if the cure for heart disease the leading cause of death was a daily dose of vitamins well it looks like that might be the case Nobel Prize winner lonus Pauling researched this very topic and found that heart disease is what amounts to long-term scurvy apparently taking the amino acid lysine and at least 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily is all that&#x27;s needed to clean out your arteries and restore the heart to a healthy condition by the time of lonus pauling&#x27;s Discovery the medical establishment had branded Pauling a quack because he advocated the use of high doses of Vitamin C to treat many diseases irwing Stone first introduced Pauling to vitamin C and explain that it wasn&#x27;t really a vitamin at all but an essential substrate that we could no longer manufacture in our bodies most animals on the planet make their own vitamin C in large amounts yet in humans the gene for this ability has mutated and no longer works properly number two the water-powered car many don&#x27;t know this but a man named Stanley Meyers supposedly invented the world&#x27;s first water-powered car Meyers claimed that an automobile retrofitted with his device could use water as fuel instead of gasoline his device purportedly split water into its component elements hydrogen and oxygen the hydrogen gas was then burned to generate energy which would then be combusted back into water vapor now what makes number two so interesting is that he was supposedly contacted by the the US Military and soon after meeting with them Stanley Meers died suddenly on March 20th 1998 after dining at a restaurant his brother claimed Meyers suddenly ran outside saying they poisoned me after an investigation The Grove City police went with the Franklin County coroners report that ruled Meyers who had high blood pressure died of a cerebral aneurysm some of Meer supporters believe that he was assassinated to suppress his inventions number one free energy by Nicola Tesla most people have heard of Nicola Tesla I mean the man has a long list of inventions and discoveries attributed to him including but not limited to alternating current the brushless motor remote control by radio super conductivity fluorescent lighting and dozens of other inventions and yet with all of that under his belt there was still one invention that Tesla obsessed over the world power system the system was a method of broadcasting electrical energy without wires his Warden CLI Tower as he called it was never finished due to his Financial Funding being cut off by his investor JP Morgan apparently JP Morgan didn&#x27;t feel providing the world with free wireless power was a good investment Tesla tried to find additional investors but was unsuccessful and unfortunately the project was scrapped the tower demolished and the property foreclosed in 2013 a Grassroots campaign to save the succeeded in purchasing the property with plans to build a future Museum dedicated to Nicola Tesla so tell us guys which one of today&#x27;s items do you think would have changed the world the most let us know what you guys think in the comments below and as always thanks for watching [Music]</p>
