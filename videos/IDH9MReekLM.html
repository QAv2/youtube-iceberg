            <p>it all sounds a bit too bizarre to be true but we&#x27;ve now been able to track down a key witness to a prison near Seattle in Washington state so you are 100% sure that promise or a derivative of Promise was bought by Australia to be used in our intelligence and law enforcement absolutely uh because I I uh uh spent uh several thousand man hours of uh programming time with a programming team team uh you know developing that subset this unlikely looking character is a computer genius his name is Michael ronos shuto and he says he was in charge of modifying the promised program so that it could be accessed by American intelligence so whoever was holding that master key could do what basically U break into it and spy AIO says it doesn&#x27;t have and has never had the promised software of course it won&#x27;t go into any detail about what sort of computer programs it does have which is very handy because according to Michael ronos the promised software was often altered and given different names before it was sold indeed ronos shuto claims he specifically modified the program for Australia at the request of AIO I basically had to change the communications protocol which is how that software package interacts with other software packages already res pres in the computer system in a federal court hearing judge George Bas ruled the justice department had used illegal and underhanded methods to bankrupt Bill Hamilton&#x27;s inslaw company he ordered the government to pay inslaw 8 million yeah trickery fraud and deceit you use those words when describing how the justice department stole the software do you stand by those words yes I there&#x27;s no question in my mind about it the evidence was overwhelming so why was the justice department so desperate to get the software from Bill Hamilton to answer that you have to go back to [Music] 1980 Iran had seized American hostages all evidence proves that these people are spies if President Carter could secure their release he&#x27;d have a big advantage in the upcoming US elections my thoughts and my prayers for hostages in Iran are as though they were my own Sons and Daughters it&#x27;s now alleged that the Reagan campaign made a deal with the Iranians a deal to keep the hostages until after the election thus denying Carter the credit for their freedom the man alleged to have helped organize this deal is a Reagan political crony called ear Brian and his payoff 3 years later on the promised software about an hour and a half outside Washington DC you&#x27;ll find this place ear Brian&#x27;s multi-million dollar country estate if you believe Michael Rona Sho it&#x27;s the house promise bought now we&#x27;d like to bring you Earl Brian personally denying that claim but he&#x27;s not being interviewed by anybody all we got was this letter from his lawyers threatening action if we so much as associate El brien&#x27;s name with this story he had the cont ta to help make sure that certain elements in Iran would not make a deal with President Carter in 1980 so that President Carter could not recover in the polls and that Reagan would win the election I Ronald Reagan do solemnly swear just 5 minutes after Ronald Reagan took the oath of office Iran announced that the hostages would be released some 30 minutes ago the planes burying our prisoners left Iranian airspace and are now free of ir and the story doesn&#x27;t end there in a moment the murders that have been linked to the Spy [Music] Scandal there are many Shady characters in this story spies for former spies people with something to hide but there are players with impeccable credentials too in part two of this investigation we meet a man whose background more than qualifies him to know a scandal when he smells one what is being said about this conspiracy points to criminal conduct much worse than anything in Watergate and Elliot Richardson should know 17 years ago he resigned as us Attorney General on a matter of principle after clashing with Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal today Richardson is legal council for inslaw and once again he has the White House in his sights it might be reluctant to have it emerge that the US government had through uh clandestin means planted uh software on foreign intelligence agencies so that the US would be better able if the phrase goes to read their mail</p>
