            <p>hello viewers now I&#x27;m demonstrating how much power my uh wind system is giving you can see now that the Amper meter and the voltmeter are going to the yeah maybe to the end now I&#x27;m here now let me show you let me show you what is the wind wind is crazy but you cannot see the turbine uh hello viewers uh today it&#x27;s really windy and now I&#x27;m trying to demonstrate how much power and volts and amp amps we are getting from my turbine she she is behind and the wind is probably really strong from 25 to 40 km per hour depending on the stroke but uh yeah if you can see uh now in the continuation we are getting somewhere between I think 5 and 8 900 watts depending on the on how much uh stroke is from the wind and basically this is it I just wanted to show it really gives some power some people are giving comments this is not the efficient turbine but it&#x27;s really efficient and I think uh everybody who makes it will be satisfied so thanks for watching until next video bye-bye</p>
