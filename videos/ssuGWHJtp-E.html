            <p>it&#x27;s chauffeur Nexis funded by Inc Utah or simply a garage many high-tech corporations are started with investment funds from in-q-tel or similar entities that are front for the intelligence community to get their hands into the company and to have a lesson subtle influence it is debated how much influence exists on what are now brand names such as Google and Facebook but since we are giving with smoke and mirror agencies for us little people it&#x27;s just conjecture shelf our Nexus is set before you offering hyper security and privacy is this credible if shell for Nexus has ties to the intelligence community they can easily come up with marvelous terms to present themselves as your friend someone who will embrace ideas like don&#x27;t be evil and someone who only has your good in their heart if the tie exists there might be some credibility issues consider the videos after the show for Nexus comm website that show how you are tracked with your phone and on the web and the fraud behind things like the blockchain you might get the impression that those that want to control you or separate you from your dollars are not happy with it this exposure consider the article art or holes intentional and you might find this exposure idea a habit this exposure effort demonstrates the credibility of shell for Nexus do you agree when a crowd funding effort is made or there is a request for others to become involved you should get to know who is behind the project the shofar Nexus crowdfunding effort is not to help you become rich beyond your wildest dreams but to build an ecosystem of independent small players that you are invited to be a part of or to simply fund the development this sounds like work there are stories such as with hewitt packard that live lease target in a garage how these stories are embellished is again just conjecture now consider this garage that was added to a house in the 1990s in 2017 it was converted into a separate house this is not the garage where chauffeur Nexus started but is the home office of the one man entity that today is chauffeur Nexus so we can be clear chauffeur Nexus has no ties to in-q-tel or the intelligence community but is literally simply a guy in a garage you are indeed being invited to be part of the show for Nexus effort via crowdfunding or business involvement now I should ask is this guy credible here is his history you decide who is the man it is me John kozloski I started my venture into electronics in my early teens during the era when vacuum tubes were still dominant the late 1960s for me it was exciting to see two flip-flops in one 14 pin dip using TTL I think very few have that excitement anymore however I was less than enamoured with the education system as I wanted to learn so I completed high school one year early and scooped ice cream for many months until I went into the US Air Force as an escape mechanism I got into communications which I wanted but it was secure communications which was new to me but it would become me while my peers were using their newfound income on beer I was buying books and parts to build things I did attempt a few courses at the University of California in Riverside I did gain a grass the Fortran but more importantly I got access to the IBM 360 slash 50 computer with four megabytes of core and that was when core was really tiny magnetic cores this was also my introduction to computer hacking on more than one occasion the system was brought down by this teenage semi student more importantly this is where I learned about the cryptography equipment of the day from the kg 13 KW 7 KW 26 KW 37 and ky3 not only how they worked but why they worked I worked at the combat operations center and March Air Force Base during the Cold War and two rooms away from the big screens used to potentially run World War 3 canopy&#x27;s to lock the card readers on our crypto equipment we&#x27;re all the same and I&#x27;m pleased to say I still have one the paper cards that were the daily codes were destroyed immediately after use sometimes but burning them other times by running them in a blender and yes one of those formerly top-secret cards is still in my position but not very usable while I knew how to take the system now I also knew better but a Friday night on a quiet evening did make it appear to some that we went down for about 10 seconds it caused a delightful panic well it quickly became very clear that the Air Force was not for me I did take an opportunity to spend two years in Europe traveling on an installation team my first six months were spent at the Bor Fink bunker during a massive renovation I developed a reputation of being odd a bit insubordinate but the one who was called on to make things work several times I was sent to projects that were just not working right to make them work my greatest joy was well on a multi-week install in Italy I was tapped to take charge to get everyone home for Christmas we work 16-hour days and the guys celebrated Christmas with their families I did a blunder in my haste and one morning the base commander picked up his special phone only to hear the local radio station we make mistakes I continued to build things including my first computer with 256 bytes of memory in a terminal using an oscilloscope as a display while in Germany I picked up the August 1977 issue of Scientific American which had an article describing what we now know as the RSA encryption algorithm an offer was made to get a copy of the original paper this one my interest was strong my first real job was with Magda Lancs I worked on there AG nav system that was used to guide farm equipment through a field long before GPS more importantly I developed a second generation electronic system for Harley Davidson this is where I learned about large volume manufacturing I was a sole developer on the Digital side it was a single-chip computer with a mask wrong we don&#x27;t hear about mass roms anymore the first generation cost over $4 a mais design only $2 which saved well over $100,000 per year and paid several years of my salary of course when we got the first few samples of our mass device I kept one the itch to be independent was already well developed in me and another gentleman and I did some serious exploring but nothing came of it I did move on to Raquel mill go for about a year and took their IBM compatible terminal and did the software to make it a dec VT 52 equivalent which again we find my understanding of communications the guy who brought me in had an ulterior motive to connect me to the coin-operated video game industry it worked and I spent another year floundering in the industry then came crude this was the era of pac-man and maze games my game included a different play field each time one or two players with growing tails it was noticed our two-man company multi amusement got a $25,000 advance roughly equivalent to $100,000 in 2018 from Tyco America our agent was mr. ray Kassar who had just stepped aside from being chairman of Atari the fastest growing company in history we had a high profile and we&#x27;re doing well that year the coin operated industry collapsed and with my own errors we did to the name multi muse Minh was a compromise on the multi computer idea that I wanted to pursue simple computers communicating together as communications seems to be in my blood we restarted as heritage systems and went on for about two decades with some noted successes the easiest that most people would recognize is this room the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange the last generation of CRT based displays in the early 90s used a million dollars of display controllers from heritage systems the hardware design PC board layout and all the software was developed by me I stood on the trading floor after the first closed over 3000 it was a few years back we also provided display controllers for cattle scales NASA the DoD and a company that had a text-based vending machine that predated what we now know as red box our longest-running market was the hosiery industry especially with the HSC 5100 a whole lot of socks were knit over the years including these with my initials and my wife&#x27;s considering this is the early 1990s we were pioneers in using a touch panel a fiber-optic network between machines and the connection between the mainboard and peripherals was a design that was similar to but predates the now ubiquitous USB the display controller industry was commoditized and we were gone in 1998 shell for Nexus was born originally called shofar Media work on it has continued and the design has been highly refined to be simple and reliable but there have been issues and lots of them it is hard to build a framework to give away while continuing to eat over time shell for Nexus matured to be not just a program but the whole operating system while it runs as a program on a standard OS it is designed to be the salt program on a device a program can be very secure but if the OS hosts another program that isn&#x27;t you have a problem shell for Nexus provides secure communications using the matryoshka protocol it is not simply encrypted but fully untraceable there is no metadata exposed and no evidence when real communications takes place shelve our Nexus can offer invisible routing a technique to allow your home or business to communicate on the web while giving no indication you are connected to the web shell for Nexus can offer private domains and private routing so that no central authority is required or can take you down a significant goal is to use show for Nexus to run a cell phone that does not require your phone to remain in constant contact with local cell towers but still receive calls to allow your calls to be fully anonymous and untraceable to be unlike other phones the track here your movements and record your every word but instead allow you to be private this is a serious and reachable Cole I need help to make it happen chauffeur Nexus is intended to be put in the public domain when you get the program the source code is embedded you have it all you are free to review it or use it to build another program with it I simply ask that you change the name show for Nexus has been funded for several years by being used as the underlying technology for the gas pump portion of rapid RMS to run small convenience stores perhaps you have a project that could also use what show for Nexus has to offer what is set before you is full disclosure of a man who has many successes and many failures but remains the consummate engineer working for privacy and tools to proclaim for all I offer evidence and you can now decide if I am trustworthy or fraud communications privacy is a serious game for some it&#x27;s a matter of life and death for others a matter of control it is not for the squeamish I can&#x27;t do it alone please consider a modest investment in the crowdfunding effort please consider if you want to be a part I&#x27;m in this until my last breath I&#x27;m also 62 so most of my breaths are probably behind me the time is now please consider it</p>
