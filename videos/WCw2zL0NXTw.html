            <p>all right hello how is everybody doing today welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel where we focus on uh learning uh new and different theories of everything that you probably haven&#x27;t heard of before but if you did uh they probably help your life benefit you in uh Untold ways help you to organize your thoughts uh because they&#x27;re all encompassing theories and so all the other theories that you&#x27;ve put in your head you can synthesize them and harmonize them and um resolve them in your head uh once you you know gain a a reliable all-encompassing Theory and today is the 343rd video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from one Dewey Bernard Larsson and uh Mr Larson was born in 1898 died in 1990 spent the last 60 years of his life working out the reciprocal system the first half of which was an inductive process to go from his uh original epiphanies to his fundamental postulates two fundamental postulates in the late 1950s and then the second uh part of his research was 30 years of deductive work where he took his initial uh two fundamental postulates and uh went through a process of deduction uh if this than that kind of thing uh and arrived at a theoretical Universe How the Universe would behave is if his postulates were correct and then he wrote books comparing how his uh how his postulates how his uh his findings his theoretical Universe matched up with the uh universe that the scientists had created over the course of thousands of years um you know so it was basically one guy against uh several civilizations over thousands of years and uh Larson generally won that contest um he has books on physics and astrophysics chemistry astronomy metaphysics um economics it&#x27;s got some chapters on psychic powers and dream interpretation religion and Phil philosophy ethics and uh some of his followers such as Dr Bruce pet have book books on um or at least writings on uh other topics even farther a field from you know what&#x27;s considered science larsson&#x27;s last book was called beyond space and time and it came up posthumously published by Dorothy&#x27;s wife and um a lot of the uh followers of Larson were distraught by by uh his wife&#x27;s choice to publish that and thought that Larsson was uh you know a strict scientist and he would have never wanted his musings on Such trivial subjects as metaphysics to ever be published these were just his private notes to himself um hard to say but it looks like uh his writing beyond space of time is fairly complete and cohesive um so uh I do believe that Larson would have wanted that to be published and um we&#x27;ll be looking at uh that work a little bit here today in um in looking at Dr Bruce Pet&#x27;s uh second half of his article that is called the fund fundamental postulates rs212 and um rs2 is something that Dr Bruce pret and Dr KB K Neu came up with um mostly after Larsson passed away uh as the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system Larson believed that the reciprocal system was correct but that he was subject to error in in how how he derived uh the system and that he might have made some mistakes in his deductions and that he encouraged people to uh find those mistakes and correct them so that&#x27;s what these folks have done and I think they did a bang up job almost on the level of larsson&#x27;s work himself now just to uh give you some clarity about um what the reciprocal system is about out um more or less Larson is claiming that uh we live in a universe that is made uh solely and entirely of motion um you know veering sharply away from the ancient Greeks who thought the universe was made out of matter and 2500 years later then you know I Einstein comes along with eal mc² it looks like it&#x27;s made out of uh matter but it&#x27;s really made out of energy um and other people have attempted including Einstein spent the last 20 years of his life trying to uh find the unified field uh to unify the force fields of gravity and electricity magnetism the strong nuclear force which is completely made up and uh as well as the weak nuclear force and how to integrate all those forces but for Larson matter energy force these are all just forms of motion they are different kinds of motion and they are representable uh specifically and exclusively by space and time that is how Larson defined motion as the relationship between space and time in fact as the first part of this article that we read yesterday um mentions uh Larson in his first formulation of his fundamental postulates uh he he revised his fundamental postulates a number of times over the years in his first formulation from the late 1950s he said that the universe is made out of SpaceTime he eventually changed that to the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time so at first he used the term space time then he eventually used the term motion and late in his life he actually embraced the term change change in three dimensions and uh so for Larson the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time this sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time uh in um motion can be uh described by um a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator speed for example is um the most uh accessible kind of motion to us speed is expressible by space over time the bicycle is moving 10 mes per hour 10 miles of space in 1 hour of time or acceleration I dropped the ball out the window and the ball fell at 32 ft per second per second that is time uh space over time to the second power acceleration um energy it took me 3 hours to move that thing two miles 3 hours 3 hours to push that thing two miles 3 hours of time in 2 hours of space time over space energy and force force is time over space to the second power and um so that would be you know um kind of a a a conjugate of acceleration which is space over time to the second power and then we also have um matter matter is time to the thir power over space to the thir power so all of these different motions and many others uh including pressure time over space to the fourth power uh electric um current electric charge electrical capacitance electrical resistance magnetic flux um permeability per itivity uh viscosity and fluidity these are all expressible in terms of time and space only so this is a wonderful system because it&#x27;s way simpler than the MKS system which which bogs down Matters by using um meter kilogram seconds the kilogram part is what is the killer there uh because the kilog gr is a representation of mass which is time to the thir power over space to the thir power so you know when you&#x27;re trying to trying to uh calculate using the MKS system it&#x27;s very difficult to to figure out the units but if you&#x27;re if you just have two components time and space it&#x27;s much easier to reckon uh equations and and and uh you know historical uh equations and see how see if they&#x27;re correct see if at least they you know match out in terms of units um because you only have two components now um there are some kind of caveats to the uh universes made out of space and time uh universes made out of motion motion is a relationship between space and time that sets up a space you know for thousands of years we&#x27;ve thought of space and time as really being the container of the universe uh but we uh now with Larson system we have to also see the universe as being the contents of the universe it&#x27;s not only the stage upon which the events occur but it is also the actors upon the stage that are made of space and time as well so um now you also have what Larson calls coordinate time and coordinate space space and time both come in three dimensions space and time have the identical qualities um because they are reciprocals of one another so space and time both have their three-dimensional aspects coordinate space and coordinate time XYZ coordinates and then space and time both progress uh what lson calls clock time and clock space uh space time is always getting later and later and later and later and the uh space version of that is space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart this is what Larson calls a scalar motion this is a motion uh that is known by science but not really investigated for its properties they they put it in the closet as be basic like an kind of irrelevant form of motion but Larsson puts it at the center as uh kind of the most basic kind of motion scalar motion a motion with a magnitude but no particular direction that you can map out or visualize best with a balloon with dots on it you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction they&#x27;re moving in all directions and they don&#x27;t acquire a direction until you assign a reference point when you decide arbitrarily that one of the points one of the reference points one of the dots is not moving that&#x27;s when you can determine Direction so not before that so the motion doesn&#x27;t the direction does not belong to the motion it belongs to the reference system and then time and space also come in only three uh only discrete units meaning that um there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space a Quantum a Quantum of space and a Quantum of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have anything you know it&#x27;s kind of like um you know anything in nature you don&#x27;t have you don&#x27;t have a third of an apple growing on the tree you either have have a a full apple or you don&#x27;t have anything and um even if you start chopping the Apple up into little pieces you still you know each one of them is a one entity in it of itself one Quantum all the way till you get down to the atom okay now um if you have have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time uh remembering that uh space over time is speed one unit of space in one unit of time is the um the constant the speed of light and so um you know for for hundreds of since melson moley experiment in 1887 or so the uh you know we&#x27;re trying to figure out why is the speed of light a constant and the speed of light is it&#x27;s really the speed of the progression of the natural reference system space is expanding at the speed of light uh in all directions and um and so any body that is actually motionless is moving outward at the speed of light so really the photon the light particle is the only particle that well not the only one of the only particles that is actually Motionless in um in the in the natural reference system and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s always moving at the speed of light because that is the expansion of space itself and uh also if you have what Larson calls this unit speed if you have unit speed then that basically means that uh half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light along with half that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light which is uh flying in the face of Einstein&#x27;s dictum that says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe so um that basically sets up two sectors larsson&#x27;s Universe the cosmic sector which is moving faster than the speed of light and the material sector moving slower than the speed of light in one SE in the material sector you have coordinate space and you have clock time three dimensions of space u moving through time always getting later and later and later and later but in the cosmic sector you have three dimensions of time and you have clock space space is always getting far farther and farther and farther apart and um you know in the material sector you have material atoms in the cosmic sector you have Cosmic atoms and a cosmic atom is known by Legacy science as a antimatter but Larson prefers to call it Cosmic matter now let&#x27;s get around to uh reading some of Dr R&#x27;s uh commentary on the fundamental postulates that is basically the First Fundamental postulate universe is made out of space um out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time universe is made out of motion it comes in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relationships of ordinary communative mathematics its magnet primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian uh now he went through those things uh quite a bit in the first half of this paper in the second half he&#x27;s going uh into the section extending beyond space and time and these are dealing with some of larsson&#x27;s um metaphysical postulates because in order to come up with his book beyond space and time his last book he had to to uh recognize that his two fundamental postulates did not cover such things as life phenomena and mental phenomena um and so he had to uh come up with four new postulates to describe those things now the beauty of Pet&#x27;s work is that he Alters the the two fundamental postulates uh which make the uh four uh metaphysical postulates unnecessary I think he goes through this in RS uh RS 2103 so we&#x27;ll be reading starting that tomorrow but we&#x27;re going to go into the section extending beyond space in time after researching biology and ethics Larson discovered that his fundamental postulates did not apply to the universe described by these topics life in many ways Act exactly opposite to the way inanimate structure should and Concepts such as self-sacrifice remained totally outside the scope of the universe of motion to correct this he began observations of the way biologic life and ethical Behavior occurred in nature and defined these observations in a set of four metaphysical postulates okay and uh the first one there are existences in the metaphysical region of a more General and less restricted type than the units of motion that are the basic constituents of the physical Universe two the metaphysical existences are logical orderly and rational and three metaphysical existence conforms to a specific set of laws and principles different in some respects from those of the physical universe and four the metaphysical existences of which we have evidence are intelligence the book beyond space and time was an attempt to create a larger more encompassing artificial reality that would include the physical Universe the biological universe and the ethical universe as subsets which Larsson defined as three levels of existence the first is the inanimate material or Cosmic sectors as matter or antimatter described in by the fundamental postulates the two fundamental postulates also then the biologic level material and Cosmic sectors interacting as living cells okay so the life unit comes comes about from the combination of a material and Cosmic atom or entity now if a material and Cosmic an entity interfere with one another they generally annihilate each other but if they interact at the right angle and in the right proportions then that explosion becomes an explosion of life as opposed to uh an Annihilation explosion and then uh um third level is ethical neither material nor Cosmic sectors creating a new ethical sector larsson&#x27;s approach to creating artificial realities was unique in that his theories had a logical cut off point defined by his levels of existence sort of discrete units of observation he did not try to force a cell to conform to chemical laws but rather observed life in nature and from those observations attempted to define a separate artificial reality that he could then correlate with his other theories and uh connect them on Common Ground that being the concept of motion okay this section is called the Manifest Realm because space time and motion all possess the same properties namely discrete units and three dimensions the situation arises that there are multiple artificial realities created using Larson&#x27;s Commandments now uh in the previous paper he&#x27; gone through um you know uh the difference between natural law and artificial law natural law is an observation about the way nature behaves whereas artificial law is a commandment uh about how nature behaves so he&#x27;s saying that Larson is using an artificial reality created using larsson&#x27;s Commandments when we normalize time uh reducing it to Unity we can make it a constant and end up with three dimensions of coordinate space and the constant of clock time Larson refers to this as the material sector and is observable and measurable but still an artificial reality that forms a consensus with our body&#x27;s physical senses another situation is where space is normalized in uh to Unity uh acting like a clock and time has three dimensions Spa lson calls this artificial reality all right sorry uh about the interruption there the uh the phone overheated and so I&#x27;m going to try to finish the video um and then glue them together um so we were uh in this section here um another situation is where space is normalized to Unity acting like a clock and time has three dimensions lson calls this artificial reality the cosmic sector named after the origin of cosmic background radiation whereas we can only observe and measure three dimensions of space we cannot directly observe clock space nor the three dimensions of time associated with it both of the these artificial realities operate simultaneously so we end up with three dimensions of space on the outside with constant clock time and three dimensions of time on the inside with constant clock space in other words these little unit-sized chunks of 3D time arranged on a 3D spatial grid we call the chunks of 3D time atoms and the Arrangements on the 3D grid structure um on the on the 3D grid structure okay so um atoms and structure the diagram on the next page uh which I don&#x27;t have is an entity relationship diagram that shows how larsson&#x27;s postulat relate to each other as natural or scalar observations artificial or coordinate Commandments and the logic he used to connect them together okay now that is the end of the article um so uh this an article that Dr pet wrote back in 2012 and um so he&#x27;s saying that the scalar aspect clock space and clock time are the natural observations whereas the artificial observations are the Commandments are coordinate space and coordinate time three dimensions of space three dimensions of time those only are uh the result of our uh situation in the reference system okay um now some of that might be a bit confusing but I think if we uh begin to read uh which we will tomorrow this RS 2103 the re-evaluation uh he will go into these postulates a little bit more and clarify um some of the key points and then um he&#x27;s going to uh eventually be able to kind of get rid of these four metaphysical postulates and incorporate them into the two fundamental postulates by uh by um altering the two fundamental postulates in Fairly minor ways uh in order that they will accommodate all of the metaphysical postulates um okay uh we&#x27;ll be doing that tomorrow so thanks for tuning in today have a great day</p>
