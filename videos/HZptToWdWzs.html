            <p>When most people talk UFOs, they think aliens from space. But Jacqu Valet, he flipped the script. He said, &quot;What if it&#x27;s not ET at all, but something even weirder?&quot; Jacqu Valet is a French astrophysicist, computer scientist, and one of the most influential UFO researchers ever. He worked on NASA&#x27;s first computerized mapping of Mars. He helped build early internet tech.</p>
<p>But in the UFO world, he&#x27;s legendary for thinking differently. Instead of saying UFOs are just visitors from other planets, Valet proposed that they could be interdimensional, part of a phenomenon that&#x27;s been with humanity for centuries, disguised as fairies, angels, and folklore. He even helped catalog thousands of cases per project blue book, which I&#x27;ll talk about in later videos. Valet&#x27;s message to understand UFOs. He says we need to study consciousness, history, and physics, not just radar blips.</p>
<p>Because this mystery might be way older, way closer, and way stranger than we actually think. Follow the UAP pod for more.</p>
