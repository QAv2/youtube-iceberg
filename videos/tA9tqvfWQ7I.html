F/C ANY material with a lighter density should float on it as you can see. I am willing to bet that you have spent many sleepless nights wondering what  what table SALT and mercury  would do if they when they were interacted. together First,   we will put a few drops of mercury in the salt It kind of does what you would expect The surface tension -  the surface area is enough to support the droplets of mercury  We add a bit more,   it creates a small puddle and it still supports it.</p>
