            <p>[Applause] Hello friends it&#x27;s me yet again uh yeah so uh here&#x27;s the uh the latest um creation uh yeah uh it&#x27;s basically the same thing as before just a bigger uh version and um as you can see it actually uh is looking uh more like a UFO um slowly uh and um yeah so uh it&#x27;s kind of hard to see but there&#x27;s actually um a large uh magnet a large um neodium uh donut sh dut shaped magnet inside of this of this thing um it&#x27;s a 3-in uh by/ in uh dut magnet with a 1 in hole in the center of it and [Applause] um yeah it&#x27;s pretty much it uh so really the only thing different is that I was able to get uh the thing to um to contact the other uh disc like if you seen my uh last video uh with this other um smaller uh homopolar motor uh you remember the two uh counter rotating discs so this is the same thing but um I got them to uh to contact each other in the inside here um the lower disc is a lot smaller and um it basically just uh there&#x27;s like a little wire that like um it&#x27;s on the inside and uh it contacts this um this uh Strip This aluminum strip that I&#x27;ve uh kind of like stuck on here yeah so anyways let me just uh show you it working and then then you can see for yourself yeah [Music] okay so there it is um uh yeah it doesn&#x27;t really uh work that well like like it works but it&#x27;s not um really fast and as you can see the lower disc oops a uh the lower disc doesn&#x27;t really spin as fast for some reason as the um upper one does so uh and I&#x27;m using the same um the same power source as the uh as I did with um the smaller version so you know it&#x27;s not really enough to power this larger one I don&#x27;t think I need um I need more power come on where is that stupid it&#x27;s kind [Music] of it&#x27;s kind of a finicky thing to get Co come on you piece of [Music] crap there we go see counter rotation demonstrated [Music] barely yeah I don&#x27;t know why the lower one doesn&#x27;t spin as fast oh I know why because it&#x27;s smaller the disc is smaller so it&#x27;s got less of a of like um a sail you could say for the magnetic [Music] Vortex okay well it&#x27;s getting really hot so I&#x27;m going to uh call it a day now um yeah I mean this is like what the Nazis did in uh 19 uh 31 in 1931 they created their uh Nazi Bill experiment which uh you know was basically the exact same thing as I&#x27;m doing here it&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s was much bigger and more powerful and uh it involved um liquid mercury and uh in 1931 they had their uh first uh successful um demonstration which uh you know supposedly um did all kinds of things including uh including um time uh distortions and then later on um they got into their uh Hano uh designs hanu uh vill uh one two and three and those those were um you know electrogravitic uh spacecraft which uh supposedly they used to go to um the moon and Mars far before uh the Russians or the Americans would get there using their own versions of um electrogravitic uh propulsion and um yeah I mean you know the story is that the Nazis got their ideas from uh an extraterrestrial race um called the uh Al debron who are um a renegade uh faction of the platan uh race and um yeah these guys supposedly have their base under the um Great Pyramid of Kiza and um one of head figures uh his name is um ashtar and you might be uh familiar familiar with that um name because it comes from uh you know the galactic Council and all of this other crap but really it&#x27;s uh this evil character ashtar who uh you know creates uh or likes to create uh Jesus Cults to basically uh undermine um New Age type uh individuals and yeah and he&#x27;s of course has the Aryan genetics as do those other uh Al debron ETS and that&#x27;s where the Nazis got their uh whole um racial uh superiority complex and um yeah so thank you for watching uh see you again next time bye for now</p>
