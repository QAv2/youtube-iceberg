            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[Music] so let me go to the next part of this presentation which is my experience with Andrea rousi and the ecad um so this was one of the pictures first picture I took with him and and to the right you can see uh the first piece news piece that I wrote in the magazine new uh here in St and Sweden um the title is in Sweden he said cold fusion now it is supposedly supposedly ready for production for for commercial use the reason I wrote that piece was that I I had been sent a blog post uh by the Italian blogger Daniela Pini who were present at the first um public demonstration that Rossy made semi public demonstration in January 2011 more or less exactly five years from now uh years back and um I thought it was interesting because I had been following cold fusion I understood that it was disputed and uh I didn&#x27;t consider it to be impossible uh since I understood that our knowledge about nuclear reactions could be limited and and I knew that there there was some demonstration observations being made but um apparently this experiment was interesting because the different was different compared to ear experiment was that rosi supposedly had not just a few Watts or tens of Watts which is a very low power output from a reaction he had 10 kilowatts which is about the power that you can get from an an electrical stove being at full full power of all the all the heating devices that you hand on the stove 10 kilobits which is quite a lot of heat and supposedly it was also repeatable and that made it completely different from earlier cold fusion experience so when I wrote that piece I thought this this should at least be be U it should should have some attention and I didn&#x27;t think more about it s until the day after because we have you know those statistics on the website looking at how many readers we have and what happened was that this news piece gained an enormous interest among all the Swedish uh readers we had like and normally we have at the most 20,000 hits on one news piece at the site at the website and this piece reached 100,000 hits so I understood that the interest is huge I also noticed that we had a large amount of comments and they were very polarized some people were extremely interested and enthusiastic others were Furious about us publish publishing a news speech like that very strong reaction polarized common comments dis discussing between each other but what I also understood that was that I I really have to um go on and investigate what this is all about one thing that I really liked from the start though was is that normally in the discussions about climate change people are concerned and they look at the solution that we have at hand the energy sources that we know about uh nuclear or solar or wind or whatever that we know about but very few actually think about what if we could find something else I mean the thing that Bill Gates is talking about and our readers showed a different kind of view because our readers are mostly engineers and the interesting aspect about their were way of thinking I found it was that they were thinking about well how could we use this to solve problems with a new technology that is not yet invented instead of thinking how could we reduce our energy use which is also important to optimize our energy use they were thinking ahead how could we actually find a new way of producing energy and I think that&#x27;s the right way of thinking because you never know what inventions you can make in any feel and you shouldn&#x27;t stop at the thing you have present at moment so uh I I I I um I sent an email in Italian what part of this story is that my wife is Italian so I speak Italian I sent an email in in Italian to Rossi and apparently he got confidence uh with me even though he normally didn&#x27;t trust journalist because of his past experience which I will come back to and and we started a dialogue and um after some while I published an interview with him and I I pulled in some Swedish researchers and scientists I have a discussion about this and I expected them to be quite negative but actually happened to find two of them which were very positive although I didn&#x27;t know before having having the Inu for discussion one of them was the professor swen kander who is also or was because he passed away dur when I during the time where I when I read the book two years ago and um shander was a part of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences which is the entity that that um brings out the Nobel prizes and he was also chairman of the energy Committee in in in that um Academy of Sciences and the other scientist I brought in was a physicist theoretical physicist called hanin who was actually the chairman of the skeptical Society in Sweden at that time so at least one of them I thought would be negative but both of them were actually very open-minded and interested in this and I later uh made them put them in contact with Rossi and then went down to bologa where he made his experiments and uh were observ this one experiment they came home and they wrot wrote a report and I was astonished when I saw the report because what they actually said uh right out was that this has to be a nuclear reaction and that report was the first report that really made uh some fuz in in in the discussions around Ros technology because two well-known Swedish physicist claimed that this has to be a nuclear reaction I continue I went down to rasy myself for four times and and I made my own measurements uh on the device and if you go at the I mean it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not really rocket science the device in itself seems very simple and it also is except for the core part of it which is the invention of adrea which we don&#x27;t actually know exactly how it works yet so uh this is isolated you can see the new netive reactor here it&#x27;s a copper tube and you have the reactor inside here and a heating device around and there is water pumped in here and in this end uh the reactor core is inside here it&#x27;s filled it was filled at that time with hydrogen uh through this tube inside and you had the nickel powder inside uh which was the material that Rossi used together with some kind of catalyst he said at that time now he says the contrary that the catalyst is actually nickel and and the main fuel is lithium another element anyway he heated on the core from inside and outside to start the reaction and once the reaction was going the reactor large as a potato inside there um became so hot that the water inside here was starting to boil and it came out here and and went out as as Vapor or as Steam so water was continuously pumped in here and by measuring how much water you boil you can measure exactly how much energy is being produced that&#x27;s basically the theory and then you have to subtract sub take away the um the uh electrical energy that you put need by heating here and through the difference you can see how much energy is produced so it&#x27;s basically very simple and I made those calculations four times for for different occasions I published them on the new side and um every time I published something the interest was very large and that time I also published in English the the the uh the margins in the calculations were not very large and there were lots of discussions about what errors could be found since this was considered to be impossible most people tried to find errors and difficulties and and what was wrong and then basically the two parts that could be wrong was that you measured the electrical energy that you put in into the reactor hitting it uh you could made an make an error that because of the waveforms of the energy being put in and also it was discussed a lot whether the the water was actually boiled and if you had dry steam or if you have water droplets into the Steam and I I discussed with lots several experts about all those issues and um every time I try to investigate I understood that there were good reasons to believe that the experiments were were made correctly and the measurements although not very exact measurements still uh get a good sign about um an anomalous heat being produced that is more heat that could be explained by chemical reactions so it had be nuclear reactions but it was not conclusive I I I I we can we can say that today the experiments were not really conclusive so uh at the same time the background of on Russell was discussed he he made those experiments and and and he had an activity in the 170s and 80s trying to produce um basically biofuel oil from organic waste and at the end he also went to prison now is there is a misunder understanding that he was uh convicted for fraud which is not right he was charged with fraud but it was never proven on the contrary they really hardly hard try they tried hard to to say that he uh took the oil or organic waste that he was buying from Industries and dig it down or hid it in some way and it didn&#x27;t do anything with it on the contrary it was proven that he actually treated all the material that he bought and he produced by Fuel from it but he had lots of enemies and the thing is uh some people have been investigating this for some time there was a sish radio actually National radio attack me for one week with her uh scientific news program uh and they tried to prove that Rosy was a fraud it was very low I think it was a very lowlevel kind of journalistic report and the thing is that you&#x27;re very naive if you go to Italy and you think that you can get the truth in one talking with a few people because Italy is a country where nothing is that is appears to be it&#x27;s very difficult to go through and understand the truth behind things and I what I found out being having lived in Italy was that there were possible explanations of all this background although not possible to prove but was still possible explanations because he had enemies both in in the cities that didn&#x27;t want any any competition about treating the organic waste and also the um organized crime that one at that time had big business dealing with organ organic waste and waste treatment so in the end he was freed and he went to the US and and uh he started to work on on the cold fusion experiments that he actually with his time in prison he had all those ideas being developed for two years when he was in prison so that was the background of Ry what happened later during that year is that he in the end he made this um experiment with a one one megabat uh plant that was composed of several I think 60 of those uh ecat um reactors together um This was um May maybe I in the beginning of the year I expected this experiment to be the conclusive experiment in the end it turned out not to be a conclusive experiments because it was very difficult to control the measurements um at that time rosi uh claimed to have a military customer that was there to uh look at the experiment and u a neutral third party person um called fanti who would supposedly uh control the measurements uh what was communicated afterwards uh after that day was uh the experiment was successful and that the military customer would buy the plant uh now if that happened or not there are no there is no proof of that but let me tell you that I have reasons to believe today that um uh probably used military uh has bought this technology from Andrea Rossi in one way or another and is actually using it but I got no proof in that and I I couldn&#x27;t give you any um any sources that I could uh refer to either but I I think that we will know about this sooner or later anyway at that point things went on for like um a a year or two uh with different experiments with new collaborations with from rosi and with uh different industrial groups and uh he broke up with some and he went on in the end he signed contract in 2012 uh with uh industrial heat which is his uh present um American partner company so um that we we know about that today um because the things that Rossi uh told me at that time I can understand that this was what happened in October 2012 uh the company uh the mother company is called Cherokee Investment Partners which is a uh investment fund with I think two let me see two billion dollar um working basically with uh treatment of old um um industrial zones which are have like polluted um ground and trying to clean them up and use them for other aspects like solar plants or something and um the CEO of Cherokee Investment Partners Tom Jordan was the one who believed in in this technology and wanted to invest in and they set up this company called industrial heat which today is the company that has the commercial rights uh to uh write produce and and sell the E technology in Southern North American Russia and China and I will come back to what they&#x27;re doing right now but um I we from that time 2011 and onwards there were discussions and reports and discussions and reports what what Rosy really brought to to the cold fusion field was uh a new energy of psychological energy at the um C Fusion conference that had been going on since 1999 called iccf uh the International Conference on on Condes matter uh I think it&#x27;s how it&#x27;s um spelled out today had been going on for years with like 100 participants but when rosi uh came in in into the situation and was um becoming more and more welln people&#x27;s interest all over the world not only elderly researchers and Al also young people were starting to have an interest in the cold foodion Arena again and that was very important thing I think because before it was so stigmatized cusion was so stigmatized that only elderly research D to get into the field because people young people going into this cusion uh field um was actually quite sure of destroying their careers it was absolutely not allowed to be touched considered to be Untouchable the thing with Ross&#x27;s technology was that he he kind of changed this scene this situation and he uh increased the belief that there is something going on here that we should investigate and this technology could actually become commercially viable so still yeah still there were ex very much very much uh a controversy going going around and I I felt that the comments on every news piece that I uh produced and the thing that amazed me was um the fury of some people&#x27;s reactions and after some time I understood that there must be two cat categories of people opposing uh even that we should look into this kind of technology and those the first one the first group I would say are people that uh believe that we should what people kind of afraid of change in general I understand I understand today that a lot of people are actually have this this character and it&#x27;s not bad because it&#x27;s a kind of also good thing that we are careful we going into new areas because we need some stability in in in in the society and in our also in in the scientific Community but this afraid this this fear of what&#x27;s new makes people try to you know cling to the old models the theories the knowledge that we have and they&#x27;re reluctant to look outside of the boundaries that we have today and when you come with such uh um disruptive uh thing as C Fusion the threat becomes very strong and people are reacting uh with with the in very intensely so that that seems to me that that&#x27;s that seems to to me explain one part of the strong reactions that I&#x27;ve seen towards my my the newsp that I produce or every discussion that was around Ros technology and in that that case if you&#x27;re criticizing every argument is good mostly it was also about Ross&#x27;s background and his probably fraud story it&#x27;s to get bit true but rarely it went into the scientific detail of of the of the experiments of the demonstrations or even on the found main of C Fusion before I mean all the published experiments with different Technologies the old kind of C Fusion that had been made before so you also have to make a separation because most experiments before were made with Paladium padium and and hydrogen what Rosa did and he was not the first one uh he introduced the use of he used nickel he was not introducing it because other people had been used nickel before and he was actually using powder of nickel and hydrogen um but that&#x27;s one part of the opposition that I saw the other part uh I would conclude are people that could lose uh personal interest if cusion would be a viable technology and an important part of them should be people working with commercial plasma Fusion which is is the kind of fusion reaction that goes on in the stars in the Sun that I explained in the beginning so one of those um experimental reactors that are being built is the uh reactor in south of France called eer so this is the eer reactor it&#x27;s um a huge uh Power Plant experimental power plant when you in this kind of uh tube form Circle tube formed reactor um you will have the the reaction Mass a few grams of hydrogen of heavy hydrogen uh floating around with 150 million degrees so you have to keep it floating uh in vacuum with um a magnetic field which is produced by Supra cond ing magnets so it it&#x27;s extremely expensive is the the the power plant is supposed to be costing about 15 billion euros and it will be ready for fullscale commercial experiments in 2027 and that&#x27;s only the start of it that that&#x27;s going to be an experimental plant which is supposed to produce uh more energy out in output than input for the first time because Fusion research haven&#x27;t been able to do even that after Decades of experiments and it&#x27;s supposed to do that for eight minutes so it&#x27;s supposed to be producing 500 megawatts output and with 50 megawatts input after that probably uh there could be a Dem demo commercial demo reactor demonstrating that it could be possible to have commercial uh reactor full scale reactors in 20033 with the first prototype of a commercial reactor Beyond 2050 so this is the hot Fusion research and that&#x27;s much too late if we want to save the planet not only from the climate crisis but also from the uh carbon pollution that we have in the air in China for example which is horrible and huge amounts of money been poured into the hot Fusion research and all this money all that money would be stopped basically I believe if we could prove that Cal Fusion is a viable commercial technology so here we got heavy uh commercial heavy um what do you say personal interest from people receiving funding um to be opposed to um the C fusion and I believe that this kind of arguments could explain the other part of of uh the opposition against cold fusion [Music] he</p>
