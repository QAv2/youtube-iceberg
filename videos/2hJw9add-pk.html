            <p>if what I&#x27;m about to tell you is true this invention could change the world so for starters I&#x27;ve known about this guy for a long time and his invention and I have a guilty pleasure of researching French topics because the older I get I&#x27;m beginning to realize that a lot of these things that were just thrown to the side by science and called woo and just pseudoscience guess what some of them have turned out to be true all right so let&#x27;s dive in so I want you to imagine a small empty jar right in front of you just like the star in this photo okay now some would say it&#x27;s just empty but it isn&#x27;t inside you would have oxygen nitrogen argon water vapor photons radio waves a few ions and maybe a neutrino even if we connected a vacuum pump to this jar there would still be things in it like electromagnetic waves photons and a neutrino or two maybe and the only reason we know this is because we&#x27;ve invented receivers and detectors to tell us what is there and according to the guy I&#x27;m about to tell you about even a small volume of space contains energy and he says that we can tap that energy and put it to use with a properly constructed receiver and where this gets interesting is that it really isn&#x27;t any different than using a solar cell which converts light into electrical power or a heat pump which utilizes a small amount of electrical current to transfer a greater amount of thermal energy from one location to another so basically our task is to determine how to achieve this with that energy in empty space easier said than done though meet Thomas Henry Mori Henry was a brilliant engineering inventor that made quite the discovery as I was saying earlier and he claimed that he had a device that could power the World by extracting energy from the environment that surrounds us all now in 1909 Mori started working on what he called a new Energy System just two years later he stated that he had discovered that the energy he was working with was not static in nature but oscillatory and where it gets wild is that he said that this energy was coming to the Earth from an outside source and then he went further to say that it was like these electrical oscillations came in surges like the waves of the sea he said it was continuous with more in the daytime than at night years later in 1925 Moray had finally built a working model of this energy generator that was about the size of an AM radio of the day and it&#x27;s shocking how simple it was to set up he used a half inch ground pipe driven into the Earth seven feet which was then connected to the generator and another 87 foot long wire connected to an antenna elevated above the ground once everything was connected he would tune the device to begin extracting energy from this mysterious source using the setup he gave live demos powering light bulbs irons fans you name it he did it and from what I&#x27;ve read it&#x27;s claimed it could Supply 700 Watts for up to 7 days and could just run indefinitely and what gets me here is that there are multiple photographs in affidavits documenting that this device did indeed work and nearly half of his published book consists of these affidavits and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re saying there was a battery blah blah blah but he allowed multiple people to inspect the device highly credible people and they couldn&#x27;t find any batteries nothing there&#x27;s even one testimony stating that Moray and a group of people drove to an isolated location like out in the middle of nowhere and it was Kept Secret for Moray just so they could test it out to see if he indeed was lying with guess what they set up the device tuned it and sure enough it worked he ended up trying to file seven different patent applications but unfortunately they were all rejected the reason being that he couldn&#x27;t describe the energy source and that it didn&#x27;t fit the physics of the time and this story gets crazier I mean this involves KGB agents people shooting at him and his family he even had to put thick bulletproof glass on his cars just to keep him and his family safe and it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s wild everything that happened to this guy so was he onto something I don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s fascinating who knows</p>
