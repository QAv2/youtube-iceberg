            <p>e e e 37 contact 120 9 breaking news tonight A Malaysia Airlines flight with 239 people on board including four Americans has gone [Music] missing [Music] I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says now I am become death the destroyer of worlds welcome everybody tonight heh 370x hopefully everybody&#x27;s doing well tonight um hello benator hello Amanda hello weona mystical Wonderland His Highness uh Lang I always forgot how to say name uh Joe how&#x27;s it going Tass Jack Trad and JL yeah and salty decimator re welcome okay so uh real quick uh this stream&#x27;s going to be a little bit different we&#x27;re going to play this video there&#x27;s several videos that we&#x27;re going to go through the next couple days related to Thomas Bearden and this is the first one turn on the volume where he talks about scal physics and the idea of weather manipulation it&#x27;s a really interesting one it&#x27;s about an hour long we&#x27;re going to dig into it uh I will commentate at certain points um but uh yeah I think that without further Ado we&#x27;re going to jump right on in and I&#x27;m going to end up full screening this as well uh so I will you&#x27;re not not going to see the chat for most of this until I I switch over the The View as well so here we go oh so real quick Thomas Bearden is Lieutenant Colonel who uh was a scientist and engineer I believe and this video is from 1985 so scaler physics goes way back 40 years uh really interesting science very consistent with the stuff that we&#x27;ve been pushing out there I hope you guys enjoy this video there&#x27;s a couple more that we&#x27;ll look at the next few days here subject for this evening is Soviet weather engineering over North America which they have been doing since the beginning of 1966 1967 that was the first shot our attempt at influencing the weather directly over the United States they then lapsed into a lot of not influencing it for a period of years and in 1983 particularly really opened up the big guns after having energized the infamous woodpecker signals the so-called over the rising Radars and the communication ban in the mid 1970s real quick I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to pull the chat over to the right so I can read you guys comments while we&#x27;re watching so if you guys have a any information related to this that you would like to share uh where&#x27;s my video cam that you think is relevant feel free to post it in the chat I will bring it up as we&#x27;re going through this and welcome the people who are just joining here as well if you&#x27;ve already seen this this is a video that was posted out there uh a few days ago but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s think it&#x27;s been on the internet for a while I&#x27;m not sure exactly when it appeared and we&#x27;re going to just play it in its entirety for the most part as you just saw from that introduction uh the basis for the video is the idea that the Soviets uh the Russians so to speak can uh manipulate weather through electromagnetic effects um I think that when we&#x27;ve been looking at stuff recently uh this would be like why we&#x27;re potentially looking at the ionosphere one thing that was posted today that is relevant to this as well is this idea that uh we&#x27;re this uh Eclipse that&#x27;s coming up that supposedly like this eclipse is coming up I think NASA is sending some Jets out into or some Rockets into space or into atmosphere and supposedly they&#x27;re going to be measuring like the effects of the eclipse pretty weird stuff guys okay here we go the first thing I&#x27;m going to have to tell you is that there are three kinds of electromagnetics and only one is being used today in the Western World the first kind is the kind we all study as electrical engineers and even US nuclear Engineers study a little bit of it and it&#x27;s classical electromagnetics the foundations of that go back fact before the Civil War it&#x27;s quite old and there are serious flaws and many eras in it as is quite well known in a few circles the second kind first of all let me characterize the first kind of electromagnetics everything is due to the force fields the so-called electric field magnetic field if that reduces to zero in an area you don&#x27;t have any more electromagnetics going on in there the potentials themselves are con considered to be mathematical figments now I&#x27;m going to be giving you a little background I&#x27;m going real fast through it but you&#x27;ll need this to understand what I&#x27;m talking about in the weather engineering and understand it so please bear with me during the first part we&#x27;re going to have a little uh quick sledding the second kind of electromagnetics came from quantum mechanics and it&#x27;s exactly opposed the primary and real things are the potentials and the force fields so-called are totally derived DED by differentiating operations so you see a flip-flop of 180° about how the two approaches regard electromagnetics further in quantum mechanics when the electric field and the magnetic field reduced to zero in an area you still may have the potentials and if these potentials which are the real things going on interfere with each other you can have real effects still produced in in charged part itical systems real physical systems as a matter of fact in 1959 a classic paper by Aronoff and bomb in physical review pointed this out very strongly and since then part of that has come to be called the bomb Aronoff effect or sometimes the Aronoff bomb effect it had been in physics 30 years at that point uh pointed out by Richard Fineman the Nobel Prize winner and ignored it has continued to be ignored and the nearly 30 years since 1959 when it was strongly pointed out by bomb and aof what we are saying ladies and gentlemen is if we can make this effect exist in the Big World they think it it exists only in the micro world we can get action at a distance that&#x27;s no longer a dirty word and we can get action even when there&#x27;s no ordinary electromagnetic going on and I&#x27;m going to show you how to do that and in the process I&#x27;m going to show you how to change the mass and inertia of an object affect its rate of flow through time guys holy smokes do you guys just hear what he just said aarin Hoff bomb effect Fineman mentioned that we can uh manipulate the potential there wait I&#x27;m gonna go back to that real quick guys just I I want to listen to this one more time it has continued to be ignored in the nearly 30 years since 1959 when it was strongly pointed out by bom and aronov what we are saying ladies and gentlemen is if we can make this effect exist in the Big World they think it it exists only in the micro world we can get action at a distance that&#x27;s no longer a dirty word and we can get action even when there&#x27;s no ordinary electromagnetics going on and I&#x27;m going show you how to do that I&#x27;m going to show you action at a distance and inertial mass reduction guys I mean that&#x27;s a bingo you have to change the mass and inertia of an object affect its rate of flow through time affect the gravitational field and so forth affect the gravitational field and so forth so surprised we didn&#x27;t look at Thomas Bearden earlier the science goes back at least several decades this point now um obviously it&#x27;s been known out there the question is how far Advanced have we come with this information here we go now the Third Kind of electromagnetics is the mechanism by means of which you do those things in other words you reduce the ordinary electromagnetics to zero electric field and magnetic field deliberately you then you do this by making a zero system you oppose the vectors so that they sum to zero but they are still there in the substructure hey when we studied electromagnetics they forgot to tell us that a zero Vector was not nothing it can be a system of very active forces Each of which is time varying and yet the system will not be detectable by any ordinary instrument it turned out that the unorthodox scientific community in the United States had been using this for some years but not expressing it quite that succinctly for example the h okay so what he&#x27;s saying here is that we can zero out the vector now why is this important because this speaks to Maxwell&#x27;s equations the B field equation for Maxwell so the B field equation times the delross operator SC Academia would tell you equals zero because it&#x27;s unmeasurable this is what he&#x27;s saying he&#x27;s saying that it&#x27;s not nothing when you do that if you change the B the B field equation times the delross operator from0 equals to A now you have the capability to do exactly what th Bearden is mentioning Thomas Bearden I believe was the real deal everything he&#x27;s going to be saying in this video is consistent with the stuff that we have been investigating um this means that we can manipulate gravity in short so let&#x27;s learn how to do it from him right now patters what we are saying now is that if we do this if we make deliberate zeros but we make them with vectors which are still there and active we have a new kind of electromagnetics a third kind and I have dubbed that scalar electromagnetics and I hope the name the reason for the name will become clear a little later I won&#x27;t bother to read that thing we simply have a zero Vector envelope but it&#x27;s the substructure that we have placed within a zero that is fantastic in terms of modern physics we have reached into the virtual world what happens before physical change occurs and we now can deliberately engineer it let me say that again in case it went by you with this simple mechanism with few coils and transistors and so forth by making deliberate zeros we can deliberately engineer the straight injure equation and we can deliberately affect the probabilities of quantum mechanics the hidden variable Theory now becomes directly engineerable and we can deliberately engineer quantum mechanics and schinger equations and the probabilities what does that sound like to you chat to me that sounds like the double slit experiment to me this sounds like rebuilding the wave function now as we listen to this uh you guys have been following along for a while keep in mind all the scientists and Engineers that we&#x27;ve been talking to think about the MH370 investigation the things that I&#x27;ve brought up related to the double slit experiment to uh the wave function rebuilding from the delayed Choice Quantum eraser experiment everything is starting to come together this is the reason why the scientists and Engineers have wanted to talk to us is because I had s sat out there and said we need to understand quantum mechanics we need to understand e r equals epr the idea of what a wormhole really means bending gravity super conductivity and AI all the implications of what I have said what had been statistical before now becomes at least partly deterministic I&#x27;m going to jump now a whole bunch of years in 1921 at the instigation or recommendation of Albert Einstein a man by the name of Kusa succeeded published a paper where he had successfully United Electrical field and gravitational field in a common unified theory 1921 to do that he had add another physical Dimension and a very strange thing emerged chat he added another physical Dimension guys what have I been saying on every podcast adding another dimension space is not empty we can manipulate gravity all of this goes back to 1921 is when the first unification Theory could have potentially already been out there I think the unification theory has been solved multiple times this could be over a hundred years old absolutely incredible there&#x27;s really only one field in nature if you&#x27;re looking at that hyperspace it is the five-dimensional gravitational field and it intersects our world in two things one thing we call the electromagnetic field and the other thing we call the gravitational field in the general sense general relativity the ability to curve and warp and twist SpaceTime itself by the way the electromagnetics just turned out to be the fifth dimensional aspect of that so we added one more space Dimension which we do not see Klein a few years later explained what happened to that Dimension it&#x27;s really rolled up around every little point in our space quite nice mathematically and it&#x27;s real by the way but this the theory languished for many years until really about the early to mid 70s when the new symmetries in the Forefront of physics and particle physics began to see that with that type of geometry you could get in all these weird particles and you could get in all the forces you really could begin to approach a unified theory of all forces of nature and the physicist became very excited the modern Theory a variant of that theory kusine geometry has 11 Dimensions 10 space one time all but the three ordinary space dimensions we see are considered to be rolled up in little circles around every point but with that thing and super gravity you can get in all of the particles and everything we know in physics in a single unified theory and the physicist are excited that&#x27;s the hottest thing in physics they just haven&#x27;t discovered yet that it is directly engineerable in the simplest fashion you ever dreamed of I&#x27;m going to give you a very simple thing now to let you understand what I&#x27;m talking about this is schematic so don&#x27;t think of the thing as being spatially separated between the two little circles on the on the plane the plane represents our Ordinary World the hand represents an extra Dimension so it&#x27;s that fifth dimensional uh geometry that Kusa came up with in 1921 the hand itself represents that fifth dimensional gravitational field which intersects our world in two Fashions one electromagnetic shown by the forefinger extended that intersection and the other by the thumb which is our gravitational field as we see it in the little intersections and both of the intersections by the way at the same point they are not spatially separated normally we don&#x27;t make Vector zeros nobody ever trained us to do that in electromagnetics there is not a single Tech book either physics or electromagnetics in the United States of America or in the western world that dwells upon what you do when you deliberately make such Vector zeros I am almost willing to state that probably not a single Orthodox physicist has made such an experiment if they are it will be only one of two of them but notice what we do if we deliberately zero the electromagnetic intersection which is what we&#x27;re doing when we make the zero but we control what goes into the zero we can put energy in there or we can take the energy out when we do that it&#x27;s coming in and out of the thumb as gravitational energy directly as curvature of SpaceTime now what have we said we have said that rigorously with that simple mechanism I can provide the direct conversion of electromagnetic energy into gravitational field energy or vice versa now if you want to do any gravity gentlemen there it is and the unorthodox researchers have been doing anti-gravity a little bit in this country for a period of years like levitating 65 lounds like plywood which is not magnetic field so with a very simple thing and and look so right there he mentioned um Zero Point Energy as well so this is the idea that if you zero out the the vector potentials now you can put energy into it and take energy out of it and if there&#x27;s no Vector potential for the electric and the magnetic fields then you are tapping into the gravitational potential that was huge I had just now figured that out so this is actually where for sure we are combining the vector we are using the scalar physics which is the uh Electro and magnetic potentials to manipulate gravity and this is where we&#x27;re combining now with the zero point idea as well so there are two things exactly as I was saying is that in order for this to be possible we simply need an extra Dimension and we need to understand that space is not empty in general yeah and real quick uh I have I I actually Florence the Changi just messaged me so for dni yes I know Florence the French uh author she is uh very intelligent okay let&#x27;s keep going looking at it through Modern Eyes and adding that single thing we can now use electromagnetics to make gravitational field energy in the general sense or vice versa we can warp engineer and twist SpaceTime at will as we wish in whatever pattern we wish and it&#x27;s been in the the literature if you cared to notice since 1921 I won&#x27;t dwell on this I will simply state that all that a mass is anyway a a particle of mass is in fact a trap scal of resonance I&#x27;m going to give you a quick once over about scal of resonance we&#x27;ll go on take a normal resonance system with a wave moving back and forth in a cavity so that it&#x27;s in phase and coherent suppose that there were two waves moving along together but the second wave the Electric magnetic field were 180 out and the first one that&#x27;s a scaler resonance system your normal instrument won&#x27;t even see it we can build Special detectors in have that will see it that&#x27;s all the mass is but you can make a current of that kind of resonance and you can pipe that current down a wire or you can add to that resonance in the system or you can take it so I want to play that again I don&#x27;t I hope I don&#x27;t know if he goes back to it but he he mentioned resonance so this part right here now I want you guys to think back to the paper that I posted by Dave Rossi where he talked about oscillations and resonance that&#x27;s required and uh having the the waves make love instead of making war and fighting the difference between an explosion and these Quantum effects that we see I&#x27;m just going to go back right here as well the resonant cavity as well do you guys know what what the resonant cavity reminds you of does anyone in the chat what does the resonant cavity remind you of don&#x27;t worry I&#x27;m going to show you guys what does the resonant hello the resonant cavities doesn&#x27;t this say these are your resonant cavities right here coupled resonant cavities coherent matter wave Beam by locked Martin that is a bingo folks that is a straight up Bingo this is a scalar wave gravitational wave patent essentially that we&#x27;re looking at here in the background locki Martin those are locki Martin orbs locki Martin can manipulate gravity this is 10 microns across that they have created the capability to to uh manipulate gravity through scalar potential through scalar physics the world has no idea it&#x27;s right there chat right there coupled resonant cavities cavity is resonant to either to either the wave individually wave and anti-wave uh superose and move along together back and forth but the second wave the Electric magnetic field were 180 out and the first one that&#x27;s a scaler resonance system your normal instrument won&#x27;t even see it we can build Special detectors in have that will see it that&#x27;s all mass is but you can make a current of that kind of resonance and you can pipe that current down a wire or you can add to that resonance in the system or you can take it away what did I say I said you can pump the mass and inertia directly into an object and increase it or you can pump it out of there and if you pump all of it out of there it&#x27;ll dematerialize on you and the statements I am making are based in part on experimental evidence in the laboratory private proprietary laboratory experimental evidence in the laboratory chat experimental evidence you know who else told us about experimental evidence in the laboratory Dave Rossy when we went on Tim pool this has been figured out this is in the Laboratories this is happening in locky Martin Laboratories probably also happening in north of Grumman all of them I mean it&#x27;s the same Engineers that just go around and yes yatsi this is better than and bingo you guys are correct so that was that&#x27;s huge guys here we go now the scalar wave that is the wave that has a zero resultant for the electric field and a zero resultant for the magnetic field but it&#x27;s composed of components which are waving and and moving and communicating and everything else is the universal wave in the universe totally undiscovered as yet in Western science you can make it for 10 cents on the laboratory bench you can convert a radar very simply to be a Scala radar for example these waves come from and go to the nucleus they go right through the farity cage they do not interact with the electrons unless you have the most extreme nonlinear situation you&#x27;ve ever heard of they don&#x27;t move electrons and you can go right through any farity cage you can go right through the Earth for example and you can go through the ocean with megahertz signals using these techniques as we sit here talking the Soviet Union is communicating worldwide uh as of 10 days ago they were communicating on well over 37 frequencies in their command and control systems for the large weapon systems they built for strategic weapons in this fashion I have a personal friend that can deliver on the Shelf the communication system prototype already built and tested that will prove that statement and I challenge anybody in the United States outside of him at the present time to measure that communication system these are nuclear waves they communicate between nuclei and if you put in that substructure the correct pattern you can go in and transmute elements in modern physics to make a proton a neutron or vice versa all you got to do is flip one quark and that is simply a pattern in the substructure a man was nominated for the Nobel Prize in 1977 for proving that biological systems transmute elements even though they only have molts and microvolts to use and I bet you didn&#x27;t even know that so also what did he just drop there he also just dropped a connection to Bob Greener right there low energy nuclear reactions transmutation and Alchemy in terms of what Bob Greer&#x27;s been looking at into cold fusion and the thunderstorm generator same exact idea that he just dropped uh real quick someone in the chat asked about um Dan Winter uh I think that Dan Winter certainly knows some some stuff uh absolutely a very intelligent person um but uh I tried to avoid some of the esoteric uh elements of stuff and this is what I&#x27;ve said guys and this is just my personal opinion on stuff I think you guys should listen to everybody who&#x27;s out there but uh you know we should TR in my opinion we should not try to connect everything together uh because when we do that we lose a lot of people out there this is already enough for people to try to wrap their brains around I think the idea of scal of physics is enough the idea that we can manipulate gravity then we can work out uh how everything in the whole universe is connected together armst thank you very much uh armstr thank you very much for the donation appreciate it critical hit love you here we go his name was Kon today is dead all the nuclei of the universe are in constant communication much of vacuum SpaceTime is made up of these Scala waves between the nuclei throughout the Universe another thing that came out of the general relativistic wave these are General relativistic waves special relativity does not apply we are always in a curved SpaceTime when we&#x27;re using them uh part of the thing that came out of the theory is you are no longer confined to the speed of light at all if you&#x27;re clever you can get almost any velocity you want to whether it&#x27;s slower in speed of light or faster Tesla for example okay guys he just said that we every point in the universe is connected by scaler waves he just said that we can go faster than the speed of light uh what more do you really need I mean there&#x27;s absolute proof right there the videos uh and what we see is possible uh it&#x27;s incredible mean it&#x27;s the year 2024 right now and that this was almost 40 years ago and no one took this seriously that the the textbooks have been written in a way where people don&#x27;t even know about it Johnny party I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re depressed hopefully this science will cheer you up here we go also I think he he&#x27;s really explained a unification Theory too of general relativity said that this uh does not worry about special relativity it&#x27;s just general relativity who was using these kinds of waves shortly after 1900 and keeping it a deep dark secret Tesla reported speeds off 50 times the speed of light I have personally participated in an experiment which kicked out an electromagnetic wave of this type at eight times the speed of light if you&#x27;ll check the Russian literature and I&#x27;ll give you the references if you&#x27;re interested the speed of light is variable anyway it&#x27;s been known for 80 years by the astronomers that the speed of light in a hard vacuum on the surface of the Earth is a little faster than the speed of light in the deep space away from the charged particles so these are nuclear waves they are not electromagnetic waves that interact with the electron shells they electron they interact with the nuclei and with the internal components of the protein and the neutron okay my Martini is ready to go the speed of light is not a constant he just said the speed of light is a variable that he experimentally uh witnessed speeds uh uh eight times the speed of light so why is that important because we have the permitivity of free space itself so like Dave Rosy pointed out on Tim P if you were to shoot a laser through this V this glass here of my Martini you&#x27;re going to see a refraction of the light because the permitivity is going to change same thing is true of free space free space is not empty remember so the reason why it appears though the speed of light is constant is because we are only witnessing it as it goes through space all the time around us we don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to we can&#x27;t compare it to the speed of light through the ether for example this is very similar to the concept of time dilation time dilation it appears as though time moves fluidly and consistently and and linearly because we&#x27;re all on the surface of the Earth but when we go into outer space we realize oh no time doesn&#x27;t flow consistently similar idea to the idea of the speed of light this is honestly another yatsi moment so I&#x27;m just going to go ahead and say it yatsi let&#x27;s keep going what I have the audacity to say to you is that we now have a tool that we do not have to talk about nuclear physics we can go in there and engineer the nucleus and transmutation is only one of the things that can be done transm El again the basis for this has been well established in the literature since 1921 with these waves you see most of our ideas of the macro world are given to us by the ordinary Photon interaction which is almost always in interaction with the electron shells this is a different order of reality we&#x27;re really dealing now in hyperspaces at least 11 dimensions and the world looks quite different indeed and physical reality in this kind of physics looks quite different indeed from the ideas we have in our head from classical electromagnetics and classical physics and the normal mcro world just as quantum mechanics was a drastic change to classical mechanics this is an even further Dr Mac microscopically Mass appears fluid and changeable who is the person in the chat that just mentioned the idea that uh really mass and matter is oscillations it&#x27;s waves everything is waves um so yeah if we can manipulate Mass if mass is fluid and changeable this is how you can have U macroscopic phase conjugation because if mass is just a wave now we can do the same thing that we would do to Optical phase conjugation essentially we can create a hologram but using actual mass solid state objects this is what salvator Pas was talking about when I asked him can we manipulate and make a solid state object achieve you know a superconductive state not just plasmas not just light can we achieve uh a coherent um coherence amongst the waveform very interesting change to Quantum Mechanics because it makes what had been statistical now deterministic and engineerable I&#x27;m an ER I don&#x27;t want to play statistics I want to make models and I want to make the sucker work the great Cosmic engines of the universe do not operate with the residues of the differential operators making the force field that&#x27;s the garbage that&#x27;s thrown out the great Cosmic engines of the universe operate inside Vector zero systems that includes all the nuclei and the universe and everything inside them that modern physics has found out about okay this kind of wave can be modeled as a longitudinal wave I won&#x27;t go into that whole treatment I&#x27;ll just say that whereas you model the normal wave as a transverse wave you model this one as a longitudinal wave and indeed when you interfere this wave you break up the coherence of the substructure they now no longer sum to zero and guess what that gives you it gives you a non-zero Vector in the E field and the B field out there real energy now appears at a distance out there from a two transmitters or two wave projectors and yet what&#x27;s in the middle is not energy flow in the normal sense that we transmit an ordinary electromagnetic wave it&#x27;s really an artificial potential the closest thing we have to calling it is an electrostatic wave a more accurate description is it is a direct wave in the curvature of space time itself it&#x27;s a general relativistic wave or a gravitational wave so if we have two projectors and they might be two modified radar antenna and we intersect them at a distance we can produce energy at a distance and that energy arises in the SpaceTime of that intersection Zone it doesn&#x27;t matter if that&#x27;s inside a mountain or inside a missile or inside an airplane inside can you imagine using three projectors three let&#x27;s say orbs and having three orbs do the same exact effect to have the vector energy Zone be the plane itself this is why they&#x27;re mapping the the plane this is why they&#x27;re mapping the plane this diagram right here this zone right here is the area around the plane spherically why are they mapping the plane spherically this is why you&#x27;re looking at it right there human body wow I have given you now the secret of how to build Tesla&#x27;s vaed death rate to mow down people by the thousands which you can do with that device right there and you can modify ordinary Radars to do that it has another very nice feature in modern physics SpaceTime has a very high charge very high potential they call it a pseudo potential if I lower the potential of my projectors below zero in other words I make negative potentials and pretty strong negative what happens in the intersection zone is not the appearance of energy but The Disappearance of energy when I bend SpaceTime if I bend it in one fashion the local region looks like a source it looks like it&#x27;s producing energy if I been it the other way it looks like a sink it looks like energy holy crap chat holy crap I get it I get what he&#x27;s talking about what Dave was talking about with fighting they&#x27;re bending the energy around they&#x27;re bending space time around the the local area this is why it&#x27;s an endothermic event they&#x27;re bending around the endothermic event right there let&#x27;s listen to that again holy crap I&#x27;m going to go back like 20 seconds can&#x27;t really go let&#x27;s go back like there below zero in other words I make negative potentials I&#x27;m pretty so he&#x27;s making negative Vector so negative potentials you&#x27;re basically you are ripping through through the fabric of space and time strong negative you can suck the energy section zone is not the appearance of energy but The Disappearance of energy when I bend SpaceTime if I bend it in one fashion the local region looks like a source it looks like it&#x27;s producing energy if I bend it the other way it looks like a sink it looks like energy is disappearing this is real this is general relativity now conservation of energy law and special relativity has gone out the window as is well known in physics in a local gen General relativistic system you do not have to conserve energy at all don&#x27;t cross the what really happens is I either put the energy in here and get it out there or I take it out from there and I get it back here and I better dump it or I&#x27;ll burn out my projectors well it&#x27;s you make a dump and you simply transform it in the other mode and switch it over to the dump that&#x27;s the way the Soviets do it Nature has been doing this all the time in fault zones and stresses in the rocks and all the interference of the scaler potentials that are made there create fields at the distance glowing lights this is a picture of earthquake lights from the US Geological Service there are 1200 locations in the United States alone where you can see glowing balls of energy electromagnetic energy controlled energy at a distance on any decent weather night if you care to go out there and look and take pictures it&#x27;s easy to investigate the so-called Earth stress lights and with this modality by using one additional Thing by using three-dimensional interferometry and using forier expansions multiple frequencies you can make such control balls of electromagnetic energy at a distance just like that like the snap of a finger wow wow we can make balls of energy just like that the snap of the finger we we made the orbs we made those orbs guys we made those orbs I&#x27;m th% sure this is our technology we figured this out I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;ve how we figured it out maybe we had help but uh sorry I have to switch the video real quick oh crap I don&#x27;t know where we were in that last video I forgot I was going to delete the other one these balls of energy that they appear right that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s talking about we can create a ball of energy it&#x27;s ball lightning just like he mentioned just like Bob Greener mentioned is that we can use scal physics it appear this one appears out of the water over here maybe it really did come from a submarine who knows we&#x27;re looking at it right here look at it mapping the plane getting ready to create the negative energy potential right there around the plane it&#x27;s mapping it right there it needs we need to know exactly how big it is it is using AI or some kind of computer system that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing right here mapping the plane no one could have come up with this no one could have faked this video there&#x27;s nobody smart enough on the planet it would only people could have made this is the government just based on the science alone this science isn&#x27;t even really publicly known I didn&#x27;t go back in time unless maybe I do in the future and make this video what if I made these videos in the future that&#x27;d be weird um okay maybe I can&#x27;t rule out that I made the videos let me go back to that sorry guys I have to think uh have been doing this all the time we measure brain WS we measure the residue e field and B field that&#x27;s going on what&#x27;s really going in the brain is all the little ion fields that make electric fields and make magnetic fields that sum to zero the structure of that is the real activity of the human brain I think without dwelling on it that you can see the two cerebral hemispheres make a scalar in aerometer and if those patterns are correct you can project or create energy at a distance like inside a metal object and you can get metal bending that way now the kind of metal bending I&#x27;m talking about is not the amazing Randy bending something on his belt buckle when you&#x27;re not looking at him I&#x27;m talking about what Jack ha does when he takes a control sample and another sample and a little old lady in tennis shoes who just happens to be a fourstar general&#x27;s wife bends that thing which is thick as your little finger and the highest test steel known to Aerospace industry bends that thing in a angle and it turns blue sorry to pause it here but alien scientist said you can make them by just crossing two lasers I&#x27;m going to pull this up over here by Crossing two lasers the fourer series is used for the talking plasma balls so they can transmit sound through the lasers and Jeremy did you dude I don&#x27;t know if you looked earlier when he talks about the resonant cavities dude the this coherent matter wave beam 100% this is this is the money this is the [ __ ] money I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m swearing on YouTube but honestly I just don&#x27;t even care at this point I don&#x27;t care about monetization holy crap guys wow I mean h how can the videos be fake if everything matches up the science matches up we&#x27;ve got secret scaler physics it&#x27;s not even a secret it&#x27;s been known since 1921 unification theories have been out there since 1921 come on man what the hell takes both samples the control sample and that sample back to the laboratory sections and looks at them under the electron microscope and the one that is the controlled sample has the normal grain structure the one that is the one that&#x27;s Bent by the human being for real not fakery has no grain structure the grain structure has been destroyed it looks like the surface of the Moon has been subjected to intense Point Heating throughout the grain structure I have just given you the physical mechanism and the physics by which the body is able to do that it is real it is not a fake Jack Hal I believe so that image that he just showed right there I&#x27;m going to go back 10 seconds so this now makes me wonder if I start wondering about the esoteric when I look at this I think I saw Tubac Cabra in the chat a second ago two hemispheres of the brain creating an intometal you know this makes me wonder about the idea of Are We creating our own reality with our brains it makes me wonder about the idea of even esoteric Concepts like psychic powers and remote viewing and things like that where you know are we manifesting our thre dimensional world are we tapping in to the underlying framework of the construct that we live in to paint our reality with our minds themselves uh very wild thoughts out here and I&#x27;m trying not to push too much in the esoteric aspect but this certainly opens the door yeah Jeremy the question here is how do we reproduce this in the lab how do we reproduce this with uh commercially available equipment that doesn&#x27;t cost millions of dollars locked Martin has the the equipment in the labs that they can produce this type of stuff and these types of effects I it makes me wonder if there&#x27;s even a situation where we just need to be able to produce the Baseline like can we just prove that the speed of light is not constant if we can just prove the speed of light&#x27;s not constant that&#x27;s also honestly enough this is just this is wild I have just given you the physical mechanism and the physics by which the body is able to do that it is real it is not a fake Jack Hal I believe does he not work for your company excellent fellow excellent scientist I won&#x27;t dwell on what all else the biological system can do with that let us suffice to say that we can derive rigorously in terms of physics not metaphysics guys look at this list pyro or psychokinesis PR precognition postcognition postcognition Clairvoyance telepathy I don&#x27;t even know what firew walking is but that sounds a pretty sweet superpower and then metal bending this is like Erie Geller man maybe we owe Erie Geller an apology all of the mechanisms for apparent psychology well if you were weaponizing that for a big weapon if you hit this thing explosively where your projectors and you fire two pulses so the pulses meet an interesting thing occurs if you fire it in the high potential mode you get an electromagnetic explosion at a distance if you fire in the low potential mode you get a cold explosion at a distance the sudden withdrawal of energy in the intersection Zone well we need to mark that one down right there uh low potential you get a sudden suction of energy absorption of energy at a distance uh does that sound like anything uh that is relevant sounds exactly like our videos chat uh I can&#x27;t switch over to the videos right now because I have this one up both types of weapons widely deployed by the Soviet Union and tested uh the recent some years back so-called booms off the east coast some of those were seen as flashes estimated to be about 100 uh tons of TNT equivalent were actually the orientation and alignment of such housers from the Soviet Union they have had such housers since April 1963 specifically the first operation test was April the 11th 1963 100 Mil north of Puerto Rico the most dramatic uh expression of the cold explosion in recent times occurred on April the 9th 1984 and the papers fortunately won&#x27;t let this one go off the coast of Japan about 150 or 200 mil well really 200 miles from downtown Tokyo out near the Kos a sudden gigantic explosive eruption occurred above the water a cloud so to speak very dense Rose rapidly to 60,000 ft and 150 mile diameter this is the other clip that I posted guys uh remember I don&#x27;t know if you guys remember several weeks ago maybe a month or two ago I posted about this where the pilots witnessed this event happened in the cold event and they said they saw a Halo type of event he&#x27;s talking about the I didn&#x27;t realize that&#x27;s the situation he&#x27;s talking about the J flight this might be an actual situation where this type of Technology not the exact technology with the orbs but similar technology was used on another plane wow what did he say Jal 35 in 1984 or 36 we&#x27;re we&#x27;re going to find that 5 747s out there one of which was piloted by a former B-52 pilot who thought he&#x27; just seen the most massive nuclear explosion you ever saw it had the mushroom shape uh prepared evasive action turned off course put on oxygen Mass prepared and braced for a shock wave which never came there was no flash this was the cold explosion a laser physicist friend of mine that I&#x27;m working with in California in the laboratory where we&#x27;re using only mwatts at best and we&#x27;re using distances about that far has done a little cold explosion over dish of water and you get the mushroom cloud exactly like that Rising guys the weird part about this this is what uh Katherine T saw Katherine T says she saw a dome like almost looked like a oil rig on the horizon an orange one which would have been consistent with the gas spreading out after the plane disappeared man that&#x27;s weird wow that thing was called Everything Under the Sun bubbling gas you know uh plumes all sorts of things it was a cold explosion the ocean there is 21,000 ft deep it&#x27;s too deep for submarines indicates it was a man-made phenomenon but it didn&#x27;t end there Dr Daniel Walker and colleagues who have access to sophisticated underwater acoustic equipment and seismic equipment did a complete study on that thing it&#x27;s published in the journal science recently a matter acoustic equipment this was 1985 guys This is 40 years ago they had acoustic Advanced acoustic equipment back then that could detect seismic activity what do you think we have in 2014 when the plane disappeared there&#x27;s no way they don&#x27;t know what exactly what happened to this plane they&#x27;ve been lying about it they&#x27;ve been covering up scaler physics a fact after his study he successfully ruled out any kind of ordinary known natural phenomenon so we&#x27;re left with a conclusion that he and his colleagues made it&#x27;s either a man-made phenomenon or an as yet unknown natural phenomenon we shouldn&#x27;t have too many natural phenomenon unknown real quick and we&#x27;ll come right back to this guys I want to address what Jeremy just said in the chat I think it&#x27;s important because I&#x27;ve been wondering about it myself so he said I still think they could have opened up an invisibility cloak around the plane these three spheres might be how to set up the plat plasma Fields if they had laser induced plasma bubble around the plane they could cause whatever&#x27;s inside to disappear I&#x27;ve been wondering about this myself especially as I&#x27;ve been digging into the advanced science and looking at stuff like Optical phase conjugation um the thing is the difference between a cloaking field and teleportation when you have access to gravitational manipulation is almost just a matter of terminology at that point this is why I find the Philadelphia Experiment so interesting because they&#x27;re trying to cloak the plane and hi or cloak the ship and hide the ship and instead they teleport it I think it&#x27;s almost just a matter of semantics uh so that&#x27;s why weirdly when people say oh they had some Advanced cloaking technology that they were using it&#x27;s really just a matter of like I think that yes that&#x27;s consistent with what we&#x27;re seeing in these videos the plane is just going somewhere else but there&#x27;s also a time dilation effect which basically makes it teleportation this is why it&#x27;s not a a breakdown of all of the matter and a rebuilding of the matter it&#x27;s a matter of a warp uh bubble around the plane which yes in theory it does cloak the plane absolutely the only reason why I would I don&#x27;t really call it cloaking is because like I said we see the smoke Trail stop and that&#x27;s why if it was like more of traditional cloaking like an invisibility cloak around the plane you should still see the smoke coming out of the back of it but I think you could still argue you know from a logical perspective that what we&#x27;re looking at here is some type of cloaking effect effect that&#x27;s happening so also I just want to say hi to uh Alien scientists and uh crypto Alchemist and the new people have been jumping in the chat as well he also said I think cloaking is much easier to pull off than teleportation yeah I agree I agree I&#x27;m keeping my mind open in terms of exactly what type of effect they&#x27;re doing to this plane uh but they definitely use some crazy advanced anti-gravitational technology that we don&#x27;t really understand that seems to be based on scalar physics on the plane No Doubt whatever you want to call it or whatever doesn&#x27;t matter to me I I don&#x27;t care and they definitely covered that [ __ ] up no question holy crap guys that explode for 150 miles particularly when it&#x27;s happened several times before in the open literature that is a rigorous paper published in the journal science uh science very recently unfortunately the journal saw fit to turned down my colleague and my explanation of what was going on and a complete date list of incidents and history and types of Soviet weapons to back it up here&#x27;s just one more incident to show you that these types of sudden mushroom rises from the ocean or near the ocean above the ocean in gigantic size have occurred repeatedly with other suspicious incidents that particular earthquake is highly suspect can you not see that if I dump energy with very powerful radiators and continue to dump energy energy on both sides of a fault Zone it doesn&#x27;t matter where the extra energy comes from with a piz electric effect I&#x27;m transforming that into mechanical stress and if I do that long enough and build up enough energy that plate is going to slip and you&#x27;ll get a natural earthquake natural looking earthquake manmade that&#x27;s how wow guys this is getting weird he just explained how we can make an earthquake happen you take the fault lines right so we got your your plates that are touching together right like this and we build up the P of electric energy on either side and you can force them to rumble to interact to cause an earthquake uh along the fault lines absolutely we should be able to do this now that I think about it it seems trivial but here&#x27;s the weirdest part about the reason why I&#x27;m bringing it up remember the letter to Ashton Forbes what were the two videos that came out after that I think they were actually connected to what they were trying to send me I think that letter might be real the one right after was about the glitter conspiracy people looked into the glitter conspiracy and they found out the government was buying up the glitter and the glitter was being used for some secret purpose potentially related to cloaking and then the next letter was the one about Chan Thomas and what was Chan Thomas doing he was using electrical engineering to predict earthquakes I actually think this stuff might be real holy crap you make earthquak Quakes well if you do it in the cold explosion you&#x27;re going to have to dump a lot of that energy when it&#x27;s 150 Mi across that is one whale of a lot of energy that you suddenly extract it and here it comes it&#x27;s headed for you it&#x27;ll simply melt your projectors unless you dump it somewhere so you switch the projector into the transmit mode and you catch it and hold it in the storage Bank temporarily and then you fire it off somewhere where it won&#x27;t do any harm like Ben it Island here is an exhaust that is 150 Mi long seen by our weather satellites from a site that repeatedly exhibits these almost 100 now that we&#x27;ve seen this particular exhaust is about one a little over one degree above the horizontal now volcanoes don&#x27;t do that they don&#x27;t look like that let&#x27;s see the next slide from the same island we see double Puffs indicating the in aerometer transmitters we see M multiple Puffs within them sometimes and in fact the satellites have even from time to time caught the actual burst showing that it&#x27;s an explosive beginning of the exhaust guys this is why we&#x27;re using infrared to scan the world you ever wonder why we&#x27;re using infrared to uh scan the world with our satellites while we&#x27;re using infrared with our drones because infrared can pick this kind of stuff up that&#x27;s why we have a multi-spectral camera you always wonder one thing I wondered when I first saw the Fleer videos the Navy F Fleer videos was why are we not looking optically wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to look in optically the answer is no no we want to look in infrared because we&#x27;re going to see more Spectrum now this is why because we&#x27;ve known about scaler physics we&#x27;ve known about the capability not just from us but from our adversaries as well and we want to be able to pick that up anywhere now there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind at this point that the cers system is in video no question it&#x27;s video it can pick up a missile launch the missile launch stuff is just a cover that&#x27;s what the the normies the public thinks out there is oh it&#x27;s going to pick up a missile launch out there and follow the missile right away Putin&#x27;s talking about hypersonics this is well beyond just shooting a missile in the sky and having to shoot over to us guys we&#x27;re talking about causing earthquakes and natural disasters we&#x27;re talking about having energy be uh sucking energy out of a system and then taking that energy building it up and then shooting it out this is like X-Men this is like uh really just crazy advanced stuff and very consistent with what Bob greenier was talking about as well with this idea of taking a faucet if you guys watch hard truths podcast number two and letting it build up and it builds up and as it builds up over time you essentially have infinite energy that you can build up into your system crazy these are weather satellites us weather satellites they are not classified unfortunately they&#x27;re from way out there we need some low-level satellite for photography which I simply do not have would be interesting to look at it if I had it here&#x27;s one where the explosive burst was caught just erupting from the item these things here Blaze away sometimes for hours and hours and days at a time with those kinds of massive exhausts of heat and energy I&#x27;ll show you where they&#x27;re pulling out the yeah and real quick to what Anthony just said multispectral I&#x27;m betting that that includes UV and terahertz as well so I think those cameras are much more advanced than just simple IR cameras and this is why we&#x27;re seeing the smoke come out of the back of the plane I think that the corridor crew and the lore Lodge do have one uh point which is that a commercial infrared camera does not pick up smoke uh it it just essentially can see through smoke but these are not basic infrared cameras these are multispectral cameras and the whole point is they&#x27;re trying to pick up energetic events and neg entropy events like we see in the videos so this is something that is well beyond anything that&#x27;s available in the public um and if we were to see the specifications of those cameras I guarantee we are going to see the smoke coming out of the plane in those cameras in what they&#x27;re doing with it uh that&#x27;s about the plumes just to show you that way back there from those exhaust plumes off that Island we had some airplanes flew through it they&#x27;re mostly ice particles from the expansion and so forth as you would expect when you&#x27;ve dumped a phenomenon actually you entrain a lot of the cold air you get circulations you get all kinds of effect effect there so you do get a lot of ice formed a little mud and this kind of thing there is a second candidate right now courtesy of some effort by Tom Harold and some kind folks um up at the SAT the satellite imagery outfit uh this one shows and I can&#x27;t Ben begin to pronounce that name can you say that for me off the slide no Z novaya Zima which is an island north of the Soviet Union up in the Arctic Circle there not too far really as a geographical distance goes from Bennett Island and here again on the extreme left you see another exhaust and you see the gigantic weather circulation that so much additional energy being poured in the area causes you see the swirl all the way around the thing stripping uh Vapor energy and vapor water and so forth from the snow and ice and everything else okay well in the mid 70s we got a shock suddenly the communication systems throughout the world and the communications band that is from 5 to 30 MHz were widely being interrupted by extremely powerful signals coming from the Soviet Union to my knowledge we have not yet located the transmitters you guys just hear what he just said remember when uh AT&amp;T and them went out uh a few weeks ago and people trying to say oh it was a sun chronal mass ejection from the sun no it wasn&#x27;t sorry to uh be the bear of bad news more than likely that was either a hack or that was a manipulation of scaler physics that was being used to attack us I also think we have to be 100% clear about okay the boat incident that happened recently with the bridge um that absolutely could have been a hack now I&#x27;m not saying it was could have been an accident but absolutely could have been a hack I think that we have to look at the lens of the world through political uh aspirations and uh Espionage for sure especially now going forward they had many resemblances to what we call an over the rising radar so we promptly lab labeled them an over theising radar the so-called woodpecker signals name from the chirp signal that sounds like a woodpecker&#x27;s beak hitting a flat block you can hear them out there most every night chattering away still interfering in fact they now sell the ham radio operators filters so that it operates through that filter in that region but what they actually did shortly before the death of bref they started adjusting across guys the other thing I&#x27;m thinking of this is the Russian harp now I&#x27;m really wondering about Antarctica I think I&#x27;m going to talk to Chad and Sherry and get back on the investigate Earth podcast next week and talk about Antarctica we&#x27;ve probably got some crazy crap going on in down in Antarctica and I think the location is not a coincidence either it makes sense if you look at the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field um the magnetic field would be the weakest potentially the North and South Pole so maybe anarctica has a a specific strategic purpose for being that location the United States a great interference pattern from multiple transmitters of the Woodpecker Radars now I&#x27;m not interested except for biological effects which can be damaging in the conventional e b f signals on that radar but we don&#x27;t have anybody who&#x27;s measuring the scalar component the substructure in the zero they don&#x27;t even have the instruments to do it if they wish such instruments provided I have a friend who do it for Price not me he will he built the instruments and and designed them but what they&#x27;re doing here is the substructure interference which is important because that&#x27;s where all the real energy is you can put as as much energy as you wish into that substructure and the normal instrument will not even see it it won&#x27;t even detect It Anyway where the interference was if you&#x27;ll check the Woodpecker signals you&#x27;ll see that&#x27;s a type of interference pattern they set up an interference pattern over the us and it left signals signatures when you adjust these things and you adjust with little slips you pop out energy you get rumbles and Booms and air Quakes and all this and those things happened from Florida North Alabama Virginia all up through the Carolinas up through mid England up through the middle of the country Texas all over West Coast everywhere these mysterious cracks and rumbles and Booms and pops and snaps everywhere while they were adjusting the grid well they got it adjusted by shortly after the end of the year that is in early 1983 they got this thing adjusted and they started pouring it on us so that spring early spring you had extremely severe flooding because what they did you simply determine by your timing and interferometry and 4A transforms which one of the grid cells you want to activate and they&#x27;re much finer than this by the way over Huntsville Alabama a friend and I saw this grid from Horizon to Horizon in even ploud field rows north to south and from Horizon to Horizon in even ploud roads from east to west and that is not natural does not happen anyway what they did is you if you take energy out of one cell that produces a low Zone a low pressure Zone if you add energy produces a high pressure Zone I think you can see if I scan my radar rotate it the beam either electromagnetically or rotate the antenna gently and move those highs and lows alone I can direct and capture and control the jet streams and that&#x27;s exactly what they did the jet streams had a classic bin dipping way down south abnormally far and then roaring up the Adera chain and so we had all kinds of good weather following that pattern and the deviation of the jet streams even the journal science has published an article from a study that shows in the last decade the variation in the weather over North America has been greater than can be statistically expected except once in 1200 years that summer we got a drought if you recall we lost half the corn crop in the United States in one Summer from the extreme drought when you form one of the patterns you get a signature in the clouds you see a little droplet of water is formed around a dust particle a little droplet of ice that&#x27;s cold enough and it makes a little transistor or a little diode in the middle and that thing forms its own little e field and these things line up and what you get is you get a ring almost a complete ring about 2/3 of a ring of clouds like geometrically drawn around the peak where the energy is is being manipulated and you get radial lines thin radial lines running directly away 10 or 15 miles sort of like the old Rising Sun symbol in World War II we saw these all over the United States here&#x27;s one taking a block and a half from my home by the time I could run in and get my camera it had passed just over the mountain but you can see those are Cloud streamers those are not light rays these are not crepuscular waves at all these are Cloud Rays these are radials giant radials I then went ahead and chased that thing over the mountain to get a little better shot of it they had cut the energy so the middle ring filled up but the Rays were still apparent in the next slide although I&#x27;m now shooting at an extreme distance uh through a telescopic lens but you can see if the lights were a little dimmer you could see the crosshatch interference pattern in the streamers also so we have both the streamers and we have the crosshatch interference pattern existing in the clouds that&#x27;s over Huntsville Alabama here&#x27;s one that a correspondent sent in and again we have dim light the clouds are actually more prominent than that from California they were seeing them all over the United States these very prominent very significant patterns everywhere I went on radio uh KABC in Los Angeles calling everybody&#x27;s attention to this two or three times delivered papers at a couple of symposia and we saw a change we saw the dog on thing start getting active most of the time at night there&#x27;s another pattern sometimes they use two patterns close together when that happens the internal Rings go out and the Rays become much thicker and they become absolutely boat tailed toward the center now when they cut the power the center fills up immediately with clouds I have been unfortunate and although I have seen classic ones of this I have not yet got a decent picture I will show you what I have which is not a good photograph and the photographs then therefore should not be accepted as proof until I get better photographs which I will do sooner or later again multiple Witnesses over Huntsville Alabama good friend of mine and I saw this very early in the morning this system motoring along absolutely classic I was very hard pressed that day on my normal job and did not take off from work and go home and get my camera I have regretted it ever since deeply I didn&#x27;t realize how rare the phenomenon was going to be to be able to get one that perfect but it was absolutely Flawless and it looked just like that right over huntville Alabama moving along at oh 20 to 30 m hour a second one came over later that day there&#x27;s the dates and the time uh in their weather control if you recall they gave us anomalous winter the very cold December snap of 1983 which broke all the records everywhere many of them since records had been kept on the cold and that was deliberately engineered they left signatures before they did it with these kinds of things all over the us we saw the same day a remnants of a second Twin giant radial system that motored along across Huntsville Alabama now here is one they&#x27;ve cut the power but the system persists for a while it it&#x27;ll possess for several hours but it&#x27;ll fill in it will lose its classic shape but you know even the field in picture is better than no picture but I don&#x27;t have a lens which will take the entire Sky I need a fishee which I&#x27;m going to get as soon as I can afford it but what I want to show you is this is on the I believe the Northeast here and I&#x27;m want to focus your attention here over to the right you will see the lines of the clouds going there they go all over the sky back to the other radial on the other side complete sorry I was muted there um Jeremy I wanted to ask you do you think that the what he just showed with the the trails in the sky right here do you think this can explain contrails in terms of what people see in the sky uh it makes me wonder because I don&#x27;t think that what we see can be explained solely based on uh like plan seating the sky it makes me think that electromagnetic effects are more um Can can explain this in a much better way than like just oh we&#x27;re shooting planes or we&#x27;re seing the sky with chemicals and stuff that are out there uh Jeremy as well because you guys can&#x27;t see the chat if you&#x27;re watching right now uh mentioned that Eric Hecker uh the person that went on Shan Ryan and blew the whistle on Antarctica uh first came onto one of alien scientist Jeremy Reese&#x27;s live streams and called into his show said he was blown away if you guys haven&#x27;t been following alien scientist definitely check him out um in the comments I was pointing out that I think that 90% or more of the UFO Community is full of crap um it&#x27;s not that I think that they are lying I just think that they don&#x27;t understand the implications of all of this if you are absorbing this information like I am absorbing this information right now uh then you can realize like the huge implications of this this means that what the public sees is just a small fraction of the global Espionage and covert actions that are happening all the time in the whole world Imagine manipulating the weather manipulating the weather it&#x27;s almost April and it&#x27;s there&#x27;s like a foot of snow outside where I&#x27;m at right now um you could see why Russia would want to manipulate this especially given their climate you could see why any country would want to manipulate it in fact I would imagine that they would come into some kind of stalemate where they say hey chill out on manipulating my weather chill out on the earthquakes Etc uh pretty wild stuff I mean the implications this are huge and then when you add in the element of a non-human intelligence potentially visiting us this is we&#x27;re talking about like magic and wondering whether or not our government really is controlled by a higher power that we have no visibility to whatsoever incredible stuff let&#x27;s keep going want to focus your attention here over to the right you will see the lines of the clouds going there they go all over the sky back to the other radial on the other side completely over your head is this giant radial connected up to two points even though it&#x27;s filling in now because the power has been cut in this Photograph we&#x27;re just a little bit back around from where we were to the left to show that the same Cloud streaks and radials are going over on the left and they go completely across we about 15 miles to the next point the next radial intersection where they link up so real quick no wonder we are scanning the ionosphere all the time because we&#x27;re we&#x27;re scanning the ionosphere because we want to see if our enemies are using scalar physics against us we want to see if they are manipulating grav gravity if they are manipulating the weather if they are manipulating earthquakes we want to try to be able to detect it instantly because this becomes National Defense at this point everything seems to boil onto National Security and National Defense now we&#x27;ll show that other linkage down on the other end as a separate shot and that&#x27;s really as you can see it does go on down there and link up it&#x27;s just beyond the tree line where it links it&#x27;s faded on that end pretty good but we had a whole two radial system a poor picture here I admit but having seen much better ones than this when I did not have a camera or access to one I can only tell you that in the future future I will show you a decent photograph if they keep this thing up over Huntsville Alabama long enough he keeps mentioning Huntsville Alabama guys you look up Huntsville Alabama that&#x27;s where a NASA Marshall Space laboratory is I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a coincidence it&#x27;s it&#x27;s always Huntsville Alabama and Los Alamos and this is where uh and I think Jeremy&#x27;s kind of pulled back a little bit on his position on Bob Lazar but I think Bob Lazar is being truthful about his opinion whether or not he&#x27;s been fed some disinformation I think is a different question but I think he really did work at Los Alamos and I think that those are the two locations um NASA Marshall in Huntsville Alabama and Los Alamos if they&#x27;re putting the stuff together to build orbs or do whatever they got to do those are the places where I&#x27;m first checking out and if Tom Harold and other assorted Good stal Fellows help may keep watch for them when I&#x27;m working inside and not out looking at Sky well you wonder what happened to you on February the 1st let me tell you what happened to you on February the 1st on December the 8th they started this little goodie out in California they were having these little rumbles and cracks and pops and snaps off the coast there from Cal from Los Angeles they had it for about a week off and on I was there on the radio show delivering an address on free energy went on another show to try to explain what these things was and I predicted based on this that they had finished a adjusting the grid and there would be a violent or drastic change in the weather within 48 hours I went on the radio and I made that statement and the radio announcer said you sound like a whacko and cut me off that&#x27;s some of the mild things I&#x27;ve been caused it does not matter I operate on the thing that if the experiments keep working and they contradict the theory the true scientific method says You must change the theory not insist that the experiment is false if it continues to be replicated so what happened was they then when they got it adjusted a high wind came up very suddenly totally unexpected blew down all the trees on the boulevards they had wrecks and everything I was there during this process and it was within 48 hours from that prediction violent sort of wind storms winds got very high in the Los Angeles area and all the orange trees were laying over flat everywhere through the boulevards it went on down in Texas spawn tornadoes and roared up the Adera chain and then they bent the jet stream in the most anomalous fashion they bent that sucker right down the west coast of the United States all the way down to the bottom and turned it and went across the bottom skimming across just above the bottom of imagine you can manipulate electromagnetic potentials and you can create a gravitation or not a gravitation but an electromagnetic bubble so so you imagine like there&#x27;s a bubble right here where I&#x27;m I&#x27;m scrolling the mouse through you can see how you can manipulate the jet stream right is if you made a bubble right here in the middle of the United States you can manipulate jet stream and by this you can manipulate the weather it&#x27;s not a matter of saying okay I&#x27;m going to make it rain right here but it&#x27;s more of a matter and although you probably can at this point if with the right quantum computers and precision possibly pull that off but it&#x27;s more of a matter of just changing it right changing the direction of travel of the jet stream in general certainly seems within the realm of possibility given the science that we&#x27;ve been looking at here tonight Texas and then roaring up the ader chain I&#x27;ve never seen that fashion before but they set about doing that in December 1984 they kept playing with the jet stream they did all kinds of nice experiments they split the thing into two they made it form into wise and looked like they were just checking out to see what all they could do but with this fashion here what you do is when you turn you entrain circulation from way out over the Pacific as shown by the purple arrows you pull moisture all the way from out in the Pacific and suck it up right across the United States and if you do the the neat little trick with the coal stuff you get enough coal stuff bent down from Canada and the Arctic here guess what you&#x27;re going to get with all that moisture you&#x27;re going to get snow and ice and February the first they let us have it and that&#x27;s our Infamous ice storm right here in Huntsville Alabama all this was going on just before that having gone several days without power myself uh I am very sympathetic to the fact that I don&#x27;t like that and I hope you didn&#x27;t either but that was given to you courtesy of the hammer and sickle boys okay there are a couple other little in just for a little goodies you may or may not have seen the paper on the Associated Press release but I&#x27;ll guys I love he calls him hammer and sickle boys I love Thomas beardson I wish I could have met this guy Thomas beard and sorry um I just love everything about this guy give you the mechanism and everybody else will tell you I&#x27;m totally crazy and I&#x27;ll say to you then you explain it or ask them to love it and listen to their jaw fly open and find out they have no explanation at all because this explanation isn&#x27;t in the textbook the Navy was having a chaff drop off the coast from San Diego a very Str and sudden and unexpected wind again arose you know when we form these lows wind rushes in so we got another one and here came a signature a sudden strange unexpected wind caught the entire chaff Cloud they were about 150 Mi off the coast there and blew the thing in towards San Diego now this is the standard microwire cha actually with a dialectric with a coating on it there&#x27;s a certain way it&#x27;s structured for some kinds of chaff that we have shown in the laboratory will reflect a scal wave I won&#x27;t go into that that&#x27;s proprietary to my friend imagine every little piece of chaff up there if the bandwidth if a scaler signal in that frequency in its bandwidth that it&#x27;s cut for is there it will reflect it that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re saying and from any two of those things randomly wiggling and jiggling around you&#x27;re going to have random intersections and interferences from the reflected scaler beams and in that little random interference Zone you&#x27;re going to get a sudden flash a sudden Sparkle it won&#x27;t be visual but a sudden production of ordinary electromagnetic energy and so imagine a Zone around the cha cloud with little twinkles if you could see ordinary electromagnetic energy if you if you could see them as visual things twinkling and twinkling away and these represents little instantaneous kindling of energy points when they move through the system area they appear in the SpaceTime farity cages and your Emi shielding we all use in military equipment have absolutely Zero Effect on them they knocked out over 60 thou power to over 60,000 homes in San Diego and you had the strange thing of the part of the city uh very angry at the Navy and claiming the Navy had done this and the Navy set out an investigation in and got the foggiest notion what happened I just told you what happened and gave you did he just mention glitter uh we&#x27;re going to go back to that for a second 4653 I&#x27;m going to go back J AK Philly fans saying something about Glitter here then you explain it or ask them to I want to listen to that one more time and listen to their jaw fly open and find out they have no explanation at all because this explanation isn&#x27;t in the textbook the Navy was having a chaff drop chaff equals glitter chaff equals glitter is what people are saying in the chat pretty wild yeah the glitter thing in the glitter conspiracy to me seems very relevant we&#x27;re doing something with glitter that I don&#x27;t fully understand Bearden is deceased and yes uh Dave Rosy did meet him I know that for a fact um yeah he passed away a few years ago I wish I would have met this guy I kind of feel like The Reincarnation of him to some degree I&#x27;m not nearly as smart as him but wow go a very strange and sudden and unexpected wind again arose you know when we form these lows wind rushes in so we got another one and here came a signature a sudden strange unexpected wind caught the entire chaff Cloud they were about 150 Mi off the coast there and blew the thing in towards San Diego now this is the standard microwire chaff actually with a dialectric with a coating on it there&#x27;s a certain way it&#x27;s structured for some kinds of chaff that we have shown in the laboratory will reflect a scaler wave I won&#x27;t go into that that&#x27;s holy crap did you guys just hear that they can manipulate glitter to create a dialectric wave for scalar potentials wait what how are they using it so imagine like glitter is like a little magnet a tiny little magnet someone walk me through how they&#x27;re using this I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t understand the application of it but it seems very relevant here proprietary to my friend imagine every little piece of chaff up there if the bandwidth if a scaler signal in that frequency in its bandwidth that it&#x27;s cut for is there it will reflect it wow if it&#x27;s cut for a specific frequency or bandwidth it will reflect it no wonder we&#x27;re buying up glitter holy that the glitter thing is a serious serious thing serious conspiracy holy [ __ ] holy crap the glitter thing is real huh the Chan Thomas and the glitter thing were not a joke whoever sent me the letter knew about all this ahead of time they knew about this ahead of time there&#x27;s the only that&#x27;s the only way this really Narrows down the number of possibilities in terms of who could have sent me the letter there&#x27;s it wasn&#x27;t a coincidence that they sent me the glitter conspiracy and they sent me the chant thas thing they wanted me to figure this out they they wanted me to figure this out they wanted us to know the truth holy crap that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re saying so imagine imagine for a second I&#x27;ll visualize it for you that you take am Mount of glitter and you throw it in the sky and it rains down you&#x27;re raining down glitter this is going to reflect waves that are trying to bounce off of it this is essentially this basic mechanism that he&#x27;s talking about here yeah and to Jeremy is saying this video is super old this is from 1985 this video is from 1985 holy crap and from any two of those things randomly wiggling and jiggling around you&#x27;re going to have random intersections and interferences from the reflected scalar beams and in that little random interference Zone you&#x27;re going to get a sudden flash a sudden Sparkle it won&#x27;t be visual but a sudden production of ordinary electromagnetic energy and so imagine a Zone around the chaff cloud with little twinkles if you could see ordinary electromagnetic energy if you if you could see them as visual things twinkling and twinkling away and these represents little instantaneous kindling of energy points when they move through the system area they appear in the SpaceTime farity cages and your Emi shielding we all use in military equipment have absolutely zero effect on them they knocked out over 60 thou power to over 60,000 homes in San San Diego and you had the strange thing of the part of the city uh very angry at the Navy and claiming the Navy had done this and the Navy set out an investigation in and got the foggiest notion what happened I just told you what happened and gave you the mechanism that isn&#x27;t all that happens I hope you realize that I am stating so the chaff Cloud can be used as like a jamming so you can drop the chaff Cloud to interfere with the electromagnet and scaler potential waves that they are trying to manipulate the weather or whatever else you can think of it as like a countermeasure for the effects of uh the Espionage that might be curring at the highest levels to manipulate the weather as well as to create earthquakes you drop the chaff down and it&#x27;s now going to bounce all the the waves all over the place scatter them in every direction now it can also create if you would think of it as like a a dead zone around the area where you dro the chaff pretty wild chaff is glitter turned into radar such as enemy migs missile locking on radar frequency the enemy aircraft gets a missile lock on you you release a chaff exactly exact same concept right is that you&#x27;re getting to say okay you&#x27;ve got a lock you&#x27;ve sent your beam your your uh wave at the object and well I&#x27;m going to have scatter it I&#x27;m going to confuse it so that it doesn&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s going to go the the heat the heat seeking missile uh will chase the chaff instead absolutely that in my opinion Soviet Union has been waging a certain kind of undeclared war on the United States for a period of over two decades and that several hundred people have already died in that war American citizens illegally all of you recall the mysterious airliner The Airliner that fell mysteriously rather for six miles and about uh couple of minutes what happened well he&#x27;s motoring along up there coming in towards Los Angeles he&#x27;s out of San Francisco there he hits a sudden little pocket of turbulence ringing the bells some interference going on where the energy doesn&#x27;t zero anymore and you get an energy one fashion or the other or ripples turbulence all of a sudden one engine Flames out just past that well one of the things that&#x27;ll Kindle this stuff into being is a plasma or a flame the fierce flame in a jet engine you know the plasma that it form so to speak the ions you can get the same effect in the ions a Geer tube for example will detect a Geer counter will detect these it doesn&#x27;t detect nuclear radiation detects its own ionization this will give you additional ionization or kill ionization and the tube will detect that so one engine flamed out and then all the other fell all the others failed and this thing fell the pilot struggled with the airplane began to regain control as he got much lower down around 15,000 ft meanwhile the landing gear come down the door falling off damaged the tail he finally got control of the thing down around 11,000 ft some control the engines began to restart and at about 9,000 ft he got her under control again and managed to fly that thing into San Francisco the nearest airport land it left a signature now they&#x27;re going to say the pilot did that I&#x27;m going to tell you what happened in my opinion understand what actually happened was as I described it from the scaler stuff that was up there it happened to be at the right frequency when he it was a high interference Zone well up there he was flying at 41,000 ft he was way up there when he passed out of the interference Zone the stuff started dying back out it charges Mass just like a capacitor it has a discharged time constant we&#x27;ve proven that when it discharged the effect the plane was then a normal type of flame exhaust and so the thing could start again now it left a signature the instruments on the airplane disagreed with one another because the electromagnetic response of an instrument or the components of an instrument to scaler is not in the specifications for that component in the future we will be able eventually to buy a components where that the second order effects the scaler effects are controlled and we&#x27;ll buy them to those specs also right now you can&#x27;t do that so some of the he just named dropped second order effects as well so what else is a second order effect is a hologram where a hologram is the potential where you&#x27;re create a 3D object out of a 2d picture using lasers using light Etc second order effects is extremely important here in terms of what we&#x27;re talking about I&#x27;m also now extremely skeptical of if Air France 447 uh was not a victim of this kind of Technology the official story behind air France air uh 447 was that the pilots forgot which way up was how here&#x27;s another explanation they got hit by some kind of scaler wave and the plane got crashed how do you know the difference the instruments will respond one way and some will respond the other way the flight instruments told the pilot and crew one thing and the flight recor told an entirely different story the flight crew instruments reported that the autopilot was gone out of you know had had quit and it was up to the pilot to fly the airplane so the pilot was taking proper emergency procedures for that kind of an emergency engine flame out autopilot gone he was trying to do the job the flight recorder recorded that the engines never died out or at least most of them didn&#x27;t and that the autopilot never died out now I submit to you that when your engines flame out in a jet it&#x27;s about like running into almost a break wall suddenly a very soft spongy wall or like having a big blowout on your car there&#x27;s not much way a seasoned pilot can fail to notice engine flame out particularly all four engines so we can take the Pilot&#x27;s word for that it&#x27;s the instruments which lied because they had an response to the scaler stuff that disagreed with each other one responded one way one the other that will never appear in the official investigation now that is not the only airplane having such difficulties one of the European nations which I shall not name has repeated difficulties with their airplanes flying off the West Coast that is not in the newspaper and that has not been announced but it is a fact and I&#x27;m prepared to back it up if I have to so one thing guys is the way that Thomas Bearden is talking in this video is not the way that somebody who&#x27;s making up information talks he&#x27;s speaking off the cuff he&#x27;s speaking directly from his knowledge base in his head the only basis here is that he&#x27;s either been fed misinformation or what he&#x27;s saying here is true to what he knows to be real or not there&#x27;s certainly some aspects of this which are his opinion which he said several times in here as well where he&#x27;s seen an event happen he may not have inside information but he&#x27;s giving his opinion on what could have caused it for the most part everything that I&#x27;ve been listening to from Thomas beard in here on this particular video seems to ring true this guy is not a liar you can tell right off the bat that he is not making this up um so that really is why I find this so compelling in addition to the fact that it matches up with everything we&#x27;ve been saying so far I did see the comment about uh Jack sarfati I will mention that here at the end um I am planning on interviewing Jack sarfati on Sunday so he will be on the hard TRS podcast at any rate we have had multiple cases not quite so dramatic and continuing cases of the same phen phenomenon on a less drastic scale and it continues to this day okay what I&#x27;ve gone through here for the last period is a presentation to you on a scheme by means of which you can control the weather around the world perhaps you can&#x27;t control it absolutely but you can certainly drastically influence it drastically influence it right you can do a lot of other things I hope you see I hope you notice that we can knock out missiles airplane anything Electronics including the electromagnetic responses of the human being in Afghanistan when the high helicopters come in and fire gas now gas kills people but even with nerve gas they kick a while takes a few seconds at least to die and the body goes into violent responses very violent if you&#x27;ve ever SE seen an animal die from nerve gas many of the people that are killed die with nerve gas some are given must hit with mustard and so forth they die with those symptoms but there is another symptom which also is exhibited I have this one correspondence from people who&#x27;ve been there on the scene some of the people simply cut off wherever they are their nervous system never fires another input anywhere in their body no reflex action no nothing no kicking no fighting no foot no fury instantaneous death and that is a scalar signature fortunate instantaneous death okay anybody who doesn&#x27;t think Havana syndrome can be possible uh just go ahead and watch this video because at this point what we&#x27; figured out here from or what we&#x27;ve discovered I guess from scalar physics is that you can just shut off all the electromagnetic signatures of the human body that&#x27;s just going to shut you down like a shutting down a robot hitting the off switch good night do you know why this is so compelling to me the reason why this is so compelling is because that kind of explains death sometimes you&#x27;ve seen people just kill over collapse turn off Etc is it&#x27;s the electromagnetic or the electric synapses just boom stop they stop firing this is extremely scary definitely brings in the concept of Psych psychotronic weapons being possible Etc I used to say one nation I will now say two Nations which are non-hostile to the United States also have these weapons I shall not name those Nations publicly and have had them for an extended period of time at least since shortly after [Music] 1969 right now the only thing that stops the Soviet Union from feeling free to move with this kind of Weaponry which I think you can begin to see the implications against tanks anything else electronically controlled on the battlefield as the other two Nations not the United States so for a period of time one of my purposes has been to warn the system a new kind of electromagnetics and more extended electromagnetics already exist in the textbooks and been there since 1921 with this kind of electromagnetics we can achieve types of engineering we have only dreamed of in the past and this time it&#x27;s not us that got the atomic bomb first it&#x27;s the other guy thank you for your attention wow holy crap man holy crap PO box 14 72 Huntsville Alabama 35807 well this is insane I&#x27;m going to leave this up because apparently it goes for like another eight minutes where it talks about this but I I want to interact with the chat for a minute here as well while we do this uh probably top 10 craziest videos I&#x27;ve ever seen and I&#x27;ve seen some crazy stuff out there um absolutely feels like there&#x27;s an aura of authenticity okay okay Jesus uh feels like there&#x27;s an Ora authenticity uh related to this Lulu is very upset right there I think I rolled the chair over her tail right there um what is it saying here guys I have at least one or two more videos related to this by the way what is this worked in USSR escaped to Brazil did secret experiments large sea area could be suddenly Frozen May 1985 killer tornadoes devastated parts of Ontario Ohio and Pennsylvania over 90 people were killed and extensive damage occurred maybe this is why we hate Russia so much this is actually right here we&#x27;re looking at the uh what he was just talking about that bubble strong swirls occurred just before the tornadoes of May 31st 1985 developed definitely feels like we should be able to predict the weather given this information about the jet streams does make me wonder about polls flipping but we would we&#x27; be able to figure it out if so I hate that they put these hyphens in there what a crazy video Everybody MK Ultra sub project 68 or 168 scaler em wa wait what was that limitations of the ordinary general relativity Theory scaler em represents a new view of general relativity electromagnets and physical reality oh I agree for sure I agree for sure I think we&#x27;re our I think we&#x27;re the ultimate baddies guys the ultimate Pro a fundamental problem also exists oh okay oh went too fast it is the axm for the zero vector vector analysis discard zero summations of the systems and active vectors this is pretty much just our reputation uh of what we&#x27;ve already been watching here for the last hour related to these videos way did the energy go it produces stress energy of the vacuum that&#x27;s what salvator Pas told us to the external Observer energy always applies to a single force moving through a distance against a resistance it doesn&#x27;t apply to a system of dynamic forces that the sum always to a zero Vector what was that goes a little bit too fast here to a zero Vector resultant for that case a new term should be used scalar physics in scalar em the infolded energy locked in locked inside a zero Vector system as a stress energy of the vacuum is called and energy huh this is very similar to what I&#x27;ve learned from Dave Rossi very very similar in fact this now I&#x27;m wondering if this isn&#x27;t where he learned it from in scaler em a new term is added to the laws of conservation of energy any one way is that say eating gating gating process from an energy to energy yields free energy since the an energy is automatically replenished by the universe so I think the idea there is that the underlying framework of reality The Ether or whatever you want to call it the construct The Matrix has infinite negative energy it then becomes the law of conservation of an energy total equivalence of an energy energy and mass is conserved so this then would be a con this would be a modification of the laws of thermodynamics in terms of conservation of energy is that we add an additional uh variable and energy and if you add the additional en the variable of an energy now you can tap into the underlying framework of the construct and you can borrow that energy from it which is essentially an infinite energy Supply Source this is how you can get free energy and I just came up with that right now if I&#x27;m looking at this yeah Fusion is free energy as well as alien scientists pointed out but what happened to all this ordinary general relativity note our statements about ogr I think that&#x27;s ordinary general relativity will be referenced to an excellent text Meisner no that&#x27;s different Meisner Meisner Thorn wheeler I&#x27;m assume that&#x27;s John Wheeler uh gravitation wh Freeman and Co San Francisco 1973 ordinary general relativity man this is killing me how fast this goes right here ordinary General relativity assumes the a problem of the nonzero stress energy of the vacuum so basically adding an an energy fixes that problem in ogr precise definition of gravitational field is not given in ogr charge conservation and Maxwell&#x27;s laws are upheld by uh artifices and assumption in ogr the vacuum is modulated as per as a perfect fluid excluded our sheer stress anistropic anisotropic anisotropic pressure and viscosity this restricts the stress energy tensor Jack uh sarfati was talking about the stress energy tensor yesterday as well and so it&#x27;s salvator Pas ogr is restricted to a special case conservation of laws is assumed Applied Auto all local frames are just assumed to be Loren frames so this is like the Lorent uh frame frame dragging effect this is way too fast conservation of all physicist of all physics are strongly discouraged from considering that excuse me general relativity can be easily engineered in a local electromagnetic system isotropic means all going in the same direction thank you very much appreciate that Dynamic zero Vector systems are not considered in ogr classical electromagnetics aiori a zero Vector em system polarizes the vacuum deterministically polarizing the vacuum state is another thing that Dave Rossy mentioned several times a a zero Vector system produces a controlled and ordered stress energy tensor of a vacuum that can be produced can that can produce macroscopic effects locally huh talking about the videos now a zero Vector system accumulator inertial work has no energy except vacuum stress energy can yield energy of its components ah anistropic means non uniformity good to know MTH has a tons tons of energy if we could find a way to release the tra Fields E equals mc^2 yeah that makes sense in ogr vacuum polarization produces a nonzero stress energy tensor unobservable except by its gravitational effects I don&#x27;t know what does mtw 411 mean scaler electromagnetics easily produces a nonzero stress energy tensor of the vacuum that is macroscopically observable seems pretty big scaler em thus violates both Newtonian gravity and severe constraints of uh original general relativity in original general relativity Newtonian gravity is used to argue that the nonzero stress energy tensor of the vacuum is unobservable huh so we&#x27;ve messed up the laws of physics to detect rhythmic rhythmic variations in the nonzero stress and intensity of the vacuum here&#x27;s a scalar wave detector so this is just an electric system farad cage pickup coil resonant tuning circuit tuning capacitor preamp can&#x27;t read some of the words tuning something shielded cable and I can&#x27;t tell what that says so it&#x27;s definitely just an electric system though if you&#x27;re interested in this check out electrical engineering detector is designed by John bery uh ogr shutters uh away from fixing the geometry and letting the four cons uh conservation laws be violated okay this is going to be very relevant I&#x27;m going to show you guys a post here after this about violating the laws of conservation in scalar electromagnet uh electromagnetic uh such as artificial adherence to the conservation of laws is not assumed scalar em is a means of direct conservation of electromagnetic energy to gravitational energy and vice versa so we can manipulate gravity what does that say in scaler em all conservation laws can be locally violated and of 10 with ease and oh often with ease okay so we can violate the laws of conservation of momentum Einstein&#x27;s formula for gravitational radiation is not a consequence of the general theory of relativity interesting this is a source right here I think in general relativity there are no energy momentum conservation laws for a system uh consisting of matter and the gravitation of Al gravitational field okay makes sense this is hard to read we&#x27;re almost done here comment okay IE in a local generalistic system conservation laws do not apply Soviets have weaponized and unrestricted oops the Soviets have weaponized the unrestricted in local general relativity for over 30 years this was back in 1985 so that would push it back to 1955 so wow we&#x27;ve really just been hiding the science the whole whole world has been hiding in science scalar electromagnetics allows the direct enggineering of SpaceTime and hence physical relativity or reality itself we would have never figured this out without the the MH370 videos how crazy is that chat so without the MH370 videos we potentially at least I would never potentially figure this out I would have been a CNN brain for life I would have thought this was fake um but we have videos showing this we have videos showing this happen right here they were recording it on two cameras they never thought it would get leaked to the public they never thought anyone would leak this footage uh we can see Dynamic Parallax and these clouds these are real clouds these are not rendered this is not after effects that we&#x27;re looking at here in this video um this is why we see these ball lightning orbs here which are consistent with scalar physics what Thomas beard Bearden just mentioned he said that we can produce these balls of lightning balls of plasma if you will this is why when I looked at these and I figured out that what we&#x27;re looking at here is a field around the object that&#x27;s how this is not a solid field a solid object we&#x27;re looking at a ball of energy here at this point no one could have ever even come up with this there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s no VFX artist that could even have thought of this they would had no idea how to even create this probably the strongest evidence for why what we&#x27;re looking at here is real is based on the physics that we just looked at uh they were recording this because they wanted to collect information about it now that I think about it probably to give back to the engineers and scientists several people that know about this would never be able to talk about it they&#x27;ve probably seen other stuff like this that&#x27;s just as crazy honestly the reason why they&#x27;re showing us the slmos here I even wonder if this is not from the original footage is cuz they want us to see that this is actually legit 100% real this color variant that we see this rainbow palette might only this might be completely classified this rainbow pallet we see here like this this multi-spectral video it&#x27;s very possible that the public is intentionally never seen this type of video because they don&#x27;t want the public to have any frame of reference for what the milit is capable of in terms of uh surveillance capabilities that&#x27;s why they showed us the black and white they intentionally showed us the black and white in 2017 Fleer footage because they don&#x27;t want us to know about what their capabilities are I I think 100% this is our technology this is not aliens at all that&#x27;s the reason why the Jeremy corbels of the world say it&#x27;s [ __ ] because they care care about alien technology they don&#x27;t care about our technology we&#x27;re exposing MH 370x is exposing our technology this is what we have the capability to do there&#x27;s no aliens in these videos that&#x27;s why Corbell hates it CU there&#x27;s no aliens the dude loves aliens he wants everything to be aliens and maybe there are aliens out there I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t care honestly what I care about is this is our technology and the way they&#x27;re able to convince the world is because nobody looks at this and thinks that we can pull this off but we can we can pull this off and here they&#x27;re doing the exact same thing they&#x27;re manipulating with scalar physics and gravitational potential the neg entropy of the vacuum state so guys if somebody faked this they would have had to have been they would have to know about Thomas Bearden and they would have had to look at his physics from 1985 and they would have had to incorporate this into the videos because what we see here is exactly what he just talked about uh these are not fake videos this is what we did to the plane um whether or not this is a cloaking or Annihilation or a teleportation event really doesn&#x27;t matter to me uh all I&#x27;ve ever cared about is that we tell the truth about what the United States government did to this plane with our super Advanced scaler physics technology there it is right there in Super slowmo uh if you&#x27;re making a fake video how many fake videos have you guys seen where they show super slow-mo of the videos and show all the details in super slow-mo the reason why you wouldn&#x27;t do that is because you don&#x27;t want people to see that you made a mistake somewhere there&#x27;s no mistakes in any of these videos that&#x27;s just what we did to the plane simple as that now the last thing I want to show tonight before we log off for the evening uh I want to show Twitter real quick so one thing I want to show you guys on Twitter is my buddy Dave Rossy uh Zed podcast is what I think he goes by the hell uh what&#x27;s his thing guys what&#x27;s this thing um podcast Zed is that what it is there he is okay guys look at what he has pinned to his profile a very special thank you to expanding real for pointing this out to me yet again here we go and yes the second law of Thermodynamics is violated while maintaining conservation of momentum and energy I&#x27;ve always wondered when I look at this image of on his pin profile from April 2023 before I ever met him months before I ever met him why he was showing us this he wants to show us that scal of physics is real this is why he showed us why his profile much like the difference is is that this happening in the middle of a rotating magnetic Vortex because of that the power that is taken in is dispersed in the vortex like a hurricane or throws all over the place but it stays in the show us we create over Unity we create a system that much like a rary it is happening in the middle of a rotating magnetic Vortex and because of that the power that is taken in is dispersed in the vortex like a oh I apologize so like I sorry I muted that I apologize but this is why it&#x27;s violating the conservation it&#x27;s it&#x27;s violating the laws of thermodynamics so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s tapping into the underlying framework and construct of the universe to borrow energy from it just like Thomas Bearden was talking about in the scalar physics this is why Dave has this pin to his profile I&#x27;ve been wondering this whole time why does he have this pin to his profile this is why he&#x27;s just telling the whole world the whole world has no idea the whole world is looking at it in this video it&#x27;s out there in the public it&#x27;s on Tik Tok it&#x27;s out there on Twitter and no one has any idea this stuff&#x27;s real because most of the public is full of idiots that nobody thinks for themselves nobody does any scientific research for themselves and they just believe whatever they&#x27;ve been told to be real this only has 26,000 views only has 26,000 views he has it pinned to his profile since April of 2023 cuz people care more about random political drama that than they care about science and real science that might be possible wow what a revolutionary eye opening night we had here guys so thank you guys for jumping on this stream tonight uh I am going to close it out here since we&#x27;ve been going for two hours there are at least one maybe two more videos of Thomas Bearden that we are going to jump into tomorrow night and this weekend and then I am going to interview I have scheduled to interview Jack sarfati on Sunday I think I&#x27;m planning on doing it live there is a possibility I will pre-record it I&#x27;m not 100% sure I do want to build it up a little bit there could be some fireworks um somebody mentioned as well what do you think about Jack sarfati talking last night I&#x27;m not sure how much of what he says is true I think that he knows the physics for sure the physics of what Jack SFA has been saying is is dead on but the difference between Thomas be is Thomas beard is an engineer Jack sarfa is a physicist we have to kind of reconcile these Jack sarfati is looking at it from the theoretical physics perspective and the engineers are looking at it from this is what we can create how do we explain it perspective yeah am I on the Spectrum guys I don&#x27;t even know what autistic even means I don&#x27;t give a [ __ ] A what autistic means if it means somebody that&#x27;s figured out by history and research uh what the nature of our universe is then sure call me arti uh artistic call me artistic uh guys what I&#x27;m no artist you call me an artist I don&#x27;t think what is think that&#x27;s ghetto I know I know if you guys don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s from look up the sukiana and Bobby alof interview um probably one of the funniest things I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life so guys I&#x27;m artistic I&#x27;m artistic out here uh yeah autism is basically just one of those things they invented to make people feel special um I I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t believe in any of that crap I think you control your own uh your own reality you control what other people think about you and if you victimize yourself in a way to convince yourself that you&#x27;re a victim and that your special needs or whatever then you&#x27;re doing yourself a disservice so okay guys I&#x27;m going to drop off yeah I&#x27;m not a musician I make music do you mean M magician no I&#x27;m not a musician I don&#x27;t think I know anyway guys I appreciate it uh thank you guys very much for jumping on this tonight I will try to set a follow-up tomorrow where we do another video on Thomas Bearden now that we know the framework uh we can begin to understand some of the more advanced concepts I will also uh most likely tomorrow be clipping I took some notes Here clipping some of the segments from that and posted it on my Twitter if you guys want thank you special thank you to uh Jeremy Reese alien scientist uh Bernie uh crypto Alchemist who was in the chat uh big thank you for all of m370x all the followers who&#x27;ve been following and supporting this whole time uh we learned a lot more today we can understand and explain the videos better than we could yesterday so every day that we improve our knowledge is a day where we&#x27;ve gotten smarter a day where we&#x27;ve gotten closer to the truth and one day we will expose that entire truth to the world world thank you everybody peace</p>
