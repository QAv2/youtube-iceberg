            <p>Hey guys, Geared Brian and here&#x27;s three different budget scan tools that every mechanic or DIYer should own. And the first scanner on the list is the King Bolan E Diag Elite. Now, this powerful little thing is just a Bluetooth scanner that you plug into your car, download and use the app, and now you have a powerful scanner that does full system scans, live data, birectional control, and again, this thing&#x27;s so small, so you can easily store it away into your glove box. So, you&#x27;ll always have a scanner on you in your car. And this powerful scanner is under $100.</p>
<p>And next on the list is a topdown RDDX600S. Now, this bad boy is only a little bit more than the King Bowlan, but this thing&#x27;s way faster, faster than that bad boy, this bad boy, and a couple other expensive scan tools that I own. And with this bad boy, you&#x27;re getting also full service scans, some service resets, and also does live data. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s wired, but nonetheless, this thing&#x27;s still awesome for the price. And last, but not least, the Autel Maxim 88S.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate scan tool for all the pros out there or those serious DIYers. This does full system scans, key programming, full birectional control, actuator tests, service functions, TPMS and key functions, and even throttle relearns. Sadly, this one&#x27;s wired as well. If you can afford it, I highly recommend the Autel Maximum. This is the one I use on a daily basis.</p>
<p>All three of these scan tools are awesome. Just depends on what you can afford and what you&#x27;re looking for. Links to all of these will be in my YouTube channel description. Hope it helped.</p>
