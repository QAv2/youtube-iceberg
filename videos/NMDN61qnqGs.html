            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel and we look at Great theories of everything including the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and today is our 478th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system going deep into several of his books and many articles by both Larson and um some of his um Associates and uh students so to speak and uh today uh we are um looking at his book called basic properties of matter and he wrote this in 1987 uh just 3 years before he died and uh we&#x27;re in chapter N9 on El currents basic properties ma of matter is a book primarily on chemistry but as Larson is uh the author of a Theory of Everything um a theory of General application in the reciprocal system of theory um the ramifications of his uh books on chemistry on temperature pressure electric current and so forth uh can be applied to many other fields and so we&#x27;re looking at these books kind of to get uh analogies and also to just kind of understand how he&#x27;s thinking about these things how he goes about his business and how we can go about our business uh because the reciprocal system is a system of theory so you can once you understand how the system works you can plug it into any subject that you want so you can plug it in it kind of democratizes if you want to use that word um which maybe I shouldn&#x27;t but um it it makes accessible science to the lay person uh if they are studious and they you know get their act together then they can start doing science with the reciprocal system and it shows because uh Lars uh by himself was able to in in studies like basic properties of matter here uh Larson arrived at a uh two fundamental postulates in 1959 and then from there he arrived at a theoretical Universe what the universe would look like if his postulates were correct this is strictly from Theory and then in his books he compared his his theoretical Universe with the actual so-called measured empirical and compiled universe of the Legacy scientist what uh you know products that required an army of scientists trillions of dollars over centuries of time and LaRon was more or less able to recreate what they had come up with over all that time uh by himself with a slide rule on his uh living room chair uh so this does show how you know um science is through the reciprocal system science can be back into the hands of the lay person the you know hardworking lay person you know this isn&#x27;t an easy thing to understand but uh you can have the motivation to understand it because you can understand that if I do understand this I understand the basis for everything and I can plug this into anything now the basic uh ins and outs of the reciprocal system I went through uh over and over and over again in the first 474 videos that I&#x27;ve done on this topic and so if you don&#x27;t understand how the reciprocal system works um refer to one of those videos today we&#x27;re going to go right into the reading from chapter 9 and pretty much assume that you at least have a working knowledge of the reciprocal system I will try to uh clarify certain issues as they come along in the texts but um you know I&#x27;m trying to be focused on like turning some pages here and like actually getting through this work um that I&#x27;m trying to read into the record without taking you know 2third of the video just to uh give you background information over and over and over again I&#x27;ve done it like I said uh I think I provided a pretty thorough explanation of the reciprocal system at least for introductory purposes uh 400 74 occasions and so um I frankly uh feel like I&#x27;ve said what I&#x27;m going to say about that for now you know maybe I&#x27;ll go back and and sum it up later because I&#x27;m always learning more about the reciprocal system and I&#x27;m always understanding more and so hopefully my uh my general knowledge advances and I might be able to summarize it better in the future but for right now we&#x27;re going to be just getting right into the text and this is coming from uh chapter 9 uh Larsson had just gotten done talking about um let me just read this last sentence from the paragraph before uh but where the atoms of a material aggregate are in effective motion thermally movement of electrons through the matter adds to the spatial component of the thermal motion that is it increases the speed and thereby imparts energy or heat to the moving atoms and he&#x27;s really you know saying that electric current um does not uh heat the atom up if there is no um space component to your um your atom meaning more or less that you there&#x27;s no heat there uh and that&#x27;s why superconductivity operates at very Co temperatures um but basically the main point that he got to at the beginning here is that the um the uh electric current comes from electrons and in particular it comes from uncharged electrons which goes against you know Legacy science uh who believe all electrons are charged Larson has a Charged en an uncharged electron an electron is simply a rotating unit of space um which makes it somewhat um unique um it&#x27;s kind of a world of space in this world of time which is uh the atom and so uh because the um relationship between space and time is motion in Larson system this is the fundamental of Larson system the universe is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time um because the El uncharged electron is is made out of space it&#x27;s a a rotating unit of space it moves through matter because matter is primarily made out of time and um so the relationship between space and time is motion so the electron moves through matter and that is called electric current and um it moves through the matter kind of uh based on some of the uh characteristics of that matter some forms of matter are more time um some have some space spatial components as well and uh that kind of makes the difference between what you would call a uh conductor and an insulator and [Music] um uh I think you&#x27;ll get to that coming up later so let&#x27;s start here the magnitude of the current measured by the number is measured by the number of electrons or units of space per unit of time so that&#x27;s how you measure current number of electrons or number of units of space per unit of time and again Larson system is quantized everything comes in units you have to have a full unit of something before you have something units of space per unit of time is the definition of speed hence the electric current is a speed from a mathematical standpoint it is immaterial whether a mass is moving through extension in space um or space is moving through the mass thus in dealing with the electric current we are dealing with the mechanical aspects of electricity and the current phenomena can be described by the same mathematical equations that are applicable to ordinary Motion in space with appropriate modifications for differences in condition conditions where such differences exist it would even be possible to use the same units but for historical reasons and as a matter of convenience a separate system of units is utilized in present day practice the basic unit of current electricity is the unit of quantity in the natural system it is the spatial aspect of one electron which has a speed displacement of one unit quantity Q is therefore equivalent to space s energy has the same status in current flow as in the mechanical relations and has the SpaceTime Dimensions t/ s and remember Larson has a system where all of our scientific phenomena are relationships between space and time and can be notated uh with uh fractions time over space or space over time um with the caveat that time and space can have exponents energy divided by time is power 1 / s uh energy is t/ s / time t/ s/ T is 1/ s power a further division by current which has the dimensions of speed s overt then produces electromotive Force EMF with the dimensions of t/ s * um a 1 / s * t s = t/ s to the 2 power these are of course the SpaceTime dimensions of force in general force is t/ s² the term electric potential is commonly used as an alternative to EMF but for reasons to be discussed later we will not uh use potential in this sense where a more convenient term then EMF is appropriate we will use the term voltage simp V dividing voltage t/ s² by current S/T we obtain t^2 / s 3r this is resistance symbol R the only electrical quantity thus far considered that is not equivalent to a familiar mechanical qual quantity its true nature is revealed by an examination of its SpaceTime structure the dimensions t^2 over s the 3 are equivalent to mass T the 3/ S the 3 divided by time T So resistance is basically mass divided by time mass per time resistance is therefore mass per unit time the um the relevance of such quantity can easily be seen when it is realized that the amount of mass entering into the motion of space or electrons through matter is not a fixed quantity as it is in the motion of matter through extension space but a quantity whose magnitude depends on the amount of movement of the electrons in motion of matter through extension space the mass is constant while the space depends on the duration of the movement in the current flow the space or the number of electrons is constant while the mass depends on the duration of the movement which is the same um yesterday in the intro intro to this chapter Larson did talk about how the movement of space through matter or electrons through matter is the reciprocal or analogous to the movement of matter through space so think of of matter moving through space and then it&#x27;s its reciprocal would be the movement of electrons through matter and so here he&#x27;s showing how those are parallels this is also a very good illustration of how um Larson&#x27;s System of Units where everything has units of space and time only space over time or time over space uh with exponents only without the mass of the MKS system or kilograms of the MKS system makes everything a lot more easy and it also clarifies relationships you can understand much more clearly what you&#x27;re dealing with when you understand the the units of something uh you can understand what those units are really all about whereas when you&#x27;re using the MKS system it&#x27;s a lot more opaque okay um if the flow is only momentary each electron may move through only a small fraction of the total amount of mass in the circuit whereas if it continues for a longer time the entire circuit may be involved repeatedly in either case the total mass involved in the current flow is the product of the mass per unit time the resistance and the time of flow in the movement of matter through extension space the total space is determined in the same manner that is it is the product of the space per unit time or velocity by the time of movement in dealing with resistance as a property of matter we will be interested mainly in the specific resistance or resistivity which is defined as the resistance of a unit cube of the substance under consideration now recall a lot of times when Larson Larsson is you know got his Universe of motion and many of his key um units involve the the rates okay so he&#x27;s not wanting to know as much about resistance as what he would call specific resistance uh you remember in earlier chapters here in this book we learned about specific rotation um specific heat uh you know so this is having to do with the rate of something so this is resistivity which is defined as resistance of a unit cube of the substance under consideration resistance is directly proportional to the distance traveled by the current and inversely proportional to the crosssectional area of the conductor it follows that if we multiply the resistance by unit area and divide by unit distance we arrive at a quantity with the dimensions t to the 2/ S the 2 that reflects only the inherent characteristics of the material and the environmental conditions principally temperature and pressure and is independent of the geometrical structure of the conductor the reciprocals of resistance and resistivity are conductance and conduct it respectively with the benefit of the clarification of the space-time dimensions of resistance we can now go back to the empirically determined relations between resistance and other electrical quantities and verify the consistency of the SpaceTime identifications okay voltage that is V equals I and in LaRon system voltage is um IR current times resistance that&#x27;s s/ T * T ^2 over s 3r which equals t/ s squ which are the Rel uh which are the um uh units of force so voltage is a force power power equals I s r that is current to the second power * R * resistance so power = s the 2 over T 2 * t 2/ s 3r = 1 / s power energy energy equals um current squared * [Music] RT Uh current squar time resistance time time and that is s^ 2/ T ^2 * T ^2 / s 3r * t = t over s energy is t/ s this energy equation demonstrates the equivalence of the mathematical expressions of the electrical and mechanical phenomena since resistance is mass per unit time the product of resistance and time RT resistance times time is equivalent to mass m the current I is a speed or velocity the electrical energy expression um r t i s is thus dimensionally equivalent to the kinetic energy expression 12 mv^ s in other words the quantity RTI I 2 is the kinetic energy of the electron motion instead of using resistance time and current we may put put the energy expression into terms of voltage uh equivalent to current times resistance and quantity uh Q equivalent to um current time time the expression for the magnitude of the energy or work is then work equals uh voltage times the quantity here we have a definite confirmation of the identification of electric quantity as the equivalent of space force as described in one of the standard physics textbooks is a explicitly definable vector quantity that tends to produce a change in the motion of objects electromotive force or voltage conforms to this description it tends to cause motion of the electrons in the direction of the voltage gradient energy in general is the product of force and distance electrical energy as VQ is the product of force and quantity it follows that electrical quantity is equivalent to distance the same conclusion that we derived from the nature of the uncharged electron in conventional scientific thought the status of electrical energy as one form of energy in general is accepted as it must be since it can be converted into any of the other forms but the status of electrical or electromotive Force as one form of force in general is not accepted if it were the conclusion stated in the preceding paragraph would be inescapable but the clear verdict of The observed facts is disregarded because there is a general impression that electrical quantity and space are entities of a totally different nature the early investigators of electrical phenomena recognized that the quantity measured in volts has the characteristics of a force and they named it accordingly contemporary theorists reject this identification because it conflicts with their views as to the nature of the electric current WJ Duffin for instance gives us a definition of electromotive force and then says in spite of its quote in spite of its name it is clearly not a force but is equal to the work done per unit positive charge in taking a charge completely around um the electric circuit its unit therefore is the volt uh end quote work per unit of space is force this author simply takes it for granted that the mean that the moving entity which he calls a charge is not equivalent to space and he therefore deduces that the quantity measured in volts cannot be a force our finding is that his assumptions are wrong that the moving entity is not a charge but is a rotating unit of space an uncharged electron the electromotive force measured in volts is then in fact a force in effect duffen concedes this point where when he tells us in another connection that quote v/ N volts per meter uh I don&#x27;t know why the N is there but maybe it&#x27;s an M uh I&#x27;m not sure v/ n volts per meter is the same as Newton&#x27;s per kulum uh both Express the voltage gradient in terms of force divided by space okay uh the quote the actual quote is V Over N volts per meter is the same as Newton per kulum and then Larson goes on and says both Express the voltage gradient in terms of force divided by space conventional physical Theory does not pretend to give us any understanding of the nature of either electrical quantity or electric charge it simply assumes that in as much as scientific investigation has hitherto been unable to produce any explanation of its nature the electric charge must be a unique entity independent of the other fundamental qu uh physical entities and must be accepted as one of the given features of nature it is then further assumed that this entity of unknown nature that plays the central role in electrostatic phenomena is identical with the entity of unknown nature electrical quantity that plays the central wall in current electricity the most significant weakness of the conventional theory of the electric current the theory based on the foregoing assumptions as we now see in as we now see it in the light of the more complete understanding of physical fundamentals derived from the theory of the universe of motion is that it assigns two different and incompatible roles to the electrons these particles according to present day Theory are components of the atomic structure yet at least some of them are presumed to be free to accommodate themselves to any electrical forces applied to the conductor on the one hand each is so firmly bound to the remainder of the atom that it plays a significant part in determining the properties of that atom and a substantial Force the ionization potential must be applied in order to separated from the atom on the other hand these electrons are so free to move that they will respond to Thermal or electrical forces whose magnitude is only slightly above zero they must exist in a conductor in specific numbers in order to account for the fact that the conductor is electrically neutral while carrying current but at the same same time they must be free to leave the conductor either in large or small quantities if they acquire sufficient kinetic energy it should be evident that the theories are calling upon the electron to perform two different and contradictory functions they have been assigned the key position in both the theory of atomic structure and the theory of electric current without regard for the fact that the properties that they must have in order to perform the functions required by either one of those theories disqual disqualify them from uh for the functions that they are called upon to perfor perform in the other in the theory of the universe of motion each of these phenomena involves a different physical entity the unit of atomic structure is a unit of rotational motion not an electron it has the Quasi permanent status that is required of an atomic constituent the electron without a charge and without any connection with the atomic structure is then available as the freely move moving unit of the electric current the fundamental postulate of the reciprocal system system of theory is that the physical universe is a universe of motion one in which all entities and phenomena are motions combinations of motions or relations between motions in such a universe none of the basic phenomena are unexplainable quote unanalyzable as Bridgeman called them do not exist the basic physical entities and phenomena of the universe of motion radiation gravitation matter electricity magnetism and so on can be defined explicitly in terms of space and time unlike conventional physical Theory the reciprocal system does not have to leave its basic elements cloaked in metaphysical mystery it does not have to exclude them from physical inquiry in the manner of the following statement from the encyclopedia britanica quote the question what is electricity like the question what is matter really lies outside the realm of physics and belongs to that of metaphysics that&#x27;s um you know pathetic but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve come to expect from uh Legacy science they just can&#x27;t uh can&#x27;t get over their denial of the fact that their system is not uh all that and if they just kind of admitted that they had a little bit of ignorance about their topic they would be doing a lot better but anyway thanks for tuning in today and have a</p>
