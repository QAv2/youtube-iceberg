            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>A House Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee held a historic hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, also known as UFO&#x27;s. Lawmakers heard from three witnesses today, including former U.S. military and intelligence community personnel, who claimed to have come into contact with such objects. Natalie Brand has more now from that hearing. We have nothing close to it, retired Navy Commander David Fraver testified before Congress about an encounter he cannot explain, a strange Tic Tac shaped object he says he saw in the sky during a training mission in 2004.</p>
<p>The technology that we faced was far superior than anything that we had. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are digging into the national security concerns and the mystery posed by Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or U AP&#x27;s, also known as UFO&#x27;s. Do you believe that? The government is in possession of UP&#x27;s absolutely Based on interviewing over 40 witnesses over 4 years. I know the exact locations. Ohh whistleblower who formerly worked on the Defense Departments U AP task force David Grush claims he was denied access to information on a government UFO crash retrieval program.</p>
<p>Something the Pentagon disputes. Biologics came with some of these recoveries. Were they I guess human or non human biologics? Human. And that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program. I talked to Congress.</p>
<p>Members from both sides of the aisle are demanding more transparency from the US Department of Defense. A recent report revealed the government is investigating more than 650 potential sightings. But Ryan Graves of Americans for Safe Aerospace says there&#x27;s still a stigma around reporting. Right now, we need a system where pilots can report without fear of losing their jobs. The witnesses say better data is needed to determine what the identified objects.</p>
<p>R and their origins. Natalie Brand, CBS News, Capitol Hill.</p>
