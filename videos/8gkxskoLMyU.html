            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this channel is designed for educational purposes and uh we look at a lot of uh different uh mostly esoteric and obscure theories theories of everything all-encompassing theories holistic um gestal theories that attempt to describe everything cosmologies uh and things that you can use in your own life uh that can help you kind of organize your thoughts and all of your research and uh things that can um you know just benefit your life in general if you know about them um but very few people know about them because they have been actively suppressed by uh those good folks out there in our uh scientific establishment uh who are going to try to foist other stuff on you that um you know uh agrees with their own paradigms but usually doesn&#x27;t produce results or produces results but doesn&#x27;t produce the actual uh Concepts uh that are underlying and um yeah so um perhaps this uh Channel doesn&#x27;t agree with the trust the science uh mandates that are uh threats that are being thrown around out there all the time but uh I believe it does uh follow science in terms of you know what science is really about the scientific method the method of inquiry of open uh you know questioning and U you know using observations and measur measurements to um you know contribute to your understanding of things instead of uh suppressing and censoring uh these things so that you can fit your uh pet Theory and with a shoehorn into U some kind of slot uh so anyway uh today is video number 340 that we are uh doing on the reciprocal system of theory from Mr dwey Bernard Larson Mr Larsson lived from 1898 until 1990 and around 1930 uh he had some uh inspiration about um the nature of the universe that he did research uh and studied up on for the next 25 30 years came out with his two fundamental postulates in the late 1950s and um then uh took those postulates and derived a theoretical Universe from them uh and from that he wrote books kind of comparing his theoretical Universe to that of the Legacy scientists that&#x27;s what I would say the Larson&#x27;s biggest mistake was or one of them is that he um trusted these scientists uh with his information as opposed to uh probably what he should have done is he should have appealed to a general audience a general audience of intelligent uh inquiring minds as opposed to um kind of spoiled um already know-it-all scientists who uh were completely closed to his uh his new Innovations and did everything that they could to discredit him in most cases and U as a result uh Larson&#x27;s theory is largely unknown today except for a handful of people out there that are still kind of working on it and the basic idea behind larsson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory is that uh he posits a universe that is made entirely of motion and uh for Larson motion was the relationship between between space and time and uh space and time have no uh independent existence they only exist together in motion you think of motion as a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator although space and time uh have can come in um multiple dimensions that&#x27;s what Larson refers to as coordinate space and coordinate time both time and space are the same they have the same general qualities and so uh time we think of generally as being three-dimensional or maybe three or four dimensional and uh space to has that same quality XYZ coordinates um even though maybe we don&#x27;t see that um and then um what we generally know about time is that time is always getting later and later and later uh it&#x27;s flows or it progresses and uh does so in a uniform manner usually H you know not in unless there are U very extreme circumstances like very fast speeds um in the Newtonian world it&#x27;s a constant flow of of time and so space always has the also has that same quality which Larson refers to as clock time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and uh in a constant flow this is the flow of space now this uh is a different kind of motion than what we generally understand motion as uh generally we understand motion as a vector it&#x27;s a motion in a specific Direction this kind of motion is a motion that lacks Direction uh lacks any type of specific Direction really it&#x27;s just either in or out and you kind of can visualize this uh using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction they&#x27;re all moving away from each each one is moving away from each other one the further away they&#x27;re moving moving uh the faster they&#x27;re moving apart uh the further away they they&#x27;re moving uh I&#x27;m not sure which one is even right there and um that&#x27;s the same as as the uh clock time um and this was also observed in science in by the Hubble telescope all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other there&#x27;s no specific Motion in until uh a specific Direction until you actually assign a reference point once you decide that one of those dots on the balloon is motionless then uh then you can impute directions to the motion but if all if if if without assigning a reference point there&#x27;s no specific direction of the movement and there&#x27;s no even like the even the areas the places on the surface of the balloon that have no dots um those are also moving away from each other too um so it&#x27;s not even just the dots that are moving away from each other but it&#x27;s everything uh it&#x27;s really what you would call the progression of space space itself is moving apart um and so uh that&#x27;s what Larson refers to as a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction and this is really the fundamental motion of Larson system and he points out other situations where scalar motion is also in effect in addition to this uh Stellar expansion but also uh gravitation uh is another uh form of scalar motion which is really the inverse of the this progression that he&#x27;s talking about uh so the gravitation can be modeled using that same balloon but you&#x27;re blowing in the sucking in the balloon instead of blowing it out all of the locations and really the whole fabric of space itself is getting closer and closer together than in the case of gravitation okay now other things um other caveats of this uh space time or motion uh construct here uh not only do they have coordinate space and coordinate time they have clock space and clock time and uh both time and space come only in discrete units there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit uh then you don&#x27;t have anything and if you have one full unit of space in one unit full unit of time you have the speed of light which is basically for Larson is the background of this universe of motion uh one of Larson&#x27;s followers would talk about how um you know for thousands of years space and time were thought of as being the container of the universe this is the setting for which all other uh action of the universe is contained like the stage of a drama um but in the reciprocal system space and time themselves are the contents of the universe not just the container but also the contents of the universe the um things of the universe are also made of space and time or together as motion and so um in a universe of motion the first thing that you have is motion that is this motion outward at the speed of light in all directions at unit speed Larson refers to as unit speed one unit of space in one unit of time and um so this unit speed is the background speed the null point or zero point or reference point origin ether and um half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light which Lon refers to as the cosmic sector and half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light which Larson refers to as the material sector which is really the only of the two sectors that Legacy science knows anything about um evidenced by uh Einstein&#x27;s dictum that um the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe so he&#x27;s actually um ignoring one half of larsson&#x27;s whole Universe the cosmic sector uh the cosmic sector is where um you know in the material sector you have um material atoms and particles and um molecules in the cosmic sector you have Cosmic atoms and particles and molecules um uh maybe not so much particles but we&#x27;ll just say atoms and molecules and um these are called antimatter by the Legacy scientists but very little is known about them and um their origin is unknown to Legacy science um now in Larson system uh when you cross this unit speed boundary then you have to invert the roles of time and space because the two sectors are reciprocals of one another so basically in the in the material sector you have coord ordinate space and clock time in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and clock space um and this shows that U among other things that when you do cross the uh into the cosmic sector when you cross that boundary you have to flip or interchange the roles of time and space now that&#x27;s just a quick summary um and not not a great one either of um uh larsson&#x27;s first post fundamental postulate and uh you know some of the consequences uh but the general just a general overview of the reciprocal system now what we&#x27;re doing today is um we&#x27;re this is the second installment of reading an article from Dr Bruce paret uh who is one of Larson&#x27;s um Chief uh revisers at this point a Dr Dr pet actually passed away about three years ago three and a half years ago um but he uh took larsson&#x27;s Theory and uh revised some of the mistakes um or what he considered mistakes that Larson had made now Larson admitted that he was subject to error he believed that his theory was correct but whether he applied it correctly um was uh open to question and that if he did make uh incorrect attributions and uh applications that uh eventually it would become clear and that other people would need to step up and and make some corrections and so Dr pet along with uh kvk Dr kvk Neu both um uh made great strides in correcting various aspects of larsson&#x27;s theory and they came up with something that they call rs2 the reciprocal system 2 or the re-evaluation of Dewey larsson&#x27;s work and um uh pet has a oh boy the alarm is going off um pet is um I&#x27;m sorry about this but um there&#x27;s it goes off for a minute here so um anyway pet um he uh wrote about 10 different uh pieces here um on the rs2 so this one is called rs211 and then he&#x27;s got rs212 and rs2 103 and so we&#x27;re going to take a look at Several of these if not all of them and so today we&#x27;re looking at rs211 um part two because we we started it yesterday and it&#x27;s called creating a theory so this is kind of how he goes through um uh you know from the beginning to uh create a theory and he looks at um both artificial reality and natural reality artificial uh natural artificial law and natural law the art the natural law is an observation about how nature behaves uh whereas the artificial is a commandment about how you want nature to behave um and uh he shows how Larson uh when he&#x27;s getting it right he&#x27;s using more of a natural approach um and observing how nature behaves and then aligning his theory to that uh when he&#x27;s using the artificial then uh he can get in trouble okay so uh here&#x27;s part two of this article it&#x27;s called Dewey Larson&#x27;s artificial reality or this section Dey Larson was a chemical engineer and his artificial reality of course was based on chemistry namely observations of the periodicity of elements in nature what we call the periodic table he noticed that mass operated inversely to space through the concept of density similar to the way time modifies space in the ratio of speed however the periodic table could not be explained with speeds unless this time denominator also had three dimensions which was puzzling because time was always treated as a unidirectional scaler while waiting at a stoplight the thought hit him that space and time were just aspects of speed and possessed the same properties if space was 3D then time was 3D and we only observed the net push of 3D time on space as a single scale variable Larson created an artificial reality to explain the structure of the periodic table using the concept of speeds and devised the theory that later became known as the reciprocal system of physical Theory the reciprocal system of physical Theory this the next section through the process of observing nature Larson obtained enough information to construct a theory of a universe based on motion a reciprocal relation of space to time but unlike most theorists rather than continuing on a deductive reasoning process observing nature and constructing more man&#x27;s laws he switched to inductive reasoning to test his basic Assumption of the reciprocal nature of space and Time by creating two postulates that describe the observations made and the assumptions going in to the artificial reality he was defining as a theory from these postulates Larson was able to create a theoretical Universe from natural consequences and compare it to what is observed in nature his first postulate is an observation a natur natural law the physical universe is composed of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay that is uh the original version of larsson&#x27;s First Fundamental postulate now over the years he uh he revised these postulates uh in small uh in sometimes a little bit larger ways so but this was his original first postulate the physical universe is composed of one component motion oh no I&#x27;m sorry this is not his first original I&#x27;m not sure this comes a little bit later maybe around 1979 or 1980 this is not his original first postulate from 1959 I&#x27;m not sure why pet has it in here um Without Really labeling it he his paper uh rs102 kind of covers this but for whatever reason paret is putting this one in here the physical first postulate the physical universe is composed of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time Larson observes that what is visible has three dimensions height weight width and depth and both the content and container of the universe are a generalized form of speed Motion in nature change is the relation between content and container and Larson observed that change can be defined by the mathematical concept we know as the reciprocal now we look at Larson&#x27;s second postulate and pet says his second postulate okay there are only two postulates just to remind you okay there&#x27;s two postulates the first and the second his second POS post uh hello uh I&#x27;m sorry uh about this uh video uh between the alarm clock and uh the Amber Alert uh that happened I think we got bogged down but unfortunately I don&#x27;t have time to uh record another video right now and I&#x27;d like to get this released so um we will have to start uh again at the end of where I got uh done and we will be able to finish this tomorrow um I&#x27;m sorry for uh all the snafus happening today um I&#x27;m not sure uh this Amber Alert that I got just kind of shut off my phone and um I&#x27;m not uh I&#x27;m I don&#x27;t have enough time to uh re-record the video so uh we&#x27;ll start again uh where we left off today uh when we resume tomorrow thanks for tuning in and have a great day</p>
