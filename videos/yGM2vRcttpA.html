            <p>hello welcome to my channel um this is an educational Channel where we go over different theories of everything primarily and uh today is our 225th video where we&#x27;re covering various aspects of the reciprocal system of theory and this was a theory that was first derived by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he died back in 1990. the basic gist of the theory is that we live in a universe of motion not a universe of matter not a universe of energy but a universe of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time have three basic aspects that you need to be aware of one is their coordinate aspect coordinate space three or more dimensions of space XYZ coordinates but then there is also coordinate time uh three or more dimensions of time space and time have a reciprocal relationship which is uh you know where the name the reciprocal system comes from and um basically you can think of phenomena as being a fraction where you can think of motion as being a fraction where time or space is the numerator and space or time is the denominator you could think of uh you know think of the most basic motion that we can think of is speed the bicycle is moving at 20 miles per hour 20 miles of space in one hour of time space over time that is a fraction that is a motion and um space and time have a reciprocal relationship there you can see that if you try to double the speed you could either say that the bike is now moving at 40 miles per hour you multiply the space by two or you could say the bike is now moving at 20 miles per half hour dividing the time by two that shows a reciprocal relationship between space and time in motion um space and time do not really exist in and of themselves they only exist together in motion now I mentioned that the space and time both have their coordinate aspects they also both have their clock aspects we&#x27;re familiar with clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later but then there is also what Larson calls clock space again because of the reciprocal relationship space and time have the same qualities so with clock space the clock again is progressing space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart that is the progression of space just like how the progression of time is the clock is always getting later and later and later then also space and time both have their uh discrete unit aspect they only come in discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time they&#x27;re both very small but they both uh do exist and there&#x27;s no continuity there they come only in chunks um actually one chunk of space in one chunk of time is the speed of light so that sets up a generalized uh uh basically two sets of uh two sectors of the universe one that we&#x27;re familiar with where everything is moving slower than the speed of light and then another that we&#x27;re not familiar with where things are moving faster than the speed of light Lars it calls that the cosmic sector uh and then the other is the material sector um now the material sector and the cosmic sector basically have a reciprocal relationship in the material sector you have coordinate space and clock time we&#x27;re familiar with that three dimensions of space and a progressing time but in the cosmic sector we have uh coordinate time three-dimensional time and clock space progressing space they are reciprocals of each other and that is a powerful tool because you can extrapolate what you know upon what you don&#x27;t know so we know about the material sector this is where our observations and measurements take place and where all scientific advancement comes from but we can know every just as much about the cosmic sector because the cosmic sector is identical on the general level uh identical to the material sector except that the rules of space and time are reversed so we can extrapolate into the cosmic sector to discover more about it now that&#x27;s just a short uh briefing on the reciprocal system right now we&#x27;re going to do our first installment of reading uh what is called the Daniel papers and Daniel is a pseudonym a Daniel Phoenix 3 is a pseudonym for Dr Bruce Perrette Dr perett passed away back in 2020 but before that he put out a great deal of material that some of which is quite speculative but it&#x27;s uh attempts to kind of improve upon Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system he actually came out with a system that he calls rs2 reciprocal system two uh so in general it starts out with the same basic postulates but in some cases comes up with different answers different uh proposals uh he he&#x27;s uh I I like the Daniel uh the Daniel papers I like Bruce perrette&#x27;s work in general it&#x27;s somewhat speculative and sometimes doesn&#x27;t stay within the boundaries of the rules of the reciprocal system but in general I give him credit because he firmly understood the reciprocal system before he started going out and uh making all kinds of changes to it he has a very good knowledge of the reciprocal system and so I feel like he is got a license to uh you know move out and do a few different things Larson himself said that the reciprocal system uh itself is correct but whether I have applied it correctly is a different question and so that&#x27;s how the reciprocal system works he&#x27;s got his basic postulates there you know coordinate time and space and clock time and space and discrete units of time in space and then he takes those and he he deduces a theoretical universe so Larson&#x27;s universe is a theoretical universe and then he reviews the literature Legacy scientific literature to determine uh what&#x27;s what what matches up with what um and so on uh so paret is familiar with that procedure and he uh he applies his knowledge um in some cases knowledge of other topics uh to the reciprocal system now um paret claims I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s telling the truth or not but uh Daniel Phoenix 3 uh is it was his uh moniker uh when he worked uh for the um I guess the government or as a contractor uh for the um uh I guess you would say the Philadelphia Experiment or the Montauk project uh which was a top secret government project back in the 80s and they were experimenting with uh time travel you know there&#x27;s a connection with the 1940s also um you can read up on some of that from some of the other people that have written about it Duncan Cameron and uh albelic but Daniel claims that he was a young member of that group one of the computer programmers uh and so he speaks uh he attempts to speak from experience about uh what went on there at the Montauk uh Labs or whatever and um so we&#x27;re gonna get into uh four separate papers that he wrote that are called the anthropology series the first one is called geocrinology hiding history in the past okay so this is Daniel Phoenix 3 starting with the introduction of geochronology hiding history in the past part one of the anthropology series on the hidden origins of homo sapiens using a reciprocal system of theory techniques introduction one of the advantages of being a subcontractor for Black Ops projects is that you often overhear the strangest things things that sound like science fiction or a good Halloween story but you sure you soon learn are very serious topics and you need to keep your mouth shut until you are well away from the situation and when you are poking around in history with the Phoenix 3 experiment it&#x27;s our Phoenix 3 equipment a lot of unexpected things turn up and so is the case with the origins of man Jonathan Glassner and Brad white hold on to your hats because you were a lot closer than you realized these papers discuss anthropology the study of the origins and behavior of homo sapiens developing a radically different worldview that will not only make anthropologists scream in horror but will make religious folks want to bring back burning at the stake the proposed theory is a common denominator to a lot of other research mythologies and Doctrine it is said that there is some truth in everything but in this case a lot more truth than anyone ever realized just happens that a few things got lost in the translation over the generations and that is what this paper attempts to correct when Dewey Larson created his reciprocal system of physical theory he clearly defined what he wanted to accomplish to define the physical universe he set out using basic deductive and inductive reasoning processes to achieve his goal when finished he had a very powerful Theory of Everything that could explain the smallest Photon to the largest Super Galaxy except there was one problem there were still things that existed and were observed in everyday life that his theory could not explain things like biologic life extrasensory abilities and the realm of ethics so he took all these Concepts and threw them into his Think Tank so-called removed everything that could be explained by his reciprocal system of physical Theory then took an objective look at what was left the result of those leftover bits became his book beyond space and time which we&#x27;ve gone over the entire book in previous videos um I think it&#x27;s approximately video 20 to a video 110 or something like that okay the result of those leftover bits became his book beyond space and time which discusses the concepts remaining in that think tank that cannot be explained directly by his physics beyond space and time was Larson&#x27;s last book he died before it was published and after he removed the pieces covering biology basic metaphysics and ethics there was still stuff remaining in that think tank for future researchers to figure out I am taking a similar approach with these anthropology papers which is not about digging up old bones but an attempt to put together a theory of origins of mankind using religious scientific and mythological data under the common framework of Dewey Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system which has proved to be very effective in explaining the inexplicable over the last half century it is my hope that pointing out some alternatives to unquestioned beliefs we can take a similar approach with our mythological systems that Larson did with the physical universe clean up the misunderstandings take an honest look at what is left and develop a theory from that premise As Natural consequence and what is left in that think tank is going to be the really interesting stuff for it will provide the opportunity to open an unexpected door to our future okay now the next section is called geologic history we&#x27;ve all been told about the Earth being billions of years old with mankind not showing his Cro-Magnon face until about 50 000 years ago unless you&#x27;ve got a TARDIS or Bill and Ted&#x27;s phone booth parked in the garage who is going to question that I wasn&#x27;t around back then and neither was anyone I know so we just accept what we&#x27;ve been told by the experts as usual guess what everything you know is wrong geologic dating also known as radiometric dating gives us our geochronology that is based on radioactive decay rates sounds all well and good with one exception pointed out by our old friend Dewey Larson in his discovery that radioactive decay is actually a temporal explosion an explosion in 3D time coordinate time not space as conventionally believed the rotational structure of the atom existing in coordinate time explodes and scatters its pieces around in three-dimensional time as our clock time proceeds we just run into the bits and pieces of the atom that physics views as radioactive emission some same location in space the atom but different locations in time the emission a rough analogy would be to take a bag of marbles um rotations in the atomic time region now the time region is when you are inside a unit of space within a unit of space now we said space and time are both quantized or they both come in only discrete units so when you are less than one unit of space you do not have space you only have time because you need at least one unit of space to have space and inside of one unit of space you have time only that is what Larson calls the time region and that is the region of the atom and over in the cosmic sector you have the same thing inside a unit of time you have no time you only have space because it&#x27;s got to be one or the other and if you do not have time then the only thing that you can have is space and um So within one unit of time you have what Larson calls the space region and this is a the region of cosmic matter or anti-matter okay back to Daniel a rough analogy would be to take a bag of marbles which are rotations in the atomic time region and dump them out in a hallway you dump them in one instance like an explosion but as you walk down the hallway you run into the marbles as individual pieces at different clock times from a purely spatial point of view it looks like you have the bag in your hand all the time and a marble jumps out at out of the bag and onto the floor when you get to the position where it came to a stop in coordinate time when a large atom explodes in time many pieces get scattered all over the coordinate time Realm some nearby and some quite far away as a result of this distribution the larger the explosion the larger the error in clock time interpretation what is known as the half-life what science believes is millions of years is in reality only thousands of years that consequence alone is enough to make most scientists hair stand on end but it is a natural consequence of the structure of the atom proposed by Larson in his reciprocal system the second bad assumption is that once an atom becomes Radioactive it continues to Decay until stable this is not necessarily the case the atom only has to throw off enough rotation to bring it back into the zone of isotopic stability which it does in a single temporal explosion the basic rotation of the atom is still intact so it can continue to aggregate particles charge neutrinos that can build its mass back up to the point where another radioactive detonation is required to stabilize it according to the physics texts uranium-238 decays to lead 206 in a mere 4.47 billion years that is how the age of the Earth is calculated now consider Larson&#x27;s explanation the first time you see a particle fly off u-238 the atom has thrown off all the particles it needed to to become a stable atom again those particles are just scattered down the hallway across time and actually have nothing more to do with the atom itself the atom goes back to behaving like a stable atom and eventually enough particles collide with it to bring it into the unstable Zone again it explodes in time again and throws off more particles down the hallway in the meantime physicists are sitting around with their stopwatch measuring clock time waiting for it to stop throwing off particles since the atom is exploding over and over again in 3D time and they are waiting to stop running across particle debris down the hallway they end up sitting around a long time say 4.47 billion years even though it only took a few thousand years to run across all the particles from the original explosion these particles with a short half-life are the ones that don&#x27;t make a very big temporal Bang so there is a good chance you will run across every marble in the hall and run out before it reaches the zone of isotopic stability again but the larger the atom the less chance there is of that happening and the dating error becomes exponential as we correct for these errors we find that recent history is a bit more recent than we thought with that new information we can now make an accurate correlation to the records provided by mythology and various religious apocrypha some of which provide enormous chronological detail now I just want to make sure I&#x27;m looking at the he&#x27;s got a lot of footnotes here um a lot of this is drawn from his uh Larson&#x27;s chapter 24 of his book basic properties of matter which is the second volume of his three volume structure of the physical universe um and uh I want to make clear that Larson these conclusions about the dating carbon dating or the radioactive dating are not Larson&#x27;s this is peret uh ex you know taking uh extending Larson um I can&#x27;t say that I fully understand that marble analogy enough to buy into his theory here um I think it&#x27;s I I&#x27;m inclined to believe it because I&#x27;m just not inclined to believe these gigantic numbers 4.47 billion years that&#x27;s something that we can&#x27;t really even comprehend so I just you know I&#x27;m I&#x27;m just kind of not with all these astronomical numbers whether it is uh huge amounts of light years or huge amounts of years um I like the fact that Pratt is shortening all these things into more manageable space and times but um I can&#x27;t say that I follow his his uh derivation of of his theories uh but he does say unlike conventional science the reciprocal system postulates a theoretical Universe based on motion to which Larson derives consequences and compares to Observation most conventional theories are the opposite the theory is developed to specifically explain an observation so many things are missed with the marble analogy only a portion of the marbles are scattered on the floor some remain in the bag in the reciprocal system it is called a mass limit your marbles can only weigh so much in the bag before you have to dump some out um okay well that was a little bit helpful so we just finished that section uh there on um geochronology um and the next section is called calendars uh let me see I think we are pretty much out of time um and we will get back to uh studying up on this next section of uh Daniel Phoenix 3&#x27;s paper on uh geocronology and uh hope you come back uh it&#x27;s a pretty fascinating read so um you know it&#x27;s mind expanding you don&#x27;t have to believe everything just let it wash over you um but it also does give you uh you know an example and an ability to kind of think in reciprocal system terms and to be able to use the reciprocal system to in your own thinking okay uh have a great day we&#x27;ll see hopefully we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow</p>
