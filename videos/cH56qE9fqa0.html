            <p>all right hello hello how is everyone doing out there um welcome to my channel we do uh educational videos here today is video number 150 on the reciprocal system of theory and this is a uh Theory system of theory or Theory of Everything that was a derived by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 we&#x27;re looking at his book called Nothing But motion we&#x27;re in chapter five of that book that&#x27;s called uh chapter five it&#x27;s called gravitation this book is primarily on physics and a little organic chemistry it&#x27;s the first of one of his three volume uh first of his three volumes in the structure of the physical Universe um addition to and um the basic idea behind Larson&#x27;s theory is that we live in a universal motion the universe is made out of motion and not matter not energy but motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other hence the reciprocal system of theory meaning that they are really the same uh they are just inversions of one another uh kind of in the same way that a fraction is you know has an inverse two-thirds and three halves for example and uh that motion requires both uh the numerator and the denominator one is space and one is time depending on what area of the universe you&#x27;re in or what sector of the universe you&#x27;re in you have space over time relationships and you have time over space relationships but you also have multiple dimensions both space and time have three or more dimensions and so um you know you can have time over space to the third power for example and um space and time are both in discrete units meaning that they come in chunks not in a continuity not in a continuum and um that&#x27;s kind of where Larson uh you know he talks about the commutative mathematics and euclidean geometry but basically he starts with those uh initial postulates and he derives an entire theoretical Universe from these postulates if this then that and then if this then that and then he kind of Compares his Universe with the universe that the scientists have measured uh empirically and uh it&#x27;s a favorable uh comparison so he went with it and he derived uh you know he uh plugged his uh system of theory into as many subjects as he could in the time that he was allotted on this Earth uh and he has books on physics and astrophysics and chemistry and astronomy and metaphysics and economics and um you know a lot of uh other subjects that he touches on if if he doesn&#x27;t devote uh you know entire books to it uh and other people have applied it in other areas as well especially Dr Bruce perrett who&#x27;s applied it to a lot of uh you know crypto history and things like that um we will get into that later okay we&#x27;re gonna start here with Larson in chapter five he&#x27;s talking about you know some of the um mechanics of gravitation in his system since Space and Time locations cannot be identified by observation neither inward nor outward motion can be recognized as such it is possible however to observe the changes in relations between the moving objects and other physical structures the photons of radiation for instance are observed to be moving outward from the emitting objects similarly each of the rotating photons in the local environment is moving toward all other rotating photons by reason of the inward Motion in space in which all participate and the change of relative position in space can be observed this second class of identifiable objects in the theoretical Universe thus manifests itself to Observation as a number of individual units which continually move inward toward each other just to interrupt here just to give you a little background in case you didn&#x27;t catch some of the earlier videos uh he&#x27;s basically uh you know he says that the you can have rotation unless you have something to rotate that&#x27;s something to rotate is a photon a photon is uh really just a kind of emotion over the same um uh oscillating motion over the same area over and over again that manifests that as a wave and that um location is moving with the natural reference system so the natural reference system um which is kind of like Larson&#x27;s ether is moving outward at the speed of light in all directions in a scalar manner uh similar to the uh point that you would draw on a balloon with a magic marker you take a bunch of dots on the balloon they&#x27;re all moving away from each other that is the progression of the natural reference system and then in order to get gravitation that Photon that&#x27;s moving outward has to be rotating the rotation of the photon is what cancels out that outward progression and then eventually turns that outward progression into an inward progression um okay here again the identification of the physical counterparts of the theoretical phenomena is a simple matter the inward Motion in all directions of space is gravitation and the rotating photons are the physical objects that gravitate that is atoms and particles collectively the atoms and particles constitute matter as in the case of radiation the new theoretical development leads to a very simple explanation of a hitherto unexplained phenomenon previous investigators in this area have arrived at a reasonably good understanding of the physical effects of gravitation but they are completely at Sea as to how it originated and how the apparent gravitational effect is propagated our finding is that these previous investigators have misunderstood the nature of the gravitational phenomenon except at extreme distances each unit or aggregate of matter in the observed physical Universe continually moves toward all others unless restrained in some way it has therefore been taken for granted that each particle of matter is exerting a force of attraction on the others however when we examine the characteristics of that presumed Force we find that it is something of a very peculiar nature totally unlike the forces of ordinary experience as nearly as we can determine from observation the gravitational force acts instantaneously without an intervening medium and in such a manner that it cannot be screened off or modified in any way these observed characteristics are so difficult to explain theoretically that the theorists have given up the search for an explanation and are now taking the stand that the observations bust for some reason be wrong even though all practical gravitational calculations including those at astronomical distances are carried out on the basis of instantaneous action without introducing any inconsistencies and even though the concept of a force which is wholly dependent upon position in space being propagated through space is self-contradictory the theorists take the stand that since they are unable to devise a theory to account for instantaneous action the gravitational force must be propagated at a finite velocity all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding and even though there is not the slightest evidence of the existence of any medium in space or the existence of any medium like properties of space the theorists also insist that since they are unable to devise a theory without a medium or something that has the properties of a medium such an entity must exist in spite of the negative evidence there are many places in accepted scientific thought where the necessity of facing up to clear evidence from observation or experiment is avoided by the use of one or more of the evasive devices that the modern Theory theorists have invented for the purpose but this gravitational situation is probably the only major instance in which the empirical evidence is openly and categorically defied while the total lack of any explanation of the gravitational phenomena that is consistent with the observations has undoubtedly been the primary cause of the flagrantly unscientific attitude that has been taken here an erroneous belief concerning the nature of electromagnetic radiation has been a significant contributing factor the enormous extension of the known range of radiation frequencies in modern times has been accomplished mainly through the generation of these additional frequencies by electrical means and it has come to be believed that there is a unique connection between radiation and electrical processes that radiation is the carrier by means of which electrical and magnetic effects are propagated from this it is only a short step to the conclusion that there must also be gravitational waves carriers of gravitational energy quote such gravitational waves resemble electromagnetic waves says Joseph Weber who has been carrying on an extensive search for these hypothetical waves for many years theoretical development in the preceding Pages shows that this presumed analogy does not represent the reality of the universe of motion in that Universe radiation and gravitation are phenomenon of a totally different order but it is worth noting that radical differences between these two types of phenomena are also apparent in the information that is available from empirical sources that information is simply ignored in current practice because it conflicts with a popular theories of the moment radiation is a process whereby energy is transferred from a material aggregate at some particular location in space or time to other spatial or temporal locations each Photon has a definite frequency of vibration and a corresponding energy content hence these photons are essentially traveling units of energy the emitting agency loses a specific amount of energy whenever a photon leaves this energy travels through the intervening space or time until the photon encounters a unit of matter with which it is able to interact whereupon the energy is transferred wholly or in part to this matter at either end of the path the energy is recognizable as as such and is readily interchangeable with other types of energy the radiant energy of the impending Photon May for instance be converted to into kinetic energy heat or into electrical energy the photoelectric effect or into chemical energy the photochemical action similarly any of these other types of energy which may exist at the point of emission of the radiation can be converted into radiation by appropriate processes the gravitational situation is entirely different gravitational energy is not interchangeable with other forms of energy at any specific location with respect to other masses a mass unit possesses a definite amount of gravitational also known as potential energy and it is impossible to increase or decrease this energy content by conversion from or to other forms of energy it is true that a change in location results in a release or absorption of energy but the gravitational energy which the mass possesses at a point a at Point a cannot be converted to any other type of energy at Point a nor can the gravitational energy at a be transferred unchanged to any other point B except along equal potential lines the only energy that makes its appearance in any other form at point B is that portion of the gravitational energy which the mass possessed at Point a that it can no longer have at point B a fixed amount determined entirely by the difference in location radiant energy remains constant while traveling in space but can vary almost without limit at any specific location the behavior of gravitation is the exact opposite the gravitational effect remains constant at any specific location but it varies if the mass moves from one location to another unless the movement is along an equal potential line which basically just means uh at the same level uh like gra at the same altitude you know in terms of gravity uh you know the higher something is the the more potential energy it has and this is saying it&#x27;s at equal potential line so this is a really at the same altitude you know at least if we&#x27;re talking about on Earth um Dynamics on Earth energy is defined as capability of doing work kinetic energy for example qualifies under this definition and any kind of energy that can be freely converted to kinetic energy likewise qualifies but gravitational energy is not capable of doing work as a general proposition it will do one thing and that thing only it will move masses inward toward each other if this motion is permitted to take place the gravitational energy decreases and the decrement makes its appearance as kinetic energy which can then be utilized in the normal matter but unless gravitation is allowed to do this one thing which it is capable of doing the gravitational energy is completely unavailable it cannot do anything itself nor can it be converted to any form of energy that can do something the mass itself can theoretically be converted to kinetic energy but this internal energy equivalent of the mass is something totally different from the gravitational energy it is entirely independent of position with reference to other masses gravitational or potential energy on the other hand is purely energy of position that is for any two specific masses the mutual potential energy is determined solely by their spatial separation but energy of position in space cannot be propagated in Space the concept of transmitting this energy from one spatial position to another is totally incompatible with the fact that the magnitude of the energy is determined by the spatial location propagation of gravitation is therefore inherently impossible the gravitational action is necessarily instantaneous as Newton&#x27;s law indicates and as has always been assumed for purposes of calculation it is particularly significant therefore that the theoretical characteristics of gravitation as derived from the postulates of the reciprocal system are in full agreement with the empirical observations strange as these observations may seem in the theoretical Universe of motion gravitation is not an action of one aggregate of matter on another as it appears to be it is simply an inward motion of the material units an inherent property of the atoms and particles of matter the same motion that makes an atom an atom also causes it to gravitate each atom and each aggregate is pursuing its own course independently of all others but because each unit is moving inward in space it is moving toward all other units and this gives the appearance of a mutual interaction these theoretical inward motions totally independent of each other necessarily have just the kind of characteristics that are observed in gravitation the change in the relative position of two objects due to the independent motions of each occurs instantaneously and there is nothing propagated from one to the other through a medium or in any other way whatever exists or occurs in the intervening space can have no effect on the results of the independent motions okay um we&#x27;re going to stop there as the next paragraphs pretty long uh now I think that&#x27;s a pretty uh good summation of Larson&#x27;s concept of gravitation and you might want to listen to that over and over again a couple times so that you can get the concepts but uh you know you if you could if you can kind of understand scalar motion then I think you can understand gravitation so you know scalar motion is just emotion without a Direction it has a magnitude but no direction or it has all directions um and again you use can use the analogy of the expanding balloon or the Contracting balloon in the case of gravitation and uh you can also use the raisin bread analogy um and so um you know try to try it out see if you can get this to click we&#x27;ll be back tomorrow for more thanks for tuning in</p>
