Glad, joyful. 18-year-old Naquan Lucas has pleaded not guilty in both murders, and while prosecutors prepare to try Lucas and the 2 17-year-olds, Pirro seemed to point some blame at DC&#x27;s juvenile system. All three of these juveniles that I&#x27;ve just mentioned. are known to the juvenile court.</p>
