            <p>[Music] You know, you told us earlier that, you know, your your the personal subjective dimension to your your research was so strong that you you constructed an observation tower um not just to observe objects, but to uh you know, provoke uh whatever is behind the objects uh what you call the control system. So, here&#x27;s a here&#x27;s a question for you coming again from one of our members whose name is uh is Sue. It and I think it&#x27;s a difficult question um uh to ask you publicly, but I I still want to try it. Do you have any personal conclusions about UAP and uh and why they&#x27;re here? &gt;&gt; Um you know, in in science, you rarely reach you Of course, you you hope to reach a conclusion, but you&#x27;re always aware that it&#x27;s a temporary conclusion on the way to something else. And usually people ask me in a much more direct way, you know, at at your age, aren&#x27;t you afraid that you&#x27;re going to die without knowing what it is? you know, which is a a more direct way of asking the same question.</p>
<p>Your u you know, correspondent is very polite. Um the um I I I I don&#x27;t care. I mean that&#x27;s if if you ask you know Dr. Nolan who has many discoveries to his credit, you know, do you uh do you want to solve the problem of cancer? he probably would say, you know, we&#x27;ve already made a lot of progress and there are types of of cancers that we can cure or detect early enough to cure. There are other types that we just don&#x27;t understand at all and the um we will at some point if you know as science makes progress but uh you know any scientist has to expect to die without having all the answers.</p>
<p>Um I think that um you know we relativity has given us a number of answers in physics but we now find that that&#x27;s insufficient to explain the contradictions that we have with quantum mechanics and so on and the contradictions continue and that&#x27;s been the case for almost a century that we haven&#x27;t overcome the contradictions. So yes, you uh you make small advances and once in a while you make a big advance. I think the point the important thing now I mean it&#x27;s great that Congress is doing this work and so on and I have a lot of respect for it having been part of congressional hearings on on other things in and the use of u information networks for managing crisis and so on where I I was uh I was asked to to be part of the the process of you know as as a technical witness. So I I know how it works and I have a lot of respect for that work. The uh in in the lab I&#x27;m not trying to evade the question, you know, it it&#x27;s a big question.</p>
<p>What I hope is to have a chance to to explore the idea that we&#x27;re dealing with a a meta system, not just a system. And what we were designing with Mr. Bigalow was a meta system, you know, that an an assembly of good observations that we could refine and then take us take up to the next level. And I think that&#x27;s what is not being done. and that the the the people who are trained to be, you know, the the the the the troops that would help us refine that system have been the project has been shut down for reasons I never understood and the financing was terminated and that&#x27;s gone.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s evaporated. So I&#x27;m so I&#x27;m not going to jump into just hoping that this thing is going to happen again. I think those things happen rarely that you can assemble the kind of talent that uh Dr. Cole Keller assembled with Mr. Bigalow, you know, on on in the days of Bass and uh and the support we had from from Washington at the time, it was very small, but I I think that um we were on the way to to getting the right questions answered.</p>
<p>So, I I would um I would hope somebody would do it again. It&#x27;s not going to be me. Uh I I would hope to um to add to to get some certainty about the nature of the dialogue with the phenomena. You know what kind of dialogue that is it? Is it just like a dialogue between us and a whale for example or or an ape or a bird that we can develop and we there are number of experiments to do that. There are experiments also on how you would communicate with aliens that have not been disclosed but we know they exist.</p>
<p>uh I know specifically that from people who were involved in those experiments that they exist and I think that&#x27;s a a big hope for me that we can go forward to that and build the kind of language constructs that would enable us to tap into that higher level you know I mean we know there have to be higher levels of existence and we know that they and communicate with us be by sharing the space. I mean, you know, we communicate with all kinds of of with ants and mice that don&#x27;t necessarily are not necessarily interested in a dialogue with us. But in in this case, it&#x27;s going to be vital for us in terms of survival of humans to communicate in a way that&#x27;s intelligent. um even though we may be at in some ways at lower levels from what what we&#x27;re perceiving and I think that&#x27;s what we need to come to grips with from certainly my from what I can bring to the party which is the information information science and meta science side of [Music]</p>
