            <p>software to die for the proma software Scandal and how the US justice department became software pirates in the name of National Security with Ted St rain or teed if you prefer brought to you by T camp and TC con.org check them out www media archives.com proudly presents this material thank you for watching also check out www promis scandal.com see you soon okay great so uh here we are at the um tour Camp tour camp.org um we basically been filming an event here in uh Washington State uh at a Titan one missile silo um and and it&#x27;s all about hacking and so if you want more information about that go to Tor camp.org uh but right now we&#x27;re here to talk about uh the S proma software Scandal and uh it&#x27;s been something that&#x27;s intrigued me for many many years 20 25 years now almost my entire adult life and um see where did my clicker go there it is and so basically um in the current market a good friend of mine helped um uh helped write a book uh with another friend of mine Jim Keith uh called The Octopus the secret government and the death of Danny Casto which is what we&#x27;re going to talk about here today and so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s Ken and uh his his uh little conspiracy Zen called steam shovel press and so we basically um yeah let&#x27;s cut to that sure um yeah and so basically uh Jim Keith and um Ken wrote this uh synopsis about Danny Castello and they basically um basically wrote this book that&#x27;s available now on Amazon so this is Danny uh I guess I should dedicate this presentation to Danny&#x27;s in Danny&#x27;s memory because he&#x27;s no longer with us um he wouldn&#x27;t have really enjoyed a book like this I should point out that Jim Keith uh who uh isn&#x27;t in this photo but we&#x27;ll see him later um he also died actually Burning Man a few years back and so a lot of people associate with the story have um died in one way or another in fact there&#x27;s uh some researchers say there&#x27;s up to 40 people who have died under mysterious circumstances associated with this story and so hopefully we&#x27;re not one of them uh anyway so this is Danny we&#x27;re going to be talking about him a lot later um and so there&#x27;s this octopus uh Danny was investigating uh something called The Octopus and uh the octopus basically had full wanted tool everything uh all of our basically entire Society our infrastructure our who we pay our taxes to what you know what the whole thing&#x27;s about and so um so this octopus uh basically um came across this uh piece of software um called promis and we&#x27;ll talk about that in a minute um and so um basically back in the 1970s um they had the same problem we&#x27;re having today and that a lot of the uh uh data that they were collecting from a lot of these different systems were basically just overwhelming them and in the 1970s um something called the Leah the uh law enforcement assistance Administration I think it was uh put out a contract for um a series of uh software development projects to help reformulate the Justice Department&#x27;s um software um for their basically for case tracking and so we&#x27;ll see let me just skip forward a moment and so this is basically what it was the prosecutors management information system and it&#x27;s basically promise for short some people call it promise promise software and um and so this is what they were after they wanted to revamp uh the entire um the entire uh basically Court tracking system uh basically what they were using was the equipment to Lotus 123 and and what they got was something that was very different uh what they needed was something that rather than uh searching hierarchal uh from A to Z for an example would go out and get everything to the least common denominator and go out and search everything at once and then come back and sort it all out and figure out what all that stuff was and then make information out of it and in today&#x27;s age that would be like Google or something you know sounds like webbot or something uh webbot or just any of the any of the stuff that&#x27;s out there now and we&#x27;ll see um we&#x27;ll see as the presentation goes on um that a lot of the things that happen out here now uh especially in terms of troan and and viruses and things like that are exactly what promis was designed to do because promis was a data Miner and so we&#x27;ll see here in a minute uh in fact let me back up a slide um to this Enterprise SL CU today we call it Enterprise or the cloud or whatever um and so basically um what it was designed to do was go out it didn&#x27;t matter what system it was on or what um where it was at uh depending on what system it was installed on it would basically go out and and get everything down to its least common denominator and then bring it all back and sort it all out and then spit out some information unlike any other software at the time I 1978 1979 and the company that that released this software was called inslaw The Institute for Law and something something something uh they&#x27;re actually still in business believe it or not after being almost driven out of business by the government as we will Su seen U and so there&#x27;s this promis software and here&#x27;s an example of basically what it could look like CU it&#x27;s out on the market today um and so this is basically an example of something that promis might do and it was the first software to let somebody figure out like be able to sort by a defendant or attorney involved or or whatever you know they could sort by all these different things it&#x27;s like Excel is today but you know today what they had needed in main frames to do before of course we can do you know on a MacBook Pro but at the time this was like revolutionary software um and so and of course you guys probably know this guy Alan Turing uh developed theoretical models on something called the turing machine that was basically one of the earliest computers and so uh but using the same basically um oh yeah and so this is is basically just a um demonstration what a basic flowchart is I mean it&#x27;s kind of just something funny we eat some food we go out and bomb some people here we are at a missile silo out in Washington I thought it was all very funny but anyway so that&#x27;s normally how data is processed but in today&#x27;s age of course we&#x27;re all used to this Matrix and this parallel processing where we get everything down to that lease com and we&#x27;re used to that now but back then that wasn&#x27;t the case um and so it&#x27;s very interesting that um basically everything we built everything today that we built on uh is all based on on this kind of computing power and so basically promis wanted to get down to that root level uh figure out all the data and try to make sense of it and then bring it all back it&#x27;s basically almost in artificial intelligence at the time and we&#x27;ll soon see that uh they use this kind of software to basically develop almost all the technology that we&#x27;re used to today you know we&#x27;re knowing about the we know it as like The Social Network you know the so we go out and you know do our our blasters events and things yeah and so you know I&#x27;m also involved in a lot of other uh interesting uh subjects uh sacred geometry for an example all sorts of paranormal and metaphysical things I was actually going to present a presentation here on the What&#x27;s called the god helmet and uh using electroc cross rotating electromagnetic fields to basically induce hallucination that&#x27;s why you see God when you&#x27;re on this helmet like 80% of the people reported having some kind of religious experience when you put this helmet on that&#x27;s got these electrodes Michael Persinger from uh University of Toronto in the 1980s Believe It or Not uh researched all this stuff and they were the reason they used helmets they used football helmets because they he was using he was at the University and so he&#x27;s using his friends that were football players as subjects and so they brought in a helmet he fitted it with these electrodes and as we&#x27;ll soon see that this same stuff is what promis is used to and so it&#x27;s very interesting that this same social networking and getting down to the least common denominator uh is basically found in nature everywhere um you know we have different fra that represent this kind of basically what we today you know know as you know computers and so and of course this is a blood vessel in the brain it just goes all the way out and you go look at the spiral arms of Galaxy and it&#x27;s it all follows this one ratio the Fibonacci spiral you guys probably heard 1.618 you know 59385 or something um and so it&#x27;s interesting I find this interesting because it this is what promis did is it got at all those little tiny tips at the very ends of the blood vessels and it got all that back and brought it back to the central route and then was able to do something with it um and so same thing with like molecular engineering and biology and and and different things like that we will see here in a minute um you know I should probably um here go ahead and cut to me real quick um I should go into presentation mode here because I do have some notes the notes the notes um yeah and so this is this subject&#x27;s like totally fascinated me since it it came out I mean the Danny Castello story broke in 19 um 1991 and um you know ever since then and and what caught my eye was a Baron&#x27;s Financial weekly article they ran four weeks Baron Financial weekly is a huge uh Financial thing that&#x27;s still in business Believe It or Not uh out of London and they ran like 110 column inches like four full Pages yeah and so um well Baron was trying to um it was they weren&#x27;t trying to solidify anything it was financial news the the the government was stealing this software and nobody was doing anything about it and now people were dying and people were being that were investigating were being murdered in hotel rooms and and weird car crashes and who knows what you know who knows what the the what lies in this Plumbing um and so basically promise was also good for um basically bios specific weapons is what it was used for but we&#x27;ll talk about more more of that in a minute and so um and so as an example of um you know we have this social network now that that uses these kinds of tools you know we&#x27;re used to this um kind of processing that that that was brought upon us and when you look at things like viruses and worms we&#x27;ll talk more about this later uh basically this is what promis did it went out there and mined data just like these and they sent it back to a central server and it got processed and so we&#x27;ll talk about this in a minute but what Google&#x27;s doing what all these places are doing the NSA you know there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s an Echelon post just close to here Yakama Washington&#x27;s got a huge you know uh post right over here man they&#x27;re listening to us um but anyway so um they could be among us uh yeah well no they will be now because I&#x27;m posting this on uh you know on YouTube next week um so you know we&#x27;re we&#x27;re we&#x27;re tied into that now we&#x27;re all part of that we&#x27;re we&#x27;re part of what basically what this all represented basically what said last night yeah I mean we&#x27;re I mean we&#x27;re on and he&#x27;s been in you know he&#x27;s on The Cutting Edge and it was funny he referred to me almost like Jesus the other day because I do a lot of technical stuff for a lot of hacking shows but including his um the LA the next hope.org um anyway so uh and I I have this website all about this if you&#x27;re interested in getting the slides or watching this video again you can go to promis scandal.com pmos PRM o p rmis scandal.com two s&#x27;s there and so uh so we basically have all this um these social Nets and we&#x27;re basically this is what we&#x27;re doing we&#x27;re you know we&#x27;re trying to process this data I mean I have terabytes of data at home I have 20,000 hours of video I&#x27;m trying to process you know it&#x27;s like 45 terabytes or something it&#x27;s just an incredible uh hard thing and so we get into these algorithms where basically um you know these computers start figuring stuff out on their own it&#x27;s just ones and zeros but they can make a pretty good judge you know and and when this software came out you know like plate recognition software and all this you know face recognition all these different you know they weren&#x27;t really around uh and this is basically what started it was was these kinds of um basically um kinds of software uh anyway we&#x27;ll uh talk about Google later um but they do the same thing basically Google goes out and grabs as much data as they can brings it back and you know puts it on your desktop you know what a great service um we&#x27;ll talk about Google later and so uh I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re all familiar with the cryptos uh key here in the um being in the um hacker community and so you know in the in the courtyard of the CIA there&#x27;s this um there&#x27;s this crypto scultpure and you know they it took years and years and some finally somebody you know solved a key for it and they haven&#x27;t they&#x27;ve deciphered all but you know one of the four passages or and so uh so this is what promis was good at is it would go out and and be able to do this uh you know 20 30 years ago of course today we all have fiber optic and everything and we of course we also have big brother and so uh so this is where it all like all this technology um combines and it&#x27;s also why this was such an important story and why Baron&#x27;s Financial weekly and spy magazine wirds ran like probably half dozen articles on it you know and they keep up to date you know when something new comes out and when I get killed they&#x27;ll hopefully write a story</p>
