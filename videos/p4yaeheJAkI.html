            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>we have here professor bo haystad professor of nuclear physics at the uppsala uh university welcome thank you very much so you participated to the test of lugano of the new hot icat and the first question is that did you participate also to a previous experiment or is your first time no no this is the second one okay so the first one was actually in ferrara the year before okay and because of the results there we decided to make a new experiment more carefully and even including the analysis of the fuel oh yes which is the very important novelty i mean so yeah yes i want to um to speak about the ashes but first i want to make you a more general question uh most of nuclear physicists are very skeptic about the so-called cold fusion or land they just say nuclear fission is impossible at this temperature because of the repulsion between the nucleus so uh what can you say why do you think that in some way it is possible some nuclear reaction in the condition typical of the of the cold fusion that i don&#x27;t know i&#x27;m also very skeptical because as a nuclear physicist i well know that the coulomb repulsion will prevent any fusion to take place at room temperature and even at a rather high temperature so we are approaching this phenomena just experimentally because we have seen in previous experiments there is an indication that excessive heat is in fact produced and we are curious to find out experimentally if that is true or not and the heat being so excessive so the only source of that is what we know it could be on the on the nuclear side meaning fusion and so we have checked that so in our second experiment now we were very keen on examining the fuel content because if there is a fusion going on then your fuel should also change and that&#x27;s where why we were very eager to find that out but again i&#x27;m very skeptical but that this phenomenon can occur but we have to also relate to an experimental site and if we can confirm that this experimental fact is really true then we have to go on and find explanations that so far there is no explanation for there are speculations yeah i would say yes no no theoretical explanation and it&#x27;s a big difference between the two concepts and if we want to speak about speculation just to let understand to our listener if we can just guess a process that can lower these barriers i&#x27;m not looking for an explanation i know that now there&#x27;s no explanation there&#x27;s no explanation okay if you if you look at two two nuclei in isolation i mean just two nuclei and see how is it possible like that they can fuse then you have to accelerate them towards each other so they can penetrate the coulomb barrier meaning that they have higher energy than the cooling barrier and so that condition is clear when it&#x27;s just two nuclei when those two nuclei are embedded in a metal even the electrons for the metal might interfere in such a way that the coulomb barrier is in fact lowered and although it in the sense that the two that has the two nuclei are neutral at a shorter distance than they would be in a free case so what i&#x27;m saying is that the electrons in the metal might change the conditions in favor of fusions at lower temperature in a metal but we don&#x27;t know we don&#x27;t know so the only way of finding this out is by first doing the experiment and again when the experiments are confirmed then we have something to relate to and then we can start to think theoretically okay um i i see some per um parallel between uh this this theme and the so-called dark energy dark matter we saw an effect yes indeed indeed yeah we saw an effect we call this effect dark energy but actually we don&#x27;t know what is exactly exactly because it but yeah there you have a phenomenon because the galaxies are rotated in a way that must be some extra gravitational force and then you speculate can what can that be and then you call it dark matter so there you have an observation it&#x27;s very much the same we have a clear we have an observation first of all i will also say that the observation must be confirmed by more experiments one observation in particular when it comes to something dramatic it&#x27;s never never enough in physics you have to confirm it and when we are clear about the the experimental observation the results of it then we can go on okay another very frequent object objection is that no gamma ray no fusion you don&#x27;t have an explanation of course but but is this a killer objection like well it&#x27;s yes and no of course one would think that all radio radioactivity or nuclear reactions would be followed by by gamma rays or whatever that&#x27;s mostly true but it&#x27;s not true in all cases if you look at our situation for example where we have hydrogen and we have lithium in the fuel and the proton can in fact react with the lithium lithium-7 isotope this star then they form beryllium-8 beryllium-8 is very peculiar in that way it decays immediately in the two alpha particles no gamma nothing just two alpha particles these two particles have kinetic energy and those are just coming to rest in the fuel creating heat so there you don&#x27;t have an evasion yeah in the first in in the first step however i would expect that even in this case the helium particles have such a high energy we&#x27;re talking about between 7 and 10 mv that they can on a secondary turn to collide with the nucleus and then create low energy gammas so basically it is very hard to find out schemes but it&#x27;s not impossible but it&#x27;s very hard to find out schemes where there shouldn&#x27;t be any any or particles in general from nuclear reactions so that&#x27;s the second mystery and for the first time you had the opportunity to analyze both the fuel before the reaction and then the ashes after the reaction what did you find and does it make sense uh well we found an isotopic shift and when we found that isotopic shift then of course we were very surprised because we were very skeptical but being skeptical you should never be skeptical to the point that you don&#x27;t examine things even don&#x27;t want to see exactly and we did the analysis with respect to the the ash that means the burn fuel uh in in many different ways so we are sure that the results we get it&#x27;s not just one well one one result where we get the same results with different methods so we found an isotopic shift in the in the fuel and that is dramatic that is very dramatic because you can&#x27;t have isotopic shifts in in a material unless there is a nuclear reaction going on well i shouldn&#x27;t say uh mostly that is the case you can also have isotope separation by by diffusion for example but that you do when you when you uh when you want to have uranium 235 out of natural uranium for example so that is diffusion processes but in this little reaction tube there is no diffusion process going on i&#x27;m just saying this just to be 100 sure that there are different methods all the very rare and very particular to create isotopic shifts but in this case it&#x27;s clear we got a shift in lithium and we got a shift in nickel and that was very surprising so that is one clue to building up more information on on what&#x27;s going on here and uh there&#x27;s a shifting yeah is a current i mean with the production of energy same order are they completely different yes that that&#x27;s a very good question because you know if you take the amount of fuel we have and then you sort of see how that&#x27;s your topic it was done and then you trace back what kind of nuclear reactions should be behind that and just an example to check is the fuel enough to create that energy and we did that calculation in the report and the answer is yes you can see the numbers there and um yes and and so so the amount of fuel the imaginable reactions are compatible with the total energy we got from the run there is people there who is saying that is not so sure that the i mean the conservation of the ashes and so on was careful because it was mr rossi that was loading and unloading i must make this question so can you imagine any way in which rossi could manipulate i i think under your eyes the fuel or the ashes uh well of course we were very we were very careful to see that nothing uh obscure or nothing hidden had and what was going on with ash just just as as a precaution but the answer is no we handle dash of course mr rossi was was present um they helped us in some way but you could also choose the sample yeah yes yes okay we okay we picked up the sample we wanted to have a look at and so on but of course i mean in principle i mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s possible to see</p>
