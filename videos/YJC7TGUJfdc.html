            <p>welcome to tuman insights where we reveal the hidden forces that shape the way you live and show you how to use them to create real transformation and supercharge your health mindset and daily life here are your hosts Emma Greenwood and Nathan [Music] Sinclair ever wish you could throw a ball and defy gravity well you&#x27;re in for a treat today&#x27;s Deep dive is all about the wild world of electrogravitics the idea that we might be able to control gravity using electricity you with us let&#x27;s go and we&#x27;re talking about more than just science fiction here it&#x27;s rooted in decades of research beginning with a fascinating figure named T Townsen Brown ah T towns and bran a physics whiz kid who was basically tinkering with circuits before he could even ride a bike imagine being that young and already obsessed with unlocking the secrets of the universe this wasn&#x27;t just some passing fancy brown was driven by a lifelong Fascination particularly with space travel back in the early 1900s that wasn&#x27;t exactly a common career goal now get ready for this Legend has it that brown had a major aha moment as a teenager while messing around with a coolage tube you know those things dentists use for x-rays it&#x27;s amazing what a curious mind can find in the most unexpected places Brown observed a slight thrust every time he turned the tube on now this might not seem like much but it got him thinking could there be a connection between high voltage electricity and an object&#x27;s weight this was a radical idea considering that at the time gravity was understood purely in terms of mass more mass meant more gravity period so basically Brown was already challenging the fundamental laws of physics as a teenager talk about starting young but he didn&#x27;t stop there he took that crazy idea and ran with it eventually building something he called a gravitator and you won&#x27;t believe this but his first version wasn&#x27;t some massive complicated machine it was basically a simple capacitor setup simple in design perhaps but with potentially mind-blowing implications picture this a capacitor with one end positively charged Brown applied a high voltage DC current to it and get this the device actually started to move propelled in the direction of that positively charged end hold on so just by juicing up a capacitor he created thrust was it just a tiny little nudge or something more substantial definitely not just a tiny nudge according to our sources some of his gravitator produce thrust equal to a whole percentage point of their own weight that&#x27;s like attaching a battery to a brick and watching it move on its own and it all stem from what we now call the beeld brown effect the BFI Brown effect sounds official fill us in named after Brown and his professor at Dennis University Dr Paul bfield this effect basically states that an asymmetrical capacitor when hit with high voltage creates thrust it highlights the collaborative nature of scientific breakthroughs wouldn&#x27;t you say absolutely two heads are better than one espe when you&#x27;re trying to cck the C of gravity but did Brown just observe this effect or did he actually put it to the test you know me I love a good experiment he was meticulous in his approach one of his experiments involved a rotating arm suspended from the ceiling he attached a gravitator to each end and cranked up the voltage what happened next the arm began to spin with each gravitator moving towards its positive pole fascinating right that&#x27;s not just fascinating it&#x27;s practically straight out of a sci-fi movie but wait a minute how could he be sure the spinning wasn&#x27;t caused by something else like the air moving around the gravitator that&#x27;s where Brown&#x27;s meticulous nature shines through he was incredibly thorough in ruling out other explanations he even submerged the entire setup in a tank of oil to eliminate the possibility of ion wind causing the movement he wanted to be absolutely certain that what he was seeing was genuine okay that&#x27;s some Next Level scientific rigger right there submerging an entire experiment in oil I guess when you&#x27;re challenging the laws of physics you got to bring your aame what did all of this actually mean was he really on the verge of proving that we can manipulate gravity well that&#x27;s where things get even more interesting and controversial you&#x27;re killing me with the suspense don&#x27;t leave me hanging what happened next remember how Brown&#x27;s work suggested a direct connection between electricity and gravity this flew right in the face of Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity which was and still is a Cornerstone of modern physics Einstein proposed that gravity is a result of mass warping SpaceTime time while Brown&#x27;s work hinted at electrical Fields directly influencing gravitational forces so it was like a scientific Showdown Einstein versus brown I can&#x27;t even imagine the reaction from the physics community at the time did they just dismiss Brown&#x27;s work as outlandish or it wasn&#x27;t quite that simple though many were skeptical Brown&#x27;s findings definitely ruffled some feathers but they also sparked a debate that continues to this day you see science is about constantly evolving testing and questioning what seems out landish in one era might be the key to unlocking a whole new understanding of the universe in the next now that&#x27;s an exciting thought are you saying Brown&#x27;s work might have been ahead of its time maybe they simply didn&#x27;t have the right framework to fully grasp it back then you&#x27;re catching on fast forward a few decades and a new Theory emerges that might just shed some light on Brown&#x27;s observations it&#x27;s called subquantum kinetics and while some still consider it a fringe idea it offers a truly fascinating alternative perspective on gravity sub kinetics oh okay I can already feel my brain starting to bend a little break that down for me if you can in the simplest terms possible of course essentially subquantum kinetic suggests that gravity isn&#x27;t just about Mass warping SpaceTime as Einstein proposed instead it proposes that gravity has two polarities one that attracts matter and another that repels it wait hold on are you saying there might be a kind of anti-gravity out there this is getting wild and how does this tie back to Brown&#x27;s work well that&#x27;s the really intriguing part some subquantum kinetics also suggests that these gravitational polarities are directly linked to electrical charges positive charges would create those matter attracting gravity Wells were familiar with while negative charges would create matter repelling gravity hills and remember how Brown&#x27;s gravitator involved those positive and negative charges okay I think I see where you&#x27;re going with this are you saying that brown might have inadvertently stumbled upon a way to manipulate these gravitational polarities using his relatively simple capacity setup that&#x27;s the theory and it&#x27;s a theory that&#x27;s gaining traction among some physicists and researchers who are pushing the boundaries of electrogravitics this is all incredibly mind-boggling it really makes you wonder what brown would think if he knew his work was still being debated and explored all these years later it&#x27;s like his legacy is Defying Gravity in a way just like his experiments and that&#x27;s the mark of a truly Innovative thinker isn&#x27;t it their ideas transcend their time absolutely but before we get too far ahead of ourselves with the wh ifs and the potential for revolutionizing space travel and whatnot I have to ask what happened with brown did he continue down this path of electrogravitics oh he absolutely did in fact his Ambitions grew even Bolder as he got older Bolder okay you can&#x27;t just drop a bombshell like that and expect me to wait what did he do did he try building a larger gravitator he set his sights on something much much bigger think flying discs wait are we talking about actual flying saucers here things that go whoosh in the night this deep dive is about to take an even Wilder turn isn&#x27;t it you&#x27;re telling me that t Townson Brown the gravity defying Maverick went from tinkering with capacitors to building actual flying saucers that sounds like something straight out of a comic book it does doesn&#x27;t it but Brown was convinced that electrogravitics could be the key to revolutionizing propulsion and achieving what many considered impossible building a craft that could navigate the skies like nothing else so he wasn&#x27;t just theorizing it he actually rolled up his sleeves and started building these things I can only imagine the workshop he must have had from what we&#x27;ve gathered brown collaborated with several aerospace companies and even conducted tests both in the United States and overseas in France hold up hold up we&#x27;re talking about real world testing of flying discs based on his electr gravitics research that&#x27;s not just science anymore that&#x27;s stepping right into the realm of Science Fiction what do these discs look like were they like the classic flying saucers we see in movies details about these flying discs are unfortunately a bit scary much of Brown&#x27;s later work remains shrouded in secrecy but from what we can piece together some of his prototypes were dis shaped While others were more like lenticular air foils he even built a disc that was reportedly 6t in diameter imagine that thing taking flight 6 feet across that&#x27;s not some tiny model that&#x27;s getting pretty close to a real working flying machine did he ever achieve liftoff with these discs I have to know According to some accounts he did Witnesses claimed to have have seen some of his prototypes achieve impressive speeds hovering silently and even performing Maneuvers that seem to defy conventional aerodynamics this is incredible you&#x27;re telling me that this guy might have cracked the code of anti-gravity flight decades ago I can&#x27;t believe this isn&#x27;t bigger News why haven&#x27;t we heard more about this well as you can imagine Brown&#x27;s work attracted a lot of attention and not all of it was from the scientific Community oh boy here we go you&#x27;re about to tell me that the government swooped in and shut down his operation right top secret stuff men in black suits the whole nine yards you&#x27;re not far off this was the era of the Cold War a time of intense secrecy and competition between Global superpowers the possibility of harnessing electr gravitics for military applications especially something as groundbreaking as anti-gravity propulsion was simply too tempting for some to ignore so we&#x27;re talking about potential black budget projects Area 51 that sort of thing now it feels like we&#x27;ve really gone down the rabbit hole it&#x27;s amazing to think that a science curiosity could have such far-reaching implications but if Brown&#x27;s work was truly revolutionary why haven&#x27;t we seen any tangible results of it today I mean where are all the flying cars H that&#x27;s the million-dollar question isn&#x27;t it the truth is we simply don&#x27;t know for sure what became of Brown&#x27;s research especially his later work with those flying discs some believe that it was all swept under the rug locked away in some government Vault deemed too sensitive to ever see the light of day others believed that his theories while intriguing were ultimately flawed that true electrogravitic propulsion simply isn&#x27;t possible so we&#x27;re left with more questions and answers it&#x27;s a bit frustrating but it also adds to the mystery and Intrigue of it all but let&#x27;s be honest even if we haven&#x27;t cracked the code of anti-gravity flight yet Brown&#x27;s Legacy lives on right is where continues to inspire researchers and dreamers alike absolutely and that&#x27;s the beauty of science it&#x27;s a never-ending quest for knowledge and understanding Brown dared to challenge the status quo to push the boundaries of what was considered possible and in doing so he opened up new avenues of inquiry that continue to Intrigue and Inspire I&#x27;m thinking back to those early experiments with the coolage tube it&#x27;s amazing to think that such a simple observation could have sparked such a chain reaction of Discovery and debate it&#x27;s a reminder that groundbreaking ideas can come from the most unexpected places and that sometimes all it takes is one person with an insatiable curiosity and a willingness to challenge conventional wisdom to change the world I love that it makes me wonder what other Fringe ideas are being explored today that might seem outlandish now but could revolutionize our understanding of the universe in the future the possibilities are endless really what if we could tap into Zero Point Energy or achieve faster than light travel through wormholes or even manipulate Consciousness itself these might seem like Concepts straight out of Science Fiction but so to the idea of heavier than airflight just a little over a century ago you&#x27;re right it&#x27;s easy to forget that what we could consider impossible today might become commonplace tomorrow but getting back to T towns in brown what do you think his legacy will be what will he be remembered for I think Brown will be remembered as a Visionary a true Pioneer who dared to explore the Uncharted territories of physics he might not have had all the answers but he wasn&#x27;t afraid to ask the big questions to challenge assumptions and to push the boundaries of human understanding and that&#x27;s a powerful Legacy to leave behind he showed us that sometimes the most important thing to Simply ask what if and to never stop exploring the possibilities no matter how strange or unconventional they might seem and who knows maybe someday thanks to the groundwork laid by Pioneers like T towns and brown we&#x27;ll be zipping around in our very own flying cars powered by the very forces that govern the universe and that&#x27;s a future I didn&#x27;t get behind well that was an incredible Deep dive from those early experiments with the coolage tube to the mystery surrounding those flying discs t sound in Brown story is one for the books it certainly makes you think twice about the true nature of gravity and the possibilities that might still be out there waiting to be discovered absolutely but before we wrap up there&#x27;s one last thing we need to explore the potential implications of Brown&#x27;s work and the future of electrogravitics so we&#x27;ve explored the life and work of T towns and Brown from those early gravitator experiments to those mysterious flying discs but what does it all mean where do we go from here that&#x27;s the question that keeps re Searchers up at night isn&#x27;t it if even a fraction of what we&#x27;ve discussed about Brown&#x27;s work holds true the implications are staggering we could be talking about a complete paradigm shift in our understanding of physics and the Very forces that govern our universe it&#x27;s mind-blowing to think that we might be on the cusp of unlocking the secrets of Gravity itself we&#x27;ve already touched on things like anti-gravity propulsion and revolutionizing space travel but what other potential applications could come from harnessing electric gravitics the possibilities are almost Limitless imagine a world where we can manipulate gravity to create new forms of energy build structures that defy conventional engineering even develop new medical technologies that could revolutionize Healthcare wow I&#x27;m getting chills just thinking about it new energy sources gravity defying architecture medical Miracles sounds like the stuff of Science Fiction yet here we are on the verge of potentially making it a reality and let&#x27;s not forget the potential impact on our understanding of the universe itself if electr gravetics proves to be a real phenomenon it could reshape our models of cosmology astrophysics even the very nature of space and time okay now you&#x27;re really blowing my mind we&#x27;re not just talking about technological advancements we&#x27;re talking about fundamentally changing how we view our place in the cosmos that&#x27;s a pretty profound thought it is and it&#x27;s a testament to the power of human curiosity and our Relentless pursuit of knowledge ttwn and brown might not have had all the answers but he asked the right questions he dared to look beyond the accepted paradigms of his time and explore the fringes of scientific inquiry and in doing so he ignited a spark that continues to burn brightly today it&#x27;s incredible to think that one person&#x27;s unwavering belief in the power of possibility could potentially reshape our understanding of the universe but I have to ask with all this talk of potential breakthroughs and Paradigm shifts what&#x27;s the current state of electrogravitics research are there scientists actively pursuing Brown&#x27;s work today absolutely while it remains a controversial field there are dedicated researchers around the world who are picking up the torch that brown lit all those years ago they&#x27;re conducting new experiments developing new theories and pushing the boundaries of our understanding of gravity and its potential connection to electromagnetism that&#x27;s incredibly exciting it sounds like we&#x27;re still in the very early stages of unraveling this mystery but the journey itself is just as important as the destination what did you say without a doubt every experiment every Theory every dead end brings us one step closer to unlocking the secrets of gravitics and perhaps even the universe itself it&#x27;s a journey that requires an open mind a willingness to challenge assumptions and a healthy dose of skepticism well said it&#x27;s like that famous saying the only true wisdom is knowing you know nothing we have to approach these big questions with a sense of humility and wonder recognizing that even the most outlandish ideas could hold the key to unlocking incredible discoveries exactly and as we continue to explore the frontiers of science I have no doubt that we&#x27;ll encounter even more Mysteries more challenges and more seemingly impossible possibilities and that&#x27;s what makes this whole journey so exhilarating T towns and Brown story is a powerful reminder that the spirit of scientific inquiry is Alive and Well constantly pushing the boundaries of what we think we know about the world around us it&#x27;s a reminder that the universe is full of Wonders waiting to be discovered if only we have the courage to look for them well listeners there you have it a deep dive into the fascinating and controversial world of electrogravitics inspired by the groundbreaking gravity defying Legacy of tea towns and brown we&#x27;ve explored his pioneering work the mystery surrounding his discoveries and the potential for world changing breakthroughs that his research continues to inspire it&#x27;s a story that reminds us to never underestimate the power of human curiosity the importance of challenging conventional thinking and the boundless potential of scientific exploration so the next time you look up the Stars remember T towns and brown the man who dared to dream of Defying Gravity and and whose Legacy continues to propel us towards a future filled with a inspiring possibilities until next time keep exploring e e e e e e e e e e e e e</p>
