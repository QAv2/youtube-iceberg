            <p>this man he&#x27;s a Russian Mystic whatever you want to call him gurjeff and one thing he taught his students was to not vent your unpleasant emotions so he had this exercise called self-observation for you to go observe yourself in the most deepest way not just your thoughts but about your body and how your body and your mind interact in this insane continual blend there&#x27;s no separation so one kind of thought will affect your body but a feeling in your gut will affect your thinking and he said you will discover and observing yourself then most of your thoughts revolve around unpleasant emotions so most of it is dealing with frustration resentment anger bitterness and he said look at those emotions see them do not judge them do not say they&#x27;re bad or good or whatever and don&#x27;t ever talk about them don&#x27;t vent them to people you can look at them but don&#x27;t talk about them and these people who expect to go whoa I&#x27;m not talking about them they start to go away</p>
