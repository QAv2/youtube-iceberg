            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[Music] Well, good day and welcome to our latest Q&amp;A reality check where you guys get to ask me the hard questions. I&#x27;m your host, Ross Kulart, and here to join me again, Megan Order. Good day, Megan. How are you, &gt;&gt; Ross? I&#x27;m great. How&#x27;s How&#x27;s my head? &gt;&gt; Your head? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not used to not having the headphones.</p>
<p>Oh, I see. Yes. Did somebody buy you headphones? I noticed there was a friendly viewer who offered to buy you headphones because he was worried about the antiquated technology that you were using. &gt;&gt; You know, it was not a friendly viewer. It was NewsNation who sent me this mic.</p>
<p>But let this be a lesson to our viewers that if you comment enough, you might just be heard. So, you got new headphones from NewsNation because a viewer shamed NewsNation into buying you new headphones, which is an absolutely fabulous way to get new new budget items. I think we&#x27;ll do this in future. We&#x27;ll use the show to get new budget items. How&#x27;s that? &gt;&gt; I love the game plan.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, what have they got for me this week? &gt;&gt; All right, Ross, I&#x27;m going to jump in. We have a comment from our last Q&amp;A episode, and it has a ton of engagement. So, I just wanted to read this to you and kind of get your feedback from this. This is from summer 9911. If UAPs have been here for over 70 years disabling nukes, showing restraints, and never attacking, why are they still framed as a threat? If they meant harm, wouldn&#x27;t they have acted in the 1940s when we were defenseless? Instead, were firing hellfire missiles, allegedly using EMPs, and reverse engineering their tech, and still no retaliation.</p>
<p>Surely that tells its own story. I just don&#x27;t accept that they&#x27;re a threat. If they&#x27;ve been here that long, possibly even millennia, and haven&#x27;t taken our planet, then maybe they never intended to. Any intelligence advanced enough to reach us, disable our weapons, and still show restraint, is likely operating from a level of consciousness that isn&#x27;t driven by conquest or fear. Maybe it&#x27;s time we stop protecting our own paranoia and start asking better questions.</p>
<p>Well, that&#x27;s a really good question and and I do agree with the broad thrust of the question, which is that there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any kind of malevolent intent for the main from whatever these NHI are. Let&#x27;s assume for the moment that what we&#x27;re talking about is real, that there is a non-human intelligence engaging with this planet. I I don&#x27;t know if I can agree with the thrust of the the the question suggesting that it&#x27;s always been benevolent because there are very isolated moments in history such as the Brazilian calaris incidents where some kind of UAP did offensively engage and kill in some cases and defigure and try and wound people uh with some kind of beam of light in the Calaras region of Brazil. Um there&#x27;s also been the Chubba Chubbers which we&#x27;ve reported on previously with our friend Ronnie Veret um in Peru and Brazil. Funny how it&#x27;s all going on in Peru and Brazil.</p>
<p>Um I wonder what&#x27;s going on down there. Why do they have bad aliens? Anyway, the um the broad thrust of what you&#x27;re saying though I do agree with which is that they could have I mean their technology appears to be such it&#x27;s so advanced if they&#x27;d wanted to cause us harm they could easily have done so well before now and it really does beg the question why on earth if the incident involving the Hellfire missile in Yemen is a UAP if it is and I appreciate that&#x27;s still open to debate debate. Why on earth are we shooting at UAPs? And why have the people who are running the legacy retrieval and reverse engineering program as well as using psionics and the dog whistle to summon and invite UAP craft to appear? If that is genuinely what people are reportedly telling us is the case, why are we shooting at them with high pulse microwaves, which is what has been alleged to me by now multiple people? Why act offensively at all against a non-human intelligence? Wouldn&#x27;t it be a terrible tragedy if our first contact with a non-human intelligence involved us primitive apes acting offensively against a highly advanced technological intelligence? I agree. I I think your your viewer is right, Megan. They&#x27;ve got a legitimate question there.</p>
<p>And and I think ultimately the um the only way that this will ever be resolved is if and when those responsible Thorma program are basically dragged before Congress and questioned about why we are acting offensively using weaponry uh primitive weaponry against an alleged nonhuman intelligence. I&#x27;d love to hear their answer and I I hope and expect that that day is not too far off. &gt;&gt; Okay, we have an email from Kevin Ross. Love the show. Question, why are the NDAs signed by whistleblowers still valid when the program they work for that generated that NDA is operated with illegally gained funding without oversight which violates the Constitution? Why doesn&#x27;t that make the NDA null and void? Thanks.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work. Respectfully, Kevin, &gt;&gt; you are absolutely right, sir. It is the case that there are protections, whistleblower protections in the existing enacted uh national defense authorization act from I think 2023 uh that protect people who have signed NDAs inside government to uh not reveal information. So if they come forward to a congressional committee, there are protections in place. I&#x27;ve got a I always keep this note by under the whistleblower protections act in section 1673 of the James M.</p>
<p>Inhof National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2023. Whistleblowers are protected from liability for breaching non-disclosure agreements when they disclose information related to unidentified anomalous phenomena. This includes revelations of illegal or criminal conduct aimed at concealing UAP evidence provided the disclosure is made through authorized channels. Now the unfortunate problem with those existing laws is that the authorized channel of course is the all domain anomaly resolution office the complete joke institution that exists within the Pentagon within the department of defense now the department of war. war.</p>
<p>Um, and uh, basically we don&#x27;t trust Arrow to investigate their way out of a white wet paper bag. Frankly, I I do think it&#x27;s important that people understand the limits of the existing protections for people who are signitaries to NDAs. Disclosures to ARO or Congressional Intelligence and Defense Committees are authorized notwithstanding any non-disclosure agreement signed by the whistleblower. This explicitly shields against NDA enforcement for compliant reports and it protects against reprisal such as adverse personnel actions, security clearance revocation, legal action for breaching NDAs and there are civil remedies that can be pursued by whistleblowers in the courts if that&#x27;s breached but they must follow the disclosures in the secure system outlined in the law i.e. to Arrow in a controlled setting.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s the problem. The problem is at the moment it&#x27;s a dog&#x27;s breakfast because nobody really trusts Arrow. Despite the good intentions of Dr. John Kazinski and some of the people inside Arrow who I think are genuinely well motivated to get to the truth of these issues, there are people in the defense department, the Department of War, uh, who are basically hindering Arrow&#x27;s ability to do its job. So I&#x27; I&#x27;ve thought this is really important to settle this out.</p>
<p>Tim Burchett put new whistleblower amendments before the Congress uh in 2025 August 29th. And this bill would expand whistleblower safeguards specifically for disclosures related to the use of federal taxpayer funds to evaluate or research unidentified anomalous phenomena. and it would amend the existing laws. And what&#x27;s interesting about this is it&#x27;s trying to patch a loophole because if you&#x27;re a federal employee and you&#x27;ve signed an NDA and you&#x27;re working for government, then you&#x27;re protected if you follow the procedure and go through ARO. But if you&#x27;re a um contract employee, uh if you&#x27;re a contractor, then you&#x27;re probably not protected.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a gray area. So Tim&#x27;s proposed a modification of the regulations which would protect military personnel and contractors from reprisal when reporting UAP related funding misuse integrating them into the existing whistleblower channels. It would also give better powers to the FBI to shield disclosures about UAP funding. Uh would extend safeguards to civilian contractors involved in federal pro projects. This is a big issue.</p>
<p>A lot of the people who contact me are civilian contractors and when we look at the law, they&#x27;re not protected. So, we&#x27;ve got a situation at the moment where yes, if you&#x27;re a federal government employee and you come forward and you&#x27;ve signed an NDA and you know about illegality or criminality, you can come forward to Arrow and Arrow will completely ignore you, but at least you&#x27;ve done your job and come to Arrow with that information. Don&#x27;t just go to Arrow. Please go to the congressional committees. Go to the um Senate Select Committee for Intelligence.</p>
<p>Uh the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Equivalent Committees. Um, even the oversight committee is limited in whether or not it can review a lot of this stuff because incredibly we&#x27;ve still got this situation where even though it&#x27;s the oversight committee uh and the subcommittee under Anapina Luna which is doing a lot of the hard work to try and expose this stuff, they don&#x27;t have the security clearances that the intelligence and defense committees have to be able to probe into these waved unacknowledged special access programs that the people inside government are using to conceal the illegally and criminally concealed UAP retrieval and reverse engineering programs. So that&#x27;s why this Tim Burchchett whistleblower protection amendment is absolutely vital. I&#x27;m sorry for taking a long time to answer that question, Megan, but I really thought it was important to explain to people why there is a deficiency in the whistleblower protection laws and why the Tim Burchette amendment needs to be passed, particularly to protect civilian contractors. &gt;&gt; All good, Ross.</p>
<p>We appreciate you being nice and thorough. I will go to an email from David. Hi, Ross and Megan. I may be wrong, but Chris Bledsoe made a statement in an interview with Ross, I believe, at a UAP conference in Las Vegas, saying, &quot;The divine lady that speaks to him said in April 2026, Easter time, there will be a new human understanding, awareness, or technology that will usher in peace for a thousand years. I believe three Atlas closest point to the Earth is also around the same time.</p>
<p>Is this coincidental?&quot; &gt;&gt; Uh, okay. This is the three eye atlas object which is if some people are saying it correctly a comet. If you&#x27;re professor Avi Lo you think it&#x27;s potentially something anomalous. Okay let&#x27;s deal first with that question. Um my understanding is that three I atlas reaches perihelion i.e its closest point to Earth on the 19th of December of this year, not Easter next year, which is when Chris Bledo is talking about something dramatic happening.</p>
<p>So, that doesn&#x27;t figure for me. Let&#x27;s deal as sensitively as possible with um a lot of the claims about three Atlas. Firstly, um, yes, in December, its closest point will be 10067 million miles away, which is more than the average distance from the Earth to the Sun. So, it&#x27;s a hell of a long way away. And um uh let&#x27;s deal also with the claims that have been made mainly by professor Avi lobe who is driving God bless him a lot of other astronomers to distraction with his persistent assertions that there is something anomalous about three eye atlas.</p>
<p>The ball is very much in Professor Avi Loe&#x27;s court right now to prove his case that there is something anomalous about three eye atlas and that it&#x27;s just not it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not just another meteor or comet. I&#x27;ve consulted with astronomers. I&#x27;ve consulted with people who&#x27;ve contacted me in great frustration because they don&#x27;t understand why professor lobe is making such a huge song and dance on very very limited evidence that there is something anomalous about three eye atlas and I&#x27;ve been very willing to give professor lober a good go because I have huge respect for him he&#x27;s very very well respected in the field and I just have a hunch that just maybe he&#x27;s had a tip a private tip from somebody in NASA or some other space observatory telling him that there is something anomalous about three Atlas. But certainly the official position from a broad range of astronomers that I&#x27;ve engaged with is thus that there is no anomalous behavior or movement detected with three Atlas. The most recent scientific assessments, including orbital solutions from the Miner Planet Center in NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, indicate that three Atlas follows a trajectory fully consistent with gravitational dynamics for an interstellar comet.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s significant. Um, it&#x27;s like Umua Mua, which was another interstellar object. It&#x27;s ind it&#x27;s interesting and it&#x27;s exciting that we&#x27;re detecting objects from outside of our solar solar system that are coming through. Um it has a hyperbolic orbit that has an eccentricity of 6.14. A lot of people have made a lot of that, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a comet.</p>
<p>And um there&#x27;s no definitive non-gravitational acceleration that&#x27;s been measured despite the comet&#x27;s active outgassing. And they&#x27;re talking there about a CO2 carbon dioxide dominated coma and dust tail. And so while the object&#x27;s elliptic alignment has sparked speculation that it&#x27;s anomalous, there are 1 in 20,000 odds for such precision. It&#x27;s um a 5°ree retrograde to the plane. Experts dismissed this as coincidental, emphasizing the lack of evidence for artificial control.</p>
<p>Recent brightening, which has been used to suggest it might be anomalous and that there might be some kind of internal luminosity, is being explained as linked to normal ice sublimation outbursts, not unusual propulsion or trajectory shifts. So, I&#x27;m not saying A&#x27;s wrong, but the ball&#x27;s very much in dear Avi Loe&#x27;s court to prove anomalousness. In summary, the consensus from a wide range of sources is that three Atlas is a typical active interstellar comet with no confirmed deviations from natural behavior. the chemical oddities that have been made a lot of high CO2, high water ratio, nitrogen without iron, they do suggest a unique formation history, I&#x27;m told, but they do not impact its movement. And the good thing is we may be able to get further data from its Mars flyby on the 3rd of October.</p>
<p>And then hopefully we can get a solution and a resolution to this. Because if there are greeneyed aliens from the planet Zug sneaking up to us on an interstellar object by stealth and hiding themselves behind the sun to launch an interim attack on planet Earth. Hopefully we&#x27;ll know by October. Um I do think though seriously I mean if as we all know from being regular watchers and listeners to reality check we do know that whoever or whatever these NHI are they have highly advanced technology that does appear to be able to move across the universe almost instantaneously. Why would they sit on an interstellar object at such low speeds? I I&#x27;m just not buying at the moment that there is sufficient or indeed any evidence to suggest that there is anything anomalous about 3i Atlas.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s a distraction from the main game and that there is more than enough evidence right now with other issues of anomalousness to essentially warrant investigation elsewhere. But Professor Avi, the ball is in your court, sir. Happy to hear your proof. &gt;&gt; All right. Awesome.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go to an email from Christina. Hi Ross, thank you so much for the work you are doing and holding these Q&amp;As&#x27;s. In light of Beatatric&#x27;s research, do you think we can assume that when we see what look like satellites in the sky that it&#x27;s possible some could be these anomalous artificial reflectors, NHI tech, captured on those 1950s plates in our current skies? Would it be possible to see them visually now? &gt;&gt; It would be possible. Um, yeah. I mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the issue.</p>
<p>I mean the the I did ask Beatatric this would it be possible to for us to figure out whether the objects are still there. Uh obviously what Beatatrice has shown is that in the pre 1957 prefirst human satellite pre-sputnik uh events there were objects in geostationary orbit which appear to demonstrate highly specular highly reflective surfaces. um and she&#x27;s been able to in in some way prove quite convincingly that these objects were there uh in the period in the 1950s when there were an awful lot of UFO sightings. In fact, there are some very interesting connections between the observation of those in some cases thousands of objects in geostationary orbit and incidents like the Washington DC July 1952 flyover. I did ask Beatatrice whether it would be possible to find those objects that were seen on the glass plates.</p>
<p>So the the way just to explain to people the way Beatatrice figured out that there was possibly anomalous artificial objects in geostationary orbit before the first human satellite was by looking at old glass plate photographic slides and showing that objects disappeared um from one plate to another in that pre957 period. and um she was able to confirm that the um uh reflectivity disappeared when they were in the shadow. So it does appear that certainly we can say in the 1950s before humans first sent objects into space there were artificial specular objects in geostationary orbit. Unfortunately, the um complexity of looking for objects in the current situation where we have thousands of objects, hundreds of thousands of objects in space and moreover an enormous amount of space junk, it&#x27;s no longer possible to actually specifically single out whether any of those objects are those anomalous objects that Beatatrice was talking about from the 1950s. I suspect though that the United States with its extraordinary space-based cameras and observatories could detect these objects.</p>
<p>And I strongly suspect, I&#x27;ve had indications as such from sources recently, that the United States knows full well what it is in geostationary orbit. And I&#x27;m intrigued as to the possibility as to whether there is a connection between, for example, some of the UAPs that we&#x27;re seeing on this planet um that appear to be coming down from orbit periodically uh maybe monitoring nuclear sites and then heading back up again. Is there, as my friend Patrick Jackson has speculated, some kind of global planetary defense mechanism or observation system? Did somebody or something install some kind of artificial planetary monitoring system with a large number? I think Beatric talked about hundreds of thousands of objects in geostationary orbit. Let&#x27;s just make it on the record that at the moment nobody has provided any convincing rebuttal to uh Beatric&#x27;s quite stunning paper and also note it really hasn&#x27;t had much coverage anywhere in mainstream media and it&#x27;s why I get peeved that so much attention is being given to the I think the highly flimsy evidence of anything anomalous involving three eye atlas when Dr. Vill Dr.</p>
<p>Beatric Filerol has in fact found something quite extraordinary in geostationary orbit. Her paper is going through peer review right now. I sincerely hope it passes peer review and that we get an answer as to whether or not the objects that she&#x27;s talking about were and indeed are anomalous. &gt;&gt; Great. We will go to a question from Dave on X.</p>
<p>He reached out to us saying, &quot;Hello, Megan. Can you ask Ross if he has heard about the ascension of Earth and humanity that is rumored to be going on increase in galactic energies raising our frequency? If he hasn&#x27;t, he should look into it. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Look, I sure as heck get a lot of emails tell me telling me that the age of Aquarius is imminent. Um, and what I find amusing, I&#x27;ve actually started keeping a little book on all of the dates that people tell me that this incredible age of ascension, this incredible moment is going to occur.</p>
<p>And please forgive me if I&#x27;m having a little bit of fun because there are so many different dates. Um, yes, a lot of people contact me claiming to be in touch with information, downloads from non-human beings, um, evidence based on astrology or astronomy. Uh, they&#x27;re all making a variety of assertions that there is some age imminent. I I don&#x27;t see any convincing evidence right now. Um, yes, I know there&#x27;s speculation from people within the defense and intelligence establishment that there is certainly something possibly catastrophic imminent, but again, that&#x27;s rubbery as well.</p>
<p>I just want hard evidence and um uh a lot of the people that have engaged with me when they do email me and I I just like to ask questions back and say, you know, why do you believe what you believe? And some people get really annoyed with me because they say, look, you just have to believe me. I&#x27;ve been told this by a um by an alien, you know, from a spacecraft located off the back of Jupiter. And I I&#x27;m sorry. You just not a lot of evidence that that proves anything for me in that. So, I think what we need is good, solid, hard evidence.</p>
<p>Yes. A lot of people swamp me with information claiming to know about an age of ascension, a tipping point for a humanity, an age of Aquarius. And I do find it intriguing and potentially exciting. Goodness only knows, wouldn&#x27;t it be wonderful for humanity right now in this first part of the 21st century if we could forget our differences as members of different nation states and start thinking of ourselves as humans? Wouldn&#x27;t it be wonderful if the problems of the world would could be resolved if governments acknowledged the existence of a non-human intelligence? The chance to dream. All right, we will go to our next question.</p>
<p>We have Dan, the Craigslist handyman, reaching out to us on X as well. Would you please ask him how his religious views and spirit spirituality changed since he began reporting on the UFO phenomenon? &gt;&gt; Not just the UFO phenomenon. I&#x27;m talking also here about the impact that shows like the telepathy tapes have had on me. And I&#x27;ve recently spoken personally to people in Australia who have non-verbal autistic children who&#x27;ve told me that their kids they believe are engaging on some kind of non-local consciousness platform with other kids from around the world. And I apologize when I say kids I mean young people.</p>
<p>Some of them are adults. And it&#x27;s exciting because it does tend to suggest that there is some capacity in the human mind and it&#x27;s intriguing that it&#x27;s become activated in non-verbal autistic people particularly that allows them to communicate non-locally and then that raises the whole possibility is the human mind capable of something that goes beyond our meat bodies. I mean there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a perennial argument in human philosophy. Are our bodies just meat computers? Is free will a myth? You know, is the whole notion that that we have a consciousness, a complete falsity that essentially all we are is a fault of nature caused by human evolution or are we something more than that? And I guess that&#x27;s one of the reasons why I find this whole subject matter so intriguing. And I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been sucked down this rabbit hole because I really did set out around about 8 n years ago to write a book debunking this UFO nonsense.</p>
<p>And the more I get into it, the more I do find I get more spiritual, the more I find myself, somebody who frankly rejected conventional religion. I went to a private boy&#x27;s boarding school for many, many years from when I was nine years old. And I was stooped in religious classes and told I had to go to church every day and do my prayers every night. And nothing makes you more irreligious than for a young rebel like me, forced religion. But what I do find fascinating about the whole UAP UFO subject and the associate is associated issues that we&#x27;re looking at paranormal issues like the telepathy tapes where you&#x27;ve got these extraordinary reported findings of telepathy and non-local consciousness and these kids are talking about angels and and some of the stuff that I find fascinating is they&#x27;re talking about engaging with people who have died.</p>
<p>It really does make you think. And yes, I I am getting more spiritually aware. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m at that stage where I&#x27;m I&#x27;m looking at it and I I think we&#x27;re all on a shared journey here. One of the exciting things about this show for me is I I try and be as honest with you as possible about where I am on this issue. I&#x27;ve gone from being a complete skeptic about anything UFO to acknowledging that yeah, in a lot of my conversations with people and witnesses, I&#x27;m increasingly thinking to myself, there really must be something to the idea of a non-local consciousness.</p>
<p>And if you accept the possibility of a human soul that we have something that transcends our physical bodies, then maybe we should start taking seriously some of the ideas in established religions. It does make you think. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So Russ, one of our associate producers, Rebecca, who helps us on this show, she was actually in Paris over the weekend and you had some fans at this wedding that she was attending. Um, so they got to talking and they wrote some questions into her wanting you to answer.</p>
<p>So this is coming from John from Switzerland. Um, he says he sat next to you at First Soul Foundation Symposium in Italy. Um, he would like to ask you if you think the Skywatcher dog whistle is sound or radio or some other frequency. &gt;&gt; Ah, that&#x27;s a very interesting one. Look, I don&#x27;t know for sure.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a radio frequency. Uh, and I have a suspicion it involves at least part of it involves something in the 1.6 GHz range. Um, uh, interestingly, funny you should actually mention that. Uh, because I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m talking to people who&#x27;ve approached me and told me that they think they know how to make a dog whistle. And um the dog whistle for people who don&#x27;t know is a device which is reportedly being used by the Skywatcher team or has been being used by the Skywatcher team.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s technology that I think is controlled by my friend James Fowler who was doing a lot of the technical work for Skyatcher. And my understanding is, and it&#x27;s not from James, that there is a technology that allows them to transmit a signal which can attract or lure or interest the phenomenon. And the tragedy is that my understanding is from multiple sources, this has been used by the US military in collusion with private aerospace contractors to lure nonhuman intelligence craft and to then shoot them down with high pulse microwaves. I am assured that this has been happening for quite a long time, for many years. What a tragedy.</p>
<p>Um uh so yeah, I think I&#x27;ve answered your question. I think the dog whistle is an RF frequency. &gt;&gt; Okay, Ross, that was the last one for today. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow.</p>
<p>We done half an hour already. Oh, well, thank you so much, Megan.
