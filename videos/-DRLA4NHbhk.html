            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>know more from other talking to other people? Had you heard whispers? Like what did you know? &gt;&gt; What I knew was not much. I mean I heard whispers. Uh but I didn&#x27;t get, you know, really involved in in thinking about it. I mean, you know, a good physicist realizes this is tinfoil hat conspiracy stuff, you know. &gt;&gt; But you had already had experience with remote viewing seem already got that problem.</p>
<p>So uh but when they came up with the idea we should do another deeper dive into this and by that time I was uh you know I mean as a physicist I mean through the years I mean I was a Star Trek fan and you know Star Trek fan and all that kind of stuff and uh as a physicist uh I would hear about these UFO sightings and so on. So, I always wondered about, you know, how how how can this uh you know, could somebody really have any kind of propulsion that that would look like that? And so anyway, uh so when this program got set up, it turned out my particular assignment was okay, let&#x27;s look at all the physics and engineering that might be behind this stuff. And by the way, we will arrange for you to get access to some materials. Uh okay, fine. So that that was my tasking.</p>
<p>And so I said, &quot;Okay.&quot; So I can&#x27;t get into a lot of detail, but I did uh do a lot of uh back and forth with some aerospace executives about getting access in case they had any materials and that kind of stuff. And it&#x27;s very So they finally said, &quot;No, it&#x27;s uh if that were the case, it&#x27;d be too compartmentalized. We we we can&#x27;t share this even though you have an official program. I mean, you got Top Secret, SCI, Gamma, HCI, it&#x27;s got all these clearances, but if we had materials, it&#x27;d be too highly classified. We we couldn&#x27;t share them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Geez. &gt;&gt; So, a lot of negotiation went on a lot of time with the vice president &gt;&gt; unless there&#x27;s something to negotiate about. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; If there was nothing to negotiate about, you&#x27;d say, &quot;How? We don&#x27;t have materials. You wouldn&#x27;t say you don&#x27;t have enough clearance for us to even discuss this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. And so &gt;&gt; already they&#x27;re tipping their hat. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re already tipping their hat. So anyway, the second uh place to go then was okay. They&#x27;re not going to share their materials.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m almost assuredly have them. Um suppose they had shared them. What would we have done? Well, we would have gone to subject matter experts all around the world. We&#x27;d give them some materials. We&#x27;d say, you know, this came from a Russian sub or, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>Give us your best output and so on. So I said, &quot;Okay, since we&#x27;re not able to get materials and share them, um, let me go to all of the subject matter experts that we would have gone to and say, we&#x27;re doing a survey for Bigalow Aerospace. He wants to know where were your field be in the year 2050.&quot; So, we figured, okay, we&#x27;d get the best sort of assessment of possible futures for their fields. And and uh I realize you probably don&#x27;t uh have immediate access to this, but just to give you an idea some of the papers that we got by going out to these people. I mean, and you&#x27;ll see how serious we were.</p>
<p>A neutronic fusion propulsion, superconductors and gravity research, posetron aerospace propulsion, warp drive, dark energy, extra dimensions, advanced nuclear propulsion. &gt;&gt; Jamie&#x27;s got it up here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so this is just the first few of 38 papers that I uh arranged for leaders to to come up with. So this is based on projections from where technology currently sits to if you extrapolate where it&#x27;s going to be in 2050 based on what they&#x27;re working on, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Spacetime metric engineering, traversible wormholes, stargates.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So you see, we weren&#x27;t uh kidding around. &gt;&gt; Well, when you started getting the warp drive, dark energy, extra dimensions, &gt;&gt; brain machine interfaces. Now, did you ask any of these? So presumably, this is just me from a civilian&#x27;s perspective. Presumably, you have some sort of a crash thing, you have to bring in people who make spaceships. &gt;&gt; You have to bring in people who make military jets, advanced propulsion systems.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s those are the people that would be able to &gt;&gt; the people we had uh working on those papers were people from those communities. How did they ch this is the the conundrum that if they did disclose and the companies that weren&#x27;t given access to these materials did fall apart and that the companies that got access to these materials advanced and had spectacular businesses. How do they decide who it just assuming you would have something? How would you decide? Was it based on relationships like knowing that someone could keep a secret? like cuz you&#x27;re dealing with outside the government now presumably if you if you have a defense contractor they&#x27;re that&#x27;s an independent company not necessarily even though they work handinand glove with the the government they&#x27;re not necessarily a part of the government. So &gt;&gt; so in fact if you put your thinking cap on you would say okay this would be the way if you want to keep it out of the public &gt;&gt; because you don&#x27;t have to disclose it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you don&#x27;t have to give it to a contractor, say, &quot;Okay, this is this is your stuff and uh from now on you own it.&quot; &gt;&gt; But how do you control that, though? You you&#x27;d have to have government agents embedded deeply in that, which I assume they do anyway. But you&#x27;d have to have intelligence agents deep I hope they do deeply embedded in these defense contractors where they would make sure that they maintain some sort of intense level of secrecy. That&#x27;s exactly right. And uh when you think about okay uh these days well suppose we have some kind of disclosure uh what are these companies going to do? They&#x27;ve been hiding things or various parts of the government been hiding things um &gt;&gt; misappropriating funds lying to Congress &gt;&gt; lying to Congress. So it&#x27;s you can see why it&#x27;s such a big problem at this point.</p>
<p>Well, that was that um disclosure documentary that uh I saw you in as well that appeared at uh South by Southwest, which was excellent. What is it called? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s called uh The Age of Disclosure. &gt;&gt; Amazing documentary. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s amazing documentary. &gt;&gt; Really hope that gets released somewhere big like Netflix or something like that.</p>
<p>So people &gt;&gt; Well, I think uh I think Dan Farah, who&#x27;s the uh director and producer of that, by the way, a very well-known producer, you know, he he collaborated with Steven Spielberg on Ready Player One, which is the big hit, and so on. And the approach he used which is really very clever uh he contacted people like me people uh like Lou Alzando on and on and on and uh said you know many of you don&#x27;t want to come out really and reveal too much podcast by podcast by podcast. So tell you what my goal he says I&#x27;m going to approach 38 of the maximum insiders and by maximum insiders I mean it includes people like you know Senator Rubio of course now secretary of state um Clapper who&#x27;s you know and I&#x27;m going to get all of you to collaborate on saying what your involvement was to agree you can and you know, not say something and they ended up going to jail. And uh and then we&#x27;ll put out maximum disclosure evidence all at one time in this film and it&#x27;ll include uh people coming forward like Jay Stratton who is head of the UAP task force. Uh he&#x27;s been involved in this field for 16 years.</p>
<p>By the way, he has a book about to come out also, which will really be a disclosure. So, anyways, we&#x27;ll put this together. We won&#x27;t talk about it along the way. And so, 38 of us ended up being interviewed for the film. Um, telling whatever role we felt we could tell.</p>
<p>So, in fact, when that film comes out, that that&#x27;s going to be disclosure on steroids. I think &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s going to be the maximum. And well, you saw the film, so you know, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty &gt;&gt; pretty revealing. It&#x27;s &gt;&gt; very well done. &gt;&gt; Yeah, very well done.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, for your own personal journey into this stuff, you&#x27;re initially introduced to it because they&#x27;re talking about disclosure. You rate the pros and cons and then when do you get introduced to it again? Well, it was when basically when Robert Bigalow uh got the contract that uh Harry Reid and the other senators uh asked. &gt;&gt; And how many how much time has passed? &gt;&gt; Well, that was in 2008. So, a couple &gt;&gt; and so that went up through 2012 and then ATIP, which you may have heard of that Lisando ran sort of picked up there to keep the ball rolling forward &gt;&gt; and now it&#x27;s been revealed by the way uh only only recently that when the funding dried up, it dried up for the reasons you might think of and that is it was so highly declassified that when congressional statements came down that okay we need so much money for this it didn&#x27;t actually describe it would just advance propulsion and all that kind of stuff. So another group picked up the money and said, &quot;Oh, well that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re working on propulsion things.&quot; So you know, but it wasn&#x27;t the real deal.</p>
<p>And so you know, what do you do at that point? Do you go, &quot;No, wait a minute. This was really for this.&quot; Well, no. Then you&#x27;d be re revealing what this was really for. So So anyway, that sort of uh ended that way. But anyway, so based on that, we then as a group went to as a turns out the Department of Homeland Security to set up a whole new program and uh it was going to be a special access program.</p>
<p>It was under a name which can now be revealed because arrow the advanced aerospace or let&#x27;s see advanced anomalies aerospace resolution office has revealed it. It was called Kona blue and uh we built up a stack of documents that would go to the ceiling here about what needed to be done, what we were going to do, how it should be done, who should be involved. Uh &gt;&gt; so at this point you&#x27;re convinced that this is a real phenomenon. &gt;&gt; At this point I&#x27;m convinced that there&#x27;s a real phenomena. I mean you know how far can I go? I mean I can I can say I interacted with for example Dave Grush that you&#x27;ve had on your program before who is really a highlevel intelligence officer.</p>
<p>People in the public can hardly have any idea how high a level intelligence officer he was. He prepared briefings for the president. He was uh top UAP investigator for NRO, the National Reconnaissance Office, and then transferred over to NGA, the National Geospatial Intelligence Office, and so on. And so in that role, he was asked, he was an official part of the UAP task force, asked by Jay Stratton to find out what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes at these superclassified levels. And he did.</p>
<p>And uh so that&#x27;s why you know he eventually came out in that uh August 2023 &gt;&gt; congressional hearing under oath saying, &quot;Yep, I&#x27;ve talked to more than 40 people who are directly involved in the program.&quot; Well, I know Dave. I know many of the people. I know many of the programs that uh he&#x27;s involved in. And so there really is something to it. And uh it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it comes out.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think I don&#x27;t think you can put the toothpaste back into the tube. Frankly, &gt;&gt; well, it seems like people don&#x27;t want to. Uh, and I think there&#x27;s so many more people that are openly discussing the possibility or what this is, maybe not even the possibility of it, but but addressing that there&#x27;s something going on. So, what is it? Is it interdimensional? Is it intergalactic? Like, what is it? That&#x27;s that&#x27;s just such an excellent question because the problem is there&#x27;s an embarrassment of riches these craft you know which in the old days you know farmer in the fields that someone was streaking across the sky and you know I don&#x27;t know what to think you know you could sort of blow it off but because our own detection equipment has really marched up into unbelievable sophistication. Uh and so now we have these really advanced sensor systems.</p>
<p>Fleer forward-looking infrared radar, high quality radars, satellites. Ratcliffe has advent has has admitted that satellites have picked up uh evidence of these of these craft and these craft have interfered with uh military exercises as we all know from uh say the Nimmits and the Gimble and the Go Fast videos that you know made it out into the public in in 2017. Um, so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really out there now at this point that there that there&#x27;s that there&#x27;s a reality here. And so, uh, that&#x27;s where we are at this point. &gt;&gt; One of the more spectacular ones you um talked about the Nimtts, the the Commander David Fraver experience.</p>
<p>So they&#x27;re flying over the water out outside of San Diego &gt;&gt; outside San Die &gt;&gt; and they think they see something below the surface &gt;&gt; and which is large and then this 20 foot tic tac looking thing that&#x27;s hovering over the water that seems to turn towards them and recognize that they&#x27;re uh it jams their radar. It does something to block their ability to detect it. They have it on screen. They have video of this thing. There&#x27;s eyewitnesses of this thing.</p>
<p>They track it on radar going from above 50,000 feet down to sea level in a second. &gt;&gt; They they don&#x27;t know what it is. &gt;&gt; It takes off at an insane rate of speed. It goes to the cat point where they were supposed to meet up. So they have all this data about this thing that behaves in a way that&#x27;s impossible with our current understanding of propulsion systems.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right? And of course in the program we interviewed uh the pilots about their experiences and so on and and so you can&#x27;t blame a pilot. He says look this thing was at you know 80,000 ft or whatever when he first detected it. Suddenly it&#x27;s down there right above the water and then it takes off and does a right angle turn at Mach 3. Uh you know this stuff is just way beyond our physics. Of course to a physics nerd like me.</p>
<p>Yeah. Now wait a minute. If it&#x27;s real it&#x27;s physics. Right. &gt;&gt; Can&#x27;t can&#x27;t be beyond &gt;&gt; beyond our understanding, &gt;&gt; but it&#x27;s beyond our engineering.</p>
<p>So, in fact, in that series of uh papers I showed you that the 30 38 papers, by the way, um there&#x27;s a little side story there which is interesting. And those 38 papers were then posted. None none of these people who generated those papers had any idea it had to do with ETSs or UFOs or whatever. Uh they all went up on what&#x27;s called the Jwick server. It&#x27;s classified server for the Pentagon and uh intelligence officers and aerospace contractors uh you know could get access but nobody in the public could and usually those things go up and they&#x27;re up for you know a little while and a month or so and they take them down.</p>
<p>This was such a popular set, this 38 papers, such popular set that everybody screamed every time they tried to take it down. And so it was posted there, you know, like forever. Uh but eventually uh through Freedom of Information Act and so on, most of those papers have have have uh been released and I I was concerned that oh my god, these guys are all going to call me up and say, &quot;What? You didn&#x27;t tell me this had anything to do with ETSs or UFOs or but actually no. But nobody seemed to uh yeah not not complain about it. So back to the question that you mentioned a little earlier though about you know what&#x27;s the source of this? Like I said it&#x27;s an embarrassment of riches.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s so much observation. Uh you know the idea that it may be a scout coming by from some other planet and checking us out and heading off uh or whatever. I mean there&#x27;s much more than that. And of course, as you know from interviewing Jacqu Valet, he dug into the literature and found out, you know, you can go back millennia and see descriptions of exactly what we&#x27;re &gt;&gt; talking about today. So as as far as where they come from, what they&#x27;re doing here, I myself have written a paper called ultraterrestrials where I try to cover the gamut and I cover everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, they could be spacecraft from some other galaxy whipping through here. Uh, or maybe there&#x27;s some Atlanteans left over from eons ago and they&#x27;re just kind of hiding out in the seabed or on some mountain range someplace. Or maybe some ET group uh showed up here thousand 2,000 3,000 years ago and they&#x27;re hiding out with some bases locally and so on. Uh and of course we have a fellow by the name of a professor by the name of Masters who who thinks that well maybe it&#x27;s uh time travelers from the future coming back. And then there&#x27;s the whole idea since physicists like to talk about in additional dimensions you know maybe they come from another.</p>
<p>So anyway then in my ultraterrestrials paper I list every one I can think of and say you know we should be exploring all of these. So, at this point, I would say we know it&#x27;s NHI, non-human intelligence, but it&#x27;s not clear what the source is. Maybe at a higher level of uh classification than I had access to, maybe it&#x27;s it&#x27;s known, but right now I I&#x27;d say we we we don&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; Do you have a suspicion? I guess my suspicion</p>
