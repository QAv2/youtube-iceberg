            <p>the iconic lifter utilizes ionic wind propulsion there are no moving parts and it utilizes high voltage early lifters were heavy and required outside ground power supplies however through Decades of research ethon cross has built the first controllable ionic craft with onboard power supply this was initially thought to be impossible yet the machine can still fly for several minutes with updated components such as a flight computer and Telemetry system The Invention highlights the importance of never giving up on a build along with showcasing that there are some very unconventional propulsion systems out there which we may not even know about</p>
