            <p>What if the mysteries of UFO propulsion could have been explained nearly a century ago? [Music] In the 1920s, Thomas Townsend Brown noticed something strange. When he charged a capacitor to high voltages, it didn&#x27;t just hum with electricity, it moved. He called it the Biffeld Brown effect. Brown believed he had uncovered a force that linked electricity and gravity itself. By the 1950s, the US military was taking notice.</p>
<p>Declassified documents show intense interest in electrogravitics, a technology promising aircraft that could hover silently, accelerate instantly, and move in ways that seemed impossible. But just as quickly as it appeared, it vanished. Public reports of electrogravitics stopped. Many believe the research was buried inside black projects. Brown&#x27;s effect was explained away as ion wind, a faint push of air.</p>
<p>Yet, the idea of linking electricity and gravity never completely disappeared because ion wind alone can&#x27;t explain the kinds of extraordinary maneuvers seen in modern UFO reports. So, was Brown just chasing sparks of static, or did he glimpse a breakthrough in physics too powerful or too disruptive to reveal? Thomas Townsend Brown may not be a household name, but if his discoveries were real, they may hold the key to understanding UFO propulsion. We were never alone.</p>
