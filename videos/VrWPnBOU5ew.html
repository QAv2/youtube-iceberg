            <p>oh there he is himself Larry Davenport hey do you want to give me a brief overview on this device yes I will looks like a pretty traditional Titi Brown uh what are these these are my cylinderical ones that I made that I ran them for several years I actually like them better yeah better than these I think what I do is I I used sprayed copper in here copper paint which makes it slightly conductive then I put these on the front like this it&#x27;s a and uh you have a dialectric in the front and then you can these are adjustable you can adjust them in and out for different voltages these I used to run at a oh I used to run on a high voltage system but uh then I would adjust the antenna or car or qid electrode on the front there and Bui would just worked a lot better I think they worked very well you get go faster than that one I had have yeah I&#x27;ve had uh in the past I used to run two the these two Transformers back here you have one hand in your pocket you use the other hand above your waist that&#x27;s good okay most if you gesture with both hands you look too wild I see I had fast 72 RP a minute which is pretty fast for these when you consider what fire Factory is very efficient when I nod the camera Bobs up and down what else would you like to know you want me explain it you know what your output is on that we kind of output is I&#x27;m going to guess about 100 to 145,000 V so 145,000 got about a 4 in AR Sparks between those if you don&#x27;t have that&#x27;s why I went with this high voltage Le I like your I really like your G system I like that that&#x27;s a good way to do it this is a very Port here I made it so I could to these conferences need something you can take apart put together real fast and set up real fast and this worked very well I have run the system in the past with a much uh lower voltage system about 38,000 so to R 38,000 that&#x27;s about where it was that grv from information unlimited device I think that&#x27;s the one you have know it well and it it works very well for prior to this</p>
