            <p>another phenomena you might have heard is called Quantum tunneling so imagine I&#x27;m throwing one of these bouncy balls against a window throw bounce catch throw bounce catch throw it&#x27;s gone completely through the window it&#x27;s not smashed it it&#x27;s not interacted with it at all it&#x27;s just suddenly on the other side of the window and you can see it flying away if we saw that we think it was crazy right but this goes on at the subtopic realm all the time in fact it&#x27;s the only reason we exist you might know that in the Sunan the way it generates energy is through nuclear fusion and nuclear fusion when it is when two hydrogen atoms come together and the protons in their nucleus bounce off each other now if it wasn&#x27;t for Quantum tunneling they bounce off each other and nothing would happen what actually happens is they Quantum tunnel into each other and that&#x27;s what lets them fuse and release the sunlight and without sunlight we wouldn&#x27;t exist so we can thank Quantum tunneling for our existence</p>
