            <p>The zero point energy is electromagnetic in nature. You can even listen to Leonard Suskin, famous astrophysicist, say that we know that even if you take out all the heat and all the light from a region of space, we still have this zero point energy, the lowest ground state. But there&#x27;s still something there. This electromagnetism is there, but there&#x27;s no mass. They say that at least there&#x27;s no mass, but maybe it&#x27;s just made up of these nutrinos or relic nutrinos or what have you.</p>
<p>But what does this mean then? You know, if we think about what are these some of the scientific discoveries have come out that could be implications. The first one I think about is that EM drive, the impossible drive that they talked about a few years back. It was like 10 years ago or so where they were testing this basically just a cone. It was a cone and the idea was that it would produce asymmetric thrust. Uh and the way that&#x27;s possible is because we&#x27;re in a medium.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re in a medium, this is now just the same concept as like how a submarine works. Submarine is just displacing the water around it. So it&#x27;s basically swimming through the medium of the water. This would be the same thing that the EM drive was doing. So this is where I want to ask Dr.</p>
<p>U here cuz NASA is the ones that actually tested the EM drive. You&#x27;re talking about EOL. Do you guys know who tested the EM drive by chance? Well, go ahead and tell them, Dr. We called Sunny Sunny White. Harold Sunny White.</p>
<p>Harold Sunny White was just on Joe Rogan like three or four weeks ago and he was having Joe Rogan hold a free energy microchip. A free. Yeah. He goes, &quot;Here&#x27;s the prototypes.&quot; He goes, &quot;Hold on to this.&quot; is he&#x27;s like, &quot;If we make an array of this on our wafer, these microchips, it can produce, I think he said like 3 watts or something like that, but enough where you could put it in your phone and your phone would never run out of battery ever Again.</p>
