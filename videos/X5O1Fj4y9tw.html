            <p>did this man discover the technology used by UFOs Thomas Townsend Brown was an American physicist who is best known for his controversial research in electrogravidics a theoretical propulsion system that purported to use high voltage electric charges to create a gravitational field Brown&#x27;s work in this area was considered fringe science by many mainstream scientists but it attracted the attention of the U.S military during the Cold War Brown&#x27;s early work focused on the relationship between electrical fields and gravity the 1920s he conducted experiments with high voltage capacitors that seemed to indicate that a strong electric field could influence the behavior of gravity Brown postulated that if he could create a strong enough electrical charge he could create a gravitational field that could be used for propulsion in the 1950s Brown began working on a series of experimental devices that he claimed demonstrated the principles of electrogravidics these devices which he called gravitators used high voltage charges to create an electrostatic field that supposedly caused a gravitational effect Brown claimed that his devices could generate enough thrust to lift themselves off the ground and that they could be scaled up to create spacecraft that could travel at extremely high speeds many mainstream scientists dismissed Brown&#x27;s claims as pseudoscience and pointed out that his experimental results were difficult to reproduce however the U.S Air Force and navy both funded Research into electrogravidics and brown worked on several classified projects for the military patented several devices related to the technology and he continued to argue that his work had important implications for space travel and energy production today Brown&#x27;s work remains controversial but it continues to attract the interest of Fringe scientists and enthusiasts who are fascinated by the possibility of harnessing gravity for propulsion</p>
