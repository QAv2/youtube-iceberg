            <p>What if I told you there was a person who claimed he could give the world free unlimited energy but he was silenced? Nicola Tesla, one of the greatest inventors in the history who created groundbreaking technologies. But one of his famous project was warden cliff tower. Tesla believed it could wirelessly transmit unlimited energy across the globe for free. But powerful businessmen like JP Morgan saw no profit in it and soon Tesla&#x27;s funding was cut and his invention was abandoned. Now the question is, was this really a failed project or did big corporations bury a discovery that could have changed the world forever?</p>
