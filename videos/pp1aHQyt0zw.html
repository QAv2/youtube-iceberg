            <p>You take four magnets and stack them on a simple wooden board that doesn&#x27;t conduct electricity. On each side, you place two bigger magnets and at both ends you attach cylinders wrapped in copper. Then you connect a wire to grab the energy being generated. Just one small action and suddenly the whole thing comes to life running on its own, powered purely by magnetism. You can even hook it up to a circuit and power almost anything, a fan, a light bulb, or even your phone.</p>
<p>Free energy right at your fingertips.</p>
