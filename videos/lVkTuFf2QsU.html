            <p>[Music] um okay well Dr Eric Davis from Earth Tech right and that&#x27;s uh for Advan studies at Austin oh okay okay which is you know you you could say both or one well can you tell me a little bit about what you&#x27;re presenting about this year well uh actually I&#x27;m presenting three papers and two papers as a first author and one paper as a co-author um the first of my two papers as first author one of them is I&#x27;m reviewing um experimental concepts for studying ways to extract energy from the quantum vacuum and it&#x27;s basically a summary of some experimental Concepts uh that we&#x27;ve been exploring and we&#x27;re going to be doing in the laboratory to see if you can extract energy from the Zer Point fluctuations uh we&#x27;ll also put a little background history on the Zer Point fluctuations what it is physically it&#x27;s numerical magnitudes and consequences if we can uh extract such energy for applications in commercial space flight uh commercial Power Systems and so forth um the other paper I&#x27;m offering is on uh a review of laboratory concepts for extracting negative energy for generating negative energy in the laboratory that would be used for generating FTL space times and uh like traversible wormholes or alub beir warp drive or kicon tube warp drives or whatever the idea is to look at uh the definition of negative energy so that people who are not specialist in general relativity can understand what it really means the term is misapplied and misused so much that uh everybody gets confused and don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about usually so I&#x27;m going to clear that up by describing uh what negative energy is give its physical definition uh and then examine the background of the kinds of uh effects in quantum theory where negative energy can be as known to be generated and then uh I&#x27;m look at some uh selected Concepts that have been developed that could hopefully uh produce negative energy in the laboratory by the way of advanced Quantum Optics techniques the other paper is a paper joint with uh Harold white from NASA Johnson Space Center he&#x27;s doing this as a private citizen and not as a NASA employee as part of his graduate uh thesis work for his PhD in general relativity uh it&#x27;s on examining alub warp drive in higher dimensional space times using dbrain Theory and we show that in bra Theory you can actually eliminate the negative energy requirement and replace it with the positive energy and a negative pressure well this is a really a real breakthrough paper right this this is the at least from what I&#x27;ve seen this is the first time we&#x27;ve ever seen an applied physics approach to Stringer brain therapy right so that I mean that&#x27;s a real Hallmark achievement right and the idea is we believe that the alub metric or any kind of warp metric really represents a velocity boost that goes off the brain that we live on into the higher dimensional space and the the equation of state of matter energy that you need to affect that physical thing would give you requirement for positive energy and negative pressure so not any negative exotic matter at all as required the equation of state looks like the dark energy equation of State in in the universe and so uh uh Harold had proposed A A first order or rough sketch lab experiment that we could do uh using lasers in order to try to see if we can test this Theory oh okay and so there you go well do you think there&#x27;s more of a future out there then for brain Theory because you know a lot of people have questioned it in terms of well String Theory mostly but said can we use this who you guys are using this so does that yeah the the door isn&#x27;t closed on brain Theory yet because it hasn&#x27;t been disproved uh whenever you do experiments you try to falsify a theory in order to prove it that&#x27;s the way you prove theor try to falsify it you can&#x27;t falsify it youve proved it literally um this is just one way of being able to test some aspect of De brain theory that we think could work in a lab to to create an FTL space time effect like the alir work drive so this would be almost literally the Star Trek warp drive thing yeah in a way but this will be lowlevel it isn&#x27;t going to be dramatic it&#x27;s not going to you&#x27;re not going to expect to see anything disappearing in the laboratory and zipping off to thear it&#x27;ll be a low level low energy uh uh experiment that will give us an idea what direction we&#x27;re taking what we&#x27;re doing right what we&#x27;re doing wrong what we could do better uh it&#x27;ll be an exploration of this thing to see how right it is if it doesn&#x27;t work it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not right it just means we don&#x27;t have the right experimental concept uh we would have to go back to the drawing board and try to reanalyze everything and see what experimental devices what configuration of energies lasers Fields what whatnot would be more appropriate to make this happen uh you know if this configuration that uh Herold is proposing uh doesn&#x27;t work then we need to find other configurations that will make it work oh okay and if it doesn&#x27;t work at all then it might call into question whether de brain Theory even works or not well now on your badge I should focus in on your badge I guess it also says that that you&#x27;re a chairman right a speaker and a chairman so so in terms of section F can you tell me a little bit about the papers that you&#x27;re you&#x27;re reviewing then or I can&#x27;t hear you oh I&#x27;m sorry you you reviewed some of the papers as well right you&#x27;re right for for other people can you tell me a little bit about those or uh no no the idea is I just did a peer review on the papers to see that they reached a level of uh publication quality required by state and scientific quality required by poor scientific standards to publish papers and uh there were papers that got rejected because they were poorly written and not because the ideas were bad uh the authors just don&#x27;t know how to write a paper we couldn&#x27;t get them to come around then there were papers that were rejected probably for almost a combination of both reasons usually the ideas are really bad not provable based on hearsay uh not on the scientific method and no logical coherent flow of information could uh could make you believe that it even the idea works or whatnot so papers did get rejected but it wasn&#x27;t a lot of papers really uh a minority of papers got rejected and the vast majority got accepted and there is also a limit to how many we can handle because we were only allowed four papers per session and we were given eight sessions we have the largest number of sessions in this conference this year so uh I know that some papers that did get rejected only because the paper writing quality was bad they&#x27;re going to be allowed oral presentations so they&#x27;re going to be here providing uh an oral talk on their on their paper oh but the difference it doesn&#x27;t go to the a it won&#x27;t be in the setings but they have it in the abstract booklet and they will make an appearance at the fo8 session Thursday morning I think and so those are the papers that only got rejected because for one reason or the other the author was not able to spend the time to bring it into the right format oh sure and and then there might even be some one paper that has questionable information on it we allowed it in um well for the benefit that there&#x27;s anomalous information in there that might benefit you know future Direction there was there was another one also that was kind of the economics of grabby waves and now in terms of sta I guess it makes sense wasn&#x27;t very scientific it was more of a business case but it would be interesting you know there are rumors I guess Paul m is talking about putting together high frequency grabby wave conference for maybe Midsummer or 2007 sometime so I wonder if those might might qualify some of the things that didn&#x27;t quite fit with sta uh no they those kind of things do fit with sta because sta is about propulsion and power and anything that can affect advances and increases in propulsion and power for space and space commercial applications is is acceptable uh if you&#x27;re looking at high frequency gravity waves you might find ways of improving space Communications you might find ways of modifying gravity locally to enhance your space propulsion effect you can use high frequency gravity waves for weapons applications you can use high frequency gravity gravity wav for a number of applications oh uh astronomy basically cosmology and astrophysical astronomy uh you can use high frequency gravity waves for a number of things and uh the economics of it was is a p I think that was presented last year I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s one like that this year okay well that pertains to if you have a high frequency gravity wave based technology in the way of a communication system that&#x27;s uh Superior to all the relay satellites we have now it&#x27;s a direct line of site through the Earth Communication System uh what&#x27;s the economic benefit of that over a traditional system how how much more difficult or expensive will it be to field it uh to develop it and so forth you presume the technology uh the physics is right the technology is there it&#x27;s just that you want to look at how advantageous is it to use that as as opposed to standard high frequency microwaves or even a direct line of sight laser beam communication well given all these applications do you have any thoughts for funders who might be might be watching down the road when we get this on the web in in terms of what they might consider putting their money into and and if they should wait perhaps for years or if this is a good time to invest and then some directions that they might go in terms of investing well I think the funder should look at the STA proceedings in the F sessions particularly since we represent the New Frontiers and future Concepts if you&#x27;re looking at New Frontiers and future Concepts is something you want to put your money into then look at the paper proceedings read every one of them carefully and decide which topic that was published there that you like the most that you would like to see developed and uh you might also want to look at the previous two symposiums so this year is the third Symposium of New Frontiers and future Concepts we also had the previous second and first uh symposiums which was uh last year was the second and the year before was the first one uh you want to look at the proceedings from there too in the F sessions and those symposiums and see and decide for yourself whether something there is what you like to do I think high frequency gravity wave gravity modification um uh faster light space times like worm holes and warp drives those are all valid Concepts you should put you could put money into also power Concepts like extracting energy from the vacuum or exotic uh no one has ever thought about type ideas involving from magnetics which we hav&#x27;t before well in terms of in terms of the lb now you mentioned an upcoming experiment I know earthtech in the past or Institute for advanced studies has done all sorts of NE stuff FS ref fuser there&#x27;s a great FS ref fuser online that apparently Hal and Michael abison had built that&#x27;s on the website but but um one of the things I&#x27;m kind of wondering about is the timeline for these experiments to begin I mean in terms of transporting you know even a small particle of matter you know through some kind of a wormhole device do you think that we we have that on the horizon in the near future or you think that that&#x27;s several years away still oh are you talking about actually implementing it or just yeah well even eventive effects of it yeah even in a test case just just kind of valid um we don&#x27;t know we don&#x27;t know yet I mean essentially standard traversible Wormhole theory has no Evan Horizons there&#x27;s no such thing and if it&#x27;s a stationary Wormhole it&#x27;s not a time machine so those those those things are not considerations in this case oh okay okay there&#x27;s there&#x27;s very spec specific difficult ways of turning a wormhole into a time machine and worrying about Horizons and going backwards and so forth and so on those those require extreme movement of the Wormhole one into the Wormhole as compared to the other end in order to to affect time dilation and things like that um standard stationary Wormhole it&#x27;s just going to open up and connect two different regions across space together and that&#x27;s it you go in you come out now do do you think it&#x27;s nothing any more difficult than what uh what&#x27;s been described by Morrison Thorne or Matt bizer in his mograph yeah stable very sane uh very uh un exciting type of but difficult to produce do you think I mean in a lab environment you know given you know even even for a small wormal size do you think it&#x27;s possible to transport matter like the next few years given current technology I don&#x27;t know I oh not with no not given current technology we&#x27;re not there yet we don&#x27;t have the magnitudes of the negative energy uh in order to generate a wormhole that would be realizable I think what we&#x27;re going to do is look at microw wormhole development in the lab we we can maybe Corral just enough negative energy over just a small enough period of time that we could see some kind of a measurable effect that&#x27;s it&#x27;s only baby steps right now and the technology is not first of all we don&#x27;t have the technology to to generate enough negative energy we don&#x27;t have a way of measuring it in the lab yet we don&#x27;t have a way of concentrating it in a place where you can then start shaping it into a wormhole uh we don&#x27;t have that yeah we&#x27;re just getting started now with concepts of generating negative energy thinking about it implementing the first steps in the laboratory and then uh evolving that technology forward to where we can then start worrying about the rest of it uh well but but once it does start to reach so I mean as far as I was going to answer your question say as far as in the future it&#x27;s going to be it could be 30 years or more I I don&#x27;t know you know that&#x27;s just a pessimistic view uh technology accelerates and advances in sudden abrupt changes every here here and there so you never can predict when things uh increase in time or decrease some time oh yeah um so I just say you know 30 years from now might be we might be possibly looking at being able to send create a small wormhole in the lap and send a beam of particles through it but that&#x27;s the best I think we can do then given you know the unlikely event that uh or the low probability event that some breakthrough happens if we can make even more negative energy yeah absolutely yeah well thanks again for your time Eric again Dr Eric Davis from in of advanced studies</p>
