            <p>I&#x27;ve never seen anything that is capable of doing this. &gt;&gt; We couldn&#x27;t wait to see the surface of this material in much more detail than our microscope on the ranch could give us. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to reposition this a little. I zoomed in a little bit. &gt;&gt; I can see some clearly defined like holes right now.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Are those holes getting bigger? &gt;&gt; Yes, I think so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. What if it&#x27;s the electron beam from the microscope that&#x27;s causing this? Let&#x27;s turn it off to see if it goes back to normal.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can do that. &gt;&gt; All right, here we go. &gt;&gt; So, that does not look as porous. &gt;&gt; No, as it was. Not nearly.</p>
<p>Uh, I have the old screen grab. &gt;&gt; Look at that. This is healing. &gt;&gt; Yes, it&#x27;s healing. That&#x27;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
