            <p>centrifuges are weird they are great for providing artificial gravity in space but you would experience some weird things living in one running against a rotation would make you feel lighter run fast enough and you become weightless you basically cancel the rotation of the centrifuge running with the rotation would have the opposite effect making you feel heavier and dropping something would be trippy for you the ball won&#x27;t fall in a straight line even though from an outsider perspective it does you can probably imagine what throwing something must look like super weird throw the ball hard enough against the rotation and you could even hit the back of your own head that&#x27;s why you want your centrifuge to be as big as possible the bigger you make it the less noticeable those coriolis effects will be</p>
