            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>when they came out and said that Luis alzando had nothing to do with atip whatsoever the Pentagon said this that was a horrible wrong piece of public relations that was absolutely incorrect they did not know what they were talking about my boss went to report to Lou at the Pentagon in the O usdi offices during the atip era so that&#x27;s right you know who my boss is Hal POF right Dr Hal put off hey what is up guys welcome back to the channel um today we are bringing you a brand new video so um please make sure to like comment subscribe and as you saw with the previous clip it&#x27;s going to be interesting one um I&#x27;m pretty sure this video is releasing on Saturday so I&#x27;m hoping you have a great Saturday and um you&#x27;re enjoying it and uh you&#x27;re taking it easy and yeah enjoyed your weekend so um yeah we&#x27;re just going to be looking at a few Clips today taking it easy um seeing what has been said about Lou in the past um there&#x27;s some controversies surrounding lose employment ATP and oap and all that good stuff so um please subscribe put the Bell notifications on to not miss a video guys I appreciate you okay so let&#x27;s get into it anyway that&#x27;s the uh the ASAP a tip thing going back to atip to Luis alzando this was different this was something that operated out of O usdi this was separate from the original assap contract this was something that he wanted to pass passed to Neil Tipton and again this memo would essentially make Tipton&#x27;s desk the central point for all things UAP and UFO related that is if I think it was Patrick Shanahan uh then depps def at the time would issue that memo there&#x27;s no evidence that the memo was issued obviously or you know we&#x27;d be having a different conversation at this point that&#x27;s where the name atip came from atip was something that was necessary to be uh proceeded with on Military cases Lou handled that I was not privileged because it was mainly spun up as I was getting ready to retire I will say this though that when I left all of our reference here&#x27;s one I think is could be constructive and as recently as today this is floating around all over the place you and I have exchanged some information about it Dr Jam James aasy answered an email some a news organization asked him for a photo and along the way they said something about oap that he corrected that it seemed like the questioner uh got it wrong and he just corrected them but he didn&#x27;t want to give a comment they used his comments anyway and it sounds like he&#x27;s coming after you I&#x27;m telling you he he was not coming after you he was not he was just pointing out you weren&#x27;t really a big part of ASAP you were invited to be part of it and if it had survived you would have been part of it but he was just clarifying that and it sounds I was not part of I made it very clear my book in fact you know Jim Jim was Jim was was one of the founders and creators of that you know he he the guy deserves uh enormous credit for that he really does uh he he we would not there would not be an a tip had there not been Jim laty or an assap and I don&#x27;t look I I I don&#x27;t take anything personally I know Jim very well he&#x27;s a highly intelligent man um you know I don&#x27;t know the nuances of what happened but you know like I said man it&#x27;s it&#x27;s I don&#x27;t pay attention to the drama anyways you know Jim Jim Jim&#x27;s a great guy I&#x27;m sure if you had a problem you&#x27;d probably let me know so just okay with him let let&#x27;s talk a tip versus oap so you know the New York Times story was very important but it got a couple things wrong uh you know the $22 million that that that was supposedly went to ATP was was assap money and there&#x27;s a lot of blurring of the lines in part because some of the people who worked for oap that contractor effer under DIA also helped you in what became a tip later a lot of confusion there including even just as recently as today about who did what and what happened and and whether or not there&#x27;s all this competition between the guys who had different jobs you Jim ly uh Jay Stratton can you sort of help us sort separate wheat from chaff on all that confusion George the these guys are all great guys you know U Jim lki is is is again he&#x27;s a national hero what what he was able to do uh was was incredible you know and and and Jay Straton to was able to do I mean he became the first UAP task force director you know so these these men have done great things for their countries and both ASAP and atip owe their existence to them um but there are you know it is it is a blurry line because elements of alsap later transformed into atip the formal program that was run out of not out of DIA but out of the Pentagon where I was at and and there is where things get blurry because not everybody in ASAP was part of that that formalized effort later on and so it&#x27;s understood it&#x27;s understandable to me that there&#x27;s some confusion um look the the reality here is we&#x27;re all working towards the same thing man it&#x27;s all about disclosure right and and put egos aside and all that that that nonsense because at the end of the day we&#x27;re we&#x27;re one team one fight and and it&#x27;s about getting the job done getting Congress informed getting the American people the information they they deserve right and getting the government to work as it&#x27;s supposed to work um I don&#x27;t like to get into the trenches of the he said she said it&#x27;s it&#x27;s silly it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s constructive and at the end of the day you everybody deserves credit everybody has done a tremendous job the folks at assap uh you know the scientists there and the folks over with Bigalow they did an incredible job Bigalow paid for a lot of this stuff himself people don&#x27;t know that I this guy&#x27;s a patriot I mean he he spent his own money fronting a lot of the bill for for the government&#x27;s efforts you know there there&#x27;s a lot of good people colum kellerer jacqu valet I mean all these folks did incredible work for the government so you know I I don&#x27;t like to get into the he said she said because I I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s necessarily constructive well here&#x27;s thing in conclusion today guys I hope you enjoyed it I really do um I hope you enjoy your day further and your weekend was good once again um I will be uploading a little bit less um due to uh employment so that&#x27;s great but um also uploading lays which isn&#x27;t but um I&#x27;ll try and make plans and whatever around it whenever I can and all that I&#x27;ll keep you updated and what it so um yeah I&#x27;ll see you in the next one okay peace out</p>
