            <p>all right everyone hello welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas and I do educational videos on many different subjects today we&#x27;re going to continue I think this is the 28th video um that I&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory developed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20 20th century and updated by uh Dr Bruce Perrette Dr kvk nehru Dr Gopi Krishna and others in the 21st century um and Larson&#x27;s uh is the theory of everything it&#x27;s really a system of theory if you have the if you have the basic Theory the basic postulates then you can use them uh through deductive processes and and derive your own uh theoretical universe from the reciprocal system now Larson developed a good deal of a theoretical Universe from his system and other people have started from that basis and embarked on further development but I suppose you could go right back to the beginning and develop it right from scratch for yourself uh theoretically if your logical processes and Larson&#x27;s logical processes are uh rational then you should develop the same universe that Larson developed don&#x27;t know if that would actually happen but uh so right now we are uh in I believe the sixth video of going over his book called beyond space and time this is his final book uh what&#x27;s his final book came out after he died in 1995. uh he died in 1990 and um uh we&#x27;re looking at the fourth uh chapter here this book is basically a departure for Larson and as I have said uh some of Larson&#x27;s uh followers were objected to his wife putting out this book after he died because they didn&#x27;t feel like it was up to the level of his other books because his other books are like cold hard science and this is getting into the squishy um metaphysical the social sciences you know not hard sciences and so there&#x27;s a lot of wiggle room here um and you know Larson uh in his reciprocal system of theory you know starts with uh his two fundamental postulates uh the first one the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time the second fundamental postulate the physical Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean and I mentioned that uh that second postulate is uh largely in dispute by the people who have uh you know gone on with the theory in the 21st century after Larson died uh and have kind of imposed this projective geometry instead of the euclidean geometry not really instead of because the euclidean geometry is a subset of projective geometry so they&#x27;ve just kind of made it broader a broader broader umbrella that they believe uh you know covers more uh situations now Larson Came Upon these postulates after 20 or so years of developing his uh Theory inductively by taking measurements and observations and calculations that he was making on his own um and uh you know taking specific uh information and and measurements and up and attempting to apply it to a general situation so this is his General situation so this is what he eventually came up with now once you have the general situation then you can turn it around and use deductive reasoning to develop the theory step by step and we went over that in the uh outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system I did 15 videos on that earlier now uh now uh when looking at the metaphysical situation he has to go back and go do the inductive reasoning again to come up with um to come up with uh postulates eventually about the metaphysical Universe now the physical universe is really only half the situation in Larson&#x27;s thing you know the universe is composed entirely of motion in Larson&#x27;s situation now where Einstein is saying that the the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson is saying that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and that there is an entire universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and then there&#x27;s an entire half of the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light this is the half that we&#x27;re accustomed to and that we can actually see and observe and measure this is called the physical universe uh he calls it the material sector and then over here he&#x27;s got what you call the cosmic sector everything moves faster than the speed of light and he&#x27;s trying to probe into this Cosmic Universe how do things work in the cosmic Universe what are the thing what are the uh relationships what are the actors what are the uh players here in this Cosmic Universe you know over here we have atoms and we have electrons we have photons and you know we have all these things uh here well not necessarily photons because photons are kind of on the boundary but uh we have these these two different sectors and he&#x27;s saying that well you know because of the reciprocal relationship between space and time is of the first postulate then I can take the the things that I&#x27;ve learned about the material sector and I can extrapolate them to this Cosmic sector except that I just re-invert uh or replace space with time we don&#x27;t see time we only see space so we can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s going on over here but we can extrapolate because we can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s going on here and what&#x27;s going on here is exactly the same thing as what&#x27;s going on here except that space and time replace each other so when you have a relationship that&#x27;s space over time here over here you have a relationship that&#x27;s time over space okay so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s doing in order to come up with these metaphysical postulates and he comes up with four metaphysical postulates here in this in the fourth chapter um that I&#x27;m Not Really Gonna derive I&#x27;ve read one of them before but I&#x27;m just going to read all of them and they&#x27;re all you know uh we can we&#x27;ll discuss it then after we after I read the four metaphysical postulates there the first metaphor physical postulate there are existences in the metaphysical region the cosmic sector in the metaphysical region of a more General and less restricted type than the universe of motion that are the basic constituents of the physical universe so over here we&#x27;ve got more basically more wiggle room these are more General and less restricted so this is just a specific uh a specific the the physical universe is a specific instance of motion specific um application of motion over here in the cosmic Universe we have the same but it is uh it&#x27;s not restricted in the same way that uh these are restricted because uh it&#x27;s through extrapolation so we&#x27;re using an analogous or comparable uh ways of of applying this and we don&#x27;t really know what we what we&#x27;re really getting into again you can see space but you can&#x27;t see time so we kind of know what the space part looks like but we don&#x27;t really know what this looks like but we know that it is uh it&#x27;s the same but we have to be more General and less restricted that&#x27;s the way I understand what he&#x27;s saying there okay now the second fundamental postulate of second metaphysical postulate we went over last time a little bit the metaphysical existences are logical orderly and rational and again this is another extrapolation you know where he says in the material sector um things are logical orderly and rational and in fact just in order to be a scientist you pretty much have to stipulate that that you know you are measuring things that are logical orderly and rational they make sense otherwise it would just be Randomness and maybe that&#x27;s you know where the chaos theorists come in or whatever but even the chaos theorists uh they&#x27;re trying to make sense of things that are not making sense they ultimately have this idea that you know something makes sense you know we&#x27;re trying to figure out what it is so Larson is just extrapolating that over into the metaphysical sector or the cosmic sector and saying that you know the metaphysical existences just like the physical existences are logical orderly and rational uh and uh he also then mentions that they are intelligent but he doesn&#x27;t put that in the postulate third metaphysical postulate metaphysical existence conforms to a specific set of laws and principles different in some respects from those of the physical universe so there are laws and principles in the metaphysical sector but they&#x27;re different in some respects from those of the physical Universe in particular they&#x27;re different because time and space are inverted or you know time is substituted for space and vice versa and then the fourth metaphysical postulate which he doesn&#x27;t drive until a little bit later okay this is uh the metaphysical existences of which we have evidence are intelligence okay so um of which we have evidence okay so the that&#x27;s where he&#x27;s going here with these uh four fundamental postulates um and so that is what he&#x27;s using as his basis for getting started okay this this is the result of his in inductive reasoning um for years on this subject and now that he has these postulates he can take the postulates and apply them to the metaphysical Universe to deductively construct a metaphysical Universe um through the same process step by step uh one by one if this then that okay now uh he&#x27;s coming to chapter five which is called levels of existence uh we&#x27;re going to determine what effects on human life will theoretically result from interaction with such metaphysical existences and we will then verify uh you know because um that&#x27;s I guess that&#x27;s part of this inductive process you have to uh when you use inductive reasoning you have to also verify so he starts here with what he calls the great chain of being as it is sometimes called beginning with the smallest subatomic particle and terminating uh he says uh with homo sapiens um or he says terminating for the present at least with Homo sapiens and maybe other people might say that it goes up higher than that um up to planets and stars logo logos logoy um and then he&#x27;s talking about um for some reason you know he kind of again assumes that this evolutionary process is how things happen um but he says no evolutionary process in the inanimate world um and that Evolution doesn&#x27;t um you know it doesn&#x27;t take place in when you&#x27;re dealing with chemicals you know when you&#x27;re dealing with atoms sub atoms there&#x27;s no Evolution he calls it aggregation you have you know where he&#x27;s saying is you you need to have life before you have you have need to have a biological process before you have Evolution like um just uh atoms and molecules do not evolve they aggregate meaning that they they build up uh by glomming onto each other and and you know going together uh with each other and they can get bigger and bigger and bigger that way but they don&#x27;t evolve um so uh he&#x27;s really he&#x27;s he&#x27;s saying that they they can get more through this aggregation process they get more and more complex um and that is really how we get to the biological evolution so he&#x27;s looking at this process um and saying that at a certain level of aggregation this biological process takes over um so what he&#x27;s saying is at a certain level of complexity of inanimate matter um it becomes complex enough so that um it can be exposed to biological evolution what he&#x27;s kind of saying is that you know where we have this you know midpoint between the material and the complex or the material and the cosmic and um Larson uses this thing then this goes back to um his all of his writing scientific writings and I&#x27;ve mentioned it before it&#x27;s called the inter-regional ratio and the inter-regional ratio you know is is is making these delineations you know saying that there&#x27;s this boundary the speed of light boundary between the material sector and the cosmic sector there are also two other boundaries with there&#x27;s a boundary Within each one of these sectors um over here he calls it the time region over here he calls it the space region because of his first postulate uh it&#x27;s called a part of it is called the discrete unit postulate everything is in units uh integers and so there is a it is it&#x27;s a quantized system meaning that there is a uh one unit of space like us the smallest unit of space that&#x27;s one unit you can&#x27;t get any smaller than that and also there&#x27;s one unit of time and you can&#x27;t get any smaller than that if you get any smaller than one unit of space you&#x27;re actually you have to invert again and you uh move into this realm of time that he calls the time region so and the same way if you get inside one unit of time then again you invert and you go into what he calls the space region where everything is space um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s very difficult to kind of uh work with that but this is how this is where he comes up with uh you know Atomic phenomena um through you know figuring out the basic properties of matter through dealing with this uh the time region especially the time region the space region now in Larson&#x27;s system the time region is um I think it&#x27;s like 4.56 times 10 to the minus 8 centimeters um 10 to the minus 6 centimeters so it&#x27;s very small but it is very large compared to like the atomic size um and then the unit of time is just the amount of time it takes for the speed of light to move one unit of space and that turns out to be an incredibly small amount of time 1.52 times 10 to the minus 16 seconds so within one second uh you actually have um 6.576 quadrillion uh units of time fit into one second a quadrillion is uh what you get after you add three zeros to a trillion so uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s basically you know 15 zeros uh so you know there are more units of time in uh in one second than there are you know grains of sand or whatever in the universe uh you know just the huge a tiny tiny tiny number but the point I&#x27;m making is that he&#x27;s using this thing called the inter-regional ratio where you um when you are comparing uh two different things in different sectors of the unit we reside in this in this space-time uh in the time Space Universe in the material sector but in not in the time region so when we&#x27;re going to the time region to measure something or we go into the other re we have to um use this inter-regional ratio meaning that we only see a certain part of of what we&#x27;re what&#x27;s actually going on um what you know something gets lost in the translation it turns out that the vast majority of the information gets lost in the translation and so we have to use this uh fraction which is usually about 150 156.44 but sometimes it can be as low as 128 um and um it depends on the other minor calculations that he makes but in it but in any case um he there&#x27;s a a translation that you have to use and so you have to shrink shrink that level down um it&#x27;s kind of like if you look at the Sun for example you only see the surface of the Sun you don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s underneath that and so that is kind of the same concept uh we will get into that tomorrow we&#x27;ll start talking of try to figure out this inner Regional ratio and then we&#x27;ll go into this difference between aggregation and biological evolution okay see you later</p>
