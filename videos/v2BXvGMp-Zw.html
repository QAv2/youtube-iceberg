            <p>of bigelow&#x27;s fields of study many of them are on things we&#x27;re yet to master but their applications would be revolutionary among the most sensitive anti-gravity or the ability to free ourselves from the laws of newtonian physics and notably weight so as to fly an object with no physical resistance and nothing pulling it downwards these futuristic technologies require the designing of new materials called meta materials recently a private company signed a contract with the u.s armed forces for the research and development of these technologies in june 2018 dr hal patoff co-founder of the company and a former atip member made some surprising comments on the subject it was a multi-layered bismuth and magnesium sample bismuth layers of less than a human hair magnesium sample is about 10 times the size of human hair supposedly picked up in the crash retrieval of an advanced aerospace vehicle looks like it&#x27;s been in the crash in las vegas in june 2018 physicist hal padov implied that this strange meta-material object came from a crashed ufo but he&#x27;s not certain patoff and his colleague dr eric davis are on the verge of identifying a number of small parts which appear to be beyond man&#x27;s fabrication capacities this sample was created with layers finer than microns using a process unknown on earth and with an aim we can only guess at nowhere could we find any evidence that anybody ever made one of these when we talked to people who in the materials field who should know they said we don&#x27;t know why anybody would want to make anything like this so it&#x27;s no longer just a matter of understanding the origin of ufos but of benefiting from them these meta materials might have exceptional properties which could prove useful and profitable they definitely have meta materials you know i&#x27;ve seen the photographs of it i&#x27;ve talked to them about that they&#x27;re trying to figure out how they operate it appears that if you put a frequency into these materials they actually can levitate i mean that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m being told i haven&#x27;t seen it i don&#x27;t know the details behind it but they&#x27;re trying to understand exactly how these are created it&#x27;s a bismuth kind of a material and it&#x27;s stratified so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s new stuff to us and we&#x27;re trying to figure out how it works</p>
