            <p>Having been a person that&#x27;s done a lot of digging on this ranch, the more serious of digging I do, the more serious of consequences that follow. I didn&#x27;t believe in the paranormal when I came out on this ranch. When they told me not to dig, I just thought it was ridiculous. One day, I decided to do some digging and then 3 days after I noticed that I had a goose egg on the back of my head. My scalp separated from my skull.</p>
<p>The pain is so excruciating. And I&#x27;ve never felt anything like it before in my life. The doctors had no idea what caused it. They didn&#x27;t know how to fix it. Basically, they&#x27;re telling me what happened to me was medically impossible.</p>
<p>And it caused me a severe injury that to this day I&#x27;m still having some repercussions with.</p>
