            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Greetings. And here we go again. Another astonishing week of UFO or UAP related news. And can we say bombshells? Well, it depends on who you talk to, but I would say yes, I think so. Uh, the density of new and fresh information reaching the general public on this subject of UFOs just seems unprecedented to me.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve talked about this a few times already, but the point bears repeating. We are in a heightened phase of public release of information on what used to be called UFOs. The quantity and and I must say the quality of information is at a level I I just don&#x27;t think that we have reached this before. Maybe the David Grush uh revelations of two years ago are really the only comparable uh point that I can think of. And I don&#x27;t know if this is bigger than the David Grush revelations.</p>
<p>Probably not. But it&#x27;s combined what we&#x27;ve seen this week is really quite quite remarkable in any case. And what&#x27;s also noteworthy is that I think despite all of this, you can expect more uh resistance, more hostile debunking, uh it&#x27;s become evident to me that the more information that we are seeing out there that&#x27;s coming out on this subject, uh the more that the uh the more we can expect the establishment and this includes not just government but number of private players, let&#x27;s say the media, many aspects of the media, Wikipedia for sure, much of academia, uh many other institutions, they will continue to come down hard against this. But uh for this program that I&#x27;m doing here, I&#x27;m just going to confine my remarks to the information itself. I think that&#x27;s quite enough to digest.</p>
<p>So today I will be covering three major stories that have emerged this week. Each remarkable in its own right. You know, just keep in mind last week uh I was talking to you about the uh remarkable um interview on the Jesse Michael program with Harold Melgrren. I thought that was enough. Now, we&#x27;ve got three more coming out this week.</p>
<p>First, I will talk about the revelation from the Weaponized podcast. That&#x27;s Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp. They interviewed Matthew Brown. Uh he was the once anonymous author of the Immaculate Constellation report. This is the document that was submitted to Congress a few months ago detailing the uh I guess what was purportedly the highly classified program uses AI to search for UAP imagery across classified uh military uh and intelligence servers.</p>
<p>So Brown worked at the Pentagon on like WMD issues, that type of thing. and he talks about how he stumbled onto this program and why he&#x27;s decided to go public despite potential serious repercussions. Uh second, I&#x27;ll take a look at Dr. Hal Putoff&#x27;s fascinating appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience. Uh Hal Putoff, he&#x27;s someone I&#x27;ve known for about 25 years myself.</p>
<p>He is a physicist with an extraordinary background in remote viewing programs for the CIA, involvement in UFO or UAP research. And so he had a lot of interesting things to say on this podcast. I will definitely be going over that with you. And then finally, we&#x27;ll cover the quite remarkable congressional, I guess we can say briefing uh from yesterday. This is titled UAP Science, National Security, and Innovation, hosted by the UAP uh Disclosure Fund and um sponsored by a bipartisan task force on declassifying federal secrets.</p>
<p>This is led by Representative Luna. A lot of you have been hearing about this. This had a lot of a very impressive lineup of of individuals. I will be mostly talking about Dr. Eric Davis here, but all of the people present had something interesting to say.</p>
<p>I would say each of these stories, these three stories, represents yet another significant step in what appears to be an accelerating process. Although, as I mentioned, it won&#x27;t be without push back. Let me just go into the specifics. So, let me talk about the Matthew Matthew Brown interview on Weaponize. I was going to do this the other day and then everything else just caught up and now it&#x27;s all of these other things to discuss.</p>
<p>But anyway, Brown is an interesting man. Uh he has a degree in international affairs. He worked at the Pentagon for over 5 years including in the office of the under secretary of defense for intelligence. That&#x27;s USDI. He had a top secret CSI clearance.</p>
<p>um he had a long he had an interest in UFOs he said but he really wasn&#x27;t an active he wasn&#x27;t actively interested in it and I think he as he said his initial uh assumption for years that it was just simply our classified uh technology and then he talked about discovering otherwise. So uh what I have most of this presentation here for you is a lot of bullets uh on my slides. I want to make this as easy for you to follow. Uh that&#x27;s going to be my I hope I&#x27;ve done a good job with the bullets. So, as he says, it was in 2018 that Brown said he accidentally discovered the Immaculate Constellation program while organizing files on a a Pentagon server.</p>
<p>It was a shared server. He opened a misfiled document uh labeled the uh 2018 Shrivever war game that contained an unexpected um heading Immaculate Constellation. He didn&#x27;t know anything about this. And then it featured Louise Alzando&#x27;s face on one of the slides. So Shrivever uh Space Force base is in Colorado Springs, Colorado in case you&#x27;re wondering.</p>
<p>And what he says is that he says there is a banner without classification markings that just says immaculate constellation. The next slide is where it gets interesting. He says because the face of Lu Alzando is there. It was saying that Immaculate Constellation is an unagnowledged special access program at USAP established after the exposure of the ATIP program in 2017. That&#x27;s the um advanced aerospace threat identification program.</p>
<p>If you followed this channel for any period of time, you probably know what that is. So, he&#x27;s reading the document and it identifies Immaculate Constellation as a a as an unagnowledged special access program. And now he&#x27;s wondering what in God&#x27;s name is this about? Uh and he&#x27;s saying that the program Immaculate Constellation documented a large black triangle hovering directly over a Russian uh naval vessel or vessels I guess in the Pacific Ocean near Kamchatka. That&#x27;s that a massive peninsula there. He said the Russian sailors showed no alarm, no evasive maneuvers, no defensive protocol.</p>
<p>So the the calm that they had suggested maybe fornowledge or maybe prior contact with this object, but it wasn&#x27;t something that was uh blowing their minds. Apparently uh the photograph itself told a story. It was taken from water level um maybe from a clandestine submersible captured both the vessels and the craft in a single frame. Perfect surveillance positioning, perfect evidence gathering. Uh the program documents label the craft either RV or ARV.</p>
<p>So this is terminology indicating maybe a reproduction vehicle of some sort, either anomalous or alien origin. Uh the mission purpose became very clear to him. Global intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance of these objects. U what the Russians knew about the triangle is I guess he either didn&#x27;t know or it remains classified. what our own military knows remains hidden.</p>
<p>But there you have it. So the mission of Immaculate Constellation basically had um really a clear purpose and a minimal footprint. So it was to gather UAP intelligence globally. It was to draw data from existing military and intelligence sensors across theaters. uh to centralize this information into a unified intelligence picture away from congressional oversight.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very logical how it&#x27;s it&#x27;s set up in my opinion. Just understanding how he explained it, it&#x27;s like you hear him talk about it, you think this kind of makes sense. Uh the briefing document contained uh he said 12 to 15 slides of raw evidence. After the black triangle, there were other pages that displayed orbs, basically spherical objects, uh not clear how they were able to stay in the air, captured across multiple continents and environments. Uh they appeared with striking regularity around nuclear facilities, weapon sites, military assets.</p>
<p>uh you know I think in his assessment you you couldn&#x27;t dismiss this pattern as coincidence. In my own research uh there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to say about these orbs they are definitely a significant part of what we call the UFO or UAP phenomenon. When uh we as we know when the Pentagon was asked about Immaculate constellation they totally denied its existence. Um so but anyway the program continued its clandestine operations throughout uh the years apparently collecting cataloging concealing what the public was not meant to know that we are monitored by something beyond our comprehension and that that select elements within our government track these encounters away from official channels. That is certainly what it looks like.</p>
<p>After the uh 2017 revelations, a brief window opened. This is how um Matthew describes this. He said people were speaking freely on classified networks. Questions were asked, theories were exchanged. All of this, the culture shifted.</p>
<p>Then came the order. It was unwritten, but it was understood by everyone. The window closed. All this was not to be discussed. Certain names became totally radioactive.</p>
<p>Uh he actually said you can&#x27;t mention David Grush in certain professional settings or you are Uh no formal memo circulated. No official directive was issued. Basically we got a message traveling through whispers and sudden silences. Careers were very much endangered for those who spoke these names and talked about programs that are not supposed to be discussed. Um the deception reached the highest levels.</p>
<p>I mean, Brown witnessed this firsthand. He said, &quot;I read the transcripts of Sean Kurpatre, that&#x27;s of the Arrow Office, briefing Senator Rubio, Senator Warren, Senator Gillibrand.&quot; And um, you know, he&#x27;s reading it. He&#x27;s like the whole all the evidence of deliberate misdirection was unmistakable. And then he he reads Rubio&#x27;s realization and Rubio said, &quot;What the hell is the executive branch doing? Have they been running this for 60 years without congressional oversight? This is Rubio who&#x27;s now Secretary of State of course. So it&#x27;s very interesting that this exchange was in there and Brown was aware of it.</p>
<p>So it became obvious the secrecy apparatus at least in his estimation extended beyond intelligence compartments or military security. Uh, one thing he said was, &quot;It&#x27;s been allowed to corrupt and infest every aspect of our society to serve the interests and whims of a very elite select few.&quot; I like that quote. Basically, you know, the machinery protects not just national security, protects power. I think we all can see that it it&#x27;s not just shielding technology, it&#x27;s shielding control. And if you break the silence, you face consequences.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s that. Uh Brown, he was very interesting. I think this is a a good of the three uh videos that I&#x27;m covering. This is the shortest. It&#x27;s less than one hour.</p>
<p>The other two are three hours or more. They&#x27;re quite quite long. Uh Brown just very interesting. You can see he had a lot of um very good qualifications. He&#x27;s highly intelligent, very sympathetic uh individual.</p>
<p>It seems to me uh his focus was not on UFOs. It was all on weapons of mass destruction and uh I think this is a man with very very strong credentials and uh he talked about risking life imprisonment when the possibility of execution you know when he said that I wondered our execution sound a little extreme but I&#x27;m not here to uh question him this is what he believes he wasn&#x27;t giving any embellishment to it so he made his decision and uh I really want to applaud uh Matthew Brown for what he had to say. I think he had a very strong clarity of purpose in his interview and um really what you&#x27;re seeing with him is is a man of order who chose to disrupt the system. You know, he&#x27;s within this military environment following orders, but he is he&#x27;s become a disruptor of his own uh his own selection. He&#x27;s a defender of secrecy who chose disclosure.</p>
<p>So, I definitely have admiration for what he&#x27;s done. Thank you, Matthew Brown. Now, Halputoff on Joe Rogan. This was fascinating to me. I&#x27;ve known Haluto off for many years.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve waited for him to come out, so to speak, on something as significant as the Joe Rogan podcast. Of course, Hal has been making more and more statements like what he&#x27;s just said on Rogan over the past few years. I don&#x27;t know if this consists of genuine bombshells. If you&#x27;ve been scouring the web for years, you would likely have heard most, maybe even all of this information that he had to say. But he put it together in a very powerful cogent manner.</p>
<p>I have to think this has had a lot of impact for many people. Uh so what did he talk about? Halpov talked about a lot of things. This is a three-hour interview, and I uh do recommend you listen to it if you&#x27;ve got the time. If not, I&#x27;ll give you my best uh summation of it here. He talked about a couple of different things.</p>
<p>One was remote viewing, uh the events surrounding remote viewing, its connections to the quantum realm. Talked about how the CIA initiated this investigation into extra sensory per uh perception following how Puddov&#x27;s experiments with the psychic Ingo Swan, who of course is very famous in this field of remote viewing. The experiments began as basically a probe into the borderland between uh types of physics, regular physics and and unconventional physics. Um well famously they yielded some unexpected results. U and he talked about this always fascinating to me.</p>
<p>So he had remote viewers utilizing just map coordinates accurately described all kinds of things including Soviet facilities including a research and development site. Uh the precision of all the descriptions was quite notable. Uh these these are famous stories in the remote viewing field but it was very good that Halputoff talked about them. Uh basically you know he went on he said there are people involved in the program they had the ability to perceive even through uh types of shielding. He talked about the internal workings of electronic devices.</p>
<p>Uh they indicated they show the capacity to affect certain devices influencing their oscillations. So not just remote viewing but remote influencing. And you know it&#x27;s like what causes this? It&#x27;s not particularly clear. Um I don&#x27;t think that he&#x27;s sure. I don&#x27;t know if anyone is sure.</p>
<p>So maybe the phenomenon you wonder is rooted in quantum mechanics where you know the laws of physics do not at least the laws of classical physics don&#x27;t always or easily apply. U he mentioned that the program gave an unexpected outcome. He said even those who initially were very skeptical became effective remote viewers in controlled experiments. Uh, one individual, he said he was a CIA representative, was tasked with uncovering potential fraud in the experiments and instead he found himself successfully remote viewing. He described a target with uncanny accuracy.</p>
<p>So all of these things are once considered impossible. They&#x27;ve been documented. They&#x27;ve been verified. And really the the only questions is what is able to make this happen? I don&#x27;t know if people really understand that uh to this day. Now it get becomes more interesting to me when Alputo off began talking about UFOs or UAPs.</p>
<p>U talks about as a physicist he was initially skeptical about non-human intelligence but he did not remain that way u after he started looking into it. I guess that&#x27;s really his his main point. um remote viewing partly opened him up to that. Uh but then he talked about as part of a think tank he this is quite interesting. I think he&#x27;s participated in more than one of these to be honest, but he talked about this one uh and he said he evaluated the potential consequences of disclosure.</p>
<p>You have to look at the the pluses and the minuses here. Um I&#x27;ll have a little bit more to say about that in a second. He talked about how the current system of compartmentalization is really holding back scientific progress on UAP technology. He was very supportive of the UAP disclosure act of 2023. Uh he believes that controlled disclosure where information is released in a careful way and a managed way is the best approach to serve national security interests.</p>
<p>Remember this is a man with uh five six decades of u of having classified um being within the classified world of holding clearances. So this is how he thinks. Uh he he also said in his opinion that acknowledging the reality of UAPs, engaging with their implications can help us uh can help unlock new uh areas for scientific inquiry, technological advancement. So I think all of that was very well said. He really came out very strongly for supporting greater disclosure.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s fair to say. He wanted to encourage a more open uh collaborative approach to UFO or UAP research, bringing experts in from different fields and really getting into it. Uh regarding that think tank, by the way, so according to the interview, he was uh part of a think tank that evaluated the consequences of disclosure and it was led by a person who he couldn&#x27;t name. uh but this person contacted puto off and asked him to participate which was all about discussing the consequences of disclosure about UAPs. He mentioned that the think tank included people like Senator Rubio and that the goal was to get a group of highlevel individuals to collaborate on saying what their involvement was to agree what could be disclosed and it was focused on evaluating the positive and negative consequences of disclosure.</p>
<p>So ultimately the um he didn&#x27;t really give a lot more information about this like its name or the specific topics discussed or the outcome but it was clear from his participation that it was important and he certainly came down on the side of wanting to uh promote disclosure more than in the past and that&#x27;s the impression that I got from that. uh perhaps the most interesting element of this interview uh at least I think in a lot of people&#x27;s opinions will be this element where he talks about comp a company that obtained materials from a non-human craft and he didn&#x27;t mention the name of this company he didn&#x27;t say Lockheed Martin but I think that&#x27;s the betting money u but regardless uh there was a connection to Bigalow Aerospace I I&#x27;m quite sure this is connected to the article that was discussed a few months ago by Christopher Sharp. A couple of other people have talked about this as well in which Lheed Martin was said to have uh technology of from craft alien craft that was going to be somehow given or gifted to the Bigalow Aerospace uh company for study and that it was turned down twice or blocked by the CIA. This may be a different scenario, but there may be something uh similar about it. I&#x27;m not sure.</p>
<p>But anyway, he talked about a company that had obtained materials from a non-human craft, but the compartmentalization, this was interesting, uh was so extreme that even the company&#x27;s own researchers could not access the materials. Uh so he&#x27;s describing a scenario where you have a person working on the propulsion system of the craft that had no access to the metallurgists who were working on the materials despite the fact that their work was so closely related and they were all in the same building. The metallurgists in turn had no access to the person working on the propulsion system. So, you know, we&#x27;ve heard hints and rumors, at least I&#x27;ve heard hints and rumors for a while of this amount of secrecy that was hindering uh research, but this was probably the most explicit statement that I&#x27;ve I&#x27;m aware of uh in the public realm that talks about this. Um, Putoff actually said the materials were stored in a basement and and even the company&#x27;s own researchers were not allowed to access them.</p>
<p>So he&#x27;s describing a situation where you have a person working on a project but would not be allowed to see the materials or know what they were working on. Uh the person would be given a task to complete but would not be given any context or information about the project as a whole. Uh put off actually used the word obscene to describe this level of compartment compartmentalization and basically it&#x27;s death to scientific progress. um for him he&#x27;s he&#x27;s talking about the lack of collaboration, the lack of information sharing between researchers as a definite obstacle to advancing our own understanding of this tech. And of course that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>uh and also uh the AROW office and the AOIMSG office those programs were trying to coordinate highly classified UAP information but the extreme compartmentalization of the technology remained a real problem. Uh, Putoff also mentioned that he had spoken to a person who had been involved in the Manhattan project, that is the project to build the first atomic bomb way back in the 1940s, of course. Uh, and that person had told him that the level of compartmentalization in the UAP field was even more extreme than it had been during the Manhattan project. uh he called uh put off called all of this a just a fascinating puzzle and that it was clear that the companies involved in the UAP field were being forced to work in a highly compartmentalized environment with very little information sharing or collaboration uh between researchers. Yeah, it&#x27;s frustrating yet understandable why uh Put off is being cy about the company that allegedly had the extraterrestrial material.</p>
<p>I mean, he he likely has his own non-disclosure agreements in place. I can only imagine uh is probably bound by all kinds of confidentiality agreements. But what&#x27;s clear is that the company in question had obtained materials from a nonhuman craft, but the compartmentalization of in information was so extreme that even their own researchers could not access the materials. Uh he actually proposed a novel solution to this. Uh he said he suggested that the company could provide material to his organization and in return they would conduct research and provide the results without revealing the source of the material.</p>
<p>He he said, &quot;Look, this could allow the company to maintain their secrecy. They could still advance scientific understanding of the material, but that proposal was rejected.&quot; So, very interesting. He talked a little bit about the Kona Blue program. We&#x27;ve heard about this over the last couple of years. Uh Luis Alzando wrote about it in his book imminent uh last year.</p>
<p>Uh here Pud Off is talking about it and basically just mentions the program. Now it&#x27;s been acknowledged and during his involvement they compiled a massive amount of documentation on UAP research um methodologies all of that which he said literally stacked up to the ceiling and he uh noted that uh the program which generated 38 scientific papers on advanced propulsion and warp technology um wasn&#x27;t sure if he mentioned this in connection with Kona blue but he did talk about this. This is very well known when it came out a few years ago. A lot of scientists, official mainstream scientists uh really ripped on these papers calling it like Harry Potter type, you know, f fantasy stuff. But actually it was very brilliantly done and put off organized these papers.</p>
<p>He basically uh in fact he talked about this five six years ago I think back in 2018 at a lecture that uh it&#x27;s still available on Vimeo I think to his surprise but what he stated was that uh as part of all of this um work he was with Robert Bigalow on contract to the government is that they wanted scientific information on all of these UFO or UAP related fields. s and didn&#x27;t know how to get information from experts uh in various fields. So he basically approached them through legitimate aerospace and propulsion science channels and was just didn&#x27;t tell them that it was uh they were working on UFO a UFO project. uh he asked if they would talk about the future of their uh discipline, you know, in the coming decades and what what could be um gleaned out of that. So, I thought that was actually very interesting that he did that.</p>
<p>Uh they just had no idea that their work was related to UAPs or extraterrestrials or anything like that. They&#x27;re just working on advanced propulsion and warp technology and their research was used to further understand the phenomenon. So very very interesting and I think he indicated that this is part of Kona blue. So but the Kona blue program really never got off the ground either. So how how this all fits in bureaucratically I&#x27;m not it&#x27;s not really 100% clear to me but it was all quite interesting.</p>
<p>Uh he also talked about various theories of non-human intelligence uh different hypotheses extraterrestrial, ultraterrestrial, interdimensional. Uh he actually talked about evidence suggesting that some of these may originate from oceanbased facilities. Found that quite interesting. Of course, I&#x27;ve published the first of my three volume history of USOS. That is unidentified submerged objects.</p>
<p>If you have not read the book, uh let me be the first to encourage you to go check it out. Uh I tried to do a very very thorough uh and complete history of that. The other two volumes are coming out this year as well. In any case, he talked about that. I thought very good check.</p>
<p>Uh he mentioned that remote viewers who were part of the remote viewing program had identified possible UAP bases uh on Earth, some in the oceans. So all very interesting. uh he wondered or suggested I you know it&#x27;s hard to know how strongly he believed these but that maybe non-human intelligence had established a presence on our planet a long time ago and that um he really indicated his presence may be more extensive and complex than we currently understand. He did toss that out there. Uh he also indicated that some incidents suggest that non-human intelligences are monitoring nuclear facilities and missile sites, something that researchers have been talking about for a long time.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just nice to hear him uh state this. Uh and you know whether or not uh he feels that they were good or bad. I&#x27;m going to get into that I think in the next uh slide. But basically I think his attitude is look none of this is conclusive. We need more information to understand really what is going on.</p>
<p>But he did say pretty clearly that the accumulation of the data and of the evidence from all the different sources uh suggested that non-human intelligence is real. It&#x27;s here. It&#x27;s a significant phenomenon that deserves serious attention and study. I think that&#x27;s probably the biggest takeaway you could get from his statement there. So, I mean, you know, everything that you hear off state, you always get a commitment to scientific rigor.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s always there at the same time being uh open-minded in his inquiry. It&#x27;s a really great combination that I I&#x27;ve always admired about him. He did talk about uh what we can call the meta material. Uh he did an analysis, you could say, of crash material, crash retrieval materials. uh specifically this one that p is pictured here.</p>
<p>This bismouth titanium meta material is so it&#x27;s called allegedly recovered from the Roswell crash. Uh he talked a bit about it. He said it was sent to a national laboratory for analysis. Scientists could not find any historical precedent for its composition. The experts were baffled by the material structure.</p>
<p>had very ultra fine layers of bismouth and magnesium um and titanium that were somehow bonded together in a way that defied conventional understanding. He mentioned that aerospace companies were also tasked with trying to recreate the materials uh structure. They could not do it. they were not able to have any success in that regard. Um he also mentioned that there were multiple recovered craft.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t know the exact number but he did say more than 10. He noted that programs have been established to reverse engineer the recovered uh non-human tech with the goal of understanding how it works and potentially adapting it for human use. He said, &quot;This effort&#x27;s been going for many years while um and there&#x27;s been some significant progress, but there&#x27;s still a lot more to be learned about all of it.&quot; I think his discussion of crash retrievals was a a really that this was a fascinating part of the discussion. It&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a nice little glimpse into the world of reverse engineering and the efforts that are made to understand and and to adapt this technology. So uh and then I think um yeah we get to the issue of are they friend or foe? Something that you know we all wonder about if we&#x27;ve looked at this subject long enough.</p>
<p>And you know, he he&#x27;s kind of on both sides of this. He talks about cases where UFOs or UAPs have been seen near nuclear facilities and that their presence was associated with a reduction in the risk of nuclear accidents or conflicts. Maybe su suggesting they were somewhat benevolent or they&#x27;re trying to prevent the use of nuclear weapons or prevent nuclear war, mitigate the risks with nuclear power. But he did note that there were other encounters that showed that these objects do have real threat capabilities. Uh not just the ability to deactivate missiles.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve all heard about this. Uh he talked about instances where they were seen interfering with military equipment including missiles and other defense systems. Um he talked about the Colaris Brazil sightings of 1977 and 1978. Uh this is something that if like if you&#x27;re a real UFO researcher or if you&#x27;re a Brazilian UFO researcher, you&#x27;re definitely going to know about this, but it was a very very significant series of events. Uh and Pov talked about that.</p>
<p>So in this case you had UFOs, UAPs firing beams of energy at people causing physical harm at sometime in some cases death and other injuries. This was investigated. This is a definite instance where you can really argue these objects were going after ordinary civilians and at times killing them. So he talked about that. although he did say the majority of these encounters seem to be non-aggressive uh and that their intentions are not particularly clear.</p>
<p>So for him to say that after all of his years looking into this is interesting. He really said look there&#x27;s still a lot more that we need to know about the motivations and goals of of these beings. We need to just keep keep at it. So he did, you know, I will just mention here that to the extent that he&#x27;s talking about the potential threat posed by these objects, it is a reminder I I think this must be uh emphasized here that their intentions must be they may not necessarily all be benign. I guess that&#x27;s maybe how we can put it.</p>
<p>and that it&#x27;s in our interest and maybe our obligation to very carefully consider these potential intentions. This has been a very strong interest of mine for quite some time. Wondering, you know, what are they really all about? Do we have anything to be concerned about here? Maybe we do. not here to to uh press the alarm in every instance, but when we are faced with a uh a group that is vastly more capable than we are technologically and they seem to have a run of the place, yes, we would want to inquire, do we have anything to worry about? I think that&#x27;s a fair enough thing to say. Talked a bit about Bob Lazar and propulsion physics.</p>
<p>That was also interesting. um you know like what is behind the impossible maneuvers of these objects. Halpto has been thinking about this for many many years. He wrote I think he wrote the forward or the introduction to Paul Hill&#x27;s classic work on uh unconventional flying objects. If you know that book you know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.</p>
<p>Paul Hill was a NASA scientist who wrote maybe still possibly the best single volume work on uh the science of UFOs. I&#x27;m not sure but it could be. and put off wrote an introduction for that. So he knows this subject that was back in the 90s. Um he talked about space-time metric engineering as a possible explanation.</p>
<p>This is a paper that he himself wrote uh as part of that um those 38 papers that actually they were sponsored by the defense intelligence agency. He talked about Einstein&#x27;s equations suggesting, you know, theoretical possibility of controlling gravity. This could be used to explain UAP&#x27;s ability to defy conventional physics. He mentioned the concept of vacuum energy or zero point energy. That&#x27;s something he studied in great detail uh more than probably anybody else that I know of.</p>
<p>He said maybe this is potentially involved in the propulsion of these craft as well. He referenced Bob Lazar&#x27;s description of element 115. This is the material Lazar claimed was used in propulsion systems of UAPs that he worked with. Um, I thought it was interesting. You know, Putoff, unlike a lot of other people, he considers uh Lazar as potentially correct here.</p>
<p>seems to me he&#x27;s um that element 115 could be a real material with unique properties that allow it to manipulate spaceime. I I think he was open to that. He u stated that the craft&#x27;s uh reported X-ray emissions were consistent with theoretical models of gravity control. Got kind of technical there, but this could be used to explain UAP&#x27;s ability to move in impossible ways. Um, I thought it was interesting when he talk he&#x27;s talking about propulsion physics and Bob Lazar&#x27;s claims.</p>
<p>So, he&#x27;s really indicating the possibility that these UAPs are using very advanced technologies that are beyond our current understanding. And again, he comes back to this idea that, you know, if we study these UAPs, this could lead to breakthroughs in our own understanding of physics and developing new technologies. So I thought that was that was all actually quite interesting. I think he even talked about El Kubier&#x27;s warp drive. Um, Miguel Alier was a mathematician a couple of decades ago who came up with this math and put off was supportive of that as a a theoretical concept that could create kind of a a space-time bubble around a craft that could allow it to go at faster than light speeds without violating the laws of relativity.</p>
<p>That was quite good. So overall, I think his discussion of propulsion physics and Lazar, it was another nice glimpse into the possible technologies behind these UAPs, u you know, I think he handled it well. He he wasn&#x27;t really trying to be definitive or dogmatic about about these things, but he was um I think open-mindedly and yet critically minded uh considering these as as valid. Uh yeah, I think Hal&#x27;s Put Off&#x27;s interview matters. I think it&#x27;s a glimpse, another glimpse into the unknown, a little peak behind the curtain of UAPs.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s talking about crash retrieval materials of propulsion systems that defy explanation. Uh he&#x27;s always very spare with his words, but the implications are right there in front of you. So very, very good. I would encourage you to check out that interview. Now for the final story.</p>
<p>Remember all of this has come out over just a couple of days. And this is the uh I guess we&#x27;ll call it a briefing in Congress sponsored by the UAP Disclosure Fund. Uh that&#x27;s got Tim Galedet and Gary Nolan and um Luzando and a lot of the folks that were up there and it was indeed related to Representative uh Anna Paulina Luna&#x27;s work in Congress. Currently she um is working on the committee to investigate various types of conspiracies whether it&#x27;s UFOs, USOs, JFK, 911, COVID and the rest. So I think this was in support of that.</p>
<p>So uh so let me let&#x27;s go in here. So the the first I Eric Davis wasn&#x27;t the first person to talk but I want to talk about him first. I I think what he had to say was the most telling and significant of of everyone there. Uh everyone had something interesting to say but I think what Davis is not someone that we hear of very frequently and so I think we really want to hear what he has to say. Derek Davis is a brilliant man and we um he confirmed here that he was a senior scientist for ATIP um doing UFO investigations for the Pentagon.</p>
<p>He explicitly stated that the legacy UAP programs are more hidden than the Manhattan Project. It&#x27;s exactly what Al Puto put off Alto said on Rogan. Of course, PutF and Davis are very close colleagues. So obviously what one knows pretty confident in thinking that the other one probably knows it as well. Uh so yeah more secret than the Manhattan project and have been deliberately kept hidden from congressional oversight.</p>
<p>He was quite explicit about that. Uh and he said since the Eisenhower administration this has been kept hidden from congressional oversight. So for the last you know 65 years or so through uh presidential emergency action directives he said he confirmed the existence of crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs. He described how defense contractors use what he called internal research and development funds to analyze recovered vehicles with zero congressional oversight. So this creates complete deniability through circumventing the appropriations processes.</p>
<p>Right. He per Davis said he personally briefed officials on crash retrieval information, including a classified briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee staff director and the Senate Intelligence Committee members um regarding findings that the recovered craft and this is his statement were not made by human hands and not from his planet. That&#x27;s a very interesting statement, not by human hands because that is a statement from the famous or infamous Wilson Davis memo that leaked finally in 2019. I had a lot to say about that. A lot of very ignorant people came out and said that they were that was a fake document.</p>
<p>It was, you know, all of these things that it wasn&#x27;t. Well, no, it was a legitimate document. Uh Eric Davis was the author of that. He actually mentions this. I&#x27;ll get to that in a second.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t explicitly state that he wrote it, but he very very strongly implied it. And I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll tell you uh the details in a second, but he did state that only one four-star general and one threestar admiral, and that three star admiral would be Wilson, by the way. Uh he said only those two successfully located these special access programs, which he said were compartmentalized beyond even our most sensitive nuclear weapons programs. So that&#x27;s how deeply these things are hidden. And then when you read the uh Davis Wilson notes, by the way, you get the exact same um conclusion that this these UFO related programs are deeply deeply classified.</p>
<p>Uh relating to the Davis Wilson memo, Wilson Davis memo situation, um he uh Lou Alzando had something to say this. So, Alzando during the this here, this briefing, he said, &quot;For those who don&#x27;t know, Dr. those who don&#x27;t know, Dr. Davis was, and I&#x27;ll let him answer this, this is a direct quote here. Um, it was submitted uh into the matter of record for Congress a couple of years ago, the Wilson Davis memo.</p>
<p>It was alleged that he was the author of it.&quot; This is Alzando&#x27;s words. And if you don&#x27;t know what that is, I encourage you to look it up. It has been entered as a matter of public record on the congressional record. It is extremely significant as Alzando. He clearly knows it&#x27;s a legitimate memo and he&#x27;s ask he&#x27;s mentioning Davis uh right there in the room he said this is the man I won&#x27;t say he did or he didn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll let you tell uh and then he kind of drift drifted off there.</p>
<p>Now, when Davis began speaking, he did not directly respond to this clear prompt by Alzando about the Wilson Davis memo, but he did discuss his background working with Bigalow Aerospace, various scientific organizations, and he described how through astronaut Edgar Mitchell, who was very much involved with that whole business, that he he said, &quot;I got on the trail of looking for the so-called called legend within the UFO community of the retrieval of crashed or landed UAP craft or UFO craft. That&#x27;s direct uh statement of Eric Davis. And then he later mentioned finding only one four-star general and one threestar admiral. Again, that&#x27;s Wilson who were able to locate these programs. U so he&#x27;s describing meeting with defense contractors and intelligence officials throughout his career.</p>
<p>He did not explicitly confirm or deny his role in the Wilson Davis notes during his testimony. Uh but I think he came very very close in when he talked about his whole backstory. Uh that was a very clear reference to it. He&#x27;s got to be careful. This is the thing with Eric Davis.</p>
<p>These these individuals, even though the Wilson Davis notes were not officially classified, what they were discussing was certainly extremely classified. And when he wrote those notes back in 2002, long time ago, he was only writing it for the very very small group of individuals associated with uh his work at Bigalow uh back then the National Institute for Discovery Science that included people like Alputo and Edgar Mitchell and uh and many others. He made a very unambiguous statement about recovered craft. He said the cra the craft that have been recovered are not of the earth. They&#x27;re not made by human hands.</p>
<p>They are not from this planet. They are not human. They are an alien technology. Again, uh I mentioned this before, but this was a direct uh reference like right out of the the memo he wrote after his meeting with Thomas Wilson over 20 years ago. I don&#x27;t think that was an accident.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t state directly he was the author of it but he directly quoted it. So um and then you know he said something else that was very very interesting. He talked about u one of the crash recoveries that we Americans got was in 1944. He said with the first recovery in Italy of a craft that crashed in Italy back in 1933 when and this is a a statement by Davis when the United States Army invaded Italy and pushed the Third Reich out they were able to recover that craft and bring it back to Wright airfield now uh right Patterson Air Force Base. And he also said the majority of the crash retrievals have gone to right airfield or right right Patterson.</p>
<p>Now that&#x27;s quite interesting, isn&#x27;t it? Because just a week ago we were all talking about this man here. This is Harold Malgren who interviewed with Jesse Michaels uh just before Harold Malgren died. And uh Harold Malgrim, if you uh you probably caught this last week, he was adviser to four United States presidents, a very brilliant economist who stumbled into the UFO reality himself way back in the 1960s, had a lot to say about it. And Malram also had uh quite a bit to say about that 1933 craft which we&#x27;ve acquired during toward the end of World War II. that corresponds exactly with what Eric Davis just said.</p>
<p>So, I really think that&#x27;s very interesting connection there. Uh, back to Eric Davis, he was not certain about the origins of these beings. He, you know, he&#x27;s he&#x27;s a lot like put off in this. I think he says, &quot;Whatever the word alien means, are they extraterrestrial? We don&#x27;t know. We don&#x27;t know.&quot; That&#x27;s a direct quote.</p>
<p>Uh the same with motivations. He really didn&#x27;t either want to or know what those motivations were. So he said, &quot;Look, we need anthropologists and social psychologists and philosophers to figure that out because they haven&#x27;t communicated their intentions according to Davis.&quot; Um and then uh another thing regarding the materials he just described analyzing the materials that the different contractors claimed that they&#x27;d had and that were being used in the legacy program. He said look they contain unknown or isotopes of unknown origin with unknown isotopic or isotopic ra ratios. Uh he really was emphasis these were compositions physically impossible to manufacture on earth.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s in his opinion. Uh, so and I think there&#x27;s one other thing that I wanted to get into here with Davis and that&#x27;s the entities. So he did talk about aliens and he didn&#x27;t go on and on about them but it was quite interesting. So he made some limited references to these biological entities associated with these UAP craft. Um he was actually asked specifically like whatever species have been uh been piloting these craft and how large are they and so forth.</p>
<p>And Davis actually stated he said people are talking about reptilians and insecttoids. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re reptilian or insect like it&#x27;s that they resemble a reptile or an insect type human because they have morphology or shapes. He said that kind of look kind of sort of look that way. They&#x27;re small human stature. And then he was asked a little bit more and he added, &quot;Well, the grays I&#x27;m familiar with from investigating the crash of Corona,&quot; he says, which is misnamed the crash of Roswell.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not the crash in Roswell, it&#x27;s a crash at Corona, a crash in New Mexico. He said they&#x27;re four to five feet tall. And he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard that the ones that are mislabeled reptilian and insect uh work roughly that height too are roughly that height too.&quot; He said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t I have not heard of any that are six feet or taller.&quot; So that in con that was basically all that he would say, but it was quite interesting. So small human stature that is four to 5t tall. Uh sometimes called the grays I think specifically from the corona crash.</p>
<p>Others get mischaracterized he said as reptilian or insecttoid due to their morphology but they&#x27;re not actually reptiles or insects but they are entities whose appearance resembles those forms. He didn&#x27;t really give any further physical descriptions beyond that but that was uh interesting for sure. So I&#x27;ll talk about just some of the other folks who spoke at this event yesterday. Uh Luis Alzando uh of course former ATIP leader described himself as he said I&#x27;ve been part of a lot of sensitive meetings both in the intelligence community and within the national security apparatus. Uh all true we&#x27;ve known all of that for a while.</p>
<p>Uh and he just stated bluntly that you know UFOs UAP I keep saying UFOs. Sorry, I keep saying UFOs. He said, &quot;Ua, UAP represent the greatest intelligence failure since 9/11, the cover up of our lifetime.&quot; Now, Lou Alzando did show a photograph of a UAP or a UFO during the presentation. I&#x27;m showing this. This is a better version from the uh X feed that the Fund for UA UAP disclosure put out.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s talk about this. So he what he said specifically is this this photograph I just received permission. He said cast by a civilian pilot. Now this is why it&#x27;s important. He said taken from a civilian pilot.</p>
<p>Uh the potentially the object he said is anywhere from 600 to,000 ft diameter. Uh he did emphasize though that he did not take the photograph and that it needed to be vetted. So we&#x27;ll just say that much. Then of course, not surprisingly, everyone just jumped in on this on this picture. Uh MC West, the debunker, uh said, &quot;Look, this is very likely, very common desert irrigation circles, uh irrigation pits.</p>
<p>We see them all the time and you&#x27;re flying over, especially out in the Midwest. You see them on there. Uh it&#x27;s not a flying object.&quot; And said the supposed shadow, it&#x27;s probably an adjacent field with a different coloration. uh creates an optical illusion of a hovering disc. Now, I&#x27;ll just say first of all, I am not going to jump into this fray.</p>
<p>If I were looking at it casually, I would say it looks exactly like a a hovering object with a shadow. And one of the reasons I would think that is that the uh if there were two irrigation pits, one of them looks like it&#x27;s blocking the road there. Uh the white one looks like it&#x27;s just covering up the road. Now, uh I&#x27;m sure that there are good skeptical answers to that. I don&#x27;t know what they are.</p>
<p>Um now, more to the point. All right. The consensus out there is that this is a standard irrigation pit. I mean, this has been mercilessly ridiculed and mocked online. Uh and you know, you really do have to acknowledge here.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, Lou did state he cannot vouch for the veracity of the photograph. He didn&#x27;t take it. This is not vetted. But you really have to think here. This is the second time that he has stepped into something like this.</p>
<p>Uh this happened uh about a year, less than a year ago with another photograph that was shown not to be an actual UFO. So, uh, you know, you really have to just recognize that this is a time for you&#x27;ve got to be careful when you&#x27;re putting evidence out there. Uh, this was not vetted. It is questionable evidence and clearly the skeptics are going to jump all over it. You&#x27;ve got representatives Luna and Berles.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re staking political capital on this briefing which included very significant claims about, you know, recovered non-aterrestrial craft uh NORAD detection capabilities. We&#x27;ll get to that. So, this distraction, that&#x27;s really what this looks like it could be, is very likely to overshadow testimonies from other witnesses who are describing important encounters. Tim Galedet&#x27;s one of them. you know, the admiral, he described some very well doumented Navy encounters and uh so I think, you know, this mistake is going to create exactly the ammunition that skeptics want, which is instead uh of where the focus should be, which is on the very substantial sensor data, multiple military witnesses, all the scientific analyses presented by other panelists.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re going to jump on this and dismiss the whole thing. uh the UAP disclosure movement cannot afford uh basic errors when you&#x27;re fighting decades of institutional resistance. I guess I&#x27;ll just leave that there. So, continuing onward, uh talk about Chris. Chris Melon always has interesting things to say on this matter in my opinion.</p>
<p>Melon was a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence. Uh so he spoke and he again he&#x27;s always on point I have to say. So it&#x27;s like UAP regularly penetrate US military airspace. He said often in militarily sensitive areas. That&#x27;s correct.</p>
<p>Uh without prior detection. Also the history on this is very very overwhelmingly clear. I&#x27;ve looked at this for 30 years myself. Uh Melon specifically mentioned the 2023 Arizona test range incidents. He said these were not isolated cases.</p>
<p>These were part of a pattern with troubling national security implications. Uh talked about NORAD verification of this. He said we need to pull this radar data to confirm UAP encounters. Basically saying look we&#x27;ve got all these satellites that are out there with outstanding detection capabilities. we&#x27;re not getting any of this data.</p>
<p>Why not? He says, &quot;NORAD has the ability to preserve this information, but it&#x27;s just not being properly analyzed or shared even with the government.&quot; Uh he talked about UAP over sensitive places including Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. He said, &quot;I talked to the sheriff and the deputy and he told me, I&#x27;ve never seen anything move that fast.&quot; That&#x27;s a direct quote from them. The witness was in the military reserves. um this particular witness and encountered what they described as a mother ship. And Melon said this is not just anecdotal.</p>
<p>He said if you look at the documentation from air uh air force office special investigation, the FBI and so forth, he says you will see written documentation from other witnesses that refers to a mothership. So, uh, and then talking about DoD video suppression, uh, Melon just said, &quot;Look, there&#x27;s no valid reason not to release the videos immediately since they are unclassified.&quot; He was very frustrated that important evidence is still being hidden despite all the proper clearances. He said, &quot;You can have any clearance in the government, but if you&#x27;re not uh in one of these programs, you don&#x27;t have a need to know. You&#x27;re not going to be told about it.&quot; So all very interesting. I think the the Langley mothership incident was particularly concerning to him.</p>
<p>Uh for him he says this was not just a story that I happened to hear. He said this was an officially documented case seen by multiple witnesses including law enforcement and military and yet it had minimal investigation. I also think that what Admiral Tim Galardet had to say was definitely noteworthy. Uh couple of very very interesting things here. Uh one he said the Navy possesses a trove of video evidence and data regarding UAP.</p>
<p>He said I see no reason why fleer footage of UAP in Navy training ranges could not be declassified and shared with the scientific community. That was interesting. He was a former Navy rear admiral. So Tim Galedet uh he he when he says things like this, you really got to you&#x27;ve got to take him seriously. He also revealed that crew members aboard the USS Gerald R.</p>
<p>Ford routinely documented UAP encounters with fleer systems. Um he said these incidents were widely discussed by the airwing during the entire deployment with footage systematically archived. Again we have more more testimony confirming that sailors have become he said desensitized to the phenomenon simply because of frequent encounters. So really quite quite remarkable. He also talked about speaking directly with a crew chief of the USS Dwight D.</p>
<p>Eisenhower uh who transferred fleer footage of UAP to the carriers intelligence officer in 2021 not long ago. This was not isolated. Uh the Eisenhower strike group documented uh Galedet said many many instances of UAP primarily seen by F-18s throughout their deployment. So really quite quite remarkable. Uh despite do um extensive documentation he said there was an unspoken understanding not to discuss them openly and that continues to this day.</p>
<p>He said u he was really quite emphatic here. He said a lot of this evidence u first of all locks does not have proper classification. He called for Congress to demand that the DoD, the Department of Energy, DHS, NASA release more UAP data for open science. So again, more confirmation from the admiral of what many expected substantial UAP evidence exists within naval archives ready for scientific examination. If only institutional stigma could be overcome.</p>
<p>Mike Gold spoke. Gold was at the previous UAP hearing back I think in November last year uh was one of the less compelling people for that but he was a little more interesting here. So he&#x27;s a uh he was a member of the NASA UAP independent study team and he just said look NASA archives have a lot of unanalyzed UAP imagery. He said I&#x27;d like to talk about some unclassified data and he&#x27;s presenting photos from NASA archives. He said, uh, there&#x27;s phenomena that have like a lunar horizon glow captured by multiple missions, including surveyors and, uh, you know, Apollo photographs, uh, triangular UAP formations that appear in the Apollo mission photography, which he, uh, you know, these are all publicly available shots.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have them, uh, for you here, apologies. But uh he just indicated there were a number of these anomalous images. Uh and also I think a little more on point he just said that these NASA UAP researchers faced explicit threats. He said particularly academic members of the NASA uh UAP independent study team were threatened outright threatened he said not for saying UAP exists or doesn&#x27;t exist but just for researching it. That&#x27;s the level of hostility he said.</p>
<p>He said like you you can&#x27;t do science in that environment. So he was really big on calling for congressional protection for researchers. And then um he had some other things just to say about the revolutionary technological implications. All I think all reasonable and all logical. Uh and then the rest there was uh others were all very interesting.</p>
<p>Kirk McConnell, um, a former staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee, a very, very interesting man, talked about, um, witness intimidation, whistleblower intimidation as one of the really big obstacles to full accountability and disclosure on this subject. He said, &quot;Look, there are people who are interested in coming forward with direct involvement in the legacy program of crash retrievalss, but they face threats and intimidation without enough legal protection.&quot; That&#x27;s a real problem. He he said, &quot;Look, these special access programs operate through presidential emergency action directives.&quot; That&#x27;s exactly what uh Eric Davis had said. uh and that these directives circumvent congressional oversight creating a massive blind spot in our supposedly democratic system. Uh Anna Estz, a former National Science Foundation program director was there saying that UF UAP research has already she said quietly revolutionized America American technology.</p>
<p>Very interesting for her to say that. She said, &quot;We funded companies working on materials, semiconductors, power generation, propulsion technology that were UAP adjacent or UAP inspired.&quot; Very interesting. And then meanwhile, she&#x27;s she&#x27;s saying like China openly is pursuing this research uh saying that Chinese officials list gravitational control and alien life among their scientific priorities at international conferences. And I&#x27;ll just uh state my website. I did a um a very deep dive into Chinese euphology.</p>
<p>I was just very interested in it. uh and I I took quite a lot of time out to go into this and uh really uncovered that very similar kinds of things about China&#x27;s approach to this that is a very uh for the Chinese military the people um liberation army that is engaged in this they are extremely organized and logical with how they are collecting UFO data and uh organizing it for their own scientific research. They seem to be taking it quite seriously. Just saying. Uh Dr.</p>
<p>Avi Loe of Harvard&#x27;s Galileo project attended this. He called for a 1 billion annual investment in UAP research funding. Uh he says, &quot;Look, we&#x27;re not at the technological pinnacle of cosmic civilization.&quot; And uh he said, &quot;Look, we need to figure out what is going on in our sky.&quot; So he just emphasized this investment would advance national security regardless of UAP origins while potentially delivering revolutionary scientific discoveries. You knew there was going to be a funding request in there somewhere, right? Uh but it was all very interesting. Uh there was a lot of talk or at least from Estz and Avi Loe I think stressing like the international competition aspect of this.</p>
<p>Uh, and you can kind of start to see some of the motivations that people are having for their own reasons for pushing forward UFO disclosure. You know, for years and years, uh, we, uh, researchers have said, well, we need it for, you know, public accountability, for democratic governance, uh, simply to know the truth so we can live in a world of truth, not lies. But we&#x27;re seeing now that we&#x27;re getting closer and closer uh to maybe something happening that very tangible motivations are are happening as well and they are related to technology and science and this is not to be uh that we should be surprised by frankly. So I think this the unprecedented briefing this is this was a very good briefing I have to say and and had bipartisan congressional support. So just another step down the road we have been going.</p>
<p>I mean this one had experts, you had academia, you had intelligence, you had military, you had NASA. So it really does show how public pressure and that is where this started can transform a stigmatized topic into legitimate national security and scientific concerns. So I think that was actually quite quite quite interesting and you know looking at the three major stories that emerge in a single week. We have the public revelation of the immaculate constellation whistleblower Matthew Brown the u very extensive interview by Halputoff on the Joe Rogan experience and now this uh fairly high level UAP briefing to Congress. We are witnessing a an unprecedented moment in UAP transparency or disclosure history.</p>
<p>I really do think that the sheer volume and quality of information being released suggests a coordinated shift in how this topic is being treated. uh all of this this testimony from this week. I was going to say stories, but they&#x27;re more than stories. They&#x27;re pieces of testimony that collectively I think they are representing some of the most significant and maybe authoritative public discussion of UAPs that we&#x27;ve ever seen. Of course, there was David Gush a couple of years ago, very, very significant.</p>
<p>And there have been some other public statements over time absolutely important but this is still quite significant. I think what makes this moment particularly remarkable is not just the breadth of information but the credibility of the sources. Again I really think this is important. You have military officials, you have government scientists, you have intelligence professionals, academicians all speaking with unusual cander about phenomena that were just until quite recently all considered this is all considered fringe. So all of this convergence of this very good quality information from credible multiple channels in such a compressed time frame this week.</p>
<p>Uh that&#x27;s an indication that we I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t want to overstate this because it absolutely might be incorrect here. But you have to wonder are we approaching a tipping point in the public acknowledgement of non-human intelligence? and its implications, you know, for well, national security, scientific advancement, and our own understanding of ourselves and our place in the cosmos. All of that all all that I can um add from this is for you to expect more debunking attempts and attacks. Uh this information is not value neutral, right? It has major implications for our society uh for our world and to a large extent how things work in our world. So always remember that there are people willing to defend their interests in this battle.</p>
<p>So don&#x27;t be surprised that they fight back. But we still keep coming at them as well. So it&#x27;s interesting times and I&#x27;m glad to share this with you. Those three videos were probably uh nearly eight hours long, more than seven hours. I try to do the whole thing in about an hour for you.</p>
<p>But I do encourage you to check them out at your leisure if you have not already. I will have links for them below. So if you like this video, you know, hit the like button, share it, subscribe to my channel here, check out my website at richarddolanmembers.com. I&#x27;ll be back soon again. Let&#x27;s keep fighting the good fight.</p>
