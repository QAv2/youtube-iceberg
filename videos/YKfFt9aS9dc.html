            <p>introducing the 0 point generator hi my name is Urus I&#x27;m the electrical and electronics engineer with over 50 years experience mostly in power generation telecommunications and it I&#x27;ve always been very interested in cheap energy production especially from the socalled Zero Point Energy if you&#x27;re familiar with quantum mechanics you&#x27;ll be aware that according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle space is a wash in a sea of electromagnetic fluctuations or energy now previously this energy has been inaccessible but now I have done just that with this 0 point generator I&#x27;m now able to tap into this previously untappable source of power space time energy and matter were all created at the Big Bang space is required to contain everything within the universe if there was no space there would be no energy and no Universe before the Big Bang there was absolutely nothing there was not even any empty space now this is a difficult concept to understand but it is vital in understanding the operation off my machine this device causes a repetitive Rift in A Spacetime Continuum around its receiver or antenna a small volume of space is compressed causing the energy in that space to be directed into the [Applause] machine I&#x27;ll now show you the various components that make up the system obviously the main one is the zero point generator I&#x27;ll show it you from all angles at the front we have a special rotor I&#x27;ll explain this purpose for later at the back we have the energy receiver or antenna this is made from a very dense tungsten alloy for the generator to work this has to be screwed down into the machine to make contact with the magnetic field inside this is the electrical board which is connected to the generator I&#x27;ll show it to you from all angles again there&#x27;s nothing really special about it now this contains several modules firstly one of these modules determines when there sufficient power coming from the generator it then turns on the other modules which convert the Ral power into 240 Vol electricity at this power point I will now connect everything together firstly we place the generator on the board so that it doesn&#x27;t go walk about when it&#x27;s running now we plug in the connectors we now need to load for this purpose we we&#x27;re using these four 240 R globes that I connect them in parallel to a lead and the plug I&#x27;ll plug it into the PowerPoint now the PowerPoint is on but the lights are off because the generator is not working to start a generator where to screw in the receiver then give it a manual turn the generator will now speed up until it develops enough power to activate modules and provide electricity this generator will work indefinitely with no cost and no maintenance I&#x27;ll now turn off the PowerPoint unplug the lights and I&#x27;ll now plug in something that requires a bit more power this domestic heater will do [Applause] fine I&#x27;ll plug it in turn the PowerPoint on and I also need to turn on the switch on the heater I&#x27;ll set it to maximum and there we go this will now heat the home indefinitely now you may have noticed that I turned the PowerPoint off a couple of times while the generator was working this is not really recommended for an extended period of time when a generator is working we should always use the generated power if there&#x27;s no load the generator power will simply start warming up the generator it&#x27;ll overheat and eventually self-destruct so if no power is required we have to turn a generator off by removing its source of energy which is the receiver the generator will now stop I&#x27;ll now try to explain the operation of this device in a bit more detail basically it consists of two hearts at the back we have the energy receiver and motor at the front and mounted on the same axle is the power generator now the main component of the motor is its Central amature which consists of an intricate array of various sized neod magnets mounted rad in a precise Fibonacci Sequence during rotation this causes a repeated magnetization and demagnetization of a volume of space around this receiver and antenna now magnetism as well as gravity will warp space and that&#x27;s what happens at the receiver antenna a tiny bit of space is repeatedly collapsed and then expanded at the frequency of rotation now during the collapsing phase the energy contained within a space has nowhere to go except through the receiver into the machine where it is dissipated as a turning Force now this device is only possible because of the very precise arrangement of the magnets in the Fibonacci pattern now I can prove this and demonstrate the production of the SpaceTime Anomaly by doing a f a transform of the Fibonacci modified agorian fluctuations and then applying some serious mathematics but that would be outside a scope of a simple presentation now rotation of the amateure is what provides the energy transfer initially the armateur is stationary so nothing that happen so to start a process it is necess NE to manually turn the amateure by spinning the rotor then at every turn another pulse of energy goes into the machine and it begins to turn faster and faster until it reaches its Optimum rotational speed at this point there&#x27;s more energy going in than is required to turn a machine this excess energy can now be channeled out through the generator part and converted into usable 24 electricity at the PowerPoint now one interesting factor is that all energy tries to escape this is called entropy energy does not want to do any work unless it&#x27;s absolutely unavoidable therefore the energy pulses that go into the machine try to escape by the quickest possible route which is through the center of machine and out through the front if this is allowed to happen the machine will not work because there&#x27;ll be no power to turn amateure to solve this problem I&#x27;ve fitted this rad door on the front this contains two high strength magnets which during rotation creates an efficient magnetic Shield which bounces the energy pulses back into the machine where they stay until they are used up as a rotational Force now this machine is only a prototype I built this to do illustrate the operational principles it&#x27;ll only put out a limited amount of power but it is fully scalable a 10 KW machine can easily be built to power a whole house or a many megawatt machine to power a whole town now one point I mentioned earlier is that while a machine is working it is always producing power and this power must be used therefore in typical household situation would have to incorporate a load monitoring system that would automatically switch in power wasting devices such as heat Banks when the power requirements for the house were low if this is not done the unused energy will overheat the generator and eventually it will self distra well that&#x27;s about it we now have an unlimited supply of free energy [Music] [Music]</p>
