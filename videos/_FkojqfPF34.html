            <p>Is it possible that the ceramics we found in the drilling spoils are superconductors and are covering whatever the objects are inside the mesa. Gentlemen, what would this mean for science? &gt;&gt; It could have very, very wide reaching implications. It could possibly unlock new methods of propulsion and energy that we haven&#x27;t understood yet. We get the majority of our energy from burning things and something like this could really set us on a completely different course for the future which I think is one of the things that&#x27;s so exciting about it. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; In fact, whatever it is that&#x27;s concealed within that messa. All of our fragments that have been retrieved indicate that they may once have been part of a structure. &gt;&gt; So hopefully we&#x27;ll get to the bottom of it and we&#x27;ll learn more about what&#x27;s [music] what&#x27;s in the mason.</p>
