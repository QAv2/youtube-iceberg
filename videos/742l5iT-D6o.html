            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Did you know Tesla&#x27;s wireless energy transmission was successfully proven in 1899, then mysteriously buried forever? At Colorado Springs, Nicola Tesla wirelessly powered light bulbs from 25 m away. His patent 64576 and 649621 were allegedly classified by the patent office immediately after filing. JP Morgan funded Tesla&#x27;s Warden Cliff Tower project until he realized the wireless energy meant no metered electricity profits. Morgan pulled funding overnight. The lab mysteriously burned down in 1917.</p>
<p>When Tesla died in 1943, FBI agents seized all his papers within hours. Government documents allegedly classified his death patents for national security. Today&#x27;s wireless charging is primitive compared to Tesla&#x27;s suppressed technology. One man&#x27;s invention could have given humanity free energy, but corporate interests buried it forever.</p>
