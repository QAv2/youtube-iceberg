            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel and uh this channel is for educational purposes we generally try to look at uh latest and greatest theories of everything and uh Paradigm shif shifting uh research uh usually done uh long ago and uh by people who you&#x27;ve never heard of or uh haven&#x27;t heard of enough and uh today is video number 341 on dwey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory and U Mr larsson&#x27;s uh theory was uh called the reciprocal system um in it he posited that we live in a universe that is made out out of motion and uh motion for Larson was the relationship between space and time that yields a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time hence the name the reciprocal system and uh you can think of uh space and time neither one of them has uh an independent existence they only exist together in motion and uh they both have three dimensions they both have oh that&#x27;s what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time they both have a scalar component meaning that they uh have possess a motion that has no specific Direction uh but it had does have a magnitude um you would model that using or you could model that using a balloon with dots on it as you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction the direction doesn&#x27;t arise until you assign a reference point once you decide that one of the dots is motionless then then you can determine directions um so the directions are related to the reference point not to the motion itself uh another way of modeling this if you want to add an extra dimension in the interior would be just like your uh raisin bread in the oven as you heat the bread and it rises all of the raisins are going to be moving away from each other but again in no specific Direction uh this is also uh what this is what Larson calls clock time and clock space the clock is always getting later and later and later but it&#x27;s not moving in any specific Direction and then clock space is uh you know a motion in time outward um everything is always getting farther and farther and farther apart which was actually observed by the Hubble telescope that determined uh that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other um and unless we are willing to um say that our galaxy is at the center uh then that would also mean that our galaxy is participating in that Mo motion as well away from all other galaxies then uh time and space also have um their discrete unit aspect meaning that time and space only come in discrete units quantized they there is a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have anything and um if you have one unit of space in one unit of time then you have the speed of light speed is space over time the car is moving 20 miles per hour 20 mil of space and 1 hour of time but if you have one unit of space and one unit of time you have the speed of light which is what Larsson calls unit speed 1 over one equals 1 and this unit speed for Larsson is really like the background of the universe or the null point the zero point the origin The Ether the um reference point of this universe so half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light and half is moving slower you can think of this in terms of uh reciprocal um you know if you uh when you have a reciprocal this is implying a multiplicative relationship the uh kind of pairs of opposite of reciprocals they multip mly to one whereas in Legacy science they&#x27;re using an additive system where the the uh opposites uh they add to zero so in a in leg a legacy system you know they&#x27;re measuring from zero from stationary and it could be+ 1 plus 2+ 3 + 4 uh and then on the negative end it would be - one - 2 - 3 - 4 but with a reciprocal system you have one in the center not zero one unit speed the speed of light is at the center and then on one side uh of opposites you would have two 3 4 and five and on the other side you would have 1/ 12 1/3 1/4 and 1/5 so the two opposites when they come together they multiply to make one as opposed to adding to make zero so this is a kind of a a higher power of a system it&#x27;s uh multiplicative as opposed to additive and uh so Larson basically put together that first postulate that&#x27;s uh his First Fundamental postulate his second fundamental postulate is basically that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics it&#x27;s primary ABS primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian uh and there is some dispute about that particular postulate that we will get into here very shortly but uh those two postulates he started with and he basically said well if the universe operates according to those principles then what what does this universe look like what is my theoretical Universe composed of and um so he went through a process of deduction uh to figure that out uh if you want to look at my old videos go back about 9 months or 10 months and um you&#x27;ll see that I did about 15 videos called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system this is where Larson goes through really like 165 steps of his reasoning process to get from his fundamental postulates to a theoretical Universe then with his books he he basically compared his theoretical Universe with the Legacy scientists uh view of the universe and and usually they come up with the same results uh in terms of all the Newtonian um questions he really just kind of affirms uh Newton&#x27;s laws um except that he provides the concepts also behind those those equations and then in the relativistic areas of the very small the very large and the Very uh uh what did I say small large and fast um they um diverge from Newtonian mechanics in the same way that Einstein&#x27;s do uh but again um he he he comes up with better results than Einstein because he provides the concepts and uh that underly the math even when lar uh even when Einstein has the math right he doesn&#x27;t have the concepts right and in many cases he doesn&#x27;t have the math right either uh he he often is just uh borrowing the math from people like minkowski and um Loren um and um so Larson is an entire entirely an improvement uh as far as uh getting results and so people can you know often say that oh this doesn&#x27;t make any sense I don&#x27;t get the space and time you know at reciprocals of each other um but Larson is able to produce results and that&#x27;s uh he was able to derive many of the basic properties of matter strictly from theory he can tell you he has equations that can tell you what the boiling point of nitrogen is or what the you know freezing point or or the specific heat or the you know the um uh compressibility of everyone of the uh atoms in the periodic table as well as many comp pounds as well um and he also was able to do make a lot of predictions of things that hadn&#x27;t even been discovered yet such as the existence of quazars and their qualities Larson was able to predict uh the existence of quazars uh several years before they were actually dis discovered um so you know he&#x27;s able to produce results sometimes you&#x27;re not really able to uh discern all of the steps of his deductions unless you really understand the theory quite well um and so that&#x27;s kind of where I am uh I&#x27;m I&#x27;m starting to understand the theory a lot better even though I&#x27;ve been studying it for over 20 years um and um some of it start starting to make sense where it didn&#x27;t before um but you just have to kind of grind away at it because it&#x27;s very unfamiliar Concepts and um you know you have to unlearn a lot of the science that you learned beforehand which is one of the mistakes that Larson made as he kind of targeted his theory toward the scientist and he probably should have targeted to toward the lay person because the lay person would have been more receptive to it um the scientists rejected it out of hand in general there&#x27;s very few scientists who are open-minded enough to kind of admit that they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about and that this other person has a has an angle that is fruitful so uh and you know that&#x27;s historically you know documented by Thomas in his structures of the Scientific Revolution uh which uh came out about the same time that Larson was making many of his findings in the early 1960s okay now what we&#x27;re doing today um apolog for yesterday&#x27;s video I just had uh kind of had to shut it down cuz my phone just shut off after I got that Amber Alert uh and um so we&#x27;re going to take over here in uh part three of um this article that was written by Dr Bruce pet who is one of uh larsson&#x27;s Chief um revisers and uh followers and revisers in meaning that he follows the Spirit of Larson&#x27;s work but he did correct a number of Larson&#x27;s mistakes uh LaRon uh contended that his theory was correct but whether he applied it correctly in all situations um was uh dubious and that he he was sure that he made some errors and that he would looked forward to people coming along and correcting those uh over time and I think that&#x27;s what Dr Bruce pret has done along with Dr kbk neru they came up with something that&#x27;s called rs2 the reciprocal system to the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system and uh we&#x27;re looking at uh one of his kind of primers of the reciprocal system 2 called rs211 and uh again if you want to go back to the start uh go back two episodes and uh you&#x27;ll get the start now he was actually going over the postulates in this article he kind of Compares um it&#x27;s called creating a theory and he Compares two different approaches uh one is the natural approach where you&#x27;re looking at nature uh nature um uh can be determined uh the natural law can be determined through obser ation of how the natural law operates uh that is one way of uh creating a theory and the other is through uh an artificial process uh which is determined by Commandments how you want the universe to operate and so he&#x27;s making various uh delineations based on whether uh this is an observation or is this a commandment and um he really is determining that the first postulate the universe is made out of motion and uh motion comes in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time that is an observation um and therefore natural law whereas the second postulate is a commandment uh that is artificial so um he he pet does reject a lot of the first of the second postulate especially the part about the ukian geometry okay uh let&#x27;s start with his writing right here his second postulate is commandment on the way things behave in his artificial reality man&#x27;s law the physical this is uh he&#x27;s quoting then Larson here the physical Universe conforms to the law laws of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian here Larson includes other artificial realities that of the communative subset of consensus mathematics and the consensus reality created by uid regarding geometry if you notice there are no observations here Larson is laying down the law on how to interpret his artificial reality a commandment the primary magnitude Clause is borrowed from Newton&#x27;s observation that quote any object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by a force combining Newton&#x27;s observation with his own observation of speed as the sole component of the universe a constant magnitude of speed was required in order for the system to work if speed varied then the elements of the periodic table would bounce around changing from one element to another as the speeds changed this did not match observation iron stays iron and doesn&#x27;t suddenly become aluminum so the underlying magnitude the primary one defining the structure must be absolute okay this section is called the beginning this paper focused on upon the basic nature of reality and how we create the world we choose to live in it shows how dwey B Larson used the concepts of observation natural law and from that created an artificial reality that responds to his rules man&#x27;s law set to paper to create a theory known as the reciprocal system of physical Theory larsson&#x27;s theory has never gained consensus status except as a conscious act between a few individuals even then there are still many disagreements over the interpret ation of Larson&#x27;s Theory because those involved do not have the same premises that Larson did while developing his artificial reality in 1996 professor professor kvk neru of India and Dr Bruce peret of these uh United States of America started a re-evaluation of larsson&#x27;s work in hopes to clarify some of the contended points which led to a second attempt to define a universe of motion an improved artificial reality called rs2 that is on its way to Theory status with these papers okay um that wraps it up with that paper so I was a lot closer to the end that I uh originally thought um let me just uh read one of these footnotes here originally Larson referred to motion as SpaceTime but that led to confusion with conventional Theory as well as his own use of time space to re uh to represent the region of extension space okay so um I think he goes through this in the second paper uh a little bit more in detail but in larsson&#x27;s first postulate originally you know he uh he he said the universe is made out of SpaceTime um which you know was in discrete units and um in three dimensions and and space and time were reciprocally related but after a fashion I think really almost 20 years he changed the SpaceTime in the postulate to motion eventually toward the end of his life he actually used the term um change in three dimensions so he went from SpaceTime to motion to just change in three dimensions so that shows a little bit of of Larson evolution of his thinking or maybe just of his ability to kind of communicate his Concepts uh I&#x27;m not sure that he changed SpaceTime just because it wasn&#x27;t the word he was looking for but more that it didn&#x27;t um people didn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t translate to to people as well as maybe motion did and then eventually change in three dimension ions okay now just toward the end here we&#x27;d like I&#x27;d like to just give you an overview of where we&#x27;re headed um we are tomorrow we&#x27;re going to start uh Pet&#x27;s second primer paper here called rs212 and this is on his fundamental postulates so we&#x27;re going to be going over kind of the history of Larson&#x27;s fundamental postulates in this paper um you know and how uh you know an extension of what we just talked about how his postulates evolved over time and um then pet will weigh in with his his uh contribution about um what&#x27;s wrong with the postulates and how he would change them in his theory and um then we also get into larsson&#x27;s metaphysical postulates because the the fundamental postulates of the reciprocal system only Define a phys a physical Theory but um there is uh in observation there are things that are that go beyond the physical and uh such as life um and uh related phenomena uh where the physical uh generally abides by the um law of entropy uh Things become more and more chaotic life operates in the opposite direction uh where things become more and more organized and so he has a separate set of postulates for what he calls uh metaphysical postulates um and so we&#x27;ll be going into that in the second paper I believe pet has nine of these primers uh on um rs2 uh introduction to rs2 so we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll learn those in the next couple weeks and I think after that we&#x27;re going to end up going into Larson&#x27;s book on economics he has two books on economics uh coming from the same general uh postulates and how he applies it to economics is pretty interesting he&#x27;s got got two books on economics we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll probably just look at one of them uh which is called the road to permanent prosperity and so um if you want to get rich you just listen continue to listen to this um and the other one is called the road to Full Employment um and then um we&#x27;re going to try to get into one of larsson&#x27;s works on chemistry uh that is called basic properties of matter which I alluded to earlier where he takes many of the basic properties of matter and he deres them strictly from Theory and then Compares his results to the tables uh scientific tables and so on um it&#x27;s a very interesting study even though it&#x27;s a little bit uh certainly a little bit over my head uh as far as um you know delving into matters of chemistry and also into to uh very abstract Theory some in some cases but I think it&#x27;s still very instructive and that&#x27;s how you just have to take larsson&#x27;s work and the reciprocal system in general is that uh sometimes you&#x27;re going to get lost sometimes you&#x27;re not going to be able to figure out what&#x27;s going on or what he&#x27;s talking about you just have to deal with it you just have to keep moving forward and you know save your criticisms for after you&#x27;ve done reading don&#x27;t don&#x27;t just put it down because it dis he says something that disagrees with something that you that you already know to be true uh just just um suspend disbelief long enough to hear him out and then you can criticize him after you&#x27;ve heard his whole statement but the thing is that usually you&#x27;re not able to really have a good angle to criticize Larson until you&#x27;ve read several of his books BS because sometimes it appears as if Larson is just pulling things out of his hat like just where is he getting this from um but then you see that he&#x27;s he&#x27;s applying it consistently in all Fields you know he&#x27;s he&#x27;s using the same rules to apply to the atom as he is to the Galaxy and so um but you can&#x27;t really see that until you&#x27;ve had a certain depth of understanding of Larson&#x27;s work so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying to be very uh thorough in going through many different aspects of larsson&#x27;s work to see that he&#x27;s covering these consistently and even though I&#x27;ve done 341 videos now on this uh I still haven&#x27;t even you know um uh uh scratch the surface on a number of important uh things that Larsson uh that Larson uses such as uh the inter Regional ratio I think I scratched the surface but barely on that and um also his uh you know kind of how he came up with a periodic table um uh how he&#x27;s using different uh the Quant quantization of motion and that he uses that consistently um and uh um the the the um mathematical differences between um between space and equivalent space and um many other kind of uh things that he uses in multiple books but you don&#x27;t really uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s difficult to tell that unless you&#x27;ve read multiple books if you just think he&#x27;s using it for one thing you&#x27;re you&#x27;re just kind of like oh he&#x27;s just making this up so he gets the right answers but then he uses it for another thing and he gets the right answers for that too so um we will look into all that in the next uh in the next uh time period going forward uh thanks for tuning in today and I hope to see you tomorrow have a great day</p>
