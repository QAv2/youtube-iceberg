            <p>What if reality isn&#x27;t happening to you but happening because of you? Quantum physics revealed something baffling. The observer effect. The very act of watching changes what is being watched. Not only in experiments but in your everyday life. Your attention is not passive.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a hidden architect. The thoughts you feed quietly build the walls around you. The fears you repeat become the path beneath your feet. Now pause and imagine. If simply shifting your attention can bend reality, what else could it rewrite? A decision, a timeline, a destiny.</p>
<p>You are not just a witness. You are the very force around which creation bends. Watch the full video and see the unseen.</p>
