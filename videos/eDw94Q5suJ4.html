            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What if you could heat your home with something? Something that makes even our best systems today look well pretty inefficient. Mhm. And imagine that tech not just heating houses but maybe uh powering whole industries changing everything. It&#x27;s a tantalizing idea, isn&#x27;t it? And it&#x27;s kind of at the heart of this press release that dropped May 1st, 2025. Right.</p>
<p>So today we&#x27;re doing a deep dive into that announcement. It&#x27;s from Cool Fusion Inc. and uh hydrogen engineering application and development company. Exactly. They&#x27;re talking about a prototype, a room temperature nuclear fusion heater.</p>
<p>And the number that really, you know, grabs your attention is 2 kW of heat out for just 400 watts of electricity in. Okay. 2 kwatt is out, 400W in. Now, for anyone who&#x27;s followed fusion, the words cold fusion might set off some alarms maybe, but this sounds different. They&#x27;re calling it COP 5.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the core idea here? Well, what&#x27;s really interesting is the claim itself achieving nuclear fusion, you know, the sun&#x27;s power source, but doing it at relatively low temperatures, not the millions of degrees we usually hear about, right? Not plasma fusion. No, exactly. This prototype apparently uses light hydrogen reactions. It&#x27;s a totally different ballgame from high temperature plasma fusion. And crucially, they say it&#x27;s safe and produces zero CO2 while running.</p>
<p>Zero CO2. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s a huge claim if it holds up. Absolutely. If it&#x27;s validated, it&#x27;s a massive shift from how we generate energy now. And this wasn&#x27;t just a quick lab test, was it? The release mentions it ran for quite a while.</p>
<p>Yeah, they stayed it operated stably for 5 months. Uh that was from November 2024 through March 2025. 5 months is pretty substantial. It is. And the core component, this heat module Ver.1, it&#x27;s surprisingly small.</p>
<p>Like 7 cm diameter, 30 cm long. Basically a small tube. Wow. Okay. Inside it&#x27;s got sealed light hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>The idea is you heat this module up initially to maybe 300 500 Celsius and then it just keeps generating heat. Okay. A compact self-sustaining heat source. Let&#x27;s get back to that COP 5 label. Coefficient of performance.</p>
<p>Yeah. Five. We hear COP figures for heat pumps and ACs. How good is five really? All right. So COP tells you how much useful energy you get for the energy you put in.</p>
<p>A cop of five. Well, it means this thing is pumping out five times more heat energy than the electrical energy it uses. Five times. Five times. 2,000 watts out divided by the 400 watts input.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s your five. Okay. Five times the output. That just sounds incredibly efficient. The press release even contrasts this with the big ongoing high temperature fusion projects.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the takeaway there? That comparison really highlights how potentially groundbreaking this could be. You know, these huge international fusion projects like IDER. They&#x27;re still fighting just to reach COP 1. COP 1 meaning break even. Energy out equals energy in.</p>
<p>Exactly. just break even and getting positive energy gain reliably from hot fusion. Well, the target for that is often cited as maybe 20, 50, you know, decades away, decades, right? So, claiming COP 5 now, even in a prototype, it suggests a fundamentally different, maybe much, much more efficient path to fusion energy. It&#x27;s a massive leap if it&#x27;s real. So, for someone listening thinking about, say, their winter heating bill, how does COP 5 translate? What does that mean compared to my existing furnace or heat pump? Well, the press release puts a number on it.</p>
<p>They claim approximately 64% electricity cost savings compared to conventional air conditioning heating. 64%. Yeah. So, think about your heating costs in the coldest months. Imagine cutting them by nearly 2/3.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s well, that&#x27;s real money staying in your pocket, isn&#x27;t it? That&#x27;s a very tangible benefit. Okay. So, beyond just the raw efficiency, are there other advantages they&#x27;re talking about? things that would make life easier or better. Yes, definitely. They list quite a few potential pluses.</p>
<p>First, uh they claim no fuel exchange is needed for about 10 years. Just one hydrogen fill lasts a decade. 10 years. No refueling. That&#x27;s the claim.</p>
<p>Imagine not worrying about oil deliveries or gas lines or anything for 10 years. Second, stability. It&#x27;s reportedly unaffected by outdoor temperature. Uh unlike my heat pump, which struggles when it gets really cold. Exactly.</p>
<p>Heat pumps can lose a lot of efficiency in deep freezes. This promises consistent warmth no matter what. Then there&#x27;s the zero CO2 we mentioned, which is obviously a big environmental plus, right? And finally, noise. They say it operates below 40 dB. That&#x27;s about 10 dB quieter than many conventional air conditioners.</p>
<p>So, uh, pretty quiet operation. Wow. 10 years, stable heat, quiet, clean. That sounds like a pretty compelling package, right? So, what&#x27;s the plan? How do they get this from a prototype to, you know, something real that people can use? They&#x27;ve laid out a three-phase road map. Phase one, that&#x27;s roughly 2025 to 2027, is about demonstrating and optimizing it primarily as an industrial heat source.</p>
<p>Industrial first. Yeah. Especially what they call socially significant areas. Think emergency power sources for disasters or heating support in extremely cold regions where conventional systems fail. Sort of proving grounds.</p>
<p>Okay, makes sense. Then what? Phase two running from about 2028 to 2030 is focused on developing actual thermal power generation systems based on this tech. So generating electricity. Ah okay. Moving towards grid power potentially.</p>
<p>And then phase three from 2030 onwards that&#x27;s the broader expansion getting it into various other industrial applications and importantly deploying it internationally. So it starts specialized moves to power generation and then maybe eventually into our homes and businesses. That seems to be the long-term vision. If you think about the impact on your life, initially it might mean more reliable power during storms or maybe your local factory uses less energy. Okay, then if the power generation phase works out, maybe more stable, lower electricity prices down the line and eventually, yes, maybe you could have one of these compact, superefficient units heating your home, giving you those big cost savings.</p>
<p>And they mentioned wider impacts, too. Right. Dr. Dr. Mazuno, who&#x27;s behind a lot of the research, talks about the potential to tackle global energy problems, help achieve carbon neutrality, and maybe even reduce economic disparities by providing affordable clean energy more broadly.</p>
<p>Okay, let&#x27;s talk about Dr. Mazuna. The press release highlights his contribution. Who is he? Dr. Tatiko Mazuno.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s apparently dedicated 35 years to researching cold fusion or uh low energy nuclear reactions. He&#x27;s seen as a leading figure with expertise across electrochemistry, physics, a wide range. 35 years is a long time. It really is. It shows this isn&#x27;t some overnight thing.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s got international recognition, too. Received the Giuliano Preparata Medal back in 2004, other awards. So, there&#x27;s a long history of serious research there. And Cool Fusion, Inc., They&#x27;re the company led by CEO Riyosuk Okada that seems committed to actually commercializing this research, taking it out of the lab to try and solve, you know, real world energy issues. It&#x27;s interesting, isn&#x27;t it, the contrast you mentioned earlier? This relatively smallcale effort compared to the massive multi-billion dollar international projects for hot fusion.</p>
<p>Absolutely. The difference in development scale and cost is stark. Hot fusion needs these enormous, incredibly complex, hugely expensive facilities, right? This kind of cold fusion research, well, as this prototype shows, it can potentially be done in much smaller labs with far less investment. That could mean, well, it could mean a faster, more accessible path to actually getting fusion energy working, potentially sidestepping some of those monumental engineering hurdles. H okay, so let&#x27;s try and bring this all together.</p>
<p>We have this COP 5 cold fusion tech announcement. If the claims are accurate, it&#x27;s potentially a huge leap in efficiency. Way beyond current heating, way beyond even where hot fusion hopes to be for decades. That&#x27;s the core claim. Yes, a cop of five is the headline.</p>
<p>And it comes with a package of other benefits. No refilling for years, stable heat regardless of weather, zero emissions during operation, quieter running, a whole suite of practical advantages potentially. And there&#x27;s a road map starting with industrial and emergency uses moving towards power generation and then wider deployment. a phased approach aiming for significant impact across different sectors. So the potential impact on your life could be pretty significant from lower bills and more comfort right up to contributing to well a cleaner energy future overall.</p>
<p>Precisely. The implications if this pans out are considerable ranging from your household budget to uh global sustainability efforts. It&#x27;s definitely something we need to watch closely. So maybe here&#x27;s a final thought for you listening. If this breakthrough is real and if that timeline holds even roughly true, what do you think the biggest changes could be? How might your daily life in the energy world around you look different in say the next 10 years because of something like this? It&#x27;s certainly food for thought.</p>
<p>Definitely, we encourage you to look more into clean energy tech and uh keep an eye on what comes next from Cool Fusion Inc. and Dr. Mizuno&#x27;s work.</p>
