            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>have you faced any retaliation or arrivals for any of your testimony or anything on these lines yeah uh I have to be careful what I say in detail because there is an open uh whistleblower reprisal investigation on my behalf and I don&#x27;t want to compromise that investigation by providing anything that may uh help provide somebody information but it was very brutal and very unfortunate some of the tactics they used to hurt me both professionally and and personally to be quite Frank yeah do you have any personal knowledge of people have been harmed or injured in efforts to cover up or conceal these extraterrestrial technology yes personally have you heard have anyone been murdered that you would think that you know of or have heard of I guess I have to be careful asking that question I directed people with that knowledge to the appropriate authorities um Mr grush what about you what was your experience after you came forward well uh it&#x27;s only been about two months or so so I guess my experience has been you know overwhelming support from uh former colleagues of mine that have you know privately messaged me and and I do appreciate that uh but I I do have knowledge of um active planned reprisal activity against myself and other colleagues and it&#x27;s very very upsetting to me coming from where uh certain senior leadership at previous agencies I was associated with and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say publicly but I can provide more details in a closed environment yeah there were certain colleagues of mine that were brutally administratively attacked and it you know actually makes me very upset as a leader to see that happen to other co-workers and actually superiors of mine over the last three years how do you account for that response that seems like a bizarre response I called administrative terrorism that&#x27;s their their quiver their tool in the toolbox to silence people especially you know the career government service cares about their career cares about their clearance uh their reputation to climb the ladder and when you threaten that float career path a lot of people back off but I&#x27;m here to represent those people um to your knowledge are nhis working with adversarial foreign governments in either technology exchange programs or back engineering programs I don&#x27;t have data on that I&#x27;m not sure have you heard or you had people come forward to present that evidence not that particular evidence that you just espoused okay on the 19th of April Dr Kirkpatrick head of Arrow had said that he did not find any evidence of uaps you also stated that you had in your interview that you had briefed him on information that you were uncovering but that he did not follow up with you were the items that you divulged to him pertin to National Security yes him and I had a classified conversation in April 2022 before he took over arrow in the July to 2022 and I provided him some concerns I had do you know why he might not have fallen up with you uh unfortunately I cannot read his mind I wish he did I was I was happy to give Sage counsel to him on where to look when he took the Helm of Arrow okay and then my last question for you before I moved to Mr Graves is um you received prior approval from the defense department to speak on certain issues correct correct through dobster DOD pre-publication and Security review and I just want to remind the public they&#x27;re just looking from a security perspective these are my own personal views and opinions not the Departments okay I&#x27;m asking that though mainly because I think that there are many people that would like to discredit you so it does bring a certain amount of credibility to your testimony I&#x27;m required by law to do that as a Former Intelligence officer or I go to jail for revealing classified information yeah we don&#x27;t want you to go to jail Mr grush as a result of your previous government work have you met with people with direct knowledge or have direct knowledge yourself of non-human origin craft yes I personally interviewed those individuals Mr grush as a result of your previous government work have you met with people with direct knowledge or have direct knowledge yourself about ATS Advanced Technologies that the US government has uh based on conventional Advanced Tech I was briefed to the preponderance of the defense departments both space and Aerospace compartment of programs yeah do you have knowledge or do you have reason to believe that there are programs in the advanced Tech space that are unsanctioned yes I do okay yeah and when you say that they&#x27;re above congressional oversight what do you mean uh complicated question uh so there&#x27;s you know some I would call it abuse here so Congressional oversight of conventional special access programs so I&#x27;ll use title 10 so DOD as an example right so 10 U.S code section 119 discusses congressional oversight of saps discusses uh the the depth SEC def&#x27;s ability to waive Congressional reporting however the gang of eight is at least supposed to be notified if a you know waived or wave bigoted I&#x27;d acknowledged sap is created and that&#x27;s Public Law well so that how does I mean I don&#x27;t want to cut you off but how does a program like that get funded I will give you generalities I can get very specific in a closed session uh but a misappropriation of funds and uh does that mean does that mean that there is money in the budget that is set to go to a program but it doesn&#x27;t and it goes to something else yes I have specific knowledge of that yep do you think U.S corporations are over over charging for certain Tech they&#x27;re selling to the US government and that additional money is going to programs correct through something called irad okay um satellite imagery let&#x27;s talk about satellite imagery we have satellites all over the place some that we&#x27;re aware of and many that we&#x27;re not aware of right we&#x27;re taking pictures of everything at every point in second uh Mr grush are you aware do you have direct knowledge we talked to people direct knowledge that there are satellite imagery of these events uh that was one of my primary tasks at NGA since we uh process exploit and disseminate that kind of information I&#x27;ve seen multiple cases some of which to my understanding and of course I left NG in April so that&#x27;s my information cut off date uh but I personally um reviewed both uh what we call Overhead collection and from other strategic and tactical platforms that were I could not even explain prosaically and I have a degree in physics by the way as well and I had I I&#x27;m aware that you guys have not seen these um reports unfortunately and I don&#x27;t know why it is do you have direct knowledge we had spoken people with direct knowledge that this imagery applies to crash sites crash crash imagery I can&#x27;t discuss that in an open session okay uh do you have any information that the US government is involved in a disinformation campaign to deny the existence of certain uaps I can&#x27;t go beyond what I&#x27;ve already stated publicly in my news Nation interview because it touches other sensitivities okay as a U.S government become aware of actual evidence of extraterrestrial otherwise unexplained forms of intelligence and if so when do you think this first occurred I like to use the term non-human I don&#x27;t like to denote origin keeps the aperture open both scientifically uh certainly like I&#x27;ve discussed publicly uh previously 1930s okay can you give me the names and titles of the people with direct first-hand knowledge and access to some of this crash retrieval some of these crash retrieval programs and maybe which facilities military bases that would the recovered material would be in I can&#x27;t discuss that publicly but I did provide that information both to the Intel committees and the Inspector General and we could get that in the skiff if we were allowed to get in a skiff with you would that be probably what you would think sure if you had the appropriate accesses yeah uh what special access programs cover this information and how is it possible that they have evaded oversight for so long I do know the names once again I can&#x27;t discuss that publicly and how they&#x27;ve evaded oversight I in a closed setting I can tell you the specific tradecraft use all right when did when do you think those programs began and who authorized them I do know a lot of that information but that&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t discuss publicly because since all right what level of security clearance is required to fully access these programs uh certainly difference between member access and say somebody like me but anybody who has a you know tssci clearance and meets the eligibility criteria the access adjudicative Authority should be able to Grant you access Miss Merchant feel yield so just to be put a fine point on that there&#x27;s nothing that you&#x27;re aware of that&#x27;s above special access program classification it&#x27;s a misnomer that there&#x27;s anything actually Above Top Secret executive order 13526 delineates the classification levels right and but I I draw a point on that because we can have access to to those programs and so the notion that we&#x27;re not being given that access sort of defies our typical muscle memory here in Congress thank you Mr Merchant I&#x27;ll yield back to you thank you Mr Gates along those lines title 10 and you might not know this or not but that title 10 and title 50 authorization as they seem to say they&#x27;re inefficient it so who gets to decide this in your opinion in the past uh it&#x27;s a group of career senior executive officials okay are they government officials doesn&#x27;t announce do what both in and outs of government and that&#x27;s about as far as all right well that&#x27;s it leads to my next question which private corporations are directly involved in this program how much taxpayer money has been invested in these programs to your knowledge yeah I don&#x27;t know these specific metrics towards the end of your question uh the specific corporations I did provide to the Committees in specific divisions and I spent 11 and a half hours with both Intel committees okay has there been any has there been an active U.S government disinformation campaign to deny the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena and if so why I can&#x27;t go beyond what I&#x27;ve already exposed publicly about that what have you stated publicly in your interviews for the Congressional Record uh yeah if you reference my news Nation interview and I talk about a multi-decade you know campaign to disenfranchise public interest basically yeah if you were me where would you look titles programs departments regions if you could just name anything um and I put that as an open question to the three of you I&#x27;d be happy to give you that in a closed environment I can tell you specifically thank you at one point you said that they&#x27;re they&#x27;re my there has been harmful activity or Progressive activity has any of the activity um been aggressive been hostile in your reports uh I know of multiple colleagues of mine that got physically injured and uh the activity and I Gotta Buy Buy uaps or buy by people within the federal government both okay so there has been activity by by alien or non-non-human technology and or beings that has caused harm to humans uh I can&#x27;t get into the specifics in an open environment but at least the activity that I personally witnessed and not to be very careful here because you don&#x27;t you know they tell you never to acknowledge tradecraft right so what I personally witness myself and my wife was very disturbing you&#x27;ve said that U.S and has intact spacecraft you said that the government has alien bodies or alien species have you seen have you have you seen the spacecraft I have to be careful to describe what I&#x27;ve seen firsthand and not in this environment but I could answer that question behind behind closed doors and have you seen any of the bodies that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve not witnessed myself and with that being said you have mentioned that there&#x27;s interdimensional potential could you expound on that I&#x27;ll get to answer your first question and you know I&#x27;m here as a fact witness an expert but I I will give you a a theoretical framework at least to work off to kind of expose crashes uh regardless of uh you know your level of sentience right you know planes crash cars crash and number of sorties what however High a small percentage are going to end in you know Mission failure for well as we say in the in the Air Force and then in terms of uh multi-dimensionality that kind of thing the the framework that I&#x27;m familiar with for example is something called the holographic principle uh both uh it&#x27;s it drives itself from general relativity and quantum mechanics and that is if you want to imagine a 3D objects such as yourself casting a shadow onto a 2d surface that&#x27;s the holographic principle so you can be projected quasi-projected from higher dimensional space to lower dimensional it&#x27;s a scientific Trope that you can actually cross literally as far as I understand but there&#x27;s probably guys with phds that we can probably argue about that but you have not seen any documentation that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s occurring only a theoretical framework discussion okay okay this these aircraft um have they been identified that they are being produced by by domestic um you know military and contractors is there any evidence that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s being recovered uh not to my knowledge plus the recoveries predate a lot of our Advanced programs that I previously am waiting of so um would it be safe to say that there could be a scenario today where you have an aircraft that crashes and because it&#x27;s been involved in one program from One Federal agency and the but the but the agency that retrieves it is not aware of that program and to them it appears alien in origin I mean that&#x27;s a hypothetical situation I&#x27;m not aware of any uh historical situation that would match that that you described so you&#x27;re not aware it has not happened that you&#x27;re aware of that I&#x27;m aware of um what percentage of uaps do you feel are adequately investigated by the US government of the five percent that are reported um I can only speak for my personal leadership over at NGA I tried to look at every report that came through that I could triage so do you believe that officials at the highest levels of our national security apparatus have unlawfully withheld information from Congress and subverted our oversight Authority there are certain elected leaders that had more information that I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;ve shared with certain gang of eight members or Etc but uh certainly uh I would not be surprised okay you&#x27;ve stated that the government is in possession of potentially non-human spacecraft based on your experience and extensive conversations with experts do you believe our government has made contact with intelligent extraterrestrials something I can&#x27;t discuss in public setting um okay I can&#x27;t ask when you think this occurred if you believe we have crashed craft stated earlier do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft as I&#x27;ve stated publicly already in my news Nation interview biologics came with some of these recoveries yeah um were they I a human biologics non-human and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program in and was this documentary evidence is video photos eyewitness like how would that be determined the specific documentation I would have to talk to you in a skiff about what agency sub-agency what contractors who should be called into the next hearing about uaps either in a public setting or even in a private setting and you probably can&#x27;t name names but what agencies or organizations contractors Etc do we need to call in to get these questions answered whether it&#x27;s about funding what programs are happening and what&#x27;s out there I can give you a specific cooperative and hostile witness list of specific individuals that were in those and how soon can we get that list I&#x27;m happy to provide that to you after the hearing is there any indication that department of energy is involved in UAP data collection and housing I don&#x27;t have an answer I can&#x27;t confirm or deny that in a public setting and could you do it in a secure setting yes do you have any personal knowledge of someone who&#x27;s possibly been injured working on Legacy UAP reverse engineering I can&#x27;t get into specifics but you can imagine assessing an unknown unknown uh there&#x27;s a lot of potentialities you can&#x27;t fully prepare for why is it that you referred to the phenomenon as non-human intelligence why deviate from the basis of extraterrestrial life I think the phenomenon is uh a very complex and I like to leave an open mind analytically to specific origin when you say can you elaborate on that for those that might if it&#x27;s a traditional extraterrestrial origin or something else that we don&#x27;t quite understand from either biological or astrophysics perspective you know just like the keep an open mind on what it could be yeah to your knowledge are there safety measures in place with foreign governments or other superpowers to avoid an escalatory situation in the event that a UAP um malevolent event occurs uh yeah you&#x27;re referring to actual a public treaty in the U.N register uh it&#x27;s funny you mentioned that the agreement on measures to reduce the risk of outbreak a nuclear war sign in 1971 unclassified treaty publicly available and If you cite the George Washington University National Security archives you will find the Declassified in 2013 specific Provisions in the specific uh Red Line flash message traffic with the specific codes pursuant to article 3 an article uh also situation two which is in the the previously classified NSA archive what I would recommend and I I tried to get access but uh uh I got a wall of Silence at the White House was the specific incidents when those um message traffic was used I think some scholarship on that would open the door to a further investigation using those publicly available information thank you and then my last question with 51 seconds remaining you even white collar crime -intentionally being taking place in regards to a cover-up can you please elaborate I have concerns based on the interviews I conducted under my official duties of potential violations of the federal acquisition regulations the far you&#x27;ve been able to answer in great detail on certain questions and then other things you say you&#x27;re not able to respond to can you just explain where you&#x27;re Drawing the Line and what&#x27;s the basis for that yeah based on my dobster Security review and what they&#x27;ve determined that is unclassified I see so you&#x27;re answering any questions that just call upon your knowledge of an unclassified questions but anything that relates to classified matters you&#x27;re not commenting on in this context in an open session but happy to participate in a closed session at the right level yeah starting with Mr grades why did you come forward on this issue purely a sense of Duty I first sworn oath when I was a Cadet 18 years ago and I I still uphold that even out of the uniform let me ask you how can the public contribute to UAP reporting and what Avenues you think are available to the public to report these sightings I&#x27;ll just touch on The Whistleblower side if it&#x27;s I do encourage you know current former military intelligence community in Industry contractors to come forward in a legal way either through the IC or DOD or whatever the cognizant IGS are um to lead you know lead you know join me in this discussion</p>
