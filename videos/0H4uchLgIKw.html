            <p>unfortunately some of you misinterpreted that so you could watch the tape for some time now you may recall that holly hand made reference to a certain contract by the united states sports military and there was actually a contract awarded for the hutchinson effect under that program and i have the document here that was funded by united states government on hutchison effect and it&#x27;s called lift and destruction system that was produced by a company who run in part by mr hattaway as carl was called that time pharaoh&#x27;s technologies limited so basically got the word lift and disruption system and there&#x27;s a whole series of documents showing the the certain frequency ranges involved the the intensity you feel and i guess you could look at that if you wish while i&#x27;m at it and there&#x27;s some references to other people&#x27;s work and there&#x27;s a rationale giving which is very exciting uh and very symptomatic of the society we live in which tries to avoid drastically enormous unsuccessfully uh anything that my dear colleague tom is trying to explain and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s having a tremendous difficulty in explaining cutting some fork whereas if there had been in my opinion as the inventor himself insists the approach taken by tom and his colleagues the explanation is much simpler for what happens now i&#x27;m trying to tell you more configurations i don&#x27;t have it here</p>
