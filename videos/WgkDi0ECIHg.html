            <p>all right there&#x27;s not much to do setup wise here because uh he gets into a lot of detail and and look Steve Green 4chan you guys asked for this it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot it&#x27;s a lot so um if you&#x27;re into this kind of thing go grab some coffee or cocktail whatever refreshment if you&#x27;re not into this thing uh check back in an hour Rich says take Jen to Applebee&#x27;s AJ maybe Jen doesn&#x27;t mind a little Applebee&#x27;s she got no problem with the Applebee&#x27;s right Red Lobster fine we like a crab feast crab Feast Macaroni Grill fine okay restaurants are all fine Chili&#x27;s or Sushi Samba There She Goes Dave McKenzie spearmint goldfish a little late my friend oh sorry that&#x27;s not professional Captain&#x27;s Log stardate 1009 46.44 the after files live stream has proven itself once again to be extremely unprofessional are you putting super chats up no all right not much to set up here um because he gets gets into all of it he&#x27;s a he&#x27;s not really a whistleblower because he&#x27;s on 4chan but his former military contractor part of the team that goes and recovers crash UFOs he&#x27;s part of the team that comes in after they check for bodies and all of that so he&#x27;ll get into it at some point and talk about how he he&#x27;s heard that there are bodies but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s ever seen any so what we&#x27;re looking at up here if I can get to it and there we go is someone took all of his the 4chan thread was a million miles long so someone took just all of his answers so it&#x27;s kind of condensed I have intimate knowledge of what the U.S currently knows about UFOs minus the last two years so he&#x27;s been out so he&#x27;s from two years he&#x27;s been out of uh the the scene for two years he says UFOs are primarily unmanned drones UFOs are built to spec each time they are deployed UFOs are created by a mobile construction facility that hides in the ocean construction facility destroys anything that comes close to it and will disappear for days when approached aggressively us believes the facility has been active on Earth for at least 100 years or much longer so that&#x27;s how he starts It Off Hey Stephen he loves the channel good to see you there my friend Elliot Hurst Bermuda Triangle Hamburger Factory um correct that&#x27;s what this is that&#x27;s exactly what this is disappear yeah so this he&#x27;ll get into it later but the location of this platform is Bermuda Triangle area and that&#x27;s why planes and ships and everything disappear from there because they get too close to this platform and um Elliot&#x27;s calling it a hamburger Factory because it&#x27;s it describes it as shaped like a big hamburger you know I would say it&#x27;s big Flying Saucer so primary unmanned drones so he talks about and I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll get to it I&#x27;m just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot so I I&#x27;m going to try and give you the the Nuggets that I know as we get through them and I&#x27;ll just repeat myself later primarily a man drone so he talks about how there used to be there used to be more piloted craft um but as our technology advanced they were having more ships go down you know more more UFOs go down probably around 1947 would be my guess so they just started doing more unmanned drones but he said there are some piloted crap from time to time when he says built a spec what he what he means is the administrators of the Factory The Hamburger Factory will say all right we need we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna scan the North Pole for example so using their technology their AI whatever it is we need we&#x27;re going to do we&#x27;re going to scan the North Pole ice core sample whatever it is and then the platform will create the machine to order with the right scanning equipment the right propulsion for the mission and it will put together a package and then it will seal up the package and then it gets deployed from from under the ocean it goes on its Mission does whatever it&#x27;s doing scans for a day a week an hour comes back under the ocean into the platform and gets disassembled the data is offloaded or it&#x27;s whatever streamed while it&#x27;s on Mission but the uh the the drones are destroyed you know he&#x27;s not exactly sure what happens he thinks that they&#x27;re broken down to component parts and metal is re is smelted or re-smelted to be reused and the reason why the craft that we see have these different shapes is because they have different Scan they have different equipment packages different scientific scanners so a lot of them are going to fit in a cigar shape but you have some that are bigger some smaller so that&#x27;s what he means buy to spec fire away on questions I&#x27;ll answer what I can you won&#x27;t be disappointed um I don&#x27;t know what the question is here it doesn&#x27;t officially exist I won&#x27;t use all right it doesn&#x27;t officially exist I won&#x27;t use the internal name on here either so someone had to ask them what did who does he work for like what department what company and he says it it doesn&#x27;t officially exist and but it has an internal designation but he&#x27;s not going to tell us what that is obviously people ask him is it omuamua if you don&#x27;t remember omumua was that long cigar-shaped object that flew into our solar system and kind of defied physics and then flew out again maybe I&#x27;ll do an episode on that or part of another or make it part of an episode because omuamua is an interesting object that has interesting um attributes but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s enough for a full episode Jenny you&#x27;re down there we have um on our list the R1 object that&#x27;s out in the Kuiper belt I think might be good to tack onto that and maybe the episode is objects in our solar system that science can&#x27;t explain could be cool that actually sounds like a winner that sounds like a 44 000 Premiere to me so but he says no omu is not one of theirs um is there a working theory on the origins if so character will elaborate so quite a bit we think the construction facility has been around since at least 4000 BC see citing slash paintings from the early eras of history um so he&#x27;s talking about in a lot of even Renaissance paintings you&#x27;ll see stuff in the sky that look like UFOs I mean you see them in in Egyptian carvings as well but that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s referring to has any form of intelligible communication been established yes it also depends on your Viewpoint they mostly want very little to do with us until we start to talk until we start to talk about war and nuclear options it&#x27;s one of the reasons why you see them so often at critical events now that&#x27;s true in most of the um nuclear tests especially the earlier ones we see objects in the sky over there where there shouldn&#x27;t be the the one that comes to mind is the is the ex the explosion at Bikini Atoll that was the big one right that was the big one Castle I forget what the name of it was but there are a couple of UFOs there so so that he&#x27;s talking about They Don&#x27;t Care About Us they&#x27;re not here to even they don&#x27;t care they&#x27;re not here to observe us they have they don&#x27;t care whether we live or die they don&#x27;t care they think of us like animals in a zoo the look whatever but it&#x27;s not a thing to them he believes and he&#x27;ll get to this eventually that they&#x27;re here for resources specifically gold and they only will intervene when they think that we&#x27;re going to do something stupid like set off a nuke destroy the planet they need the resources and what&#x27;s interesting about the gold is if you go back to the stories about the Anunnaki who are allegedly the first right the aliens that seated Humanity or whatever you believe about about Anunnaki and enki and and and those quote unquote gods and Zechariah sitchin&#x27;s book those beings were here for gold so that tracks now maybe he knows that you know I&#x27;m not saying his story is true I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s interesting so there are a lot of nuggets about his story that track with Bob Lazar and and Zechariah sitchens and and a lot of a lot of the people and the stories that we&#x27;re aware of now that could just mean that he knows all the stories like we do and he weaves this narrative that&#x27;s you know that&#x27;s the skeptical point of view and look I probably lean that way but if that&#x27;s not so then a lot of the things he has to say are very coincidental and line up with a lot of the theories that have existed for a long long time so he&#x27;s saying at least 4000 BC sightings see paintings early history um any communication no they don&#x27;t care about us until um we&#x27;re gonna destroy the planet do they know who or what is creating these craft yes as mentioned earlier the mobile construction unit is responsible for the deployment and construction uh many potential they are made by a higher branch of the government absolutely not what allows them to fly so fast what technology gravity manipulation and the materials they are constructed from so he&#x27;ll get into that a little bit later as well um but it tracks with a lot of what Lazar says we think the construction unit is driven by AI the response time to threats is almost instant and usually very calculated and well thought out you all should pay attention to this the majority of UFOs as I mentioned previously are built to spec and purpose this is why they&#x27;re always different sizes the contents and Equipment usually mimic the intended purpose too is related to that one under rock that one Scandinavian country the one that deploys with tectonic plates um no this one almost never leaves the Bermuda Triangle uh BS governments have and have had for a while Advanced anti- anti-gravity crafts you asked if the particular UFOs we study are the result of a foreign government not if other governments have shittier versions speed alone tells us what we&#x27;re looking at so he&#x27;ll get into it later but he he says pretty much that we don&#x27;t have the tech you know we have been able to reverse engineer some of their technology but not not anti-gravity not for lack of trying they just can&#x27;t get it to work so people ask him like these uaps we&#x27;re seeing are those it&#x27;s not like a military test he said no way we can&#x27;t do anything like that do the uaps return back to the manufacturing unit yes some come in and leave the planet but usually very rarely usually the same number that comes in goes out unless special circumstances arise it feels more like a carrier but with construction capability interesting what are the purposes of the uap&#x27;s surveillance of humans the U.S believes they&#x27;re not here to harm us they only seem interested in us once they realize we&#x27;re destroying things around us including each other one of the officials in charge said something that stuck with me they act like keepers of a zoo uninterested in the daily life of wildlife until this problem right I mean if they&#x27;re that advanced why care about us I mean that&#x27;s maybe hard for us to to accept being the species that we are that&#x27;s so self-centered but if if you&#x27;re a million years ahead in technology we&#x27;re I mean we&#x27;re ants why would you care it&#x27;s like oh I&#x27;ll have an ant farm that&#x27;s cool but that&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m here that&#x27;s you know that&#x27;s an interesting uh can I approach that facility without being attacked the last unit we saw approached the facility didn&#x27;t he even have time to communicate they were being attacked before it was over what&#x27;s buried under the Mesa on Skinwalker Ranch is that show even is that show even legitimate it seems uh like some of the most legitimate research on anything paranormal I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life and I&#x27;m very curious about what they seem to be finding says no idea of the project if any is likely to be kept separate um asked about elements doesn&#x27;t have any idea about that the crafts we recover are built with numerous elements some aren&#x27;t even obtainable here so he&#x27;ll talk about later that uh that most of the craft are made with with metals that are mined here but there are some metals that are brought off world to to make the craft are they friends they cut their losses when crashes are recovered same with Personnel zookeepers aren&#x27;t friends with the animals right so he&#x27;ll get into this later as well when there&#x27;s a crash why not communicate why not he says it&#x27;s to them it&#x27;s not worth it they have so many things going on and there&#x27;s no reason to communicate vessel crashes they just if they can get to it they do if humans are crawling on it they just say if it would you know nothing we can do about it they don&#x27;t bother they don&#x27;t bother with it it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not worth recovering the technology it&#x27;s not worth having to deal with us do you know if the entities behind the UFOs are native to the Earth like an older civilization Breakaway civilization or civilization of humans that escaped a previous cycle of cataclysm due to their Advanced Tech that&#x27;s a cool question limited expertise since my role is more craft analysis us believes they are far into our world a previous cataclysm could make sense they also show up in times of strife such as natural events I also think that other guy who was talking about approaching the area without being attacked as a remote viewer um he talks about how he lurked on boards because he had never heard of remote viewing before he wasn&#x27;t aware that was a thing but he says in his in the people he deals with that psychic type of stuff doesn&#x27;t come up these they&#x27;re on the ground they&#x27;re scientists they&#x27;re they&#x27;re practical they&#x27;re picking up pieces they&#x27;re not you know projecting their consciousness have you tried sending in a raft of hippies yeah I recognize them as a threat just kidding based on previous disappearances and acts of hostility we believe the construction facility carrier has learned what is and isn&#x27;t hostile usually it would just move away or stay deep under the water it doesn&#x27;t fire on civilian boats for example exceptions apply when we have seen one or two go missing usually after sharp turns Etc so you&#x27;re on a Princess Cruise with you know with your family or whatever you&#x27;re probably fine I don&#x27;t know where the where the cruise ships go I bet I bet they don&#x27;t go in the Bermuda Triangle though let me check the check the chat if you know maybe they do but it seems to me like if you if you talk to the the suits that own the cruise lines and corporate like do you guys Cruise in the Bermuda Triangle they would say ah we don&#x27;t believe in that but we still don&#x27;t go there just in case Jay Richard says yeah they do all right so I guess the um the platform is not worried about it they&#x27;re not worried about the cruise ships because they know who&#x27;s um who&#x27;s who&#x27;s an enemy and who isn&#x27;t but if a ship is cruising along and it makes a sharp turn toward the crafts it gets disappeared any relation to Antarctica my section monitor just this craft and any interactions that attempted my a previous co-worker did mention something in passing of Antarctica at one point but I ignored it if I&#x27;m being honest talking about other projects is considered career suicide how about the destination the space warps is Jupiter a potential destination I believe they&#x27;re keeping a massive orb inside of the gas giant who have no evidence in many but many dreams of it no idea if it&#x27;s a project I haven&#x27;t seen it no orbs out of the construction facility just UFOs what units have been lost approaching this construction machine why are they not sent a sea wolf to investigate the Jimmy Carter with its nanotech everything you can think of really at one point nuclear missiles were being toyed with again we deployed Fighters and a sub with series intent everything except the sub was lost now I&#x27;m not sure exactly what he&#x27;s talking about here but there wasn&#x27;t an event that you guys probably know about where in nuclear nuclear facility nuclear silos suddenly they just started arming themselves and uh nobody knew why they just started arming up and everyone&#x27;s like oh oh it&#x27;s not me it&#x27;s not me it&#x27;s not me and then something happened and not and nothing happened and everything settled down um but that was a scary situation there&#x27;s been there have been some close calls and some false alarms and this guy attributes some of those to the UFOs getting a little getting hinky with us how would they come to the conclusion the uip being released are ET if they don&#x27;t know what the UAP are to begin with or if there&#x27;s nothing inside them that&#x27;s a pretty big jump to go right to E.T that&#x27;s a good point he says they crash sometimes Parts fail and gravity engines near the surface of the planet can be like Crossing an intersection we recover these and sometimes find passengers we mostly see drones now back in the earlier days we saw a lot more piloted craft um that&#x27;s just a question that he moved on from the project the last unit we saw purchase facility didn&#x27;t even have time to communicate okay any details on what happened to that craft normal approach details pilot responsive and actively talking the feed cuts out Pilots still talking suddenly nothing poor guy likely had no idea it was a suicide mission based on what we&#x27;ve seen the construction facility has far superior weapons than the UFOs do the weapon destroys the matter and hits entirely it also crafts on anything electronic in the vicinity so Bermuda Triangle right they talk about compasses stop working the radio there&#x27;s interference magnetic interference this could be what he&#x27;s talking about like any just we just do like a giant EMP that lasts the whole time you&#x27;re in here so get out the contents and Equipment usually mimic the intended purpose um like the equipment share a pattern specific to its purpose yes usually when we find a thinner model for example it would have no pilot and have a lot of sensor sense sensory Hardware my favorite is finding one that is fitted for research if we&#x27;re lucky we find things we have never seen before before I left we were looking at what we thought was a lab or some or some kind for genetics a genetics lab I don&#x27;t know if he gets into what genetics he&#x27;s talking about but that&#x27;s that&#x27;s scary and interesting um talking about one shaped like a pear Burger size shape and speed are usually the factors we use to determine what the purpose of the UFO is we get it wrong sometimes they can be quite large and both pear and burger shapes are known are known builds so common shapes all right I&#x27;ve had two orange orbs approach me to within 100 feet one night glowing translucent but rather dim like the Setting Sun seen through smog they were flying in 45 degree formation like this about 50 miles an hour he says research slash science vessels sometimes have mobile light producing cameras used for multiple purposes from scouting to keeping threats contained or at Bay these are shaped like Hammers and when operated are extremely bright red lights are a sign of hostility or caution to deploy weapons orange lights are usually for spotting minerals or living things that&#x27;s kind of what I was talking about before with the with the laser the guy&#x27;s shining the laser so he&#x27;ll get into it later but he&#x27;s talking about red lights orange lights but but later he&#x27;ll say he&#x27;s talking about lasers that they use as soon as I blink my flashlight at them and they accelerated with several thousand knots and disappeared um he says I&#x27;m not surprised the range on those is quite large the UFO was likely somewhere above you quite high up is the underwater base near Catalina Island he says no um this one has only left the Atlantic Ocean twice both times before I arrived are aliens human or humanoid and he says humanoid very humanoid then how do you know anything about abductions forced breeding programs Etc he says bodies are removed before we&#x27;re allowed to perform work we definitely see some past we definitely see some passing by hence changes in older proven methods by New Management he&#x27;s talking about how there&#x27;s a lot of turnover in his team because they&#x27;re using different methods now than they used to so they&#x27;re using new personnel um also real true disclosure coming anytime soon the Air Force is extremely frustrated with the lack of progress on their end we felt similar but are unable to share details with them so the Air Force trying to reverse engineer but just can&#x27;t make any progress all right so he&#x27;s so I&#x27;d assume this is sort of an AI design that seems to be advanced yet already prepared for the get-go can you rephrase this basically when designed to let&#x27;s say be a minor you usually see Hardware dedicated to resource collection on the vessel if the vessel is something scientific you may encounter things like tools and as previously mentioned something akin to a lab we thought of it more as hey I need to go hiking so the construction Philly so the construction facility builds you a car UFO and packs it full of hiking supplies and even adjust the shape to fit what was packed that makes that makes sense I&#x27;m keeping an eye on the chat see if anyone&#x27;s confused but yeah like I was saying earlier what&#x27;s the mission okay you&#x27;re gonna do that you&#x27;re going to do mining here&#x27;s some scanning equipment some mining equipment it&#x27;s this size that&#x27;s the shape we just skin it and deploy it later he&#x27;ll talk about mining how the Chinese have been able to successfully reverse engineer some of the alien mining Tech but it keeps breaking and they don&#x27;t know why and it&#x27;s probably because they can&#x27;t they don&#x27;t have the right parts and I keep I bring it up that he&#x27;s going to say it later because this is long and people are going to bail out and I don&#x27;t blame you so if there&#x27;s something interesting I want to get you the Nugget before you split he&#x27;s asked do you think there are fewer piloted crafts because the population of the facility if anything is declining he replies no the common consensus is that they&#x27;re just being careful I&#x27;ve heard recovery of living Pilots usually doesn&#x27;t go well for either of us we suspect they piloted a lot of initial craft due to early complications we also saw more crashes any bodies recovered to show any ranges of Aging we can recognize I wonder if most of the inhabitants are either old or dead at this point though younger bodies would disprove that I suppose that&#x27;s an interesting question like are they on the are they here breeding on the platform or do they have extremely long life spans and they&#x27;ve been here for a long long time he says no idea about age not my specialty and asking about it would have been met been a net negative especially now previous higher-ups were getting better about being open with information since Discovery happened quicker but uh you know I&#x27;d like to know that answer and I don&#x27;t remember if he answers it later you know are they breeding here he does talk about how they are male and female and and so forth so maybe they are what do the passengers look like are they biological and or Android he says they&#x27;re biological do you know anything about people such as Stephen Greer Elizondo or whatever are these people in the know or larpers or controlled misinformation no idea one name sticks out you didn&#x27;t mentioned mentioning Bob Lazar by name would likely have you taken out back and put down like a dog do the math on why that&#x27;s very interesting so he doesn&#x27;t know who Elizondo is and Elizondo was the director of atip so that&#x27;s you know that&#x27;s an offshoot of Project Blue Book that&#x27;s that&#x27;s right next to the Air Force he doesn&#x27;t know who Elizondo is so that&#x27;s either the guy&#x27;s not telling the truth and hasn&#x27;t done enough homework because you should know who it is um or elizondo&#x27;s is is just part of this information and this guy&#x27;s working for the real thing so he doesn&#x27;t he&#x27;s busy I&#x27;m recovering aircraft I&#x27;m not following the disinformation campaign but interesting about Bob Lazar that you can&#x27;t talk about him and have everything ever found regarding UFOs in general what is your personal favorite so he says new engine was deployed with a very large model that I had never seen before we usually see three to five gravity producing engines and this one had seven favorite object or find probably the lab since we never fully discover never fully understood how it worked before it was destroyed makes me wonder whether a meaningful distinction between scientific study and amusement still exists for them if it ever did he says this was before my time but they talked about a bus UFO that had more that had more occupants than Hardware most of the intended purpose appeared to be for physical viewing I wondered if they ever just wanted to look at the animals so I mean I picture the same thing a big UFO with like you know Windows on it just cruising around just looking at the intelligent monkeys so he&#x27;s asked how long till we can hang with aliens here&#x27;s his answer as harsh as it is have any cousins that destroy everything they touch when do you want to see them again right so yeah they don&#x27;t want to have anything to do with us  cousin so I was just they&#x27;re far ahead of us with technology and we&#x27;re aggressive so why um someone&#x27;s talking about a strangely recurrent thing at a minimum the psychotronic devices of some sort so he says this reminded me of something in my first year UFO crashes they remove the bodies well before my team arrives we start to look and the craft is unpowered at first a few minutes later the craft powers on and starts to close up we radio out we radio out and get a response from the unit removing one of the occupants alien that they are working on it ship Powers off and the other team asks if we are good to go no mention of how access was possible I suspect the pilot may have interfaced with the ship by remote or psionic ability so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this event or a different one he talks about later but he&#x27;s talking about a scary time where he was in a craft you know just whatever he&#x27;s doing like he finds tools and stuff so he&#x27;s Gathering stuff and the thing closes and and he&#x27;s stuck in there and he can&#x27;t rate you can&#x27;t call for help he can&#x27;t radio out he&#x27;s just in there hoping that I hope this opens all right someone talk is asking him about are they translucent they definitely had an inner core that wasn&#x27;t see-through lots of tools they use produce light is this if this is still about the orb the shell you may have seen was just the light around the device I called the hammer he mentions the hammer a lot as the shape and I can&#x27;t really picture it I can&#x27;t really picture it because I don&#x27;t know of any as that being a common I don&#x27;t know of any UFO that&#x27;s been shaped like a hammer you know so I&#x27;m wondering if he means something else he&#x27;s asked are there more than one construction facility you mentioned one in the Bermuda Triangle however there are lots there are a lot of UFOs off the west coast of the Americas as well and the insight he says I suspect there may be there may be since we only watched the Atlantic Ocean and the UFOs we track normally Don&#x27;t Stray far from home base but asking about it wouldn&#x27;t have been a bad move so he doesn&#x27;t know but it could be that these platforms are elsewhere possibly lots of places we don&#x27;t really know and you know if his team is working on the platform in the Atlantic and there&#x27;s a team working on a platform in the Pacific they&#x27;re not going to know that each other exists most likely maybe maybe supervisory would um but text I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think they would be written on other projects I think that&#x27;s this is the only thing that we&#x27;re worried about because what if there&#x27;s what if there are platforms all over the planet what if what if there&#x27;s 50 what if there&#x27;s a hundred of them you get to a point where you where instead of focusing on your work you start wondering like what the hell is going on with all the you know where are we invaded are we infested are we overrun yeah Well he kind of says here you know are there more than one asking about it would be a bad move uh he worked in the Atlantic he doesn&#x27;t know the others the mention of something in in the Arctic was weird and brief when it came up um talk about hybridization of the human race if you only knew how bad things are um he gets a little vulgar there but basically says that um they&#x27;re not looking necessarily to interbreed with us because it be like interbreeding with a an inferior genetics I read somewhere some UFO navigation systems require an extraterrestrial whose own personal wavelength has been specifically attuned to the neural network of The Craft so he says that tracks somewhat for me when we look at the craft we usually have to force certain things to work two teams come behind mine so that could be dedicated to under to understanding of The Craft so he mentions it here and there that there could be some kind of psychic interface if you remember the episode on the um the arvs the alien reproduction vehicle and the mark McCain the mark mccandlist story where um where his friends saw the UFO and they they basically created blueprints of it the controls were very simple just just kind of uh it was just a stick and and sort of and and like almost like a trackball to control the ship everything else they thought was done with a psychic interface which doesn&#x27;t have to be that crazy right that doesn&#x27;t have to be a wacky psychic interface that could be norlink right well I mean that&#x27;s not that far off you know if if a monkey can use neuralink to play Pong then in a million years aliens can use neuraling to control a craft all right someone asked can you tell us what they look like physically usual gray type or big ears and he says imagine the typical Grays you see on TV I&#x27;ve seen two corpses so maybe they&#x27;re a different species but I&#x27;ve never laid eyes on another he&#x27;s asked about culture and he&#x27;s heard rumors mostly they almost never want anything to do with us mentions of Destruction or Warfare apparently change their attitude pretty quickly I hope they&#x27;re watching what&#x27;s going on in Ukraine right let&#x27;s keep keep an eye on that all right hell of a claim any particular incident I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re referring to the various nuclear nuclear site incursions so he&#x27;s talking about when they get involved with us let&#x27;s see what he says I guess global conflict wasn&#x27;t a good term I meant more of tension the nuclear sight incursions the airspace violations has also been increasing tensions from what I understand the Roswell incident increased tension between the U.S and Soviets it did their secret tensions between their secret the security tensions behind other countries gaining access to information or materials surrounding the phenomenon there&#x27;s been a there&#x27;s been great domestic tension within the U.S true Intel agencies military disinformation campaigns Etc disinformation is interesting you know if he&#x27;s military a contractor he or psyop he would say disinformation he wouldn&#x27;t say misinformation a civilian will say that because that&#x27;s a new made-up word disinformation is what is what um psyops do since uh why did the UFOs uh screw up those people in Brazil uh was it by accident um them not knowing would be damaged equipment uh if found they usually monitor us if approached at an uncomfortable distance they flee when cornered it doesn&#x27;t end well I think he&#x27;s talking about the uh the Virginia incident uh their tools can do harm to us even for just scientific purposes we think they just don&#x27;t care all right so he covers this a little bit later and and I&#x27;m jumping around but this thing jumps around I just want to get you the nuggets someone asks them you know about abductions or people are abducted and they&#x27;re experimented on with with you know these devices scientific equipment you know Cartman gets the probe up his butt whatever it is and they asked him you know people talk about how painful those things are and he says they just don&#x27;t care uh we&#x27;re just they don&#x27;t care that it hurt they hurt us they just they&#x27;re doing their experiment and if it it just destroys someone&#x27;s mind so be it if it hurts their body so be it they just they don&#x27;t care we&#x27;re just meat do you believe we&#x27;re under their control in some way or sometime in history he&#x27;s asked possibly but I have no way of knowing the higher ups I worked for seemed hell-bent on discovering more about them usually not a quality found among controlled beings and that&#x27;s a good point right if they&#x27;re in charge why are we trying to learn so much uh what were the main reasons for the crashes I think random lightning or freak accident seeing how it seeing um seeing how advanced they are that&#x27;s a good question you&#x27;d be surprised how many mistakes they make especially the further back you look one area they seem to avoid like the plague we suspect is due to issues with gravity and flight before they figured it out we collected we collected quite a few mishaps there they&#x27;ve tried to shoot down they&#x27;ve tried to shoot some down mostly over nuclear incidents but failed miserably all right he covers it a little bit later and I think I have some more insight that he doesn&#x27;t get to is um you know it&#x27;s a good question why if the your technology is so Advanced why can&#x27;t you keep your ship in the air you know flying is supposed to be the safest way to travel why are you crashing if you can fly across the Galaxy you can&#x27;t fly to New Mexico um but he&#x27;s saying that they were kind of still figuring things out and they were hitting Pockets around the around the planet where gravity was weird and electromagnetism was weird and he talks about there&#x27;s a place they avoid like the plague we suspect it&#x27;s due to issues with gravity in flight and later he says that it&#x27;s somewhere in Mexico he doesn&#x27;t know anything about it but there is an area in Mexico called The Zone of Silence and in the zone of Silence is a weird place where where nothing works phones don&#x27;t work radios don&#x27;t work it&#x27;s just a very weird spot now it could be a coincidence I could just be connecting those dots but he says it&#x27;s a place where things don&#x27;t work in Mexico but that&#x27;s all he knows about it and he moves on um but that seems to make sense to me maybe there&#x27;s some type of gravitational anomaly there that aircraft won&#x27;t work did you see written symbols on the craft yes usually marked by doorways and key objects written language appears frequently on tools and critical items um also reads like their objective is to observe and preserve and he says I agree the idea was pitched that they&#x27;re waiting for us to mature or perhaps something bigger to arrive and they don&#x27;t want us to ruin the planet in the meantime so they&#x27;re just keeping an eye on things until the big ship gets here I guess what do you believe is the reason for the uptick in sightings once again my knowledge was cut off about two years ago if you mean very recently my guess would be the Russians and U.S having a little secret dance among amongst themselves which they are when nuclear anything gets involved we see large deployments for long periods of time Strife seems to be the catalyst he&#x27;s asked what&#x27;s your scariest experience while engaging with a phenomenon what was your favorite he says doors and closing on us as mentioned above made me wish I had brown pants still fascinated with the lab we found it was damaged by accident I had never really got much time with it he&#x27;s asked are you aware of any foreign uh foreign Tech that was successfully reverse engineered he says yes we used to laugh at Russian and Chinese designs we stopped laughing at China when they produced an operational but buggy version of their mining equipment still stumps most of our Engineers China also lies out of its ass but from what we saw we deemed it operational and working countries listed above have flight capable craft just not very good ones I&#x27;m honestly surprised nobody&#x27;s asked about the energy source or internals and then he&#x27;s heading out for the night so this went on for multiple days it gets to it later about the device with China and what it is I I don&#x27;t maybe he&#x27;ll tell us how big it is but it&#x27;s some type of laser or energy that is um blasted into the Rock but it&#x27;s tuned for whatever they&#x27;re trying to mind so so just a wall of rock right but we tune it for gold and it just eliminates anything but gold and so all that&#x27;s left is just gold just vaporizes or whatever it does just dematerializes the non-metal that&#x27;s not tuned for so if they want aluminum they tuned for aluminum everything else is just lamented or you&#x27;re separated out so apparently China has that Tech but it&#x27;s buggy and um and they can only get it to work for very short spurts so it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re using it on an industrial basis they just they&#x27;re trying to figure it out I don&#x27;t know what the question is here one example um one example was shortly after I joined they said one was down but two occupants were alive the first team couldn&#x27;t get close without being attacked aliens never seem to recover their lost UFOs for whatever reason so they just waited out a few days until they died then recovered the UFO hostility is usually their last option what&#x27;s the energy source you mentioned Bob&#x27;s who I think I know already and if you know lazar&#x27;s story then um you would have guessed correct as well correct-ish the power source is element 115 the thing no one talks about is that usually they seal it within the craft because it produces its own gravity field Bob Lazar handled e115 which was already pulled out which is rare and weird protocol now is that only one person is allowed to handle e115 I was forbidden from touching or interacting with it we still had trouble producing it too so you know that we&#x27;re producing it but it&#x27;s unstable so I if he says we&#x27;re having trouble producing it I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s talking about civilians or not but um if so he&#x27;s right we can&#x27;t get it can&#x27;t get it to be stable I&#x27;m just looking at the chat Element 115 that&#x27;s right 115. Atlanta Cyrus this The Whistleblower stuff this is not David grush unless it happens to be the same guy but I I doubt it there were some things about this account that bothered me for from a veracity standpoint you know for him dropping in things like LOL you know us a military contractor especially like who works like a scientific Detachment I just don&#x27;t think would talk like that but you know maybe I&#x27;m wrong because he&#x27;s he&#x27;s about 30 years old and he says everyone he works with is 35 or younger so all people so maybe Millennials just drop casual LOLs in there I don&#x27;t know but you know his writing is very very casual JG says yeah that guy just feels like a fraud uh Aaron Skinner I can&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re falling for a 4chan troll who would use r word um I&#x27;m not falling for anything Aaron and I said this earlier I&#x27;m saying that I lean toward this is not true but it makes for an interesting read you know I think it&#x27;s a good narrative you know so we don&#x27;t have to believe everything to enjoy it I mean that&#x27;s why the Y files exists right I mean if I&#x27;m debunking most of the stories I still like the stories and uh and judging by the live stream numbers you enjoy it too babazar called it on and Pentium big bad Airwolf I would believe this if it wasn&#x27;t on 4chan yeah I I I do too I wish it wasn&#x27;t on there and that&#x27;s you know and that&#x27;s part of him being very young because if you&#x27;re older than 35 who&#x27;s not that old but if you&#x27;re just older than 35 40 you wouldn&#x27;t even think to go on 4chan to blow your your whistle on stuff you would maybe go Reddit and then if you&#x27;re over 45 you know why what are you gonna call the papers but 4chan that you would do that if you&#x27;re young okay but I just think it&#x27;s I just think it&#x27;s entertaining um and a lot of his stuff tracks with a lot of other things that we know about about UFOs Joseph Smith says it&#x27;s true it&#x27;s all true Scott R I believe it more in 4chan than I would on Reddit which is an interesting point a lot of can a lot of all those crazy conspiracies on 4chan turned out to be true didn&#x27;t they how do you oppose travel in the context of those Tic Tac reports and Bob lazar&#x27;s report slash video where they seemingly jump through space-time and light to appear in a new location notice how it just phases to a new location like staggers he says this is common when moving at high speed from a standstill or slow speed initially gravity distorts time and the object inside the field field can stagger when traveling it&#x27;s an interesting answer especially for a 4chan guy and you know dovetailing with cozyrebs Theory tonight on time being an energy energy field that works with The Ether if you&#x27;re using gravity to distort that energy field of time and then moving a physical object through it it would make sense that it&#x27;s going to look weird to us because when we see something we&#x27;re seeing electromagnetic spectrum of visible light moving at light speed come into our eyeballs but if there&#x27;s if if you have this time is everywhere infinite like kazirov said and this ether which doesn&#x27;t care about time everything happens instantly things are going to happen in that realm that we can&#x27;t really comprehend but our eyes can only see visible light which is too slow for The Ether it&#x27;s too slow so if an object is moving through the ether it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to look staggered shout out to the Picard maneuver you hold these into TNG know what I&#x27;m talking about Picard maneuver who&#x27;s got it let me see who knows card maneuver Matt was someone really offended by the word hey man I didn&#x27;t say it but look I&#x27;m Gen X we grew up using that word we don&#x27;t mean no harm we don&#x27;t mean no harm by it and look if you&#x27;re in here and you&#x27;re offended by it you&#x27;re probably probably watching the wrong show I&#x27;ve heard the craft can detect the presence of a camera and when someone is filming filming them so he says not unless the craft is put into a mode to detect a lens if the UFO is standing still or hovering though they won&#x27;t miss you you can see a face like you&#x27;re standing in front of someone a couple of miles out doesn&#x27;t look like a camera though their eyes are different he&#x27;s just saying they way up in the air they can they can they can see whatever they want to see how are you able to talk about any of this didn&#x27;t you swear to secrecy he said yes liver cancer sucks when the government already have their eye on you considering you could turn out to be a loose end he says I&#x27;m not going on national TV or radio I&#x27;m on a 4chan board I&#x27;m sure they look at stuff like this but cancer makes you feel makes you a little makes you feel a little different also did you or your co-workers experience strange things outside of work that could be related to what you saw no usually most people working there had no prior interest in UFOs or at least feigned interest or feigned not having interest yeah so someone says Hey most zookeepers love their work and love the animals a great deal and he says I&#x27;ve wondered if some of them do like us they definitely have the ability to destroy us the Spheres are a type of unmanned surveillance drone shaped like a hammer but when activated yes they appear like spheres due to the intense light they see light differently and looking into the Sun for them isn&#x27;t an issue like it is for us I can&#x27;t speak for psionic abilities if any sense I&#x27;ve only heard rumors in passing we believe the lack of communication was inherent to the personal beliefs about us as mentioned previously but active serious discussion about destruction gets them going so they don&#x27;t care so much until we start talking about destroying the planet do you think they&#x27;re playing some role in stopping Rogue entities and dangers from space hurting us on a large scale that&#x27;s scary he says that was another theory yes we think they are more interested in keeping the planet safe from us two main suggestions are that we don&#x27;t spoil the planet before they arrive and take it from us don&#x27;t spoil the planet before they arrive and take it from us or they are letting us evolve and grow while pres while preventing devastation let&#x27;s hope it&#x27;s the second one not just you know keep we&#x27;re keeping the seat warm for you until the mothership gets here and then we all were just all enslaved it&#x27;s a cookbook Aaron&#x27;s just talking about remote feeling that it doesn&#x27;t know much about someone asked them about interdimensional stuff he says as for the Interventional aspect of it I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s anything actually interdimensionally happening it&#x27;s just our best way to try and grasp perceive what&#x27;s going on behind the veil from what I understand whatever is behind the phenomenon has the ability to manipulate matter energy in similar ways that we can manipulate information we can create 3D realities and manipulate them via our understanding of machine code and linear algebra so they could do the same with matter and energy it also seems to be able to play around with space-time almost as if we&#x27;re sitting on or perceiving time that&#x27;s been homogeneously transformed into projective space while they&#x27;re free to move move about homogeneous space if they haven&#x27;t entered the projection space then they could freely move about our space without interacting with it until they collapse their space coordinates into our projective space normalizing their position with their homogeneous coordinate all right so he&#x27;s just talking about there and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re in their space their coordinated space and we&#x27;re living in in a in a projection type of space compared to them that they could pop in and out of he&#x27;s not saying that that&#x27;s true he&#x27;s just saying that that&#x27;s a theory what why does image analysis by someone competent on the original UFO always show weird stuff gravity and the reflective nature of the craft usually am I right in assuming that this go lights is just air absorbing radiation or being completely saturated by no so no he may talk about this later and it&#x27;s a good point is that uh if you see a photo of a UFO the edges are always a little blurry and that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s a real thing if it&#x27;s a sharp edge it&#x27;s not real just because the way they move and the way gravity is what materials are these UFOs made of that answer gets complicated quickly short answer is an alloy that we cannot reproduce but only repurpose this alloy is kind of like a film that fits over the crap over the frame of The Craft I mentioned they were built a spec that&#x27;s exactly what I mean the shape is always efficiently designed the actual frame itself is heavier and composed of more elements both of these Alloys have a lot of elements we cannot reproduce one of the main problems when repair when repurposing these Alloys is getting them hot enough they absorb heat very well and shaping the metal is a tedious process wait we get melted can you quickly walk through the process of identifying the contents of a crashed UFO craft first team leaves first team leaves that details all right first team leaves that D that deals with occupants and initial discovery then we arrive and meet with an EC with an external member of the team who can touch and examine parts we are not allowed to interact with we&#x27;ve never had to cut our way into the UFO we enter we enter the first order we enter see he doesn&#x27;t use punctuation so It Hurts The credibility it&#x27;s still a fun story uh we enter the first order of business is checking for e115 then leaving the ship together and send it send it away uh we return and look for any tools and loose objects that can be extracted we then start to strip any specialized components on boards such as sensory equipment or navigation we leave and a third and fourth team arrive likely to remove the bulk of The Craft tell me about the mobile construction facility making them shaped like an extremely large UFO but as one mentioned more of a burger design almost never leaves the Atlantic Ocean in fact it will sit through hurricanes and only move elsewhere to release or receive a UFO no visible weapons or cockpit from satellite footage it also does not use any lights unlike other UFOs are there no other things making UFOs that&#x27;s the question yes UFOs arrive and depart Earth but very infrequently these UFOs are usually quite large the US has been itching to get its hands on a freighter UFO with inbound or outbound but the chances never presented itself leadership openly stated securing one would result in promotion how do you secure that how do you secure a freighter-sized you know an imperial an imperial destroyer how do you snatch that inbound uh this makes a lot of sense uh but what about the sausage multi-colored lights I highly highly doubt the drones or military except the triangle kind this was important because he says I&#x27;ve he says he&#x27;s never seen a triangle UFO lights are usually on bigger vessels and are sensory in nature they also use to spot each other so the triangles he&#x27;s saying that&#x27;s not what he works on now could be a different team that he&#x27;s not aware of or it could be the the triangle experimental aircraft that we&#x27;re not supposed to know about but um but one of those triangles was just photographed in Vegas just about a week or two ago it was it&#x27;s pretty compelling all right are we taking a taking a small break to do a giveaway or what yes please</p>
