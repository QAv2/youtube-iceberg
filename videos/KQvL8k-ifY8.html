            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel where we focus on uh different theories of everything cosmologies uh all-encompassing theories uh as well as um you know things that would help you in the uh in the big picture but you may not know about them because they&#x27;re rather obscure and possibly esoteric and uh uh today is a 329th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Mr dwey B Larson and uh Mr Larsson came up with this reciprocal system of theory meaning that it is a system so if you understand the system you can plug it into any subject um and so if there is uh a particular subject that you&#x27;re interested in delving into you can figure out the system and then fig you know kind of figure out how it works and then uh you can um you know deduce a way to apply it to your uh chosen field it&#x27;s not easy but if you can really grasp the system then um you know your intuition will probably lead you to the right approach now the idea behind Larson system is that we live in in a universe not made out of matter and the universe is also not made out of energy but the universe is made out of motion and uh other people in the past have come up with that concept A Universe of motion but Larson distinguished himself by defining motion as the relationship between space and time and so if we if we talk about the most basic kind of motion that we can think of speed speed the car is moving 15 M hour that&#x27;s 15 miles of space in one hour of time at space divided by time that is a relationship between space and time it sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time you can think okay let let&#x27;s double the speed well you can say the car is now moving moving 30 mph you&#x27;re doubling the speed but uh by the reciprocal you know way of thinking you could also say and it would be the equivalent to say the car is moving 15 miles per half hour that would also be doubling the speed so you can double the space or you could half the time and it would uh result in the same give you the same results now uh Motion in general does not includes more than just speed in fact in Larson system all of our really our scientific Quant quantities out that are out there are uh also forms of motion and they are different relationships between space and time we can think of it as uh uh motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator with the that space or time well first they are um they have no independent existence they only exist together in motion and that they are have the same qualities they are the same except that they are reciprocals of each other so what qu quality adheres to one also adheres to the other the first is that uh space and time are coordinate meaning that they have three dimensions or I would even say three or four dimensions but um we generally think of space as being three-dimensional but we don&#x27;t think of time as being three-dimensional so uh we have to accept the coordinate space and coordinate time and then we also have what Larson calls a clock the clock aspect clock space and clock time we generally accept clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but this is a motion that has no specific direction we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t think of the clock as moving in any particular direction except for just later it&#x27;s the same with space clock space is that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no particular direction this is what Larson calls a scalar motion this is a separate kind of motion that he&#x27;s he&#x27;s actually dealing with in this paper that we&#x27;re going to be discussing here a little bit later um but a scalar motion can be modeled by using a balloon with dots on it you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction the farther away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other um so this is really the model of a scalar motion which is much different than uh your normal kinds of motion Mo most motions have a a Direction but a scalar motion uh has only a magnitude no direction and um this was also you know this is not just hypothetical for balloons but it was observed by the Hubble telescope that observed that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and if we if we unless we want to cling to the concept that our galaxy is at the center of the universe and that all the galaxies are moving away from ours uh we would have to assume that our galaxy is also participating in this General uh recession from all of the other galaxies and so our galaxy is also participating in this Galactic recession moving away from each other but in no specific Direction lson emphasizes that you know this is a different Motion in kind than the normal motions that we&#x27;re used to dealing with but science has not investigated this this kind of motion this scaler motion uh it has kind of relegated it to just as a sideshow but Larson in his system is really saying that the scaler motion is really what the whole uh uh Universe of motion is built upon and then the other quality of space and time is that they are quantized meaning that there is one unit of there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space and if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time then you don&#x27;t have time um and so um if you have exactly one unit of space space in one unit of time space over time being speed if you have one unit of space over one unit of time you have the speed of light uh and the speed of light is what Larson calls unit speed this is the background of uh Larson&#x27;s Universe of motion so the state of rest the origin the zero point the reference point of the universe of motion is moving out outward at the speed of light in all directions this is the background motion and so in Larson&#x27;s Universe half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light and half is moving slower he calls these the cosmic sector and the material sector respectively and this is uh outrageous to Legacy science uh following Einstein&#x27;s dictum that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe this shows that the Legacy scientists don&#x27;t really know anything about the cosmic sector and they&#x27;re only really dealing with the material sector in their Reckoning um so um that uh and then this the speed of light basically creates a boundary between these two sectors when you cross the boundary um you recognize that the cosmic sector is identical to the material sector except that it is the reciprocal and so when you cross that boundary you basically uh have to invert the roles of space and time and so in the material sector in the sector that we&#x27;re used to dealing with in the sector that the scientists are familiar with we have coordinate space three dimensions of space and we have clock time uh the clock is always getting later and later and later but if we cross that boundary and we move into the cosmic sector into the faster than the speed of light realm then we&#x27;re dealing with coordinate space I mean I&#x27;m sorry coordinate time three or more dimensions of time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and so um that kind of shows you uh a little bit about how the reciprocal system works now we&#x27;re looking at an article that Larson wrote um back in the day and it&#x27;s called the um nature of motion now this is our fourth installment of reading this article so if you want to uh start at the beginning you want to go back about three videos and start there but Larson uh pretty much went through this kind of this scaler motion and showed um a how it&#x27;s fundamentally different than normal motion vectorial motion and B that it is in existence uh it is in evidence of uh certain phenomena in the universe in particular like this Galactic recession but also the um movement of photons at the speed of light uh the speed of light being constant why the speed of light is a constant also uh gravitation is an inward scalar motion so it&#x27;s gravitation is basically the same uh as the balloon using the uh balloon with dots on it but you&#x27;re blowing sucking in the balloon instead of blowing out the balloon so a gravitational motion is a motion toward toward uh every you know toward all other um spots on the balloon and so that gets rid of this whole concept of action at a distance of having to have an intermediate uh intervening medium between two uh points that are gra uh gravitating it&#x27;s it&#x27;s that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening what&#x27;s what&#x27;s there&#x27;s no uh there&#x27;s no specific um direction of gravitation you&#x27;re you&#x27;re just moving in toward all other objects all other locations but you can choose a reference point when you choose that reference point then it appears as if the uh attraction is just occurring between two points but it&#x27;s actually occur it&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s actually um not so much the attraction between two points it&#x27;s actually the contraction of space itself space itself is cont attracting in gravitation and so all points are moving toward all other points but we generally just recognize one uh as as a reference point and then you know point out how it&#x27;s attracting uh another Point um okay now let&#x27;s uh take over here uh for the fourth installment of this paper the same property of scalar motion also accounts for the fact that we are able to observe the gravity ational motion of a mass only in the direction of other masses although the motion actually takes place in all directions that&#x27;s kind of what I was just trying to explain uh before we can arrive at a complete uh explanation of this situation however it will be necessary to give some consideration to the question as to the existence of an absolute system of reference the prevailing scientific opinion concurs with Einstein&#x27;s assertion that there is no absolute reference system although there is some uneasiness about the rotational situation and about the significant role that the system based on the average positions of the fixed Stars seems to play in physical activity but the conclusion that there is no absolute system of reference is based on argument ments that apply only to vectorial motion what we now want to know is whether an absolute system of reference can be defined for scalar motion an absolute system of reference is one in which an object that is in fact motionless is represented in its true condition as stationary when we we can further say that any object which has no inherent capability of movement in the reference system and has not been acted upon by any Outside Agency is in fact motionless it has not been possible thus far to find any objects that qualify as motionless from the vectorial standpoint but at least three classes of objects can be identified on the basis of the foregoing Criterion as having no scalar motion these are one photons of radiation two neutrinos or other massless particles and three galaxies at extreme distances where the effect of gravitation is negligible of course there is always the possibility that our observations may not be giving us the complete picture and that one or more of these classes of objects is subject to some unrecognized type of scalar motion however this possibility is ruled out by the fact that all three classes of objects follow exactly the same pattern all of the objects identified as motionless from the scalar standpoint move outward at the speed of light relative to the conventional system of reference since these objects are necessarily stationary in the absolute system of reference it follows that this absolute system of reference uh for scalar motion is moving outward at the speed of light relative to the conventional reference system the reference system that represents motionless a motionless object in its true motionless condition is likewise the correct reference system uh for objects that are in fact moving thus the absolute system of reference that has been defined is the natural reference system for scalar motion the one to which the physical Universe actually conforms every physical object is being carried outward at the speed of light by the movement or progression of the natural reference system relative to the conventional system of reference why then do most physical objects stay put and only the exceptional ones move outward in the manner of the photons the answer clearly is that all objects with mass are moving inward gravitationally in opposition to the outward progression of the natural reference system The observed scalar motion is the net resultant of the two opposing motions between the progression or of the progression of the natural reference system and gravitation at the very short dist distances of our ordinary experience the outward progression of the natural reference system which is constant is negligible compared to the inward gravitational effect which is inversely proportional to the second power of the distance so when they&#x27;re close by uh gravitation outweighs uh by far the progression and so we really don&#x27;t perceive the progression at all we only perceive the gravitation but as the distance increases the gravitational motion decreases and at a certain very great distance which is a function of the mass and in the neighborhood of 2 million light years for objects as massive as the larger galaxies it reaches equality with the outward progression Beyond this point each Larsson calls that the gravitational limit by the way and Beyond this point each galaxy has a net outward motion increasing toward the speed of light as the distance becomes greater and the gravitational effect decreases still further here then is the explanation not only of the recession of the distant galaxies but also of the inward motion of most of uh most of those that are relatively close together the finding that there is a hitherto unre recognized motion of General application illustrates the importance of expanding the currently existing concept of the nature of motion to take scalar motion into account as brought out in the preceding paragraph the clarification of the fundamental situation automatically provides the explanation of the recession of the distant galaxies and eliminates the need to assume the existence of some process such such as a universal expansion or a big bang to account for the outward motion furthermore the same relations between the opposing motions are also effective in application to the shorter distances and smaller masses and explain many hitherto poorly understood physical phenomena including such items as the immense distances between stars and the structure of the globular clusters and also um okay um identification of the outward progression of the natural reference system enables us to complete the explanation of the lack of observational existence I&#x27;m sorry observational evidence of gravitational motion toward locations in space that are not occupied by objects with mass a point in a spatial reference system obviously has no capability of independent motion however as we have found this point is being carried outward by the motion of the natural reference system relative to the conventional system of reference this is just the expansion of space itself the inward motion of gravitation operates against this outward progression up to a speed level equal to the speed of this progression because of the mutual character of scalar motion the effective gravitational speed toward the unoccupied location in space cannot exceed the limiting speed of the point in the reference system the the excess gravitational motion is unobservable another instance in which the conventional reference system is incapable of representing scalar Motion in its entirety as Larson says on this count um a onedimensional scalar motion it requires three dimensional three dimensions of space um to describe it and so but there are three dimensions of scalar motion so there are really two dimensions of scalar motion that are outside the capabilities of the reference system the reference system is three-dimensional vectorially in space and so all three of them are exhausted uh by simply one dimension of scalar motion so when you move into these other two dimensions of scalar motion you move out out beyond the capabilities of the reference system um the UN the excess gravitational motion is unobservable in uh another instance in which the conventional reference system is incapable of representing scalar Motion in its entirety since the effective Inward and outward motions are equal there is no net change change of relative position and the gravitational motion toward the uh unoccupied location is unobservable the mutual gravitational motion of two masses is not subject to any limitation and the full net speed of both participants is effective in changing their observable positions in the reference system here we have the answer to the frequently Asked question how does mass a know that it must change the direction of its gravitational force when Mass B moves from location X to location y the answer is that mass a is moving gravitationally in all directions at all times whether or not other masses are present its motion toward Mass B and therefore also toward location X unoccupied momentarily by mass B is observable whereas its motion toward unoccupied location Y is unobservable if Mass B moves to location y the previously observable motion of mass a in the direction ax becomes unobservable while the previously unobservable Motion in the direction a y becomes obser observable this is not a unique situation it is typical of the results of the unidirectional representation of multi-directional scalar Motion in the conventional system uh spatial reference systems the same kind of a pattern can be seen for instance in the galactic recession Galaxy X is moving out outward in all directions when it is viewed from Galaxy a the motion in the direction ax is observable while that in the direction BX is unobservable but if the Observer moves to Galaxy B the previously observable Motion in the direction ax becomes unobservable whereas the previously unobservable Motion in the direction BX becomes observable returning to the question uh to which this discussion is addressed are there motions that are not included within the physicist definition of this term the answer is definitely yes um the except accepted definition requires motion to be vectorial that is to have both magnitude and Direction whereas in fact the basic motions excuse me the basic motions of the universe are scalar they have magnitude only the directions in the context of the conventional reference systems that are attributed to those that are actually recognized as motions are properties of the coupling of the scalar motion to the reference system not properties of the Motions themselves elves as would be expected where a basic concept is modified recognition of the existence of scalar motion has some far-reaching consequences some of these have been identified in the foregoing Pages however the discussion has been limited to the immediate and direct results of the revision of the motion Concept in order to make it unnecessary to introduce anything from theoretical sources since the existence of scalar motion is an observed fact these immediate consequences of that existent are likewise purely factual all right that is the end of that article the nature of motion okay so the last three that we&#x27;ve done have been the physical nature of space the nature of time and the nature of motion so that kind of gives you the nuts and bolts of the reciprocal system because the universe is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time and then in these last 10 videos or so he has defined the nature of these three uh primary categories of of things um and they&#x27;re really all three like a trinity um lson uses the analogy of a box if you have a box um the Box being motion you have automatically by having the Box you have an inside of the box and you have an outside of the box uh one of them is space and one of them is time so but you automatically you have one and it comes as a package deal you automatically have the other two uh so if you have motion you have space and time and that&#x27;s the other other fundamental uh paradigm shift that&#x27;s required to kind of uh accept uh access the um reciprocal system is that uh space and time are not the container of the universe uh ever since the ancient Greeks or even before them uh we have thought of space and time as being kind of like the setting uh where uh the stage upon which uh the actors um go through their Paces uh the actors of the universe go through their Paces in on a stage or a setting of space and time but in Larson system space and time are the contents not the container but the contents of the universe the universe is made out of space and time and so the actors um are actually made out of space and time and so um that is a paradigm shift that you have to be able to grock um before kind of accessing the reciprocal system and the other is that you know um you have to be able to in Vision motion without anything moving motion comes before the thing that&#x27;s moving and then in fact the thing that&#x27;s moving again is motion itself um you know all of these different quantities like matter energy acceleration speed force uh pressure uh electric charge magnetic flux permeability um viscosity fluidity these are all forms of motion and they&#x27;re all expressable uh with time space coordinates uh motion is time to the third power over space to the third power energy is time over space pressure is time over space to the fourth power um and this is a very very useful uh way to use your units because it&#x27;s way less cumbersome than the MKS system which uses three different variables but the uh reciprocal system just uses two and so you can um check your equations to see if they&#x27;re balanced out by just uh checking their time space coordinates for example eal mc^2 energy time over space equals matter time the thir power over space to the 3 power times the speed of light squared that&#x27;s speed is s/ T squar is s s^2 over t^2 you multiply it and it works out the equation works out so um the uh equals mc^ s is one of the few things that Einstein got right and um uh we&#x27;ll leave it there so thanks for tuning in and uh we&#x27;ll be back with a different uh uh contribution from Larson tomorrow and our next discussion of the reciprocal system of theory thanks for</p>
