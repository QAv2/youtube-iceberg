            <p>so E8 is an algebra called a Lee algebra it has a geometric object associated with it called the E8 algebraic root lattice and that&#x27;s an eight-dimensional object you can call it a crystal if you want it&#x27;s an eight-dimensional Crystal and it has very powerful and special mathematical qualities that a lot of physicists and mathematicians appreciate such as its association with the largest division algebra the octonian it&#x27;s uh also uh the root lattice Point set is the densest packing of seven spheres or eight dimensional balls in 8D and as a uh group it&#x27;s the a Le group associated with these algebras it&#x27;s the largest of the exceptional Le groups so all of these uh three things make it beautiful to mathematicians and useful to some physicist</p>
