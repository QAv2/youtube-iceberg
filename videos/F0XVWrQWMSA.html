            <p>[Music] well hey everyone how you doing today welcome back to my YouTube channel I want to talk to you today what I think is probably the most ex exciting story happening right now for those of us interested in this these sort of topics it has to do with the cold fusion and low energy nuclear reaction also known as leoner energy production systems which when we&#x27;re filming this here just at the beginning of 2015 have really made a lot of progress if you haven&#x27;t seen my previous video about cold fusion and hearing the people from the Italian lab Nea you can just watch it right here but just to sum it up you know we learned earlier in 2014 from Dr Victorio violante that they had succeeded in making Cold Fusion Energy work and it took a while but they got it to work by putting impurities in the Palladium doping the Palladium as it&#x27;s called and actually creating a bumpier surface because cold fusion is not a chemical reaction it&#x27;s some other sort of nuclear reaction or other process which we&#x27;re still learning to understand but what we learned from Dr violante is that it works through resonance the Palladium and the derium um elements have to interact through a type of vibration through a type of resonance well a really exciting thing happened a couple of months ago is that Bill Gates founder of Microsoft and at this point the wealthiest man in the world visited Dr viante at Ena in Italy or a facility that they had procured for the meeting and we found out that Bill Gates is a fan of cold fusion and Leonard low energy nuclear reaction there have been a lot of breakthroughs in leoner just a few months ago from the team working with uh Ernesto Rossi on the so-called ecat the energy catalyzer and there was a third-party report um even though it was controversial but the six phds who examined the device said that over a 30-day period it had produced a lot of excess heat about 1.5 megawatt of energy beyond what had been put in to get it going in a one month period that&#x27;s enough to heat uh a whole bunch of homes over one month and the cost is low so there&#x27;s a lot of excitement building in this area and I think for those of us who are interested in a lot of the topics that we talk about here on my YouTube channel and on my blog new Crystal mind we found out that the lener reaction also works by having the nickel and the hydrogen interact through resonance Rossy called it on the nickel powder it&#x27;s not just any nickel powder you put in this little reactor that some people call the dog bone because it&#x27;s a small thing that looks like a dog bone it actually has to have what Rossy calls tubercules or little bumps on the surface of the nickel why because that sort of shape creates a particular sort of energy resonance which produces a reaction at a very subatomic level apparently this is the exciting thing we&#x27;re not exactly sure what produces the energy some people think it&#x27;s a type of neutron tunneling uh not the type of electron tunneling we used to from superconductivity but another type of tunneling process where the neutrons emerge in a way that creates excess heat whatever the reaction is whether it&#x27;s a nuclear reaction or not this is very exciting the implications for all of us here is that cold fusion and Lenard and all the other Associated Technologies could create an abundance of low power non-polluting energy that has no chemical uh waste products no radioactive side effects or anything like that at a cost perhaps one tenth of what we&#x27;re piding for energy right now which would provide provide lots of abundant energy to third world countries who need it so they could stop cutting down their forests for fuel uh using coal like China does polluting dirty sources of energy and replac with clean uh abundant sources of energy and this is perhaps why Bill Gates would be interested in developing this so I think this has profound implications for all of this you might have noticed that the price of oil has been dropping a whole bunch in the latter part of 2014 into 2015 is it because of the news of the success of these cold fusion liner projects or is it just happening because of its own reasons or a combination thereof we don&#x27;t know at this point but we can see that things are really changing and this could lead to an entirely new technological Paradigm for all of us away from polluting expensive sources of energy under centralized control to cheaper non-polluting decentralized energy sources that would be in each neighborhood or each home or each apartment complex or something like that so I think these are very exciting developments and I think something you should be watching in the future because it really impacts all of us in a huge way well that&#x27;s all I want to say for you now keep your eyes on the resonance and we&#x27;ll be following this topic and we&#x27;ll talk to you soon take care for now and bye</p>
