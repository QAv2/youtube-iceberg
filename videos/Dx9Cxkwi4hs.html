internal documents very chilling information where a detective is basically saying that they cannot look their wife in the eyes and tell her that they are willing to risk the life of their family by pursuing this case so they&#x27;re basically asking to get off the case a lot more on that coming up very soon why won&#x27;t the DA&#x27;s office say whether or not David McGowan was looking into this their official stance is that David McGowan was not looking into this that is their official stance according to their spokespeople but at this point there have been a lot of questions that have
