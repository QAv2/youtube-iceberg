            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Hello, this is Dr. James and today I&#x27;m going to talk about Mercury vortex engine. Now um if you look at the ancient scripts they talk uh from India they talk about viamanas anti-gravity spacecrafts that they&#x27;re building thousands of years ago and they make reference to using mercury uh a mercury vortex engine to uh create the anti-gravity field. And so I wanted to do some experiments. So let&#x27;s take a little look at this.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s kind of an interesting experiment. Okay. Okay, so in order to make this work, I got a car battery here. This is a car battery that someone was throwing out. I saved it and uh they put out a lot of amps.</p>
<p>Okay. And this is our Mercury Vortex engine right here. And then in order to switch the current, I got uh my buddy suggested this. This is a battery disconnect. It can disconnect or um interrupt 1,000 amps of DC current.</p>
<p>And I got this off of Amazon. Oops. Anyway, and uh wanted to do some measurements of the current to see what kind of currents going through there. So, this is a current transformer. Let&#x27;s take a look at this guy.</p>
<p>So, the way this is made is I have two opposing magnetic fields. I have a north to north pointing inward and the mercury basically runs in a track right under the magnet like that. So, I wanted a fringe field. So the magnetic fields are pointing out like that because in order to get a force in a circular direction need a cross field. It&#x27;s the right hand ruled.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s E crossb. So if the electric field is in this way the magnetic field is radial then the force is circular around. So you need to have uh the magnetic fields opposing. So I have a top plate and a bottom plate. And I had to make them out of stainless because uh copper is uh amalgams with mercury.</p>
<p>It gets dissolved by it. So we&#x27;ll take a look here. And I tell you, this thing gets super hot when you run current through it. It&#x27;s like a arc welder. And I left a little hole in the top so I can put mercury into there.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;ll do some testing on this guy. And oh, this is fiberglass. I wanted to make it out of something strong. So it&#x27;s a sandwich of fiberglass. Bottom fiberglasses hold the magnet in the center.</p>
<p>Then you have the uh stainless steel plate to conduct electricity. So the electric fields like this. Remember it&#x27;s between the two plates. So it&#x27;s vertical. The magnetic field is fringed.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s outward like this. It goes around like that. So fiberglass, stainless steel, fiberglass. This is cut out in the middle so that the mercury can travel in a circle. Then the top plate is stainless steel and then fiberglass again to hold the magnet in place.</p>
<p>So basically the insulators is fiberglass in there. Okay. And we&#x27;ll do some testing on this guy. Let&#x27;s see if we can make this work. Okay.</p>
<p>Not only uh did the Viamanos claim to use Mercury, but uh for their anti-gravity vortex engines, anti-gravity propulsion systems, but the uh the Nazis supposedly were working on a pro project called the Nazi Bell, which supposedly used uh rotating mercury and lots of electricity to produce anti-gravitational effects. And it was supposedly the um experiments that led to the Nazi flying discs. Anyway, here is um some diagrams that I made so you can understand what the machine is. So this is magnets with opposing poles here. And the reason why I did that is because I want to have the magnetic field be pointing out radially out near the edge where the mercury is going to go around.</p>
<p>So it has a radial magnetic field pointing this way and an electric field. See it&#x27;s plus and minus this. So this this is the magnet here. This is the top electrode, insulator, bottom electrode and opposing magnet. So electric field is going to be vertical like that.</p>
<p>And the magnetic field is going to be pointing outward in a radial direction. So that will cause the mercury to rotate. you have a B C or E which is vertical cross B. Well, anyway, it goes in a aimothal direction. So, it&#x27;ll cause I just have a little mercury bead in there and it&#x27;ll rotate around like that.</p>
<p>I just wanted to test to see if this concept works and I want to see what the impedance is. See how much voltage and current I need to drive it because every every u load has a certain impedance. You want to have a source that can drive that impedance. And so I figured a car battery I figure it&#x27;s very low low impedance, very high current, low voltage. So a car battery can put out a huge amount of current.</p>
<p>So we&#x27;ll test that out. Okay. So anyway, here&#x27;s the diagram for my ver Mercury vortex engine. Here&#x27;s my Mercury Vortex engine. There&#x27;s the disc.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s a high current switch and we have it at 10.5 volts. I hear it running and the voltage drops to 1.7 volts. Holy cow. It looks like the voltage is slowly recovering. I better charge it up some more.</p>
<p>1.7 volts. Wow. Okay. So, here is our measurement of the current using a piercing coil. And it looks like it is is 5 volts per division.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s 1 2 3 3 volts high. So, that&#x27;s 15 volts. I&#x27;m going to have to do the calculation cuz the Pearson here, let&#x27;s take a look. Here we have our switch. We have the Pearson.</p>
<p>The Pearson is 0.025. 025 uh amps per volt, right? 025 amps per volt. And here is our mercury device again. Oh, you can see it. See it moving around in there.</p>
<p>See, it drops down every once in a while. Look at that. You can see it drop in the top. Yeah. See, definitely definitely moving around in there.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on here. It looks like the current&#x27;s starting to drop down over time. Okay, I need to run it for a little bit longer pulse and see what happens. Run. Stop.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s interesting. Look like the current drops right off after start up. Holy cow. Oh, you know what? That&#x27;s That&#x27;s probably the coil the core saturating. Yeah, it&#x27;s got a time constant that it can integrate over and then it crashes.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, that&#x27;s the core saturating there. So we&#x27;ll say 15 volts. I have to do the calculation. 15 volts divided by 0.25.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s basic 0025. Okay. Okay. So yeah, that&#x27;s the core saturation. I did some calculations and it was uh about 15 volts here divided by uh 0.025 025 volts per amp.</p>
<p>And so that&#x27;s about 600 amps. And if we look at the battery here, it&#x27;s rated for 790 crank amps, cold crank amps, but it was thrown away. I found it in the trash. And uh it&#x27;s leaking down to 10 volts. So I I think 600 amps seems reasonable for this thing.</p>
<p>So we have our high current switch here. our mercury device, our piercing coil. Okay. Very cool. Okay.</p>
<p>See, you can see it drop down after I run it for a little bit. So, it&#x27;s definitely spinning around. It&#x27;s dropping down, but it loses kinetic energy. Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>A little closer look. Here&#x27;s our Mercury Vortex engine, our high current switch, and here is a Pearson 0.025 volts per amp. Okay. And that&#x27;s a setup right there. Okay.</p>
<p>my guitar pickup on the coil or the the Mercury Vortex engine here. And uh got some kind of big transient at the beginning and then this noisy stuff like something&#x27;s moving. I don&#x27;t know. We&#x27;ll try this again. Turn it on.</p>
<p>There we go. Okay. One stop. Okay. Some kind of big transient at the beginning.</p>
<p>See a big transient there and then looks like some kind of periodic motion here maybe. Let&#x27;s see if I can find the cursors. T cursors. Okay. So that is at about 400 hertz.</p>
<p>Look up there. 400 hertz. See that on the camera? Okay. 400 hertz. Is that for real? Try run stop again.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. 335 hertz this time. down into the middle more. Let&#x27;s try increasing the uh scale here.</p>
<p>See if we can see anything meaningful here. Let me this a little bit. There&#x27;s definitely something going on there. It&#x27;s making some kind of noise. Not sure if I can see a frequency in that or not.</p>
<p>Maybe some kind of periodic motion here at the beginning. Okay, that&#x27;s 204 hertz. Let&#x27;s see that on the scope. Okay, this one&#x27;s 222 hertz. See, it seems to be pretty regular.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what this is. Some other noise. Maybe it&#x27;s making a lot of noise when it&#x27;s making contact in there. I don&#x27;t know. Okay, taking a closer look.</p>
<p>It looks like there is a regular ripple at low level that is about 2.63 kHz. If you can see that on the thing, the camera and those big things, maybe that is the oscillation of the mercury in there. Maybe it&#x27;s really going super fast. And uh maybe these are just where it&#x27;s breaking contact and it&#x27;s making a lot of noise when it does that. That&#x27;s a possibility.</p>
<p>See, there&#x27;s a big transient. Then you see this regular ripple, lowle ripple in the background. I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s pretty fast though if it&#x27;s really 2.63 kHz. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
