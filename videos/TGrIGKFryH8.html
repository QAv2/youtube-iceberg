            <p>so this is a bi-field brain uh saucer um the top canopy uh is essentially it&#x27;s a parabola um there&#x27;s a dielectric separator uh which is polystyrene that&#x27;s about four and a half centimeters long um here is a lower uh electrode uh it&#x27;s not connected to anything in actual fact this is a concentrator uh this thing is is similar to a parabolic dish reflector um so in actual fact this is the uh you know this is the parabolic reflector this is the parabolic dish this is a reflector and this is um a secondary electrode so with uh 12 volts as you can see it lifts up so and it&#x27;s our key um from the electrode to the uh concentrator in the geometric center so yeah saucer as a parabolic dish so that&#x27;s six amps 12 volts to get that kind of lift and i&#x27;m going to have a look at even bigger ones example of a parabola saucer uh with simply uh it&#x27;s just got a wooden separator between the um dish reflector and the concentrator electrode um so essentially the dielectric in this case is air so this is again about 12 volts air dielectric so this flies very very well with the air dielectric so that&#x27;s air so this is an example of what happens if you get the geometry wrong because in this case uh yeah the spacing is okay but um the geometry of the the canopy is incorrect it should be it should be a parabola um so yeah you guess you might get some lift but it&#x27;s not going to be uh as good as it would be if it was probably concentrated</p>
