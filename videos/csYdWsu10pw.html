            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>The newly released video captured by a US Reaper drone shows a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen. Suddenly, on the left side of your screen, you see a Hellfire missile zip in, strike that unidentified object, and bounce right off it. When we slow the video down, you see the Hellfire missile continue to travel on its path. That The trajectory becoming clearer from this zoomed out angle, not shown as a second reaper drone that launched the missile. Congressman Eric Burleson shared the video at a House Oversight Committee on what the military calls unidentified aerial phenomena, better known as UFOs.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bounced right off, um. And it kept going. It kept going and it looks like the debris was taken with it. Yeah, what, -- what the hell is -- that? We&#x27;ve never seen a Hellfire missile hit a target and bounce off.</p>
<p>Lou Elizondo is a former senior intelligence officer with the Pentagon. The Hellfire makes a hit, a kinetic strike on something solid. There&#x27;s usually not much left of, of whatever it is it&#x27;s hitting. Uh, it&#x27;s very, very destructive. What, what seems to happen is that the missile is either um redirected or in some case, perhaps glances off the object.</p>
<p>Uh, and continues on its way. A recent government report revealed the government received more than 750 new UAP sightings in the 2024 fiscal year, leaving lawmakers digging into the mystery -- and national security concerns posed by these -- objects. Does this video scare you guys? Yes or no? Yes, Wiggins. Yes.</p>
<p>Yes. Me too. There&#x27;s a lot of information that&#x27;s not in that video, like what mission they were on and as they said, what are we even looking at here? We do know that the US military was conducting air strikes against Houthi targets at the time. Pentagon officials tell CBS News no comment. Charlie Dagana, CBS News, Washington.</p>
