            <p>[Music] welcome to down to earth with terry verts where we talk about what matters down here on planet earth today i am super excited to have lou elizondo on our show lou is a former pentagon official he was also the director of the atip program which we&#x27;ll talk about and a uap expert unidentified aerial phenomenon lou thank you for joining me terry it is absolutely my sincere pleasure and i just want to say before we begin uh you know i really really enjoy your show and and also thank you for uh for your service to our country i think i&#x27;m probably more excited to do this interview than you are probably excited to to interview me this is a wonderful treat for me no i&#x27;m i&#x27;m so glad and thank you for coming on we had uh chris melanon a few weeks ago and he was amazing and so this is kind of the follow-on to chris&#x27;s episode for the for the followers of our show well unfortunately i don&#x27;t want to disappoint but i&#x27;m not sure terry i&#x27;m going to be able to match up to my uh to my esteemed colleague chris so i&#x27;m just going to put that out there right now to you and your audience uh i uh this will probably be a bit of a disappointment having him on first is like you know having a rock star on stage first and then followed up by the warm-up man nah this is uh so we&#x27;ve got you know before it was like yeah it was a warm-up band before this is now queen just came on stage or uh or uh aerosmith just just took the stage um so first of all i gotta say i normally don&#x27;t sound like this i mean this is our first time doing a podcast my hometown here in texas baseball team um is in the state playoffs i drove up to texas a m last night two-hour drive they&#x27;re 30-0 they got a kid who&#x27;s gonna get drafted in the first round who made the most unbelievable double play spinning 95 mile an hour through the first base i&#x27;ve never seen a double play like that and they hadn&#x27;t lost all year they&#x27;re ranked number one in the nation by max preps and they lost they they looked awful they had the worst game i you know they lost ten to six so my voice is a little bit worn out after that late night game last night sure well terry unfortunately this is my normal voice and you&#x27;re gonna have to endure with it uh because this it does not get any better this is my unfortunately what what you see is what you get with me i&#x27;m with you and this this is my normal face too um the people always tell me i&#x27;ve got a face for a radio so i&#x27;m not sure i think i think that&#x27;s a compliment but i&#x27;m not sure um so so lou this um this has been kind of a crazy month or two months or a year or several years really about uaps we used to call them ufos now they&#x27;re uaps there&#x27;s there&#x27;s there&#x27;s stuff happening in the air and that we don&#x27;t fully understand and i&#x27;m going to come at this as you know i&#x27;m a former astronaut i&#x27;ve never seen you aliens or every speech i do when i speak for a living somebody asked me about aliens and i&#x27;m happy to talk about it i&#x27;ve never seen one i&#x27;ve never seen a ufo myself but the things that people have been seeing now are so compelling and it&#x27;s not some old guy that&#x27;s really into mushrooms and he was really into heroin in the 70s and he&#x27;s seeing aliens this is not what&#x27;s happening at all we have data we have radar tracking stuff and so i what i really want to do i don&#x27;t have a i don&#x27;t have normally i have kind of a map of the interview i have nothing for you i want to find out are there drones out there are there balloons out there are there are there truly other things out there and this is kind of the where i want i just want to hear what you have to say because you&#x27;re so interested you&#x27;ve been on tv you&#x27;ve been in documentaries you&#x27;ve been in movies you know you&#x27;re you&#x27;re in your and you were at the pentagon so i just want to have that conversation with you yeah sure terry well look um let me begin by saying yes to all the above um are there drones yes are there balloons yes are there weather anomalies yes are there aircraft yes are there missiles are there you name it is there all is there conventional technology out there that we misidentify all the time absolutely um that&#x27;s but but that&#x27;s not really what our concern was when i was in in the pentagon um our concern were those things that fell outside the normal envelope performance envelope of of conventional aircraft that you would at least consider to be conventional aircraft to include you know even some of the more more exotic ones uh that we we you know use some of the more high performance capabilities um let me if i may let me start also with with this um the question is is there a species that is able to to to be a space faring species and the answer is unequivocally yes we are we are one of them proof is in the pudding just just look at us you yourself spent some time in space uh someone built some sort of technology to to to if you will blow you out of earth&#x27;s orbit albeit temporarily and uh you know you you you are living proof that that living things can indeed can can become space-faring now the question you ask me is are there things out there that are not us that have that same potential and that&#x27;s precisely what we&#x27;re trying to find out terry uh there are there&#x27;s enough data to suggest that there are things operating within our our own airspace that is a it&#x27;s not ours b we&#x27;re pretty sure it&#x27;s not foreign adversarial c it&#x27;s been doing this for a long time and d uh there&#x27;s not a whole lot we can do about it and so there therein lies the issue my my background i&#x27;m not a ufo guy i&#x27;m not a ufologist i&#x27;m just a former investigator and an intelligence officer so my job was always to to very simply collect the truth and speak the truth that&#x27;s it and then present that information to a jury and let them decide uh in this case you and your audience are the jury what i happen to personally think about something or feel about something is rather irrelevant to be honest with you it&#x27;s just like an investigator you know you don&#x27;t the jury doesn&#x27;t ask well how do you feel about this it doesn&#x27;t matter how i feel what matters is what does the data say and and then what matters is what you and your audience think about this or feel about it not me and so from that perspective my job the job of chris mellon is is is fairly narrowly focused to really just collecting the facts and then presenting those facts to to the jury or in this case a court of public opinion um if there is enough information there that that your government my government was willing to spend our taxpayer dollars and by the way it wasn&#x27;t chunk change either uh to to look into this um and and uh the results of that information was was very compelling and now you have the eyewitness testimony of pilots uh and and and very you know no-nonsense people such as yourself who spent time in the military spend time even in space coming out and say yeah you know what i didn&#x27;t want to say this before but but i saw something kind of weird too and uh you know there there we there we have it yeah the thing that strikes me about that is that the kind of people who are speaking up you know the fravor and these kind of guys and gals are the kind of people when they wake up in the morning their goal for the day is to not see a ufo like as a fighter pilot they don&#x27;t want to see ufos though i can&#x27;t imagine anything i would less other than crashing you know if i saw something like that and i reported it i would be that guy i would get a nickname in the squatter and i&#x27;d have a new call sign you know these are the kind of people that are not wanting you know to see this and yet they have seen it and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re kind of doing their duty to uh to uh speak up about it so well if you&#x27;re lucky they&#x27;ll change your call sign if you&#x27;re unlucky they&#x27;ll take you off flight status they&#x27;ll give you a psychological evaluation and you know you&#x27;ll spend the rest of your commun career probably uh you know cleaning out jet turbine engines what is atip talk about that i mentioned the advanced aerospace threat identification program is that right is it so harry reid uh funding is that what that was well it was your funding it wasn&#x27;t harry reid finding that harry reid was you know harry reid didn&#x27;t pay for it harry reid was was courageous enough to to support this effort and champion it but but make no mistake you paid for it your audience paid for it taxpayer money paid for it and uh you know it was it was a very very much a legitimate program it had evolved a little bit over time from the from its nascent stage when it was first uh you know on the books and i think late 2007 early 2008 uh it morphed a little bit it was originally under the the umbrella called awesome and uh asap was you know another wonderful dod acronym uh that was used but later on that it really kind of evolved into into the to the eight what everybody now knows is a tip and now the uap task force so yeah when i came to nasa as an astronaut i was an air force guy so i thought you know it&#x27;s like learning a new language i thought the air force was pretty impressive at acronyms but nobody holds a candle to nasa it is like it really is a new language it you know it&#x27;s like i had to learn russian and i had to learn nasa when i went to nasa um so the so these are programs that are that were officially funded by the dod and they were looking into this phenomenon and now there&#x27;s a new bill that just came out at that the very tail end of the trump administration somebody snuck in this language that then the dod had to come up with a report within six months that of what&#x27;s going on with all this stuff and and i was laughing with chris when chris there&#x27;s some poor and i i don&#x27;t know and one of the proudest things about my 30-plus years of air force service is that i&#x27;ve never been to the pentagon i&#x27;ve literally never set foot i you know god bless you i find myself every day that i&#x27;ve never been there but um i can imagine in my brain i see this poor 06 it&#x27;s some colonel or maybe a navy captain who has to go around and meet the admiral and meet the general and everybody hates him he hates his job now he&#x27;s never going to make admiral or general because it sucks to be him and i i can just imagine there&#x27;s not a lot of excitement inside the building is that true or are people it was probably different in 2008 i&#x27;m guessing now it&#x27;s a little bit more accepted but i can i can just this bureaucratic resistance to what&#x27;s yeah i mean i&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll share with you uh we effectually those of us who worked at the pentagon we had kind of a nickname for it we officially referred to it as as the death star and so you know you&#x27;re going you got you get your assignment back at the death star and you got to go back to headquarters um you know there unfortunately the uap task force was born out of political pressure um there was enough pressure being placed on the pentagon publicly and from our legislators that the pentagon was was was forced to create this capability now there were elements in there that i have to applaud for example uh depsec f norquist um he took a a chance and created this because he knew it was important to follow but unfortunately there are also pockets of resistance within the pentagon and and those pockets of resistance are are still very influential and very vocal and and yeah they make people&#x27;s lives miserable why are we doing this why are we studying this you know why are we spending our time money and resources on it uh and you know ultimately those pockets were never briefed they were certainly not briefs by me and they they i suspect they&#x27;re probably reluctant because it&#x27;s first of all you have mission creep as you know in the government right so we get every day we get more and more added to our plate nothing ever falls off you know everything&#x27;s a priority right two uh i think there&#x27;s a fundamental lack of understanding of what we&#x27;re dealing with and when you&#x27;re looking at for example the height of the cold war um and by the way the the efforts of atip were have been going on for decades it wasn&#x27;t called at that one time was called project blue book and whatnot but the bottom line we we&#x27;ve seen these things in our skies for for quite some time displaying these beyond next generation technologies um so so we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve always known the real the problem is there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot we could do about it and also at the time we were we were thrust in the middle of what we called the cold war which by the way coincidentally wasn&#x27;t very cold was pretty hot war to be honest with you but um you know the big threat there was nuclear proliferation and and then the threat of of soviet union so those were very clearly definable threats and you and i were products of of that genre and so uh that was that was you know that&#x27;s a very clear uh enemy that you can look at and say okay they&#x27;ve got nukes they&#x27;re hostile they don&#x27;t like us we&#x27;re playing this game of chess on a global scale through proxy wars and whatnot that&#x27;s a very easy enemy to define yeah when you are talking about uaps that we don&#x27;t there&#x27;s two things to determine if something is a threat we have capabilities versus intent well we&#x27;ve seen some of the capabilities we have no idea the intent and since there&#x27;s no overt hostile action being taken by these things and a lot of the information at the time was anecdotal i think there was a conscious decision by the pentagon brass to say you know what yes we kind of know they&#x27;re there but since they&#x27;re not bothering us let&#x27;s go ahead and focus our time and attention on on those things that that that are bothering us right absolutely you know it crisis du jour so i think i think that probably is part of it too there is a a tremendous amount of social stigma and taboo yeah associated with this topic because we haven&#x27;t done ourselves any favors we&#x27;ve spent 70 years putting out you know silly hollywood b movies and people wearing tin foil hats and you know these these these these ufo conventions where people wear green suits and elvis on the mother ship when in reality that&#x27;s not at all what we&#x27;re talking about what we&#x27;re talking about some sort of advanced technology that is is in some cases behaving fairly provocatively at this point and when i say provocatively i don&#x27;t mean necessarily hostile what i mean is provocative yeah uh and uh yeah and and you know now it&#x27;s to the point where where we really simply can&#x27;t ignore it anymore so uh that&#x27;s kind of kind of where we are at you know as a snapshot so to speak so how many years were you there doing this digging around in the at the pentagon uh almost 10 from 2008 and then uh i left in 2017. okay did you meet chris mellon while you were at the pentagon then i did i did uh you know very very tenacious man i respect chris tremendously um i&#x27;ve said before there&#x27;s five people on this hand that i can i can count and if they told me he called me at four in the morning and said put your boots on uh i need you to go with me to war i would do it and chris mellon&#x27;s in that category this is this is a person who&#x27;s no nonsense held one of the most senior positions in the pentagon also worked for uh our legislative branch was one of the the founding fathers of special operations command socom and um you know he he found his way to me and and the conversations i i spent about four or five months probably pushing him away uh and trying to come up with every excuse i could not to breathe him on and ultimately he had managed to jump through all the the administrative hoops uh and and at that point there was no reason why i i had to tell him because he had all the clearances that i asked him to get right which frankly between us i thought it would never happen you know i told one of my ops officers that said well we don&#x27;t have to worry about him we&#x27;ll never see him again because i know some of those read-ons took about about a year to get if not longer if he came back the next week so at that point i i i recognize okay this guy this guy means business he&#x27;s like he&#x27;s an amazing guy oh he is he is absolutely he&#x27;s he&#x27;s truly a national treasure uh incredible human he does not have to be doing this uh you know he&#x27;s got a a tremendous reputation from from from his family right and yet he decided to to risk it all to have this conversation with the american people so for that i i respect him tremendously he&#x27;s and he&#x27;s also a very dear friend too right he&#x27;s a good guy i mean he&#x27;s chris mellon from pittsburgh uh it was funny i was telling my friend he&#x27;s he&#x27;s running a business and he&#x27;s in pittsburgh because of carnegie mellon and the amount of tech uh the the people there like there&#x27;s a lot of great uh talent to hire and i was like you know you&#x27;re carnegie mellon i need to put you in touch with this guy chris blah blah and then i was like wait a minute he&#x27;s chris mallon okay never mind yeah it&#x27;s never never mind chris you&#x27;re you&#x27;re already attached with carnegie mellon so yeah amazing i&#x27;d say so yeah i it took me i&#x27;m slow man i&#x27;m just the air force fighter pilot so and his family is beautiful too by the way i mean just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not just chris he he&#x27;s got this incredible support mechanism his children his his lovely wife just just to you know sup super super super human being in a super family right well for those listening to the podcast if you get a chance to listen to the episode with chris mellon because it was pretty good and and this will be a good follow-on so you&#x27;re at the pentagon you&#x27;re working on this a-tip program which in some ways is like a follow-on to project blue book that you know we all saw tv shows about when we were kids um and there&#x27;s there&#x27;s [ __ ] happening in the skies and what so i i want to talk about like what was happening like what could be going on that would cause the pentagon and harry reid and all this millions of dollars and under secretaries of defense you know focused on it what was happening i just kind of want to lay it out everybody&#x27;s seen the navy video and blah blah blah let&#x27;s just talk about like from a to z what was going on what what has been happening yeah well when you say what was happening is actually uh uh it was the opposite is why why chris and i got so engaged because we kept getting reports from the field um in some cases some some some very uh emotional pleas from from some very senior people saying hey look i got these all over the ship you know i can&#x27;t keep people below deck forever what do you want me to do right and so uh my intent was to you know bring the calvary sound the bugle and bring the calvary say look i got it sir got it ma&#x27;am we are working on some solutions for you the problem is the calvary never came i would go up and i&#x27;d brief it to seniors and they said this is interesting this is fantastic great uh but we don&#x27;t want to let the boss know and see their boss was what is a senior so a senior is uh the number one number two people in the pentagon we&#x27;re talking about people that are working with the secretary of defense in his suite that are the the senior i don&#x27;t want to say their position because people know who they are and they haven&#x27;t come out publicly yet right but these were were some of the most senior people in the department of defense uh they were his his direct his his confidants think of uh his uh senior advisors right i know and i know you&#x27;re talking about this is why i&#x27;m having this conversation is one of those seniors approach me so anyway yeah and and they&#x27;re and by the way it&#x27;s for the record it wasn&#x27;t their fault okay they&#x27;re you know hindsight always being 2020. i understood i was frustrated because i was an operator my job is to to identify issues and find solutions um we had a new secretary of defense jim mattis this is a person that i had the honor to serve with in combat an incredible human being but the bureaucracy was yeah incredible one of the again my top five for sure yeah um and this is a man as you know and i know always has a career of always wanting to have more his successes based on more information not less right the praetorian guards were keeping that from him um for and you know i i understand now why um because they were trying to protect the boss he had this incredible reputation as you know mad dog mattis the man the myth the legend and all of a sudden if he got questioned by congress or the media say have you been briefed on ufos they didn&#x27;t want to put him in that situation they were they were trying to protect him while at the same time find solutions uh for for our issues at the more tactical and operational level but but unfortunately there was this almost paralysis by analysis where i&#x27;d go back we&#x27;d perform more briefings i&#x27;d get more eyewitnesses to come in they would brief we&#x27;d show videos we&#x27;d show you know analysis we&#x27;d show photos we&#x27;d have the reports and whatnot and uh you know there was this this hesitation um the first person i briefed they actually didn&#x27;t even want to have a conversation i spent an hour and a half briefing this individual uh and and at the conclusion of the briefing i i remember clear his day yesterday he looked at me and he said so how does how does you know miami miami hurricanes do it you know how&#x27;s the football team doing this season and i was uh you know i was i was shocked because i spent an hour and a half and it just wasn&#x27;t seen you just couldn&#x27;t process it right right and then other times i remember you tell i would i would brief a senior and they&#x27;d kind of look at you and kind of smile after 20 minutes and said man is this a joke or are you kind of wasting my time here right because i got i got real important things to do and then lastly uh one of the seniors um fortunately took it serious and and he actually a former fighter pilot himself and he was actually very helpful um unfortunately we still failed to get it to to to secretary mattis but he was sympathetic and and he he looked at it and he took the briefings and we had the you know pilots come in the radar operators come in and and you know he he i i truly believe sincerely he was trying to find a solution but he he was also caught between protecting his boss yeah and and also you know doing what&#x27;s necessary to help the field uh but at the end of the day you know i&#x27;ve been doing this for for almost 10 years and and finally you know for me the clock ran out i said look guys i i don&#x27;t have the horsepower i don&#x27;t have the funding and the resources anymore to do the right job and and i&#x27;m i&#x27;m i&#x27;m failing the people in the field they&#x27;re they&#x27;re expecting me for his resolution and i keep telling them we&#x27;re gonna give him one and and and we don&#x27;t and so finally i i out of protest i submitted my resignation and by the way for the record that senior at dod i have no hard feelings at all about uh he&#x27;s i i if i was in his position hell i i probably would have done it exactly like he did so again this is not a blame game you know this is just the bureaucracy it really it not only did it it affected me and and the people in the field but i think it also affected him as well i think he was put in a really difficult position uh and the bureaucracy didn&#x27;t there was no mechanism to report this type of information yeah uh you know so and he is new to the job so he just came in he&#x27;s like look you know we don&#x27;t even have a uh usdi yet we&#x27;ve got acting usdi half of the chain of command isn&#x27;t even in place yet you know uh we gotta we gotta sit on this a little bit longer and you know a little bit longer became a little bit longer and a little bit longer so it&#x27;s the pentagon it&#x27;s bureaucracy one of those individuals actually pulled me aside at a at a meeting one time and he was like terry you gotta and he told me what was going on and it kind of blew me away so that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re having this conversation is because of one of those individuals so there&#x27;s so the bottom line is for the listeners there&#x27;s bureaucracy it is impressive um at the the pentagon bureaucracy it&#x27;s the largest organization in human history i mean it is in terms of dollars there&#x27;s never been a larger organization so you can imagine when there&#x27;s you know a billion here a billionaire before long you&#x27;re talking about real money there&#x27;s a lot of internal resistance to anything that&#x27;s gonna change whatever i i can only imagine but you said something just then lou and that in that this what you were just saying that kind of blew me away there were navy boat ship captains that were having to keep their crew under below decks because there were things flying around that&#x27;s correct like that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a hollywood movie from the 80s oh i&#x27;ll tell you man some of this stuff was was absolutely riveting one of these stories let&#x27;s talk about the stuff yeah okay well you know i&#x27;ll share with you uh one one interesting um uh event that occurred uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty incredible um you have uh i&#x27;m not gonna go into too much detail i want people to know who it is i you know the person is kind of very cagey about this but uh uh you have a helicopter going out of uh a caribbean island on a regular basis because the navy likes to test fire uh some of its its cruise missile technology and whatnot and what will happen is that that after the the cruise missile runs out of fuel it kind of falls into the splashes into the ocean it will sink and then at a certain time it kind of it kind of rises up and we go and fetch it uh and we we analyze it for telemetry and things like that uh long story short helicopter crew goes out uh to to recover one of these things uh as they are recovering it uh the first time the missile uh they&#x27;re pulling up and and something what was described round and circular about the size of a small island a black dark color starts rising to the surface it doesn&#x27;t break the water but it starts rising to the surface they thought wow that&#x27;s really really peculiar well the next month goes around and they go out to retrieve this uh this this another missile that was test-fired and this time we&#x27;ve got a frogman hanging down from the rope about to to latch on to the to the missile and uh this thing starts coming out of the water again and if you know about the puerto rican trench out there you&#x27;re talking about water that&#x27;s 22 000 feet deep it&#x27;s the second deepest part of the ocean the thing starts rising up and and that&#x27;s the thing is starting to come to the surface the frogmen is literally trying to climb the rope they&#x27;re doing an emergency ascent everybody is absolutely panic at the disco freaking out uh you know what the hell is that what&#x27;s going on and as they start to pull up uh it&#x27;s it it sucks the missile underwater and then disappears never to be seen again uh i mean there&#x27;s there&#x27;s there&#x27;s there&#x27;s incidents like that that just kind of make the hair stand up on the back your neck what when was that when was that uh i it was a little while ago i don&#x27;t want to go into too much detail because like i said i the person wants the privacy yeah uh i i know the individual personally i&#x27;ve talked to him he&#x27;s not uh he does not want any type of of publicity he&#x27;s actually i think kind of uh averse to it he doesn&#x27;t want to be he&#x27;s kind of seen what happened to me and others so he&#x27;s like you know i don&#x27;t want any part of that like i said in the beginning the kind of people who are making these reports are the kind of people who wake up in the morning and they say all right today i&#x27;m not going to see a ufo because if i do it&#x27;s going to screw my career and then if you&#x27;re the ufo guy at the pentagon how does that help your career right so that&#x27;s unbelievable i&#x27;ve never heard that lou and even in the doc i&#x27;ve watched a phenomenon and i&#x27;ve you know i&#x27;ve watched several of the things that you&#x27;ve been on i&#x27;ve never heard that story before yeah um so in my mind all these different events and i wanna i&#x27;d like for you to maybe walk through the timeline or just categorize them there&#x27;s the tic tacs these non-descript you know cylinders that the navy fighter pilot saw in 2004 that went really fast from the ocean to space to high speeds whatever and that&#x27;s truly not explainable there are these triangles that look like drones that have lights flashing and i think people in belgium around the world but i want you to talk about those they may or may not be drones and then there&#x27;s these things that look like balloons they&#x27;re kind of translucent balloon looking things so there&#x27;s the triangles the balloons and the tic tacs those are the three things that i&#x27;ve heard about chris talked about one that went from canada down to cuba and we weren&#x27;t able to intercept it but l let&#x27;s just like i don&#x27;t know somehow organ there&#x27;s all these things and you my brain gets confused i&#x27;m a linear thinker so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s like go a b c d what are these different things sure now there&#x27;s the island that&#x27;s floating out of the caribbean i never heard of that before yeah let&#x27;s uh let&#x27;s uh deconstruct a little bit well the island may be enigmatic of of something that we&#x27;ve seen before when the pilots first described the tic tac in 2004 they noticed an object just under the water and the water seemed to be roiling on top so right churning and so you know we we may be dealing with something something similar we don&#x27;t know uh yet but but certainly there&#x27;s some some interesting congruences two when we talk about the tic tac and then i&#x27;ll get into some of the other questions you had specifically um this is you know we call it the tic tac but you your view your audience might be surprised to know that in the 1950s these things were still being reported through official us government channels but they were being described as 40-foot white flying butane tanks which looks an awful lot like a tic-tac and then they were being described in the 60s as white flying lozenges right again cylindrical object doing performing exactly the same way was that so there&#x27;s a lot of look uh no these are some other documents that that at some point will probably see the light of day very soon um so there&#x27;s a long history here of of of these vehicles being reported and basically depending on the genre you grew up in you know it&#x27;s either a butane tank it&#x27;s a tic tac it&#x27;s a lozenge you know it&#x27;s just right it&#x27;s a label that we give because of the sign of the time but they&#x27;re describing the same object now you kind of go into a question as far as categories and descriptions so there is the historical lenticular shape or or saucer shape that people are familiar with right then there is another category or perhaps classification of observed craft which is a long cylindrical uh or oval shaped crap which tends to be a little bit bigger than than the disc shaped craft and then you have uh these much much larger triangular shaped vehicles that have been described and then the really really big ones are almost like boomerang one of the observations that we had in atip among many was that it could very well be that these vehicles look the way they do because of the specific function so what do i mean the the discs tend to be tend to be not always but tend to be observed to be a small type of craft so think of a corvette you can fit two people in a corvette and you can zoom around the streets all day long right but let&#x27;s say you now need a school bus you need something bigger than a corvette because you want to put more people in it or more equipment or supplies you know whatever uh you need a bigger vehicle and so you have that long cylindrical school bus that may be for for other reasons and then let&#x27;s say we need uh not a school bus but we need an aircraft carrier i need something so big i can put a whole lot of people a whole lot of equipment to do a very specific function well um that would maybe be your triangles it could very well be that the triangular craft was so big because they&#x27;re performing a very specific function and those tend to be the very very big craft and then on rare cage occasions are reported an enormous craft which tends to look like a boomerang think of a cylinder but bent uh and and you have this just enormous enormous vehicle there is some speculation why these vehicles are shaped the way they&#x27;re shaped and performed the way they perform i i won&#x27;t go into a lot of detail here but it may very well be that the the shape of the craft is is is specific to the function and mission of a specific no different than us in humans right uh an f-16 looks like an f-16 because it&#x27;s designed to be an interceptor whereas a b-52 looks like a b-52 because it&#x27;s designed to carry a lot of weight and drop you know bombs ordnance uh you know they&#x27;re both aircraft but but they look differently they function differently because they perform different missions okay but those are those basically uh in terms of all these things that different people are seeing there&#x27;s the triangles there&#x27;s the balloons there&#x27;s a tic tacs and there&#x27;s like ufo there&#x27;s the saucers so those kind of the four basic types yeah i mean there&#x27;s a lot of again misidentifications out there you know the more the more people get sent here&#x27;s here&#x27;s the the catch 22 in this whole thing the more people are aware of the reality of a uap the more people are going to look to the skies and the more we&#x27;re going to misidentify things right that&#x27;s okay because i think i think you have to figure out a way to separate the wheat from the chaff and in this particular case uh this is precisely what the pentagon is trying to figure out and i think people should be patient because there&#x27;s going to be a lot of things misidentified in the beginning let&#x27;s talk about the data so you know as a test pilot i used a lot of different types of radar i used a lot of different infrared cameras and tracking systems uh and in the 50s and 60s we didn&#x27;t really have great we had some stuff but you know that that data is a lot better the navy spy one radar on these aegis cruiser you know these big giant electronically scanned array radars is that true that with the higher quality tracking data that we have the better data we&#x27;re getting on these types of things is that true yeah so it is let me let me kind of put this into perspective in the old days and you made up a very good brought up a very good point let&#x27;s say you have a a radar tower you had one radar tower sending out a a a a radar beam in a particular frequency and that radar signal gets bounced back off of an object and comes back so you&#x27;re transmitting and receiving and and very much like sonar but from the electromagnetic perspective right you&#x27;re picking up that object and it&#x27;s reflection of a signal right as we got better and better with radar data uh when you talk about the spy-1 radar this is radar really isn&#x27;t just a radar it is it is a suite of collection sensors and i&#x27;m not going to go into a lot of detail here because some of it&#x27;s probably a little bit sensitive but think of a radar that now has the ability to talk to other radars and and then integrate that information and create a common operating picture of the battle space or or the operating area how about that and so it&#x27;s not just picking up its own signal it&#x27;s sending out it&#x27;s integrating other radar that&#x27;s coming in that may be you know uh airborne based radar uh ground-based radar and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s integrating all of that it&#x27;s looking at all the various different bits and pieces of information to give you a much more uh higher fidelity picture of the area and spy on a navy ship yeah right okay correct the spy one radar and so so you&#x27;re looking in essence being able to pick up a baseball at 80 000 feet that&#x27;s that&#x27;s how sensitive these things are uh which is extremely capable far much better than than what we had back in the 50s and you said it yourself you know we&#x27;ve come a long way in our evolution so it&#x27;s important to know that even our aircraft now and i don&#x27;t need to tell you this but you know what the modern-day aircraft is really much it&#x27;s pretty much a flying sensor it is designed to to pick up anything and everything it&#x27;s not just a weapons platform anymore it&#x27;s much more and that information then gets fed back to the ship and of course all that information then is is processed analyzed uh so now the same picture you&#x27;re seeing on this on on the boat can now be the same picture you&#x27;re seeing in the aircraft which is the same picture that the generals are going to be seeing you know sitting at a fob which is the same picture that people are going to be seeing on the e2 hawkeye that&#x27;s that is what we spend our money on trying to to create this this battle space awareness and so that&#x27;s the technology we&#x27;re dealing with today so when you see something on radar it&#x27;s important for your audience to know it&#x27;s not just a ghost in the machine it&#x27;s not just a blip that maybe your one particular radar is picking up because the radar systems of today are designed to automatically filter out if all this radars aren&#x27;t talking about aren&#x27;t seeing the same picture there is some sort of uh reconciliation that occurs internally to determine if something real or not and if it&#x27;s not it typically will just filter it out it&#x27;s noise right so what i&#x27;ve read and you can enlighten this when in the 2004 incident when they dave fraver and others saw the tic tacs and the and the operator operators on the ships were seeing these things that data accidentally got deleted is that true there&#x27;s been there&#x27;s been radical i guess it&#x27;s been radar data yeah i guess kind of like my my emails at the pentagon that have been accidentally deleted um yeah no i don&#x27;t sometimes it happens yeah yeah just one of those things i guess right uh yeah there&#x27;s there&#x27;s some allegations there that information look the deck logs are supposed to be to be to be be kept and they usually get sent to the national nara national archives uh for for posterity&#x27;s sake well it&#x27;s interesting because on the princeton the deck logs are missing for that very one day that they encountered the that&#x27;s weird that&#x27;s really weird that is weird isn&#x27;t it i wonder why yeah the princeton is the navy destroyer with this super fancy spy one radar that was out there off the coast of california when these navy fighter pilots saw these tic tacs and now we&#x27;ve all seen the video through the new york times and and cnn and others yeah okay he just crossed the street to help help the listeners out yeah yeah and it&#x27;s also important to know it wasn&#x27;t just just the spy one radar it was also picked up i spoke to the radar operators when i was back in egypt on the e-2 hawkeye when you talked to the you talked to the navy enlisted men and women and oh yeah you talked to that that was my job okay and what did they say what did they say i had them come up to the secretary to secretary suite to preach the same so these poor e5s and o3s had to go to the pentagon and talk to you yes top brass at the pentagon what do they say yes uh well you know i think they were clear a little bit nervous because you know you don&#x27;t walk into the secretary&#x27;s suite every day so they&#x27;re kind of like i&#x27;ve never done it you know uh and uh you know they provided their information but what you had was this this you had these workups so let me let me kind of start from the beginning here for your audience who may not be uh familiar with with military operations so we have these the strategic aircraft carrier strike groups think of a floating piece of the united states that we can move anywhere around the world and when you think of an aircraft carrier people think of this great big ship with a bunch of planes on the deck but that&#x27;s really only one part of the carrier fleet okay these ships never sail alone they&#x27;ve got escorts with them they have defense mechanisms they&#x27;ve got submarines they&#x27;ve got all sorts of stuff right so um you know what you&#x27;re trying to do is replicate a piece of sovereign united states and and control that area anywhere in the world so um before the the one of their deployments uh they were doing what they call workups which is which is their exercises their training trying to replicate real world scenarios uh and so they can you know keep hone their skills and keep sharp before they actually have to go to combat or go to war so they&#x27;re off the coast of california they&#x27;re off to san diego they&#x27;re doing their work ups about 60 miles off i think in the whiskey uh operating area and um it&#x27;s a piece of air space that as a fighter pilot we go and do our exercises and the whiskey areas are off the coast so okay correct right uh and so uh we&#x27;ve got these uh we&#x27;ve got these these two f-18 hornets up there uh plain cat and mouse and you&#x27;ve got two others so you have a blue force and a red force you have a you have a good good guys and bad guys right and you&#x27;re gonna you&#x27;re gonna do your war scenarios and so they&#x27;re out there doing their thing and all of a sudden uh in the middle they get waved off they get this radio call coming in from the e2 hawkeye and saying hey guys um just a heads up we we see something on our radar initially the e2 hawkeye radar operator thought it was maybe just wave top because a lot of times those radars are so sensitive that if you have a high enough wave you can pick those up uh but this was a common steady sea state at the time so they realized hey look that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not a wave top he says well i&#x27;m picking up something and as they&#x27;re having this conversation that princeton jumps in and says yeah we pick it up too in fact uh we want you guys to stop doing your war games and we want you to go beat feet over and check this thing out um so they were vectored to it it&#x27;s not like the pilot said hey i&#x27;m curious let me go no no no the princeton said you will stop what you&#x27;re doing and we want to reroute you and go take a look at what the hell that thing is going on okay and this is a pilot this is david it&#x27;s names i can say dave framer jim slate and alex dietrich um there&#x27;s another person there but they haven&#x27;t come out publicly yet so i&#x27;m not gonna mention their name okay so you have two two aircraft a front seater pilot and a backseat whizzo you know a weapons officer right and so they&#x27;re going out to to check out what this what&#x27;s going on so they boogie on over yeah right maverick and goose you got it uh except for not f14 tomcats they&#x27;re flying f-18 f-18 exactly yeah uh so they uh they they head on over and uh i remember talking to to one of the pilots and the pilot was telling me you know initially i was excited i thought maybe that we&#x27;re gonna go do some drug interdiction you know maybe there&#x27;s some low-flying cessna that&#x27;s bringing in some dope and we can go ahead and mexico yeah you know yeah and uh as they get to the area they&#x27;re getting closer closer closer the princeton says okay you&#x27;re right where you need to be uh you know take start looking around and so they start looking around and and pilots both look down and they see this what seems to be the submerged object under the water was described as a almost the size of a 737 underwater so initially all of a sudden their hearts started to race they think oh no we&#x27;ve got a downed aircraft and the water&#x27;s roiling on top of this but as they look down they realize that there is this what looks to be this tic-tac but this tic-tac is floating over the water and it&#x27;s behaving like a ping-pong it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not flying in in a linear fashion that you would expect with a leading edge trailing edge nose a tail right and aerodynamics it&#x27;s kind of doing this all over the place and uh obviously that was that was rather startling that it&#x27;s not a helicopter it&#x27;s moving too fast to be a helicopter there&#x27;s no control surfaces uh no wings no ailerons no elevators no rudders no cockpit no obvious signs of propulsion it&#x27;s just this ping pong moving around so um dave fraver uh who&#x27;s really you know like like you as you know as a fighter pilot you guys tend to be a rare breed i also i often uh joke about dave that he&#x27;s one of the few guys i know that actually runs towards danger and not away uh he&#x27;s kind of a big deal yeah well he&#x27;s also top gun he&#x27;s also top gun guy so i mean he&#x27;s he is he&#x27;s probably the most seasoned pilot uh on the carrier so he&#x27;s legit this is a legit guy oh yeah he&#x27;s way legit so he says hey i&#x27;m gonna go you know take a look and get close to this thing and uh the other pilot&#x27;s like yeah cool i&#x27;m just gonna hang out here i&#x27;ll keep high cover because i don&#x27;t know what that is you know let me know so yeah right you know i&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll watch from up here and so dave goes in and as dave and his wizards start to come in this tic tac all of a sudden orientates itself directly at him almost like pointing at him right like hey i know you&#x27;re here right and as so dave starts to come in uh on a slow and steady arc this thing starts to mirror his position maintaining a safe distance not letting dave get close uh but but mirroring his his image and meeting and coming up to meet him so so now you&#x27;re talking about an object that is somehow aware of the presence of u.s military aircraft and is being controlled intelligently by someone or something and as dave comes in he&#x27;s he&#x27;s he kind of loses his patience him in the wisdom they said you know what i&#x27;ll screw it i&#x27;m just going to go ahead and and cut this in half i&#x27;m just going to come straight in at it and see what happens running this is all recorded uh there is uh i&#x27;m gonna be very careful what i say here there is there is video evidence of of this craft there&#x27;s data so he cuts in and comes in and as he starts to close the gap this thing just boom disappears over the horizon and it does so uh at an at an incredible velocity and disappears over the horizon in about about two seconds maybe less so i mean by disappearing what&#x27;s the distance range so we&#x27;re gonna get to that right now so here&#x27;s exactly what happens so about five seconds later the princeton comes in and says uh hey you&#x27;re not gonna believe this but we had this thing on radar and it&#x27;s waiting for you at your cap point now at cap point is a rendezvous point right that is is pre-established by the pilots it&#x27;s nothing that is broadcast it&#x27;s nothing that can be exploited or extrapolated it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s there and you&#x27;re looking at a distance of 65 miles from where they were to where this object is now in five seconds in seconds so five seconds so you&#x27;re you&#x27;re talking think about moving 65 miles in five seconds that is faster than ordinary and in orbit 17 500 miles an hour we go about five miles a second in orbit so that&#x27;s they were going 13 miles a second if i&#x27;m doing my math in public right so they&#x27;re going almost three times orbital velocity right so if the data is is correct that&#x27;s exactly what what what occurred and that&#x27;s the the nimitz incident so then uh they&#x27;re running low on fuel they go back to the aircraft carrier they scrambled two more they launched two more air uh f-18 hornets because one of the these guys is a hot shot marine who says you know what i&#x27;m going to go find this thing i&#x27;m going to go get it right and and he did and that is the famous uh tic tac video um so the video was that when you hear the guys yelling and you you can see it moving and there&#x27;s a weird line of sight because it&#x27;s not i don&#x27;t think the video is right off the nose of the airplane right it&#x27;s kind of it&#x27;s looking off to the side as it&#x27;s tracking the tic tac yeah so you have the background yeah right and all of a sudden it just kind of bang shoots off and uh the camera&#x27;s not moving it&#x27;s the object is definitely moving and that of course is backed up by radar it&#x27;s not just some grainy video people say oh look it&#x27;s the dot and you&#x27;re moving the camera that&#x27;s not at all what happened and so uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the the famous nimitz incident uh what people don&#x27;t know is that there&#x27;s been other incidents before that uh in the same exact waters involving the uss boxer and there&#x27;s been incidents after that in the same waters as we now see with the kid in the omaha so uh they&#x27;re these things continue to occur and i think people look back and they say it&#x27;s episodic you know i know about the minutes that i know about the roosevelt incident yeah but what you don&#x27;t know this is continuing to occur to this day this hasn&#x27;t stopped this is not this is not just a one-off so this so something is happening under the water this thing is in the air does it go up into space well we&#x27;ve caught them at so remember what i said about the spy one radar we it can pick up a baseball at 80 000 feet right it took these objects out this way it&#x27;s not looking correct right right so what we do know is these things have been picked up at 80 000 feet and within within a second or less they we see them dropping out of sky and then hovering over the water at 50 feet over the water and then popping back out again in the words of kevin day who by the way is probably one of the world&#x27;s premier radar operators also a top gun graduate in his words it was raining ufos and you could see that on the scope and now as we&#x27;ve seen today it wasn&#x27;t just oh no no no it occurred over a period of days and look i&#x27;ll tell you in your audience right now and the video just came out that was authenticated by the pentagon yesterday someone took a video of the radar scope from one of the the navy vessels this this last year and and they are they are you can see them they&#x27;re right there on the scope it&#x27;s so there&#x27;s more than one there&#x27;s more than one track there&#x27;s more than one target yes and are they okay wow so the military person in me is saying that this is a way to probe our defenses you can see our reaction time you can learn about our capabilities by doing what they&#x27;re doing they&#x27;re not attacking us they&#x27;re not trying to shoot us down there it seems more like a learning exercise than a aggressive exercise because i mean it&#x27;s definitely yeah yeah right and it&#x27;s provocative but we&#x27;re not sure yet hostile and there&#x27;s a difference that&#x27;s why we have to be careful because the moment you say it&#x27;s a potential threat people say you know you&#x27;re fear-mongering or how do you know it&#x27;s hostile well we&#x27;re not you know look air safety is an issue it&#x27;s a threat if i&#x27;ve got a a commercial 737 flying from baltimore to let&#x27;s say denver and it&#x27;s got 230 people on board you know kicking back drinking cocktails and waiting to see grandma and you got one of these things coming up close and personal and the pilots aren&#x27;t prepared now you have in a situation where you might have to take a base of maneuvers you have an air safety issue you have a collision potential you know and and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s problematic is it is it hostile no is it a threat yes so that&#x27;s you know we have to be careful when we use that terminology because i&#x27;ve had people misunderstand what what we were trying to say in the pentagon uh and you know so so this has been going on the the 2004 incident is the famous one but you said there was incidents before this and there&#x27;s been incidents since then oh yeah of these of these specific types of vehicles whatever they are of of some sort of high performance vehicle displaying what we would consider beyond next generation technology the ability to perform uh instantaneous acceleration hypersonic velocities uh stealth or cloaking or low observability trans-medium travel and ultimately uh you know what has been described transmedia meaning airland sea space yeah so it means space yeah so as you know we are we are as a species when we create when you look at you you created at let&#x27;s say let&#x27;s just take for example an f-22 raptor uh one of our most capable fighter aircraft that we have right now this is a a high performance aircraft that is designed to fly in atmosphere and so you know it&#x27;s aerodynamic and whatnot but when you compare that to let&#x27;s say uh a a a russian proton rocket or the soyuz spacecraft right um you know it doesn&#x27;t look anything like an f-22 because that rocket as you know is going to be performing maneuvers in outer space where there is no atmosphere there&#x27;s no atmospheric resistance right exactly right i&#x27;ve got thrusters right yeah and and you don&#x27;t have you don&#x27;t have a jet engine you have a chemical rocket engine because you know wings and jet engines are useless in space and then when you compare that let&#x27;s say to a submarine it doesn&#x27;t look like a rocket or a a plane because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s designed to operate underwater in fact it uses buoyancy and ballast to go up and down it has a propeller to mechanically displace water and that&#x27;s why a submarine looks like a submarine and if you want to create something that can operate in multiple environments let&#x27;s say a seaplane there&#x27;s always a design and performance sacrifice a seaplane as you know is neither a really good plane nor is it a really good boat because it has to operate it has to operate in both environments and then you take the space shuttle which is you know one of my personal favorites it operates in the atmosphere and in space and on the ground but as you know uh you know it&#x27;s a design compromise you use the spaceship does you know yeah right the space shuttle doesn&#x27;t necessarily fly with the jet engine it kind of glides back down to earth and right you know because it&#x27;s got a there&#x27;s these design compromises um well we are attached to it these tic tacs without any type of performance or design compromise at all correct including space space and underwater yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that for us is why this is so so uh interesting because if let&#x27;s just go down the rabbit hole for a second and assume that a foreign adversary has designed and implemented this technology right let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s chinese and for the last several decades the chinese have managed to have this technology that completely uh makes obsolete every and any weapon system that we have uh they can fly over our airspace it&#x27;s not a damn thing we can do about it they can fly over the white house within seconds uh uh basically nullifying um every single uh aircraft missile uh that that we have all of it um that&#x27;s a problem this would be an intelligence failure at the scale of 9 11 because it means that despite our very best intelligence collection efforts and all 18 organizations and the billions of dollars we spend each year we someone has managed to gain a strategic surprise and advantage over the united states that&#x27;s problematic so at a minimum that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re dealing with right it could also be something very different it might not be foreign adversarial it might be a completely different paradigm that we&#x27;re dealing with and i think we need to keep all options on the table until they&#x27;re no longer on the table right no i i agree and so it&#x27;s almost like so it&#x27;s either human or it&#x27;s not and kind of the worst case scenario might be that it&#x27;s human because like like you said that would be a right failure of that would be the biggest failure in history of our military which by the way is i almost hope that it it&#x27;s not human because that means we&#x27;ve got bigger problems on our hands yeah right that would that would be pretty awful okay so we so this is the tic tac it&#x27;s been around for decades unbelievable performance you know that is really uh that that is something for sure there are these other vehicles too you talked about the triangles and the weather they&#x27;re not weather balloons maybe they are i don&#x27;t know but these things if they&#x27;re not going that fast we ought to be able to track them and figure out where they came from right yeah one would think and that&#x27;s part of what we call the u.s air domain awareness there is a huge uh conglomerate of u.s government organizations that their whole job is to maintain awareness of of u.s airspace u.s controlled airspace that&#x27;s the job of norad that&#x27;s the job of of the uh the air domain awareness working group interagency working group i mean this we put a lot of money time and effort and talent trying to maintain awareness over our controlled space and there&#x27;s a reason why there&#x27;s a no-fly zone over certain parts of washington dc right because of what happened during 9 11 we we we keep a very close eye on our on our on those assets and equities that we were trying to protect just like over our sensitive military installations right there&#x27;s a technology that can come out there and and uh you know unabated conduct reconnaissance and surveillance and there&#x27;s not a damn thing we can do about it yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s probably problematic so chris told me there was a uh thaad missile battery maybe in guam and there&#x27;s some belgium f-16 pilots so just run us through like what&#x27;s been happening with the triangles what&#x27;s been happening with the with the balloons or whatever you know yeah well the the triangles uh are something that have been seen for some time uh this is they&#x27;ve been seen internationally they&#x27;ve been reported by military eyewitnesses backed up by electro optical data and electromagnetic uh capabilities like radar so we are dealing with something it is it&#x27;s real whatever it is now of course there&#x27;s all sorts of people that go into the down the rabbit hole of of of speculation uh there&#x27;s a lot of these conspiracy theorists that talk about it&#x27;s some sort of secret u.s craft called the tr-3b uh there&#x27;s absolutely no no indication or information that validates that um and and you know certainly when you&#x27;re testing you know this as a test pilot let me ask you terry when you test a new capability where do you test that aircraft if there&#x27;s something super secret we don&#x27;t want to tell anybody well you tested over a uh or california yeah right there&#x27;s not the desert southwest is where we would test that stuff do would you fly that over downtown chicago or downtown la if you wanted to keep it a secret probably not there&#x27;s people people have these things and they&#x27;ll uh you know they&#x27;ll put it on twitter if you do exactly so uh you know it just it doesn&#x27;t make much sense i mean you are a test pilot yourself you know the protocol for when we&#x27;re testing something that we don&#x27;t want our adversaries to see and you know you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t do that type of test flight over major metropolitan populated u.s cities that&#x27;s not how you keep this that&#x27;s what happens with these things that&#x27;s what&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happened with several of these things and and they are being seen by by a lot of eyewitnesses at the same time but are they moving is the triangle moving you know 13 miles a second like the tic tacs are it can so what we&#x27;ve seen is that typically they tend to to loiter and move very very very slow and then all of a sudden and silently and then all of a sudden in a blink of an eye boom they&#x27;re gone just like the tic tac over the horizon uh and it&#x27;s hard to to to imagine something with that type of mass right something that large how big are they i think how large is well some have been reported to be you know the size of of a city blocker so that that&#x27;s even that&#x27;s huge right that&#x27;s a lot think of an aircraft carrier right you wouldn&#x27;t expect an aircraft that&#x27;s an air right that&#x27;s an aircraft carrier and imagine that thing all of a sudden you know deciding to to shoot over the horizon and you know and and by the way no associated signature so no sonic boom no contrail none of the things you normally associate with you know an aircraft flying in the sky uh even the acoustic signatures like i said sonic boom it&#x27;s not there there&#x27;s no sonic boom that&#x27;s weird i mean there&#x27;s air it&#x27;s moving through air and when a rock when a space shuttle comes back to earth it makes the the trail you can see for hundreds of miles it&#x27;s burning plasma so these things move that fast without leaving any plasma trail correct there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s no heat ablation there&#x27;s no atmospheric ionization that we typically associate and with with vehicles uh you know and friction air friction coefficients all that is is it doesn&#x27;t seem to apply here was there an incident in phoenix i remember reading about that um with the triangles that was triangles the phoenix lights now a lot of people get confused because you have davis monthly down in tucson it&#x27;s common for the a tents to go up and drop out you know we call it willy p white phosphorus flares and you can see them and you know in a black background they can appear sometimes to look like shapes but they they tend to burn out there was a mass sighting yeah they descend right with with with right with varela and they go with the relative wind um but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re dealing with here there&#x27;s the phoenix lights were was seen by by hundreds if not thousands of people in phoenix it was even seen by the governor uh who admitted this uh well you know what i&#x27;m i&#x27;m i&#x27;m gonna do a thing here i&#x27;m going to let your audience look that up because i don&#x27;t want to give too much away i think this will be a great homework assignment it&#x27;s called the phoenix lights just type in phoenix lights ufo incident and uh the whole breakdown is there but even even the governor saw it and he came out he said you know at first he tried to make fun of it he did this press announcement and then later uh i guess because so many people were upset with him and said you know i saw it too don&#x27;t make fun of it he came out and said no you know what i saw it too and it really wasn&#x27;t funny uh we don&#x27;t know what this was but so were they here&#x27;s the thing though there are people with radar if nothing else the faa has these air traffic control radars that are for airliners so they should be able to see them on radar and they should be able to see where they took off and land from now well that&#x27;s part of the low observability issue that we have because sometimes the radar when you look from the pilot&#x27;s perspective they&#x27;re having a hard time locking on sometimes they can lock onto it sometimes they can&#x27;t sometimes they get these weird nonsensical returns almost as if there&#x27;s some sort of active jamming or spoofing going on um the long story short here is that we that my time at atip there were some very smart people not you know not me excluding me but there were some smart scientists and whatnot who was who were able to come up with a very uh interesting theory and that uh there is a certain technology that if if you if you can master it all those five observables are possible we initially thought when we first started atip that maybe there were five separate exotic technologies responsible for each one of these you know observables and you see the the efforts and the dirts and all the reports that we did with the government on exotic propulsion and whatnot but it turns out that if if you know how to manipulate space-time and not a lot just a little bit the space-time fabric of space-time all these observables are possible it also may explain why we&#x27;re having this this weird nonsensical return on radars uh it also may explain why you don&#x27;t have the associated uh issues such as air friction like we said right and and the the acoustic signatures uh it turns out that if if if you if you know how to engineer and manipulate space time in a localized area a lot of things that seem magical really all of a sudden become reality and we&#x27;ve seen some of the micro experiments now at the cern the large hadron collider that seems to be substantiating a lot of this this uh this this speculation right now so that so we&#x27;re bringing in you know nuclear physicists and astronomers and cosmologists to understand you know extreme physics to explain what we&#x27;re seeing on our f-18 radars and air traffic control radars and that kind of thing that is the next step to to open up the aperture of this and and bring in under the tent a much broader audience bring in people contributors bring in scientists more scientists more academics uh bring in uh you know if it was up to me rather than being a uap task force which as you know in government terms means a temporary body to do a temporary job i&#x27;d create an enduring capability i would create something whole of government i would do something like a federal national lab like we have bring a department of energy faa noaa dhs dod the ic the intelligence community bring everybody lady dottie bring in uh academia to come in from the universities and and look at this i i would i would look at this topic very much like a uh like a peaceful version of the manhattan project where we bring the best and brightest to to look at this that&#x27;s funny normally i mean the russians have been stealing our stuff for 50 years and the chinese are obviously active in trying to steal our technology but now we need to do the same thing let&#x27;s figure out the tables are turned on us um so okay so triangles what what else you just said they&#x27;re the size of a city block they can go from zero to a million instantly what are they doing are they just moving around and observing us well that we don&#x27;t know i mean there&#x27;s a lot of people that that that have theories uh you know the problem for me is that we don&#x27;t have enough data yet to to really um where one theory stands out more than another and we need more data and so i&#x27;m very careful never to offer my own opinion because i don&#x27;t think we have enough data yet um there&#x27;s a whole lot of reasons why something might want to be here uh there&#x27;s there&#x27;s the practical i mean your intentions right i and there&#x27;s a practical sense that you know if you&#x27;re really dealing with some sort of exotic technology uh and and if so look we we know there&#x27;s two ways to bend space time thanks to einstein e equals mc squared and so what you have is either a lot of mass and like the earth&#x27;s mass is is disrupting space time around us uh perturbing it a little bit and and that&#x27;s why our gps uh clocks this atomic cesium clocks uh they run at a different rate than the the clocks here on earth because the the mass of the earth is actually warping space-time so the heavier an object is the more it warps space-time well same thing with energy just turns out you need a whole lot of energy to to warp space-time and it&#x27;s possible that you know if you really wanted to get to the fundamental elements of the universe uh and and so let me backtrack a little bit the smaller you go in in size and mass the tighter energy is held in little packets if you will so uh if i take this glass of water and i change its phase it&#x27;s a one times ten to the third energy release and it&#x27;s called steam and uh you know for for quite a while we&#x27;ve been using steam engines to do a lot of our work because it&#x27;s an exponential to the third times greater uh energetic yield well it took the the chinese to to realize that if you actually broke up the molecular bonds a chemical you know exothermic reaction like gunpowder that&#x27;s a one times ten to the fourth yield uh and then uh we did that of course uh mankind realized that in the 11th century it took us about another thousand years to to realize well if i started splitting up the atom not the molecule with the atom itself uh a fission type reaction that&#x27;s a one times ten to the fifth yield okay in terms of kilo ton yield uh and then it took about 25 years later for us to realize well hell i could i could break up the nucleus of an atom right and and now that&#x27;s literally a nuclear not an atomic but a nuclear yield which is one times 10 to the sixth or or better referred to as a megaton yield and so forth and so on and so on so the smaller you go down right the more the more energy is is held tightly but when it&#x27;s released it&#x27;s much much more and so one of the theories is that perhaps uh if there was someone has figured out how to warp space time using energy uh they could be using hydrogen which is abundant most abundant element in the universe right uh because it&#x27;s already kind of broken up to its fundamental atom the problem is is that if you wanted to mine hydrogen out in the universe uh it could take you quite a while because even though it&#x27;s so abundant it&#x27;s it&#x27;s um it&#x27;s dispersed it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in in in gaseous clouds there&#x27;s only one place you find hydrogen where it is super concentrated and that&#x27;s water h2o you go in a you star or are you going to start that would be that you probably would yeah probably probably not advisable um so you know maybe maybe the reason why these things are hanging out around water is because frankly we&#x27;re just a convenient gas station we simply don&#x27;t know i mean there&#x27;s all sorts of different hypothesis that have been put forward uh while while i was my time at atip so the trying let&#x27;s i want to get back to the triangles um people have written that they&#x27;re drones that the chinese have really you know they&#x27;re just they&#x27;re they&#x27;re poking us in the eye with these drones um i&#x27;ve got my dji drone you know these are just advanced drones when was the when was the drone first really implemented in the united states and and abroad from a from a uh commercially available perspective about 10 years ago right quadcopters yeah uh i remember when i was in the 1990s late 1990s i was part of the pioneer and hunter uav program okay those were the best ua visas before we had predator and all that these were basically miniature cessnas that we outfitted to be uh remote controlled and that was the best uav programs that we had at the time and then we came up with something started right yeah i chased the globe when i was a test pilot in 1999 2000 yep right you got it so uh and that was really really it uh those are airplanes those are just airplanes without people those are not right quadcopter and my drones right my point being is that we were chasing these triangles back in the 80s and even earlier on before drone technology was was was even even not only a reality but he&#x27;s even thought of so you know it&#x27;s one can stipulate that these are all drones well sure maybe some of them are but they weren&#x27;t back then you know it&#x27;s like going as i told people before it&#x27;s like walking into king tuts 2 for the very first time and all of a sudden seeing a fully assembled 747 sitting in there you know that it doesn&#x27;t make sense the time the time period doesn&#x27;t make sense you can go back now put pieces of 747 back into the tomb now but you wouldn&#x27;t expect to see one you know the moment you open up a tube that has been sealed for three four thousand years it just doesn&#x27;t make sense it&#x27;s the same brand so what where have the triangles been seen there was the guam the fat fat all over the world yeah all over the world they&#x27;ve been seen in russia they&#x27;ve been seen uh out of the pacific over the ocean they&#x27;ve been seen in europe they&#x27;ve been seen united states they&#x27;ve been seen in south america uh pretty much wherever there&#x27;s a human being uh a presence of human beings they have been they have been seen they&#x27;re and these are legit report these aren&#x27;t guys on mushrooms and these aren&#x27;t the ufo hunters society of russia these are military trained military eyewitness people i&#x27;m not i&#x27;m not interested in grandma seeing some lights in the backyard my job was only with trained military observers and that was backed up by some sort of of data okay so you&#x27;ve seen data you&#x27;ve seen military reports you&#x27;ve i assume have you talked to people who&#x27;ve seen these things yeah absolutely and the and and they&#x27;re legit people yeah they&#x27;re legit as legit as you are and are these well that&#x27;s not very legit hopefully you found better than that um are these are these drones are these chinese drones that they figured out how to make uh quadcopters flying flying around no they&#x27;re not i mean okay i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m gonna push i&#x27;m gonna be the skeptic i&#x27;m gonna push okay yeah sure you know okay again uh you know look let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let&#x27;s deconstruct this logically okay you&#x27;re talking about your drone um what&#x27;s how far can you fly your drone uh well unfortunately i crashed it in the lake behind my house but when it when it used to be a lot and it didn&#x27;t bubble and float back up it just went to the bottom but i&#x27;m you know a couple of [ __ ] couple kilometers couple kilometers great 20 minutes right okay so what type of technology would it take to fly a drone uh not a couple kilometers but but perhaps several hundred miles loiter over the deck of a of a ship for let&#x27;s say three four hours and then uh disappear uh under the waves and then do that night after night after night um i&#x27;ll ask you a serious question what what what drone technology right now is available that we have that can do trans medium travel that can loiter by the way with no long range long distance right so so there&#x27;s as we know how to communicate there&#x27;s only two ways you can get over the horizon communications for something like that unless you you have a repeater aircraft right that&#x27;s 70 samples right through satellite and and pre-arranged gps coordinates and satellites or you&#x27;ve got to be closer to your target um well there isn&#x27;t anything that we&#x27;re seeing that&#x27;s closer to the target we sent we&#x27;re the only ships out there some cases for for for a hundred miles uh where are they being launched from where where are they getting their fuel if they&#x27;re they can&#x27;t be using electric battery because you don&#x27;t have the duration and the endurance yeah so now you have to find an alternative fuel source which means probably some sort of of internal combustion engine which means now more weight which means a bigger robust platform which now means more you know more support services for that and launch capability you can&#x27;t just hold that in your hand to launch it you&#x27;re going to need some sort of of of launch pad somewhere that&#x27;s stable enough to hold that type of weight for that type of enduring mission right and oh by the way not get shot down oh by the way you said your drone fell into the into the lake well we haven&#x27;t found a single one of these drones floating in the water we haven&#x27;t found one of course we&#x27;re looking yes absolutely we&#x27;re looking my brain is spinning here i i&#x27;m working i&#x27;m actually working with a uam company which which is uh excuse me like a flying taxi this is the big thing and you know we&#x27;re looking at an hour maybe two hours maybe you know 100 mile range kind of thing 100 miles an hour those are kind of the numbers that that the flying taxis are hoping to get to they&#x27;re not there yet but they&#x27;re hoping to no they&#x27;re not and there&#x27;s a lot of money there&#x27;s a lot of money in it there&#x27;s a lot of money being put you&#x27;re doing that yeah we&#x27;re using lithium-ion batteries and and we&#x27;re looking at something that we still don&#x27;t have the technology to do that and yet that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re seeing so these are the navy ships you&#x27;re talking about u.s navy surface vessels blue water ops there&#x27;s no horizon anywhere nearby correct they&#x27;re seeing these things fly over them in formation are they doing anything what&#x27;s happening out there sometimes they&#x27;re just hovering over our capabilities for for shooting down uh i i&#x27;m not going to elaborate on what uh counter measures the us government might or might not be employing i&#x27;m going to leave that up to the government to to make that statement uh but you know as you know we do have counter drone technology uh we do have that um it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not that tough to to to zap one of these things if it was a drone um you know if i if i&#x27;m on my foam on my boat in the chesapeake and and i come within 300 you know feet of a ship they they have the authorization to shoot me out of the water and by the way they will so uh the same thing holds true for drones right yeah i would i wouldn&#x27;t recommend taking a drone and trying to you know uh tease a a u.s navy warship that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not advisable so obviously we haven&#x27;t been able to shoot one down or we you know we have we haven&#x27;t gotten one of these things have we do these things exist in a hangar area 51 or even better no one ever talks about area 52. that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s that&#x27;s about area 52. yeah i&#x27;ve said that before um you know uh i i&#x27;m not going to going to elaborate i&#x27;ve i&#x27;ve said for the record and i&#x27;ll stick to what i&#x27;ve said before uh it is my uh my belief that the us government is in possession of of uh extremely exotic material and and that&#x27;s about all i can say uh about that right now i have to be careful of might still have my my my security clearance oh you still have at least today i do i saw my ts clearance okay my mine expired years ago um not that i never knew anything i was at nasa there i mean that nasa is not a place of secrets it&#x27;s you know the russians fly with us we&#x27;re it&#x27;s i never i i never knew anything really good so i&#x27;m learning more now than i ever learned when i was with the government so the uh so there are these and these are all triangles that we&#x27;re talking about right now uh well no we&#x27;re not talking about just triangles we&#x27;re we&#x27;re now talking about drones right because we we switch from triangles to large triangles being observed to now now drones uh that have been or what what people refer to as drones which really reality probably you know many cases aren&#x27;t drones uh in some cases they are but you know uh there therein lies the problem and some of the confusion because now people are are reporting so much which is a good thing right we want you it&#x27;s you&#x27;ll say saying see something you know say something uh so people are now finally reporting um but with that you&#x27;re going to get a lot of noise you know in that reporting right now now the challenge is separating you know the the noise from from the signal right the uh there was some video released recently it looked like night vision goggles it was that green you know night camera look of and there were some lights right exactly and so that was i think was that a quote-unquote triangle that they released and there was also pictures yeah that was a video of a vehicle now the question the jury is still out was it effect of the lens what it was referred to as bokeh effect uh because the aperture as the lens closed becomes a triangular shape and what you&#x27;re seeing is actually just a conventional aircraft or drone through that effect or are we looking at something truly legitimate uh is it an actual active light source coming from the aircraft that&#x27;s blinking uh like an aircraft navigation lights or are those lights actually being reflected off of a smooth bottom uh from from something below there there&#x27;s still a lot of of questions regarding that that video came out after i left the pentagon i i know a little bit about that particular incident but i certainly don&#x27;t have available to me all the information so i want to be careful not to speculate too much right uh the pentagon has has said that it was a legitimate video uh and it was being used by the uap task force but beyond that um you know i want to be careful to speculate okay how so but again if it&#x27;s a drone it may be low observable but it&#x27;s not zero observable and we should be able to track where it takes off from and lands at and if it&#x27;s a drone in open water operations it&#x27;s got to be taken off and landing from a boat or a submarine or something i mean that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s right drones that can hover can&#x27;t travel thousands of miles exactly and those like thousands of miles can&#x27;t hover right exactly and that&#x27;s my point that i&#x27;ve said before fixed wing it&#x27;s got to move you got to create lift under the wings and you want to be going inside right you have to have a sufficient speed to maintain lift if you want to hover then you can your loiter time goes way down because your energy now is being transferred rather than from from from from horizontal to to vertical right right and so you&#x27;re you&#x27;re wasting your fuel that doing that so there&#x27;s no real capability we have right now that can fly for thousands of miles and then hover for three or four hours and then fly thousands of miles we that&#x27;s just we don&#x27;t have that yet so if there&#x27;s a destroyer out in the middle of pacific and these things show up clearly the spy 1 radar is tracking it where did it come from and where did it go great question that&#x27;s absolutely correct and look these are just up here if you well i can tell yeah i mean with the images you know they popped in at 80 000 feet they came in from somewhere we we picked them up at 80 000 feet so that means they came in from higher than that and we picked them up at 80 000 feet and then we retract them going 50 feet over hovering 50 feet over the water and then bouncing back up and zipping off past 80 000 feet again where it went nobody knows but we were looking up to 80 000 feet and it went beyond 80 000 feet so you know you tell me and there and there&#x27;s data here but the problem with is the the government bureaucracy classification system is that as you know there&#x27;s so many holes and it&#x27;s all need to know so i may have seen one thing but i don&#x27;t know so there&#x27;s not a lot of people that have i&#x27;m sorry yeah i apologize i took my phone i just uh i just got interrupted so that&#x27;s why we lost signal i apologize i&#x27;m being uh i&#x27;m being told that i i have uh i think i have a schedule conflict right now i was told that uh i have some folks waiting so i just want to just let you know i got probably a couple minutes but uh i think um i&#x27;m gonna wrap it up and we can come back again and do this some other time as well if you want i hate to be this way but i guess they&#x27;d schedule this for an hour and now uh i&#x27;m i&#x27;m already stepping on the toes of of somebody right now let&#x27;s wrap it up bullet these balloons these navy there&#x27;s some pictures of these translucent balloons anything interesting about those if it&#x27;s a balloon again we should be able to track it what are these things doing sure sure again that&#x27;s that you&#x27;re you&#x27;re asking the questions that that we&#x27;ve all asked if these are balloons and we should know it&#x27;s a balloon they should have a very specific path and by the way balloons not traveled against the wind and 120 knots that doesn&#x27;t happen balloons float with the wind with the prevailing winds they don&#x27;t they don&#x27;t go against it as you know right unless they have a car they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re not floating with the wind they&#x27;re moving no they&#x27;re moving you get no we have the radar data you have it on gun camera footage you can see them they are moving against the headwind i mean it&#x27;s not you know the ones that are of interest to us are the ones that are not behaving like a balloon and that&#x27;s what i think people fail to recognize that&#x27;s that for us is is a litmus test a balloon is a balloon uh you know a balloon doesn&#x27;t behave like an aircraft right unless it&#x27;s some sort of hybrid technology which is something that we&#x27;re really not not aware of yet the balloon&#x27;s air speed is always zero and their ground speed is whatever the wind speed is and so that that&#x27;s absolutely what&#x27;s happening right okay i you got to go lou this conversation is not over i i want to know the real data and that&#x27;s compartmentalized in secret places where with people that aren&#x27;t talking with each other and i i know the i don&#x27;t know the bureaucracy specifically but i i i can i know the bureaucracy where all this stuff is understood all right well thank you so much for coming on board i know we gotta we gotta run your your list jerry i&#x27;ve got one question for you even though i&#x27;ve i&#x27;ve gotta jump here i have heard that space has a very distinctive smell almost like an ionization smell obviously the vacuum of space doesn&#x27;t really have a smell but there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a something associated can you can you share with me for just a moment because i&#x27;m dying to know from somebody who&#x27;s been there the smell of space so what does a strawberry smell like uh great question it&#x27;s hard to explain right it&#x27;s hard to describe the smell right yeah there&#x27;s all kinds of smells that&#x27;s hard to describe so um when a spacewalker comes inside in his spacesuit you can go up and smell the the fabric of the spacesuit or when a cargo ship docks and you open the hatch you can you can go smell the part of the spaceship that was just out and it it&#x27;s kind of musty it&#x27;s kind of electric like the old railroad trains that we had when we were kids um there was that electric smell uh it&#x27;s mechanical it&#x27;s it&#x27;s you if i smelled it i would go you were just in space you know i would know it immediately um but it&#x27;s hard to describe it but i i would describe it as musty electrical and unlike anything else i&#x27;d ever smelled before wow fantastic thank you for sharing that with me i&#x27;ve always been told that i just i was dying to hear from from an expert like you who&#x27;s actually been there and done that so thank you i appreciate that they&#x27;re very unique sure of course well i know you got to run thank you for having us being on the show and hopefully maybe we&#x27;ll do it again anytime thank you very much terry thank you for your service really appreciate it we&#x27;ll see you bye-bye thank you</p>
