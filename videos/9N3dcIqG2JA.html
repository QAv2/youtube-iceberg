            <p>God and nine ignition sequence Stars six five four three alien proof podcast as the approach they saw yeah they definitely did see movement in the main part of The Craft strange looking creatures were moving around inside said Remy they looked inside and looked under stress they moved fast and they were able to will themselves from one position to another in an instant they were shadowy and expressionless but definitely living beings this from the Trinity UFO crash article it&#x27;s Sunday October 9 2002 excuse me 2012. we&#x27;ve been going back in time 2022 I&#x27;m Doug and this is Dr Bill joining us again this week how&#x27;s it going Bill hey how are you it&#x27;s 2022 bill 2022. so we&#x27;re discussing a newspaper article from 2003 so it&#x27;s close that was close so um would you sent this to me is that where I got it yeah I sent it to you where&#x27;d this come from I mean this is an article in 1945 this happened um August 20th to August 25th 1945 an operation by the US military to recover a crashed UFO near San Antonio New Mexico uh which was to uh 20 miles Southeast of the Trinity site so this is the Trinity UFO crash and it&#x27;s um important to note that these incidents happened around you know the time that we you know developed the atomic bomb this is August 6 was the atomic bomb right August 6th was Hiroshima August 9th was Nagasaki and this crash occurred uh 10 days 11 days later so this goes into the theory that you know all these sightings and things of um revolve around our development of nuclear weaponry I mean we&#x27;ve talked about this many times I mean but there&#x27;s more and more crashes it seems in the area I mean this is only one of a few incidents that happened all along with of course Roswell in 47. right yes yes yeah so I mean they give it virtually get what&#x27;s interesting is they give the crash and I wanted to mention because the reason I read that excerpt is that they moved about it seemingly at will like because you know they&#x27;re at one spot and it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re stating that they move they would like disappear real quick and re that&#x27;s the vision I get when they talk about moving quickly and seemingly at will so I&#x27;m wondering I always wonder about time dilation and that kind of thing you know when we&#x27;re I got to go back to identified flying objects the book that I&#x27;m reading you know they talk about that type of thing you know with the with the craft you know being able to come and go the trends pastorals extra Tempest drills tempestriles intestinals amen now I don&#x27;t know if these are I&#x27;m yeah I&#x27;m kind of torn because they&#x27;re stating that these were small beans and many times they say they have four fingers instead of five they don&#x27;t have a thumb well you don&#x27;t need you know well I don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t need if you don&#x27;t need a thumb well maybe just one of you you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t need you don&#x27;t need your pinky or pinky is extraneous so we&#x27;re thinking maybe that oh you know maybe that&#x27;s the one that dropped off yeah so that would be a you know that could be something that could be lost ability or if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re bioengineering why why just get rid of it yeah you don&#x27;t need it it says well if you&#x27;re making gloves and use less material that&#x27;s right yeah it&#x27;s a whole industry it&#x27;s been saved are you starting to buy in these are us from the Future No you know these aren&#x27;t the book describes the fact that we to travel across space we would have to you know it&#x27;s 100 you&#x27;d have to have generations of people to get to the next solar system not necessarily not necessarily because of time violation and if you have a ship that can do constant acceleration travel between the stars is perfectly feasible the only limit to it is the The Travelers will have slower time but time will travel you know at the normal pace so you travel to Alpha Centauri it&#x27;s going to take I don&#x27;t remember how long it is you travel to Alpha Centauri it takes six light years or whatever it is but the ship could do it in a month so it&#x27;s like the there theoretically it is it is possible but when you get back all your people will be dead and you&#x27;ll have regular time yeah so and you don&#x27;t hear about that though really I guess but yeah I mean it&#x27;s so the the that interesting how do they do it in a month I mean how fast that&#x27;s more than light speed isn&#x27;t it uh they&#x27;re not traveling any faster than light but there&#x27;s time dilation So the faster you you the closer you get to the speed of light the slower time moves for you right so you for you only a month or whatever the speed you&#x27;re going at causes it to be only a month ago by but normal time you know Earth six years will go by so you can&#x27;t travel any faster than light takes to travel between stars but for the people in the ship time is slowed down and they can they can you know you can travel within you know reasonable periods of time if you can do that well they just need to we don&#x27;t obviously have the technology or for propulsion I mean I I well what the book is stating is that it&#x27;s not you know you&#x27;d have to have generations of people to make it I mean they they this guy disagrees with uh I don&#x27;t know he&#x27;s talking about technology uh he&#x27;s not even talking about technology today to even do this it&#x27;s technology of the future future he disagrees with Einstein well he he quotes he cites Einstein in various areas in there like I said it&#x27;s like reading a textbook so it&#x27;s slow going but you know he&#x27;s I mean it can be done he talks about you know we&#x27;re talking about the Fermi Paradox and the the other one and um I don&#x27;t know it just seems like he doesn&#x27;t subscribe he says if you take generations of people you know yeah and you know to yeah you&#x27;re making your own you&#x27;re making children which are you know to travel families yeah you&#x27;re just it and 100 000 years from now you make it I mean I have I have a paper in one of the books up here which lays out the the time dilation and the travel time between stars and I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not going to pull it down so he&#x27;s looking at one viewpoint but e time will I mean if you travel to the core the center of the universe it&#x27;s um I can&#x27;t remember 30 000 light years so you can travel if you&#x27;re traveling at a constant acceleration you can travel to the core of our galaxy in your lifetime and come back but you know it&#x27;ll take you to speed no you&#x27;re traveling you can&#x27;t travel faster than light this is just constant constant acceleration it slows time down for you and you can actually travel to the center of the universe and back in your lifetime but 60 000 years would travel would pass on your Earth now there&#x27;s a great book a series of books called by Larry Niven called I can&#x27;t remember the name ah anyway but there&#x27;s a great book but written by the great science fiction writer when we used to have science fiction writers and he um he wrote a book about a guy that was given a mission for a um it was frozen and then he woke up and he was they transferred his consciousness to a younger body or something because he was had cancer and he was frozen and they said well you know you&#x27;re um uh people from the past are more durable for this type of thing and he was supposed to man a ram ship Ram scoop and do like Explorations for this in this government on Earth right and once he got the ship going he was like screw this I&#x27;m going to the galactic core and uh they couldn&#x27;t do anything because he was you know he was it was his ship so he went to the galactic core and he came back to earth like 60 000 years later and the whole story is about his experiences exploring you know sort of a post-apocalyptic world uh it&#x27;s a good book really good book but it&#x27;s theoretically you can do that the problem is is that the ram there&#x27;s people who&#x27;ve come up with papers that you can&#x27;t uh there&#x27;s technical difficulties with using a ram scoop which is what Larry Newman was talking about but theoretically it is possible to travel great distances in a human lifetime within our galaxy using constant acceleration so the designs Einstein he figured out there could be wormholes too right wasn&#x27;t he one of the ones that came up with the Wormhole there I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s something yeah there&#x27;s some weird equation in there that he came up with that you know there could be wormholes you know kind of like contact or Stargate is a good example of something that could be done well I don&#x27;t want to say could be done so it&#x27;s theorizes could be done and I I think yeah I think that&#x27;s that stuff is is theoretically possible I mean so I mean that might be the the way that has been done well in in what we&#x27;re seeing or what&#x27;s being seen I thought we&#x27;re saying but what&#x27;s being seen these things are coming through wormholes or they can bend space that&#x27;s the other thing where you the example where you take the you take the paper and bend it in half and poke the pencil through it and that&#x27;s you know the that&#x27;s it you know the universe or whatever so I don&#x27;t know I mean they could come from there I guess wormholes is a possibility constant acceleration is a possibility and uh basically you could also have if you&#x27;re talking about slower slower moving craft if it&#x27;s not technically feasible you could have like micro spacecraft which just have um 3D printers in it and uh Scott sigler&#x27;s book on his pandemic books talk about that it&#x27;s a great story where you have these like micro things that just fall into the atmosphere and then they just start replicating and they create um like an infection that leads to it&#x27;s a great story Scott Ziggler&#x27;s one of the he&#x27;s he is a real science fiction writer and it&#x27;s the whole thing is about these um it&#x27;s a way to transport across space and so these things grow in people take the people over and they build like a portal so these aliens can invade the Earth and it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a great story so there&#x27;s a possibility you said microsatellites to um let me I got a cough he said micro side lights to the various solar systems and then they basically just if they discover Life they just reprogram the existing life and take it over or build uh Nano machines that could build other machines that could 3D print little people with three fingers and no thumbs or it&#x27;s four four fingers and they&#x27;re not very tall either yes they&#x27;re well that saves on the printing cost the um I should say that the this article the New Mexico UFO crash in 1945 I read about it in the book called Trinity the best kept secret by Jacques Valley and Paolo Leo Pisa Harris and that I&#x27;m reading that I&#x27;m about two-thirds of the way through that and then I also pulled this uh this news article that was written in the mountain mail in Socorro New Mexico oh there&#x27;s the spelling Joe&#x27;s looking for and uh 2003 11 to 2003 by Ben Moffett and Ben Moffett knew these two guys that discovered this crash when they were 11 10 and 7. and writing uh riding the fences on their one of the kids they leased Land from the Bureau of Land Management to raise cows and the dad worked the dad worked for the Army it&#x27;s 1945 so the 10 year old kid and the seven-year-old kid are riding the fences and repairing the fences and they were looking for a cow that was going to calf yeah and one of the things that they said in the book that&#x27;s not in this article is that when they came on the crash they heard like a screaming which sounded like um rabbits you know a rabbit scream yeah right yeah and they could hear they could hear that and these these people or whatever they were and they said they looked they thought they might be they look like children were like moving back and forth in that weird way that that they described and they were making this high-pitched whaling noise so um as Padilla and who&#x27;s nine Ibaka Who was seven yeah so so they see these things they see this wreck and there&#x27;s a you know there&#x27;s an artist depiction of the wreck later on down the article that they said is dead on to what they saw their side of the crafts ripped open the craft has a hump on them it looks like a cockpit on the top yeah and they have these beans in there and I know we were always trying to surmise are these things clone you know are they clones are they sentient what are they you know they&#x27;re 3D printed uh 3D printed images things well um I complain about I guess I complain about the Fermi Paradox and the simplest solution to the Fermi Paradox is that they&#x27;re already here yeah you know everyone goes well what about the Fermi Paradox well you know they&#x27;re already here it&#x27;s a simplest solution what&#x27;s the description of the Fermi Paradox again Fermi Paradox is Fermi was just saying given that the age of the universe even traveling at sublight speeds um it is possible to explore the Galaxy and and you know it&#x27;s possible if a civilization developed itself in the core in the center of the universe in four billion years they should have been able to explore every star in the galaxy so just give it even if if you do the calculation number of stars travel time whatever it is four billion years is a huge amount of time just take you could even take half a million all right yeah half a million half a billion and uh or half a million 500 000 years you should be able to explore the entire galaxy using whatever traveling even if they traveled very slow so it&#x27;s not so much you&#x27;re talking 500 000 years or you&#x27;re talking about a billion years or a billion years they should be here already and so so Fermi was like well where are they given that simple calculation what&#x27;s possible in the amount of time that&#x27;s happened they should already be here and they&#x27;re not but I mean that that&#x27;s one of the that raises a question that then people go well you know then we&#x27;re probably the only life in the universe then which is absurd and there are a lot of uh special circumstances for Life evolving on on Earth I mean we got this Moon that keeps the atmosphere under you know it&#x27;s they say I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true they say that the moon reduced our atmosphere to so we don&#x27;t have something like Venus um so our moon is a reason for that and otherwise we&#x27;d have an atmosphere like Venus which is all you know a soupy CO2 thing no plus you&#x27;d Crush I mean you would crush it on against the atmosphere such that can we crush a via car I mean the Russians I watched something uh the universe the other day and the Russians have sent a few craft to Venus for whatever it&#x27;s weird yeah for whatever reason in the 60s and I&#x27;m like why did they send it to Venus I mean why not Mars I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s bizarre I think they did both I think they sent to Mars into to Venus so we left some trash on Mars too but Mars is a less a lot less significantly less hostile at in Atmos or an environment in Venus so I don&#x27;t know why they would put their efforts on I mean if you&#x27;re going to go somewhere to you know to be able to stay I think Mars like we&#x27;re doing today we&#x27;re exploring Mars is a reasonable reasonable option the uh I watched a NASA news conference recently and one of the reporters asked these the panel whoever they were if they would speculate on whether or not there was Life on Mars and they all just laughed and I&#x27;m like why are they laughing yeah I&#x27;m like why are they laughing I mean there&#x27;s good evidence and they&#x27;re like well every microbial at this point though right yeah well they&#x27;re talking they&#x27;re saying well and that&#x27;s the question there&#x27;s good evidence that there&#x27;s probably microbial Life currently on Mars and uh I don&#x27;t know why they laughed um but do you think in their neighborhood a civilization on Mars no but I don&#x27;t know enough to actually give that answer a logic yeah well no reasonable I mean I don&#x27;t know nothing I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know enough to say say I would yeah you&#x27;re thinking like a you&#x27;re a PhD I&#x27;m just thinking like a dreamer no no it&#x27;s gonna be no I don&#x27;t think so I think they&#x27;re good because it looks like there was Watershed and you know there&#x27;s evidence that there was water and much higher which doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s but where it doesn&#x27;t automatically mean that there&#x27;s life because there&#x27;s water but it could be a greater chance that there was something there but any and you know how things will look after Millions hundreds of thousands of years even this Earth if we didn&#x27;t had no life left on it what would things look like in a hundred thousand years you know and maybe they had nuclear war of some kind and you know but you know obviously there would be you&#x27;d have to dig or something to find any evidence and we&#x27;re not there yet well here&#x27;s a I have I have my new um Mars Atlas and this guy says Henrik hargitai he says uh how new is that from 20 21 22 oh well he comes out with this every year he&#x27;s in Hungary and he says its surface looks lifeless but we should remember that the lands on Earth were also lifeless and likely Dusty until aquatic organisms colonized it only around half a billion years ago the Martian landscape has many similarities to early and perhaps future Earth future Earth yeah yeah so uh I don&#x27;t know the history of of Mars and when because they obviously had rivers and and water flowing on the surface and stuff like that I would definitely say at one point Mars had life and there is I don&#x27;t know or our science our scientists are very weird about sort of proclaiming that the possibility of of life elsewhere I think it just I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s no evidence but we are seeing evidence of water in other solar systems and it used to be thought that water was was really rare and special to Earth and it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s Waters everywhere there&#x27;s water on Mars there&#x27;s water on the moon there&#x27;s there&#x27;s water on other moons other moons in our solar system there&#x27;s that one Moon that&#x27;s that&#x27;s all water with a crust of they think there might actually be life on it because there&#x27;s a crust of of Frozen ice around it and underneath it they think the water may be liquid with geothermal activity allowing for you know life to live survive just like the the sulfur Vents and the ocean here yeah but so this is what point is their oxygen I mean you need plant life right um oxygen is secondary to life yeah so oxygen layers come first and then oxygen well no bacteria like they the older older bacteria and stuff don&#x27;t use oxygen and Oxygen&#x27;s a poison to to it so when when um uh there was actually in in our history of our planet when plants evolved there was like a collapse you can see it in the the strata stratigraphic history when oxygen came into the atmosphere there&#x27;s like an explosion of oxygen because of the explosion of plants producing oxygen there was a rust layer that came out and you can see it in the stratigraphic geologic history yeah the layers and oxygen is is a is is toxic basically and it causes uh once you develop the ability to produce oxygen it&#x27;s a great defensive mechanism and then you have so you have the plants first they developed a defensive mechanism I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of people are going to slam me for my hand wavy them at this point you&#x27;re a scientist bill you should you know about these this is fact well the more I learn the more I learn what I don&#x27;t know so the um so Oxford will be I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be reminded of that yeah so the oxygen came out and then you had um um it was toxic and you had like animals developed or bacteria developed that could use the oxygen which caused for oxygen to cause an increased metabolic rate so if we didn&#x27;t use oxygen we&#x27;d have a really slow metabolic rate so if we um okay so plants came first before the oxygen and then they produce oxygen plants produce oxygen and it was okay well it&#x27;s a way to make energy but it&#x27;s also is a great defensive mechanism for other organisms can plants live without of today can they if you remove all the oxygen out of a box but you give them Water and Light will they still live yes they need carbon dioxide though okay so we can just plant some stuff on Mars and let it won&#x27;t grow oh it&#x27;s too cold and the atmosphere might be too thin but um people used to talk about seeding the atmosphere of Mars or not Mars Venus with um with bacteria that you know that can you know algae into and to make Mars habitable but I think it&#x27;s the atmosphere is too toxic for that but Mars is is doable it&#x27;s carbon dioxide atmosphere um there&#x27;s a series of books call about terraforming Mars which I haven&#x27;t read I have them is that what that is what is Terry always hear an alien and all that what is it you know what which is terraforming it&#x27;s changing the the planetary surface to make it it habitable so there&#x27;s a series of books called red Mars green Mars and blue Mars which is like a history of terraforming Mars and they were very popular a couple decades ago I have them I haven&#x27;t read them I should read them I should read them yeah but it um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just a way of it&#x27;s changing the so I don&#x27;t know what they would do I don&#x27;t know what the process is on Mars part of it is you have to make the atmosphere thicker in one of um one of the scenarios is to take comets and uh deflect them to dump lots of water into the Martian atmosphere at a martian to crash onto the Mars to make the atmosphere thicker so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s it&#x27;s doable theoretically it&#x27;s doable well they hadn&#x27;t we just launched we just hit it and didn&#x27;t we just hit an asteroid with some kind of graph to try to deflect it did it work I never I don&#x27;t know I haven&#x27;t been following it it&#x27;s not making the news be interesting because that&#x27;s uh and uh NASA what&#x27;s going on with Artemis we&#x27;re not until November now yeah the dart yeah the dart mission NASA has uh had several reports on it I haven&#x27;t read them but there is information and um I think the one of the telescopes the Hubble took a picture of the impact so they have they have the data and the information on on how useful that would be and they called it the first planetary defense test planetary defense system first test of our planetary defense system uh yeah Artemis they moved Artemis into the barn because of the hurricane before the hurricane hit which didn&#x27;t really hit on that side too much they got a lot of rain and there was enough wind so the Artemis had a gust maximum of I think 62 knots and that&#x27;s 62 knots halfway up the measure as measured halfway up the rocket and they were actually getting gusting I think when the hurricane came through higher than that level so moving it back to the barn was a good idea they could have attempted to do a launch before the hurricane hit the problem is if they had to scrub the lunch they wouldn&#x27;t have had enough time to move the rocket into the barn so I think they made a right decision they moved it into the barn they pushed it back to December November and they they can do maintenance and checks and all that stuff in the barn which is fine the hurricane it is what it is they needed to get it if they couldn&#x27;t if they couldn&#x27;t guarantee a launch on that one day if they had failed to get a launch on it they didn&#x27;t have enough time to get it into the barn before the hurricane hit so they did they made the right decision and now they can do more checks they can check the fueling system there&#x27;s like batteries that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem but there&#x27;s batteries that are supposed to be um fully functional they&#x27;re the the emergency abort system batteries that have a certain criteria for functionality and they the organization that&#x27;s in the launch there&#x27;s the launch safety organization had granted the Artemis locket rocket locket rocket an extension on this these batteries I think the batteries are rated for 20 days and but they can of course they can go longer and they had granted them an ex exemption on the 20-day rule for the launch Windows that were coming up but now that what they can do is once it&#x27;s back if they need to they can change these batteries out it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a good thing so we&#x27;ll see we&#x27;ll see how it goes but yeah I&#x27;m disappointed they didn&#x27;t like roll it out and launch it right away but I can wait till November I&#x27;d rather see a successful launch than a than an unsuccessful launch it takes three days to get it back in the barn right yeah slow they may have said make a decision it&#x27;s a big rocket they may have taken they may have taken a they they did like an expedited expedited rollback so I think they were able to do it like two and a half days so yeah you ever seen that thing it rides on and said yeah crawler thing it&#x27;s bizarre like I actually I actually wonder about how much damage that thing takes when they launch it oh that&#x27;s a something I&#x27;m curious about I just redo it they&#x27;ll use their Surplus parts and put it back together I got an old one in the old one you know somewhere on the property that they just they&#x27;re Savage for parts and put it back together they might have two of them and they just rotate them repair and rotate you know it&#x27;s probably you used to be the atlas V you know Gemini Gemini so let&#x27;s Circle back around to the Trinity UFO crash it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the traditional it crashed it had the metal that got you could Bend It Like A they said like a cigarette pack and it would spring back together excuse me Spring apart not crease and that kind of thing you could crumple it and you released it and it just unfolded too like it was now the book so it looks like go ahead oh the book was saying I was you know reading in the book and they they um this woman that wrote the book with pal Palo Leo Pisa Harris she spent a lot of time questioning and interrogating these guys and coming back at them she was saying that the this picture in the article that from the mountain male shows like a terror in the spacecraft and what they&#x27;re saying from under the questioning the the guy was saying it was more like a panel had blown out so it&#x27;s not like a rip in it it&#x27;s like it hit a they call it a Marconi Tower a radio tower yeah and then and it caused the the kid one of the kids I think it&#x27;s Remy or Baka I think it&#x27;s Baka the younger guy so he he was saying that the he it looked like that it hit the tower and it caused this panel to blow out and it&#x27;s not like a terror but it&#x27;s like a square or you know a shaped panel blew out exploded out from the craft and they don&#x27;t know what happened to that and then the craft crashed and then the the creatures are running around making noises like injured rabbits and teleporting back and forth or whatever they were doing and um so that that rip and the terror but there was debris because the army guys and it&#x27;s a weird it&#x27;s a weird story because they they saw the wreck they came back and they told their dad and then like two days later uh the the one of the local cops and their dad and them went to explore the wreck and when he got to the wreck they didn&#x27;t see it because it had been covered with brush and the area had been like raked yeah they raked up the debris and there wasn&#x27;t any debris around but the kids saw was it after that that the kids saw the guys the the military was there they got there to pick up this craft right and they were kicking the debris in a crevice yeah burying it well and they didn&#x27;t want to carry it away they&#x27;re too lazy or whatever and then then a few days later the um a uh his Hispanic Sergeant showed up to ask if they could go on their land and build a fence to drive the trucks through for the recovery they had a greater Road build of fields and they said how come you can&#x27;t use our game to go yeah it&#x27;s not big enough we gotta do something bigger yeah it needed to be a 26 foot it was 26 feet wide the gate that the Army put in and um you know how you can&#x27;t even drive you would have to take up the whole Road where they taking that thing he&#x27;s also I don&#x27;t know zero on a 26 foot wide truck I mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s yeah I mean you&#x27;d have to do in the middle of the night I guess and close the roads well I mean how would you transport it they put it on a low boy put in a lowboy and they um he said they had the cant it the kids were saying these two kids when they saw said they had to cant it because there was an overpass that had to get out uh go under so they had the Kant the um the craft so it was low enough to go under the under overpass and um covered it with a covered it with a tarp yeah and the kids used used to go out and spy on the soldiers and he said they they had a tent out there and they would listen to music and they go into town to try and pick up on girls that Cafe is still there we should go to that cafe and we should and his he said when they got his dad and the copper when they went out there went inside it went inside the crowd oh really yeah oh that&#x27;s from the book right because that&#x27;s not in the article yeah and they they said is the dad and the copper they went in the craft and they told the kids to stay out and uh the the dad also the dad worked for the Army and he told them he said don&#x27;t told the kids don&#x27;t talk about this because they thought it was they thought it was some sort of uh top secret craft or something and own one of the kids um can&#x27;t remember if it was an aunt or a mom or something when the Trinity bomb went off because where this people lived The Flash woke him up and the mom peeked out of a crack on the house when the bomb went off and it blinded permanently blinded her in one eye so that&#x27;s amazing yeah yeah and uh so it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s an interesting area and I couldn&#x27;t find I spent a lot of time digging through the book because there&#x27;s a list in the book of the crashes the UFO crashes that happened in this area or supposedly happened in this area well Aztec was there&#x27;s like three of them in Aztec were in there there&#x27;s a bunch but yeah I I will find that list and I will go I will I will we&#x27;ll go over that next week but I I you know you saw me sitting here digging through the book and I didn&#x27;t bookmark the list which is just dumb uh and I couldn&#x27;t find it and of course you know when you&#x27;re trying to find it in a hurry you can&#x27;t find it uh so it just intrigues me and I don&#x27;t know if the book touched on this about when they buried the the debris um because they didn&#x27;t want to carry all the debris out or something so they put it in a crevice and just put dirt and brush over it was there anything in the book about that yeah there is and what happened is that they came in there&#x27;s a dam a flood control Dam in that area and that crevice the the guys have gone out back later decades later and um the crevice has been filled and graded over so where they were kicking the debris is under 10 feet or some 20 feet of dirt now because they came in they graded it and they put a dam and what was also interesting is um when Valley went out there to look at it the spot where these guys said the craft had landed somebody planted a bunch of a bunch of knocks noxious plants and really yeah and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re if you touch them they&#x27;ll cause like skin irritation there&#x27;s two different plants were planted and they&#x27;re growing right where the craft supposedly landed and Valley was speculating that somebody came out there and planted these things to prevent people from digging up the area yeah and um what else was he saying yeah because I looked at the man I had a mile post sign and that kind of thing I&#x27;m like man you could probably find this place yeah but you know if it&#x27;s under 10 feet of dirt that you take an excavator to get anything out of it but I&#x27;m surprised Well Valley when you or I would have saw this we&#x27;d have went and dug up the stuff yeah Valley went out Valley went out there with the idea with metal detectors and and the whole thing I haven&#x27;t finished the the book but they went out there I think a couple times to explore the site and they didn&#x27;t they didn&#x27;t find anything and then the kids said that they went into the craft and tore a uh with a the one of the kids the older kid I guess grabbed a not a crowbar but it&#x27;s one of those bars that they use on um when you chain oh you know the the when you you chain something down onto like a low boy it&#x27;s got like a ratchet system and you you take the bar and you ratchet in the strap yeah the strap so he took one of those bars went into the craft and he knocked this um thing off the wall the problem is is the picture of the thing it just looks like a aluminum cast fitting and the only thing they could find that it resembled was apart from a wind wind vein windmill oh really and they think it might have been from the Marconi Tower which had a generator on it the power something on the market so it was an alien it was part of what they hit this is what valley is speculating because and they these guys kept the part and one of the kids had it and then the other kid got uh but the Army showed up after the Army had come in and these guys had cleaned the area out and they came up and they asked to search these people&#x27;s homes looking for I guess material and they let him do it so one of the kids had this this thing he called it his testuro his treasure in Spanish and he uh the other kid buried it in um took it because they were the Army was searching for it buried it in one of their sheds and the shed was also used as a like temporary housing for um uh Farm Workers basically people that people that would come and do stuff and there was a guy I don&#x27;t know if it was a shepherd that was staying on their Ranch and he was sleeping in the shed and he had nightmares and said that these creatures had come in and were asking for their uh their Tesoro or something and he was totally the guy was freaked out woke up and was getting ready to shoot somebody oh wow and so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a strange story but the the kid had buried this this thing from that he took out of the craft in the shed and they still and the guy still had it so the guy the guy went to uh move to Washington State took it with him kept it all this time and Valley is actually they&#x27;ve actually taken pieces from it and tested it so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not conclusive at this point and the the aluminum piece looks like it is just a sand cast aluminum something and like I said Valley was speculating that it was um it might have been from the Marconi Windmill and got put in the The Craft by one of the gis when they&#x27;re cleaning up the area with the stuff that they weren&#x27;t kicking in the ditch and burying covering with stuff right but yeah it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a great story the um the kids spied on the um the gis when they&#x27;re staying there and cleaning it up and were able to watch them yeah it&#x27;s amazing Story I mean it&#x27;s a typical I mean like I said I was looking at the mile post I was trying to look it up well man you could just go there I didn&#x27;t know that it was under that&#x27;s imagine that they kicked it in a crevice and kicked dirt and brushed on you could just go get the you know Valley and Palo whatever you already found of that yeah they did that so this one says in the article here it also says maybe this was a list yeah so I couldn&#x27;t see it this is the list God I&#x27;m a nut it says from night it&#x27;s in the article it&#x27;s not in the book and I marked it so yeah great good good me uh from 1946 through 1949 25 UFO sightings that may have contained extraterrestrial life were reported worldwide by the center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence I&#x27;ve never even heard of that of those this is the list of those seven came from New Mexico including one near Magdalena 1946 Socorro 1947 that was that was the one where Zamora had seen um the craft land and take off and it left Burns marks and things and Zamora I mean in this area Zamora is I think distantly related to these guys so because it&#x27;s a you know it&#x27;s a rural New Mexico Community Roswell actually near Corona July 4th 1947 planes of Saint Augustine cats and Cat Catrin County July 5th 1947 Aztec 1948 White Sands 1949 and Roswell again 1949.</p>
<p>[Music] another was the pattern two on the Hopi reservation of Arizona in 1947. so this area had a lot of of potential UFO crashes this is a list I couldn&#x27;t find wiped out from yesterday it&#x27;s crazy A crazy amount yeah I&#x27;ve never even heard of this I gotta look this place up center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence cool and then uh I should say Valley he&#x27;s 80 he&#x27;s 80 years old was going out there and investigating this stuff this book&#x27;s two years old so did I send it to you did I send you a copy which one is it uh it&#x27;s not a hard it would be an e-book I might have sent you a copy of it yeah but maybe what&#x27;s it called uh Trinity the best kept secret oh yeah I think you did I had to download it I had to download some weird form out uh it&#x27;s ePub it&#x27;ll work on your iPad yeah it I was able to convert it okay um wow that&#x27;s amazing so you got anything else on this or uh yeah so these guys well one one of the interesting things is this one of the guys the younger guy joined the New Mexico reserves National Guard when he was 13. no 13. yeah they allow that yeah it was 18. no they allowed 13 because the National Guard was so decimated from World War II yeah they allowed him to join the uh I think this is the guy that became the cop later they&#x27;re amazing yeah they allowed him to join the National Guard at 13 and he was uh doing guard Duty that might even be in here um hell yeah here uh 1936 National Guard Jose Padilla was born in San Antonio November 1936.</p>
<p>well at Sakara high he left to join the National Guard at age 13. when very young children were allowed to sign up because of the World War II death toll in the New Mexico guard wow yeah it was crazy he actually became a uh was a safety inspector for the California Highway Patrol and it actually was shot once while while he was a hybrid highway patrolman well that&#x27;s nice yeah he uh they were when they were interviewing him for the book he was being evaluated because he still had a slug in him and the doctors were concerned you know about it causing problems and they were thinking about removing it and they decided not to decide to leave it alone which is probably the best best practice leave it alone because that has aged the the I think the anesthetic is more of a problem than the surgery yeah no well then they had the story of they had pieces of this thing and they used it to uh Rim a use it to stop a leak in a brass pipe under a window the other house the foil he kept it for years it was um he wrapped it on the threading for a fitting for the windmill wrapped it around the the threading and because he took the um he took the the part something had happened with the part and it needed to be welded and so he took it somewhere to be welded and the guy&#x27;s like it&#x27;s brass we can&#x27;t weld brass yeah so he took this foil and he wrapped it I guess the the pieces and wrapped it to bind the pieces together and then put it into the the pump at the well windmill at the farm at the ranch and he said it worked for years and eventually you know they were gone and they moved and the well got torn out or the the windmill got torn out and the parts gone piece of alien technology we can never we just can&#x27;t get that piece well he had someone else can&#x27;t get that piece of alien technology we&#x27;re just using it to repair windmills now yeah and put into the ground it worked well it was a great scene again it was a great thing to repair the um the windmill and he had someone else found another piece that they thought came from the the downed craft he had a cousin or somebody had found it when he was riding the the ranch and he just thought it was scrap metal and through they I guess they had a scrap metal pile and he just threw it in a scrap metal pile and they&#x27;re like he told the one of them about it and they&#x27;re like it&#x27;s you know like it sounds like it was something from the craft from the crash well but what I find interesting is that I think the Army came in there and and camouflaged the wreck and raked the area and probably rake the area through crap into the the thing picked up pieces and threw it into the craft raked the area and then had then later came in so I&#x27;m curious on that now the book is going into more detail and I&#x27;ll the next chapter in the book is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base ah yeah done we&#x27;ll see what we&#x27;ll see what&#x27;s going on with that um so we got we&#x27;re gonna go for another 10 minutes do we want to talk about the um UFO Lie from the New York Post yes let&#x27;s talk about the UFO lie all sap or a tip I should say that&#x27;s we&#x27;re going to call this episode is it all sap is it a tip his atip all sap is all sap a tip I mean is Alexander a liar is he telling the truth what do you think I&#x27;d well actually the New York Post basement office episodes are excellent and I&#x27;ve watched the next two which talk about Skinwalker Ranch which is which are very good it makes me want to read the book skinwalkers from the Pentagon which I have on uh my iPad and I&#x27;ve been confused when I&#x27;ve been reading about ASAP and atap because I see these these different names and stuff and this this uh YouTube video by the New York Post they actually explain that because apparently it went out under a bunch of different names that were sort of related and then they were talking about the confusion or when you the guy that does The Black Vault the confusion for when you&#x27;re requesting documentation through the Freedom of Information Act you have to use the right nomenclatures right names yeah which doesn&#x27;t matter because anything that could be you know the Freedom of Information Act is whatever they decide to release and under under the executive order from Ronald Reagan they can classify anything on the spot and then they can deny the existence of the document on the spot so Freedom of Information its teeth basically have been pulled by the executive order by Ronald Reagan so atip and ASAP are essentially the same thing atip was like a renaming was it by Elizondo or somebody um it was a nickname they said yeah Elizondo created the nickname and then gave himself the director title I don&#x27;t know it was went back and forth well I think there&#x27;s two different parts to the story there&#x27;s the uh the money part that went to like uh Bigelow and um Skinwalker Ranch and I&#x27;m my feeling at this point is that&#x27;s just you know money wasted yeah and that&#x27;s what they were trying to cover up because and then Bigelow is a big contributor to Harry Reid he didn&#x27;t contribute that in turn gave him funding for it was like a that they didn&#x27;t like that and they were trying to cover that up I think he didn&#x27;t get Harry Reid that much money I think Harry Reid it&#x27;s like 20 grand it wasn&#x27;t that much it was like 20 grand but this is still it&#x27;s the idea is the principle but I think Harry Reid was genuinely interested in having this stuff looked at yeah so I yeah he got money from Bigelow yeah he was friends with Bigelow um but he didn&#x27;t want to visit the ranch where the dino Beaver was Dino Beaver he didn&#x27;t want to be uh the dino Beaver he was still he was still looking out for his reputation he was still an active Senator at the time so yeah uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s fine and they talk about this guy output off how put off who did the he was the the guy one of the guys who would like the Stare at Goats have you seen that movie that got the Starrett goats movie it&#x27;s also oh yeah The Men Who Stare at ghosts goats yeah I&#x27;ve read the book and I&#x27;ve read the book and I&#x27;ve seen the movie how put off is also a Scientologist and he&#x27;s risen to the top level of Scientology he&#x27;s an ot7 which is I can&#x27;t remember what it is holy crap yeah he&#x27;s an ot7 Scientology yeah top of the top of the the whatever they do it begs the question I&#x27;ve heard this brought up before that you know all these sightings are para you know are paranormal we know that sting Walker Ranch is whatever it is but they&#x27;re paranormal even the UFO sightings they&#x27;re thinking is some weird you know it&#x27;s tying in somehow with Paranormal Activity I don&#x27;t know I I mean who knows we make fun of of we make fun of Skinwalker Ranch but I do still think I just you haven&#x27;t seen it but I just watched that interview with uh Travis Taylor Travis I have a Taylor it&#x27;s a good interview I mean I still think he&#x27;s talking about Skinwalker yeah he does how he he does does he say why I mean I&#x27;m gonna watch it anyway but I just give me the glue me in does he is he still supporting Skin Walkers he&#x27;s still supporting Skinwalker um he&#x27;s I think he&#x27;s I I think he&#x27;s genuinely honest and trying to figure what something if something&#x27;s going on out here I mean We complain about the the holes and the logic and the experimental stuff the reality and the reality of the thing but you know he has seen anything you know there isn&#x27;t any legitimate anything yeah I&#x27;m I&#x27;m um there&#x27;s nothing at all I mean I&#x27;m sorry it just doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s Oak Island with UFOs it is they&#x27;re gonna go years they&#x27;re gonna be they&#x27;re gonna milk this thing for years they&#x27;re filming season four right now and who&#x27;s watching it us uh I will watch it I will watch Bill watching it absolutely well it&#x27;s more interesting than Oak Island where they find I found a button but he&#x27;s uh I think he&#x27;s he&#x27;s genuinely he&#x27;s doing a decent job and I mean I wrote a defense of him at some point if it gets too bad I will read my defense of Travis Taylor I think you should do it now you should do it Bill oh yes fellow scientists Travis Taylor he is an accomplished he&#x27;s an accomplished person I mean you can&#x27;t deny his accomplishments and he&#x27;s got several degrees and they&#x27;re legit as people say he doesn&#x27;t have degrees it&#x27;s all provable we know it&#x27;s stupid you know I don&#x27;t deny him his degrees I deny him is a ability to be a scientist s of salt he should know better than to do these Carnival acts that he&#x27;s doing at skinwalker it&#x27;s yeah you said yourself the science is it well Olympic process is not there for lack of term you would use he complained in his interview that people don&#x27;t understand the scientific method and I um I don&#x27;t agree with that from what I&#x27;m seeing from the show I&#x27;m not a scientist and I can tell it&#x27;s garbage you know it&#x27;s like peace yeah they&#x27;re they&#x27;re pushing the envelope of believability it&#x27;s but he does theatrics he it&#x27;s theatrics it&#x27;s an entertainment but um and it&#x27;s money it&#x27;s money it always always comes down to money yeah I enjoy it I mean he&#x27;s he is an accomplished scientist he does know what he&#x27;s doing if he&#x27;s allowed to do it uh but he is his hands are going to be tied because he&#x27;s he&#x27;s part of the entertainment he&#x27;s so we don&#x27;t know where he&#x27;s coming from how much he he does not have final say on the editing of the show or what gets presented he&#x27;s doing no more than trying to legitimize the project to me you know this is he is he&#x27;s in it he is makes it you know it makes it seem real he is there to legitimize it yeah yeah that&#x27;s his role but he should know better I&#x27;m shame on him I don&#x27;t I he should know better there&#x27;s been no Dido beaver I haven&#x27;t seen the dog I do I will continue to give him the benefit of the doubt um until next season and then we&#x27;ll see but I am looking for a checking account he&#x27;ll see you&#x27;ll see the reason that Travis Taylor is doing this Travis Travis Travis Childers I got my check I got my check shut up so anyway coming back to the uh UFO lie it it it&#x27;s good the show is good because they they break it down to me they broke it down to the point where you have two different camps you have Elizondo and Chris melon and you have the lakaski so our biggest Camp so you have the um the what they call it the paranormal paranormal Disneyland component which is yeah Skinwalker Ranch and then you had sort of the breakout component which was Elizondo and melon and they are focusing on the documented anomalous phenomena that that the military has seen so I would say that Elizondo has done um us and melon have done a service so to break this out get this taken seriously it should be taken seriously and the um the other stuff that looks like there&#x27;s and this comes out in the later videos done by the basement office the problem with Skinwalker Ranch and all the money that they were throwing at it was uh people working Bigelow wasn&#x27;t there the chief scientists that were involved weren&#x27;t there so you had a bunch of people running around at the thing and you got Bigelow going I want results so they found results for them they saw they had to give justify their existence so you got people you know whatever&#x27;s going on uh and it just bore it just comes down to um you have to have good supervision good supervision if you&#x27;re going to do stuff like this especially if you got you know an arrogant millionaire yelling at people telling them that they got to have results or everyone&#x27;s going to be fired yeah and if you want to have if you&#x27;re working there and you&#x27;re getting good pay and it&#x27;s a good gig oh you&#x27;re gonna get results people are gonna say oh I saw this and it looked unusual and and I think they&#x27;re just milking they&#x27;re milking the cash flow you know what&#x27;s interesting is Bigelow after he backs out of everything now recently and I don&#x27;t know how recently this is but you and I have seen it where he all of a sudden is trying to find his dead relatives through parano and he&#x27;s had a lot of tragedy a lot of tragedy yes yes and uh he&#x27;s trying to trying to resurrect these dead relatives through paranormal means and I&#x27;m wondering as I watch this if there&#x27;s some tie-in you know skin walker and Bigelow paranormal dead relatives I don&#x27;t know I was you know well then I find the weirdest the putoff thing adds another element to that and I&#x27;ve actually started reading a some alternative books and I meant to have them over here but I I don&#x27;t have them but I&#x27;ll talk about it next time uh my impression is I don&#x27;t know a putoff is sort of out there in the associates with him or you know they&#x27;re staring at Goats trying to kill goats yeah sort of sort of people so they&#x27;re so they&#x27;re out there Scientology ot7 you know the guys yeah the guy&#x27;s on another planet um yep the so that that brings in an end they&#x27;re also associated with like CIA and stuff like that and Chris lato and his his um he did a great interview recently uh with this uh woman Professor that&#x27;s a religious studies person and she wrote a book about uh UFOs which I picked up I&#x27;m going to read and she he&#x27;s like he looks at putoff and some of these people and says they&#x27;re all tied in with the CIA so but you I think I mean Elizondo I think has ties in with the CIA through his dad and of course through his work but that&#x27;s that put off is a whole nother case and scenario that&#x27;s just that&#x27;s out there Elizondo and melon I think were genuinely trying to get some traction on the anomalous phenomena flying phenomena so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s I made it sound like Elizondo was involved he wasn&#x27;t the director but he was involved in delving in the UFO aspect from the outside almost yeah and and since there was um since there was no funding he was he was allowed I mean this a lot of organizations do this he was he was director of atip it&#x27;s as real as you want it to be in any organization especially a non-funded program you can name it whatever you want and you can be director and he was granted permission to do this as long as it didn&#x27;t interfere with his other duties he said okay was the actual director of ASAP right it was awesome but he was gone at some point and elizano was brought in to do you know sort of to do he said security and um counter Ops or Counter Intelligence and security yeah and then once like 12 Elizondo took over for him to 17 when he resigned yeah so he he but he had his other duties and then he had um the side job now a lot of government agencies universities do this you are allowed to do independent projects so it&#x27;s an unfunded independent project within the Pentagon in Elizondo I would say was definitely the director of this it was not an official project it was not a funded project so it is true when the Pentagon says he was not the director of Aesop and that&#x27;s true that is true but he was director of an unfunded project which was atip and he has he was granted permission to work on this project as long as it did not interfere with his other duties so you can&#x27;t I mean you it&#x27;s it&#x27;s splitting hairs corporations they&#x27;re looking for information on atip then you get denied because they&#x27;re like there is no a tip yeah I mean he looks awesome yeah and then it links into latasky well of course Elizondo sued into it through the Inspector General I don&#x27;t know what the results of that was said he wasn&#x27;t involved I think yeah well that the suit I think is more it&#x27;s to protect his reputation and it&#x27;s to protect his is probably protect his uh security cleanse her security clearance and probably his pension so he&#x27;s he has he&#x27;s doing that because there are people obviously in the Pentagon that want to um that are pushing back on what he&#x27;s done and one of the things I don&#x27;t think there are people that are happy about the release of these videos at risk anyway I think because he&#x27;s done some weird yeah I think he&#x27;s okay but the um but I think I think the the thing that he&#x27;s filed with the IG is preemptive to prevent further um pushback by the Pentagon at his pension at his security clearance and it&#x27;s just pushed they are pushing at him he&#x27;s pushing back a little bit now the problem his problem and is he sent these videos to Chris Mellon the the videos were not uh classified but they were not authorized for release to the general public and that&#x27;s well documented and there&#x27;s a video of him when he was asked about sending these these videos and he got really embarrassed about it so he screwed up that&#x27;s a big screw up on his part and it&#x27;s well documented that Chris melon got these videos from him now Elizondo did not release the the videos to the public melon did that and melon has said that he did this so there can be there can be a backlash to Elizondo because of this release because he gave him to to melon but then melon was melon was a big shot at the Pentagon and Mellon could um could rightfully have access to these documents so you can&#x27;t say that Elizondo necessarily did anything wrong a mistake he made a may have technically made a mistake but technically he didn&#x27;t do anything wrong he was a big wig at the Pentagon and he&#x27;s heavily connected and he&#x27;s not they&#x27;re not going to do anything to melon he&#x27;s Rich anyway you can yeah they&#x27;re not going to touch him whatever I&#x27;ve got my own money so elizondo&#x27;s on the hook for this release but he&#x27;s not the bad guy in the release melanius but melons nothing&#x27;s going to come back so the only it&#x27;s like the um you know that Erica the aircraft carrier that burnt down in San Diego remember that being on the news a few years ago so that was a disaster because the port capped and it is so funny they didn&#x27;t never train anybody on firefighting well this for this aircraft carrier aircraft carrier catches on fire the port Captain is fighting with the ship&#x27;s captain about who&#x27;s responsible for fighting the fire so that was a that was a mess they hadn&#x27;t anybody trained to fight the fire and the aircraft carrier burnt down and is a total an aircraft carrier burnt down is a total loss so they got something yeah they got some schwabe that they decide is is responsible they gotta blame somebody so this guy this kid they just put him on trial he was found not guilty and this is a military trial in a military trial are ruthless for for how they treat people and the captain in charge of this military trial said he&#x27;s there&#x27;s no evidence that this guy started the the fire so the the bigwigs at the Pentagon in the Navy were looking for a scapegoat for why this aircraft carrier burnt down and they tried to pin it on this kid and that&#x27;s the problem that&#x27;s what&#x27;s elizondo&#x27;s problem is is people may be upset at the release of these videos and they feel they got a pin it on somebody and he&#x27;s oh I don&#x27;t blame man yeah he&#x27;s the Fall Guy and that&#x27;s why he that&#x27;s why he needs to be careful because they are looking for a Fall Guy and and these people hold grudges forever so yeah that&#x27;s swabby and the the thing is the other guy that they think actually may have lit the fire has already been discharged and the Navy&#x27;s like oh we don&#x27;t have any off we don&#x27;t have any authority to pursue charges against him because he was discharged he&#x27;s a civilian now yeah I mean it&#x27;s crazy so yeah they had the pennant they they you know when the the bigwigs screw up or when there&#x27;s a screw up and the release of these documents I&#x27;m sure those people view it as a screw-up they gotta scapegoat it because you know when something like this happens ultimately what it should happen is that the people at higher levels are responsible for when this happens and they should take responsibility but nobody does anymore so you know the genie is already out of the bottle so it really doesn&#x27;t
