            <p>the scientist is totally proven. Um it worked and he was going to be a zillion or whatever. He&#x27;s going to transform society. And uh the problem was once the news of his engine got out, the oil stocks crashed. They just crashed.</p>
<p>So the oil industry lobbyed the US government. We have to do something about this. And in 1951, the invention secrecy act was passed. So now if you patent any device that is more than 20% efficient, that&#x27;s instantly classified. That&#x27;s that is now a state secret.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s vital to national security. You can&#x27;t talk about it. You can&#x27;t um build it. And you can&#x27;t sell it unless you sell it to the US military. You cannot do it.</p>
