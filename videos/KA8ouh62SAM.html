            <p>all right how&#x27;s everyone doing out there I am Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos and uh many different topics but today uh for uh the last couple months we&#x27;ve been working on studying up on the reciprocal system of theory which is a Theory of Everything uh developed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century up until he died back in 1990 and since then it&#x27;s been uh you know uh extended and forwarded by uh many others a few others not so many no one knows about this very few people know about this but uh Bruce Perrette was one of the spearheaders there uh he passed away uh back in 2020 and so uh you know the reciprocal system uh is uh in danger of uh slipping through the cracks here and getting thrown onto the trash heap of History so hopefully people like me will be able to uh keep it uh keep it relevant and um keep refining it as well so the basic idea of Larson&#x27;s Theory system of theory he has books on um mostly on scientific topics right now we&#x27;re covering uh his final book called beyond space and time and that was on um metaphysics psychology philosophy and religion uh it came out posthumously in 1995 and um the gist of Larson&#x27;s system of theory is in articulated in his first postulate um and it basically is that the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other meaning that they have the same qualities but they are uh you know basically the numerator and denominator of a fraction space and time both are quantized meaning that they have a smallest units and below that unit it does not exist uh and uh one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light the speed of light is not the maximum speed of the universe but the speed of light is the midpoint or neutral point of the universe unlike what Einstein would say and um the half there&#x27;s so there is half of the universe that&#x27;s actually moving faster than the speed of light and Larson calls that the cosmic sector or sector two sector one is the material sector that we&#x27;re familiar with the the slower than the speed of light uh sector um which is the realm of physical chemistry you know atoms and molecules but when atoms and molecules build up to their most complicated form uh which is DNA containing billions of atoms per molecule uh then that that uh DNA molecule becomes eligible to be taken over by a cosmic unit or control and um this unit controls in the same way that a thermostat controls a room it&#x27;s a small part of the overall structure but it controls the environment and when a material and a cosmic unit join together in such a way Larson calls that a life unit so life is the merging or the putting together of a material and a cosmic unit kind of in the right configuration and then beyond that when a life unit gets to its most complicated level which Larson uh says is the intelligent human being then uh that being becomes eligible to be taken over by a being from sector three sector three is the uh generalized area that is independent of space and time or you know precedes space and time where you can&#x27;t really say proceeds because that&#x27;s a time uh implied uh statement there or word but um it transcends space and time independent of space and time and uh that&#x27;s what Larson calls sector three and uh sector three is I guess Larson&#x27;s synonym for uh God or the spiritual uh realm and uh then uh the sector 3 unit is uh and its objectives are good and ethical uh as opposed to sector two life the life uh or the life unit it&#x27;s governed by survival so the human being is somewhat caught the intelligent human being is somewhat caught in the middle there uh where they are getting input um for their survival but they are also getting input for their good behavior or ethical Behavior many times those two dovetail and they work the same uh but sometimes they work opposite and in those cases the human being has to be able to decide which to choose now we are looking at a chapter 14 here which is called uh thinking and memory think in memory are both really sector two things they are um survival type things and they are kind of on the uh steps uh toward this intelligent human being you know both thinking and memory are basically prerequisites for an intelligent human being which then becomes eligible for sector 3 control so um you know these are this so it does have sector three relevance but it is not specifically about sector three uh both of these things are are sector two ah qualities and now he&#x27;s talking about uh sleep and dreaming here uh and uh we just got done kind of explaining that the purpose of sleep is to really basically rewind the thinking and memory processes because thinking and memory cannot operate continuously because it they get out of sync with the material structure because the material structure is uh governed by clock time the clock the time is always progressing now incidentally space is also always progressing too and that we see that as the recession of the distant galaxies um but time is always progressing in a scalar manner meaning it has no specific Direction in the same manner as the recession of the distant galaxies and that&#x27;s what called the scalar motion which you can Envision by using a balloon and putting magic and a magic marker and putting dots on the balloon then you blow up the balloon all the dots move away from each other uh but in no particular direction or or in all particular directions that&#x27;s a scalar outward motion you suck in the balloon they move together that&#x27;s an inward scalar motion and [Music] um just another brief comment on reciprocity a reciprocal if you if you forgot your math uh from seventh grade or whatever um a reciprocal like so the reciprocal of three is one-third okay a reciprocal when you when you multiply two reciprocals you get one and um so three and one-third are reciprocals of each other they both have the same quality that three it&#x27;s the same quality but they&#x27;re the opposite and so when you uh go from sector one to sector two you can extrapolate they are the same except that they&#x27;re opposite the roles of space and time reverse and so even though we don&#x27;t have direct access to sector two we can tell what&#x27;s in sector two by what&#x27;s in sector one and uh so that&#x27;s kind of a little bit about how the reciprocal system works okay um now when he&#x27;s talking about sleep he&#x27;s saying that this the material sector is governed by this progression of time whereas the cosmic sector is uh governed by what he calls coordinate time three-dimensional time which is like XYZ coordinates um and so the uh the cosmic sector eventually Gets Out Of Tune or out of timing out of sync with this uh material structure and when it&#x27;s out of sync it&#x27;s less able to control uh control the material sector and so uh evolutionarily it&#x27;s had to develop a method to basically um undecouple from the material sector and Rewind so that it gets back in the sink and that&#x27;s the that is the purpose of sleep is what he says so here we&#x27;re going to take over here in the middle of this chapter we can deduce from theoretical premises that the time correction is accomplished by operating the mental processes in Reverse during sleep on the basis of our normal understanding of the effect of reversals it would appear that a period of sleep equal in length to the preceding waking period would be required in order to complete the synchronation synchronization of an apparatus that operates continuously development of the reciprocal system of theory has revealed however that the effective magnitude of all primary physical quantities is the amount by which they deviate from Unity the speed of light rather than from the mathematical zero so this is the reciprocal system in a nutshell the universe of emotion in a nutshell the neutral point of the universe is the speed of light Unity so our measurements are made from that zero uh the zero the speed of light uh up or down from the speed of light not from the mathematical zero like the no motion at all and so you&#x27;re always having to to add this one unit before you are able to kind of get into the middle and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re not we don&#x27;t need to rewind for 12 hours a day but only for eight hours a day because uh this one unit is already present and so here he explains each such quantity has an initial positive level of one unit which has no physical effect okay so we feel the speed of light as no physical effect that is our that is how we feel zero reversal of the direction of the mental processes during sleep reverses the initial level of each individual time unit as well as that unit itself and the total deviation from the positive in uh unit level during one unit of reverse operation is therefore two units if the mental process is process is in full operation when the individual is awake his sleep periods should theoretically amount to one-third of the total time and this is roughly an agreement with Human Experience now after that explanation I would say that I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with uh his findings because uh I think that really you only need like two hours of sleep if you&#x27;re eating right um and you take care of yourself um but people don&#x27;t do that so they need eight hours of sleep so he might need to revise that or he might have needed to revise that but um anyway physical or mental abnormalities may increase or decrease the sleep time incipient mental disturbances for instance are often correlated with reduced amounts of sleep as would be expected if there are significant interruptions in the thought processes which reduce the total operating time is also true that there seems to be some variation above and below the theoretical eight hours in the individual requirements for sleep even where no abnormalities are present but it is doubtful if the apparent variations in average sleep time are real what appears to be a greater amount of sleep may be due to a number of short intervals during which the individual is actually awake perhaps the borderline state known as drowsiness similarly a well-known phenomena called micro sleep which involves a succession of short sleep intervals May well account for the apparently low sleep requirements of other persons as already noted the control mechanism of the higher animals including man consists of two distinct Parts the memory the memory apparatus and the thinking apparatus both have Cosmic or inverse elements that is they operate electrically rather than by means of material forces and both must therefore undergo periodic synchronization with the material structure but the memory apparatus is simpler and more primitive than the thinking apparatus furthermore it evidently is not as a whole in full operation continuously it therefore accomplishes the necessary adjust Readjustment in less time uh in order to allow the synchronization of the thinking apparatus to catch up the memory apparatus is disconnected from the adjustment process periodically and allowed to operate for a time in its normal manner except that it remains separated from the motor mechanism and the contact with the outside world the most striking physiological feature of this phase of the sleep cycle is a rapid movement of the eyes and for this reason it is called uh REM sleep um rapid eye movement the phase during which the entire mental mechanism is undergoing the synchronization of adjustment is non-rem sleep the three different physiological conditions that have been discussed uh then he has a little table there but the basic gist of it is that the memory is less complicated than the thinking and so the rewinding of the memory takes less time than the rewinding of the thinking and so there&#x27;s a period where both the memory and the thinking are rewinding and that uh is here he uh where they&#x27;re both uh adjusting uh then that is what&#x27;s called non-rem sleep when the memory is finished adjusting but the thinking is still adjusting then we have REM sleep or dreaming so dreaming is the result of uh the memory being already rewound but the thinking is still rewinding and so the memory is rewound and so it is basically in a situation of idling uh like a an a motor idling uh it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not like engaged with the outside world because you&#x27;re asleep but it is uh it would really be like kind of like half sleeping and uh now he cites a bunch of literature of uh these uh evolutionary biologists or whatever they are um saying that the purpose of of dreaming is a mystery he says the purpose is simply to prevent over correction of the time deviation in the memory apparatus as in the case of positive deviation that is corrected by the synchronization process there is a tolerance in the negative Direction and aside from building up the negative equivalent of sleep pressure that results from sleep deprivation lack of REM sleep has no important effects within the zone of tolerance beyond the limit of this Zone adverse physiological effects begin to develop similar in some respects but apparently not as severe as those resulting from complete deprivation of sleep the less severe reaction is understandable in as much as lack of REM sleep affects only the memory system while the total deprivation of sleep it affects the entire mental apparatus a report uh and then he gets into some other commentary the pattern of REM sleep in in in animals indicates that the structural complexity of the thinking apparatus falls off more rapidly than that of the memory apparatus as we follow the evolutionary scale downward a relationship that is to be expected since memory necessarily precedes thought we could have memory without thinking but thinking without memory is impossible mammals as a class have well-defined REM periods but the REM sleep of birds has been reported as minimal while reptiles apparently have none at all indicating that their memory synchronization time is ample to take care of the needs of their rudimentary thinking apparatus very young infants on the other hand go to The Other Extreme and spend half or more of their sleep time in the REM State this probably indicates that the thinking mechanism develops more rapidly than the memory mechanism in the early stages of the infant&#x27;s growth The observed gradual decline of their normal adult REM time then naturally follows okay so that is his theoretical explanation of dreaming um and then from here he&#x27;s going to discuss what uh how to kind of interpret dreams uh what they mean and so on uh I think maybe that will come in here later in this chapter and then in the next chapter called the stuff of dreams so we will take over there when we resume tomorrow hope everybody&#x27;s out there is having a good day and uh hope to see you coming back uh if you don&#x27;t understand all this that&#x27;s fine we&#x27;ll get to the finer points later okay have a great day</p>
