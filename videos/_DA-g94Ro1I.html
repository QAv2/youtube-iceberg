            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Yeah by what they&#x27;ve read and seen since describing essentially what they remember yeah it&#x27;s just a nice part of the world is yeah everybody&#x27;s so helpful hang on let&#x27;s let&#x27;s uh let&#x27;s see how our tanker toys are all put together here have we got any kind of an audio l yeah if you just want to give me a little bit of Glen would you just uh say a couple things let okay first of all the phone was ringing right okay the way really the way I became involved in this was started out in the after early afternoon around probably 1:30 in the afternoon and I received a telephone call from the marcher wary officer out at the Walker Air Force Base Army Airfield Base and uh he was requiring inquiring about what would be the smallest possible casket that we could get that would be hermetically sealed and uh at that time I know that we had used like the four feet and uh caskets we had used those before but I thought thought they also made them in a 36 so uh but I he wanted to know if we had any in stock and I said no but I if I can make a called Amell I can have him in you know by 7:00 the next morning on the truck so he said I&#x27;ll get back to you and uh that was the first Contact that I had with the base and then what then he called back uh oh probably 45 minutes or so l and he said I need to ask you some more questions he said in case something like this should happen he said we uh we need to know what the preparation what how what your preparations are for the bodies that had been laying out in the elements you know and uh he said we need to know also what uh what if your treatments of of the bodies are the remains uh what could you do to them and if your treatments would it would it change any of the chemical breakdown of the tissues the blood would it make a difference and I said I thought probably it would and I said uh of course he knew exactly how we would treat those bodies CU we have an outline from them and what we really have to do I think he at that he already at that point knew knew exactly what we would have to do did he disclose to you what he had no I told him I said if you if you have a problem if you want you know if you have something you don&#x27;t really know what to do about it let me come out and I&#x27;ll you know try to help you do whatever you want to do and he said okay and he said no he said let&#x27;s let&#x27;s just back up just um let&#x27;s start again with you were saying you told him that you can come out and take care of what he had right yeah why don&#x27;t you pick it up from that so and he said well you know we don&#x27;t really have anything he said we&#x27;re sitting here thinking in case we should get involved in something like this you know what would be our preparation what what would should we do then I you know I went through I said do you really want to know how we would do it well yes you know we would like to know so that&#x27;s when I explained to him that we would have the Vats that we would fill up with the with form Malahide solution with water and we put the bodies in them uh let them stay there for 24 hours and then take them out and U then we would pack the bodies in the would be a sawdust and really a [Music] lime what we would pack them in then WRA them in in the place that&#x27;s bodies that were badly decomposed if there was tissue deep tissue we would have to do it hypodermically with needles to get to the deep tissue then we would have to aspirate the cavities if the cavities hadn&#x27;t already ruptured and then put some cavity fluid in those I said that&#x27;s you know kind of normal procedure now at one point you finally offered to take care of it for them well offered two three times yeah can you review what that conversation that point you mean when I offered to take care of them yeah he said well we we don&#x27;t really right at this time we don&#x27;t really need your assistant but he said in case something like this should happen then he said we would be prepared and we would know what to do then we got back onto the subject of maybe not damaging any of the of the chemicals uh compounds or anything with the bodies or you know tissues whatever because it uh they wanted you know how do you would you pick bodies up like that and what would you do not to to uh contaminate any of it didn&#x27;t this begin to seem a little strange to you at that point well I thought maybe what happened they might have had a VIP or you know some officer and something that happened they maybe they didn&#x27;t want you know want to keep it quite and they probably want to do it themselves not be involved with the civilian and uh businesses or anything so after these conversations you were curious and you went on out to the base as I understand can you review that well I didn&#x27;t go out to the base yeah I was curious but the only I didn&#x27;t go out to the Bas and probably a couple hours later and I&#x27;d got an emergency call there was an Airman that was injured in an accident and I took the Airman to the base he rode in the ambulance with me and I took him out to the virgin streamer and that&#x27;s way I became really involved out the base I didn&#x27;t go out just because I was curious give me the sequence from the time you picked up the Airmen and just described to me well and I got the call you know I left the funeral home and the amess went to the scene of the accident picked the Airman up he I did not Place him on a stretcher because uh he had a head injury and a nose I think his nose was fractured so I did some minor uh first stayed and then he sat in the front seat with me all the way to the base when we got to the base then uh he walked into the emergency room I didn&#x27;t uh have to take him in they didn&#x27;t bring out a you know a gurnie or anything we just he just walked in on his own then I never did see him after that then I had this friend that I wanted to talk to and say this uh is a lieutenant nurse that I knew quite well that had only been there roxim only been commissioned and been there to sign this was their first assignment to the out it to the air base and U I wanted to talk to her and so this I was going down the hall and I uh first thing the lady that I want the lieutenant that I wanted to see was coming out of one room going across the hall to the other and she noticed it me she said how did you get in here and what are you doing in here and she said you better get out in a hurry she said you&#x27;re going to get in a lot of trouble she said would you please leave and get out of here in a hurry and then about I turned around and then about and she went on into the other room then in about time I turned around there was a there was another officer said hey wait a minute and I said uh looks like you had a crash they said I see there&#x27;s some you know in the ambulance in the ambulances out there I see a lot of recogniz said where was the crash and he said there wasn&#x27;t any crash and he said uh then he said just wait a minute then I he said wait a minute and I you know stood there for a minute he turned around and evidently he must have waited for somebody else to come out because there was another officer coming out he said this man says there was a crash out at the base he said he wanted to know about he was inquiring about our crash and this was when and I encountered he was a redheaded officer and uh very nasty very uh BR he said uh he did not see any crash there was not any cat crash and he said uh you get the hell out of here and you didn&#x27;t see anything and you don&#x27;t talk to anybody he said you&#x27;re going to get in hell of a lot of trouble and I said look I&#x27;m a civilian and the damn thing you can do to me about it he said No but somebody might be picking your bones out of the sand that&#x27;s when he made the remark there then there was a black sergeant that was standing beside him and he said yeah but he would make better dog food for our dogs course I didn&#x27;t understand that but my father happened to be an Old Trapper and for a hobby and everything and I said my father uses guys like you for baai and his cow traps and then there was two MPS that joined me right on took me outside and each holding me by my elbow and escorted me out to the back to the ambulance and followed me all the way back to the funeral home now as you were entering the hospital just saw something three trucks yeah when yeah cuz usually where I parked there was three field ambulances parked in the area where I usually park where we be back up to the to the ramps so I just pulled up to the side in front of those and parked out in the front and the Airmen and I got out and walked in so uh when I passed when I got up went up the steps up the ramp and I was walking uh going into the emergency room I noticed that the doors were open and and but what was odd about it there was an MP standing beside each one of the vehicles in the back it&#x27;s standing there and the doors were open actually I was curious and you know I just happened to look in that&#x27;s when I saw some debris or it looked like parts of a plane or something that they hadn&#x27;t had a crash cuz I&#x27;ve seen them do this a lot of times bring in pieces in the old ambulances in can you describe the debris yeah they were I noticed in two of the ambulances there was some debris that was probably 2 and 1 half to 3 ft you know long and probably high that was propped up on the side of the emets there they were kind of in the shape of maybe like a half a canoe they they were like the front part of a canoe and uh you know it looked like it looked like it might be aluminum but it it looked more like it was the metal looked more like stainless steel that had been heated it was blue kind of a bluish tent to it but what was odd about it it looked like around the curve part in the front of the canoe there was some some uh design signs or something it kind of reminded me of maybe some Egyptian signs or whatever and it was probably about 3 in and high and probably the length of what the wage I saw it looked like it was and the same thing was in in the other ambulance too I mean I saw practically the same thing the the pieces that were practically the same size and ins signas look like whatever that might be was uh part of the record how did n how did your friend feel about what she saw well I didn&#x27;t know really until until the uh till the next day and I wanted to I called out I kept trying to get a hold of her because naturally I was curious and I wanted to know what was going on and so I called out the next day and then probably around 11:30 she said I know you&#x27;ve been trying to get a hold of me but I haven&#x27;t been available and she said why don&#x27;t you meet me at the Officers Club if you if you have time meet at the officer club and we&#x27;ll have lunch and I wanted I want to talk to you and the funeral home we had at at that time we had all the some of the businesses there had an associate membership to the Officers Club and our funeral home had that membership and also had a card to identify myself and what business that I was you know associated with so I had no problem only time I go to the base all I had to do a lot of times if it was in the evening i&#x27; have to stop and sign a visitors and get a visitors pass and then turn it in when I left but it was no problem going out there so I went on out and met her beg you pardon tell me about lunch well we you know both ordered I&#x27;m not sure remember what we ordered but it was just a light just a light lunch but she was so upset uh she looked like she was you know in shock is what she really talked like and looked like and uh she said I want it she said I said well I was just curious on reason I want to talk to you I was curious on what happened and she said well you won&#x27;t believe it and she says I don&#x27;t believe it either but she said uh I got in a lot of trouble on this thing I probably I&#x27;m not real sure about this but she said when I then she pulled out of a little purse or little pocketbook whatever she had there she gave me a little diagram that she had that she had drawn some D some uh figures of of some arms in the face and so on she told me that this is what you know was what was in those that it was a crash wasn&#x27;t an airplane but they didn&#x27;t know what it was at that time these were bodies yeah but she said we have three bodies that there was three bodies she said two of them were very mutilated one look like it might have walked out that it you know might have lived a little while and she explained they were like three and A2 ft four feet tall the uh two of the bodies were the the you couldn&#x27;t identify much because they were practically destroyed and it looked like maybe that they might have been uh a predatory animal or something might have uh been doing some damage on the bodies too how did she describe your head your hands well she said the your head and then the the little drawings that I had she the way she explained it and the way she drew it that the heads were somewhat larger than than a human heads the hands were long no thumbs it was just the long very delicate fingers at the end of on the underside at the tip of each fingers was a pad likee um maybe a little Pad but it looked like the skin had maybe little suction like the little suction cups on those on the uh no fingernails on the hands the head the lips were very just a long narrow more or less not full lips like we would have in a in most of our people but very fine line very fine lips uh there was no teeth that was the inside of of the mouth it was it was kind of like a real uh a gums maybe it was uh you said explained it it was almost as hard as if it was rawh hiide maybe H that the uh the ears there was only two small orices on each side of the head with look like a couple of small loes that might some way that might cover both of those but there was not a p ear and also that the nose there was only two small orices in the nose with it was there was really no nose that was convex it was all just flush with the of the face was she emotional about all this very much so very emotional she would have to stop and drink water every once in a while and also she never touched her meal that all the time we were talking in an hour and a half that we were there she never touched her meal any other demonstrations of emotion indications of how she was excited well just you know every once in a while she&#x27;d go like this you know and ringing her hands and she said it was the most most uh horri I&#x27;ve never been so horrified in my life I&#x27;ve never seen anything so gruesome in my life I&#x27;ve never smelt anything that smelt worse in my life and she told me that when I saw her she was leaving the room to go to the bathroom because she was deathly ill and was going to throw up did she recognize any of the doctors by the examining the body she told me U she said I don&#x27;t I ask you that question which of the doctors and she said I don&#x27;t know that she said I don&#x27;t know that I knew them and that was her answer so but she said she walked in the room and they said hey we need you you need to help us and uh that was way she became involved in it then she got ill the doctors also became very ill they would have to do little examination then they&#x27;d have to leave and go sit down and then they would come back and do a little bit more it was that bad after your conversation with her at launch can you describe what happened that did you how you r to see her again and how you learned the well yeah we visited a while and then I had to get back to the funeral home go back to work but uh then uh I never did see her after that and I called out the next day to see how she was feeling see what and they told me that she wasn&#x27;t available then I wouldn&#x27;t be available that day I called the next day and they told me that she&#x27;d been transferred and it was rather odd because CU she&#x27;d only been at the base Less Than 3 months that was her on commission less than three months and that was her first assignment so it was rather odd that she would be transferred out you know within three months so later on you attempted you got a I guess you got a letter then about two weeks probably two weeks at least two weeks could have been a little longer but I know it was at least two weeks I got a I got a letter addressed to me at glenis at The Bard funel home with uh she didn&#x27;t sign it didn&#x27;t have any returned address or anything on it but inside of the letter it was just a note she said I don&#x27;t have time to write I will write later later this is my APO number and that was that was extent of it so then I wrote back to her and uh asking her more or less how you know how she was feeling and why the sudden transfer and then I was hope that she wasn&#x27;t in any trouble it was just a short note I really didn&#x27;t go into a lot of detail or anything then probably 3 weeks or probably a month after that then I got the letter that I had mailed to her it was return it was stamped return and also it&#x27;s on the on in red printing it said deceased and that&#x27;s the last time I ever heard or heard anything about it then well probably then I went out to the base uh few days later and I was talking to one of the nurses and I said you know whatever happened to the lieutenant and she said well the rumor is that we heard that she was killed with five other nurses in a training mission in a plane crash and that was it no indication where well it was in London England she said in my in the note that she sent me that she was in London Station in London and that was it that&#x27;s the last time I ever heard do you believe that she&#x27;s dead no I don&#x27;t think so after all that&#x27;s happening and after you know threatening me and everything I doubt very seriously that she was I would hope not what would you like to say to her if she happen to see this well she happened to this see if she she feels like the you know she wants to talk if she feels like I would like to hear from her yes see what&#x27;s been going on in her life and why she wasn&#x27;t able to contact me if she you know feels like it let not for um now the sheriff told your father you were in trouble okay what happened there then the next day after I was there when I had the problem problem with the officer and the black man I was told my father was contacted by our Sheriff George Wilcox which was a very close friend of my father they were very good friends and uh he called uh to see if my father was home because he wanted to come out and talk to my father and he did so and he told my father that there was a black sergeant from the base that came to the his office was inquiring about who my parents were my mother and my father if I had any brothers or sisters and all you know wanted to know my what my personal family who they were and where they were George said that he didn&#x27;t he knew I had some family but he didn&#x27;t know you know where they were anything else so anyway he told my father that he did contact my father and he told my father that he thought I might be in some trouble and uh but he didn&#x27;t they evidently didn&#x27;t explain why I was in trouble so you know first thing my father did was get in his car and come to the funeral home he said we had to talk because he and I were very close we were real you know real good friends the best friend I ever had was my father he said I&#x27;ve got to talk he said if you&#x27;re in trouble he said we we&#x27;ve got to do something about and I said I&#x27;m not in trouble he said well you are he said George Wilcox told me that you were in a lot of trouble and that you got involved in something that you had no business getting involved in and that you could be in a lot of trouble and I said then so I told my father the story and he&#x27;s the only man that I&#x27;ve ever told this story to until I talk to Stan fredman and to you people and that&#x27;s it period And I did tell my father what what the story was of course it was you know it was unbelievable for him but then he became very upset and he wanted to go shoot a few people and all that because they did threaten my life and you know and they so that was the way my father heard about it and that was extent my family and he never would tell them who my brother I had a brother that was a fighter pilot during that time and I had three sisters and uh one of them was a nurse but I but he would never tell them anything and so he didn&#x27;t tell the sheriff or anybody else cuz the sheriff was supposed to call him back and give him the names and where they were at and he wouldn&#x27;t do it let&#x27;s get back to your friend did she Express an opinion as to what she thought these beings were did she think did she think they came with well she all she was all the only remark that she ever made was that they definitely weren&#x27;t humans as as we know humans but they could be from another planet or the doctors were explaining this that they couldn&#x27;t be from our planet they had to be an alien it had to be something else but not not in our planet she had a phas she used to describe how they look to her you remember that you were telling you like little black chin well she said that well of course they were you know first thing she said they were black they were just as black as it could be but probably laying out in the elements in in July and Roswell with 105 to 110 temperature every day and 80 degrees or so at night I mean that&#x27;s not that wouldn&#x27;t be Inc commmon because we picked up a lot of sheep HS of people that have been found dead that&#x27;s laying in the desert you know for days and didn&#x27;t more rattlesnakes or whatever and they do turn you know as black as they can and I know exactly what they were talking about be with the smell and the odor being so drastic because this is a very unpleasant situation you know and let&#x27;s talk about their eyes how did she describe their eyes well she said that of course Their Eyes Were set back into the skull oh and it was a remarkable I thought it was interesting also that she said their skulls the doctor said their skulled bone structure wasn&#x27;t like ours it wasn&#x27;t actually a bone it was probably a real heavy cartilage it it looked more or less like a newborn baby the skull was very pliable you could Mash on the skull and it would you know it would give and so it the bone structure it wasn&#x27;t bones not like our bones it was our skull and everything what about the bones and the hands and arms is said very fine very delicate the arm bones they like the radial the Y and in the arm that uh that was so fine that he doubt if they could lift you know she said they doubt if they anyone in that that size and the arms of that could lift 50 lbs on the earth or anywhere else you know they doubted they had that strength but she said what the one that hadn&#x27;t been uh mutilated to a great extent it reminded him of a real small ancient Chinese person no hair at all and uh very very delicate skin in fact they said the skin would look like they could almost see through it almost transparent um why don&#x27;t you give me a paragraph on the years and well the ears like I think I stated to you that the ears there was a couple of small orices one on top of the other with two little lobe flaps one over the other they didn&#x27;t really know how those if they had any significance how they worked or what they wasn&#x27;t I mean they didn&#x27;t go into that the nose was only a couple of very small orices holes right there just above the lip line but it had uh there wasn&#x27;t anything covering it and it was just like two small indentations there and that was it said it was very unusual does anyone else you you&#x27;re talking about the hands the hands yeah descri hands the the hands well there was one hand there was there was one hand that evidently that wasn&#x27;t attached to the arm and she said that where she got sick and left the room was that this doctor had the long forp and pick the hand up and turned it over and that&#x27;s when they noticed that there wasn&#x27;t any thumb none of them had none of the bodies had any thumbs or anything they were just long very fine U very delicate fingers no fingernails but right at the tip of each finger right at the tip of each finger it looked like there was a pad and in this pad it looked like it might have had very small little they were like little suction cups very minute suction cups the doctor that&#x27;s the way he explained it that was looking at it let&#x27;s tap we need to get the arm as well okay yes the arm we need to go about the arm really magazine we published and with the ads of the tips maybe you can get can you get a copy of them I can that be happy it&#x27;s amazing it all fits together that&#x27;s thing obviously it would know about your information yeah well see I&#x27;ve never I&#x27;ve never discussed this with anyone my father was the only person I really ever discussed this I didn&#x27;t discuss it at the funeral home or anything else I never discussed it with any of my family period I never have until I met Stan Freeman two years ago it&#x27;s the first time I ever discussed it would you have an interest in dubs of testimony that we get from other people here I&#x27;d be happy I&#x27;d love to yeah but I you know I&#x27;d love to I&#x27;d like to have a tape of mine also if you you know maybe can send you two one you know my daughter said if you know I want to tape of this and I want to keep it you know and I want it in the family but we we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll make you up yeah I would have to you know whatever if you guys feel comfortable I&#x27;d love to you know have some tapes or whatever you know absolutely we got quite a few that we could probably run off what you have VHS or beta machine tap I I&#x27;ll see till we get some thought of other people&#x27;s interview I just go to Kmart or wherever and buy the I think we have the tap going now why don&#x27;t we start with the he talked about the hands for continuity might be good to go to the arm this will all be edited anyway but we can start wherever you like you want want to go let&#x27;s start with the arms okay forget the camera see if he was ready it&#x27;s not there it&#x27;s not there it&#x27;s all right but you were asking me to to describe the arms and this was another thing that the lieutenant brought out that it was that it was very uh the difference between their and ours that the that the from the rest to the first joint here that it was probably one and a half times longer than the top part up here it was it was very oddl looking it was very odd she said and U the uh very small very small arms very small bone structure bone structure was bone structure uh of course I asked her about the bones because we were talking about the wrist bones and everything and she said it was very similar to ours but the bones were so small that that their bones proba wasn&#x27;t in in the arm wasn&#x27;t any larger than my finger W so um okay now give me two three sentences on how they were dressed she we never mentioned it never talked about the dress did she say anything about sex so was she able she said she really never she was so sick and everything that never even entered her mind so was it guess not no way to determine the sex of the beings then well it wasn&#x27;t discussed with her it probably was but she like she said I was so ill and so horrified that that I don&#x27;t you know she said she sat up all night and and she knew I was going to be real concerned knew I was going to be on what happened you know she knew that I got in trouble probably and she would drew that you know she set up and made a little notes on the back of these little prescription pads and that&#x27;s what she had her notes made out and that&#x27;s what we discussed particularly what she had I was very interested in that you had kept so many records of the incident and pertaining to everything that you know regarding the UFO correction and you kept them in the uh you know there at Bard and then later they disappeared could you give us well I was really in charge of all the military contracts I did all the bids and everything and really took care of all the contracts myself and uh that was that was one of my duties at funeral to take care of the military and I had a file I had a file on everything had ever happened at Walker Air Base the like Bob Hope and different some of the big orchestras and everybody had come and have the big parties and everything and the hangers you know I tended but I would also have pictures and everything I had a personal file that I kept and I kept everything in this file that that that pertained that I attended or or whatever and this is where I put the diagrams and the notes that she gave me was in my personal file well then the Ballard funeral home sold at a later date several years later that it sold and the people that bought the funeral home these were files that they were the old files that that that they kept in the basement down in the furnace room and they had all the milit I had all the military fire s together in one filing cabinet everything had happened at the base and everything we also had the contract at Fort suar Air Base they had a glider base there and also fighter pilot training there in the p47 and 51s and so on and so I had all the files everything was one filing cabinet was strictly all military and that&#x27;s where I had all this filed away I had all this filed away I even had the newspaper that Walter hot the head lines and all this the next day I had all that in these files what interests me is that I have all these files all these different topic only one was missing when he went to look for it that was one pertaining to this yeah can you review that for us well no there were some of the other files were missing also not just my own file but my file was in the same that yeah most of most all my files my file was gone but there was also some files uh they they had really actually had destroyed most of the files that were obtaining after a certain years they just gotten rid of them and they told the the manager funeral that&#x27;s the manager there name Raymond Otero also told me that he knew my file was there Joe Lucas that was the manager at that time knew my files were there and he and I had some personal problems and uh he said get rid of the you know get rid of his damn files we don&#x27;t think remind us of him that&#x27;s where the files went really there was some discussion about how to preserve the bodies right um dry ice and that sort of thing and you kind of oh well where they got the ice and things okay that&#x27;s okay they then the mortuary officer what okay how would what would you do if you had to ship one out and but you couldn&#x27;t do anything to it I mean that you couldn&#x27;t you know do any treatment Tre what would you do I said don&#x27;t thing you could do that I would suggest that first thing if you have a problem don&#x27;t want to destroy any the tissue any any blood cells anything that you don&#x27;t want to destroy I would suggest that you contact a pathologist and I said I&#x27;m sure the the Army Airfield I mean somebody&#x27;s got some pathologist around I didn&#x27;t know that they had one in Rosell but I said if I were you I&#x27;d call a pathologist and take you know ask him what how he would like to have it done or whatever you&#x27;re going to do or whatever it is you better do what the pathologist because he&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s going to do the autopsy and make the reports but I said the only thing I know you could do is just go to clar&#x27;s Dair Sunset creamy we had two at the time and buy all the dri you can and pack them in dry ice if that&#x27;s possible and that&#x27;s what I suggest that they do excuse me you hit my mic with your oh sorry about thator yeah I&#x27;ve done it at least eight times already personal okay what you think I think as a suggestion you might want to do that part again if back to it because a few times oh sorry BR lnis take to clity all right let&#x27;s go back and go over the dry icing again well okay what I suggested that the mort to the mortuary officer I suggested this to the mortuary officer after and we we discussed this probably for 20 minutes or better on the telephone and I said I kept telling him hey you know if you have a problem if you got something out there if you need our services we have the contract I would be glad to come out and help you take care of it he said no this is for future kept always referring this was for future use in case we did have something but uh then I I said well you know first thing you better do you better get a hold of a pathologist I don&#x27;t know whether you have one at at the base I don&#x27;t but I know you probably have the top pathologist you know something similar to those words and I said that&#x27;s what I do and you better let him give you the instructions and then you better do what he tells you to do because he&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s going to do the autopsy and you don&#x27;t if that&#x27;s if it&#x27;s this sensitive you better do what he tells you but I said the only other suggestion I can make that you go to Cloud&#x27;s dairy or you go to Sunset crey buy all the dry ice you can and pack whatever you have whatever the problem is you better pack it in dry ice and then do whatever you have to do with it cuz that&#x27;s the only way they tried to put it in the morg out the morg they had two refrigerated body compartments that we used to put them in and then we&#x27; go out and get the bodies from there but they always brought the Airmen to us but on the dependence and everything we went out for them but they weren&#x27;t cold enough and and it became so offensive they were afraid they were going to you were going to upset everybody in the hospital so they later moved them over to a hanger and that&#x27;s the last that she knew anything about him too the lieutenant knew anything about them but she doesn&#x27;t know how they moved it or anything about it but they were taken to a hanger cuz it the offense the odor was so offensive they couldn&#x27;t that like they said it was upsetting everything that&#x27;s great fantastic did she tell you where she thought or where she was told the bodies went from Roswell I&#x27;m sorry where the bodies went from Roswell did you know where where they they were shipped out did you know where they went she didn&#x27;t know she never told me she never mentioned any no suggestion whatsoever she just said the last she heard they were in a hanger and that&#x27;s all she knows and we never discussed anything else I guess if that takes care of everything would you like to watch it is a portion just to get an idea you don&#x27;t need to watch the whole yeah let&#x27;s turn it around and watch it</p>
