            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is this channel is dedicated toward uh education and uh kind of raising Consciousness to certain uh things that I think are important that I don&#x27;t think enough people know about and uh a lot of times these are um works from people who spent their whole life working on their major project and got it out there and nobody ever looked at it and they died penniless and uh unknown or I guess in this case you know he wasn&#x27;t penniless but uh certainly never got recognized for what he did and uh that&#x27;s uh Mr Dewey B Larson he is the author of the reciprocal system of theory today is the 153rd day of um doing videos on his system of theory and it is truly a system if you figure out how how the system works by studying Larson then you can apply his system to any subject and come up with answers that reflect reality Larson started working on this way back in about 1930 and kept it up until his death in 1990. other people have tried to carry on his work since then uh some of those people have also passed away sadly and uh you know there are very few people that know anything about it um I think it&#x27;s a great system and I wish I understood it a little bit better but I&#x27;m going to at least try to put it out there uh you know maybe my uh kind of liberal arts mind isn&#x27;t grasping a few things but I also think that uh you know the uh Rank and file scientists are probably the last people in the room who are who are ever going to get it I bet I showed this to a couple of scientists so-called scientists and they&#x27;ve rejected it in some of the most unscientific manners that I&#x27;ve ever seen um using phrases like I&#x27;ve never heard of him before that&#x27;s that&#x27;s relevant right that&#x27;s relevant to whether the theory is correct uh in your mind I guess but anyway we&#x27;re looking at his uh 1979 book that&#x27;s called Nothing But motion but just beside behind Larson&#x27;s Theory is that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it&#x27;s made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time and as a result space and time have a generalized reciprocal relationship uh and uh we will get into that today a little bit because we are uh wrapping up chapter five which is on gravitation and we will beginning be beginning chapter six that is on it&#x27;s called the reciprocal relation so we&#x27;re going to look into that reciprocal relation between space and time uh after we wrap up his chapter here on gravitation now gravitation is the opposite Force to what he calls the progression of the natural reference system when you have a universe of motion the universe is there&#x27;s always motion everything is made out of motion including matter and energy and so uh there is nowhere that there is not motion um and or if there is that place is not in this universe and uh as a result um instead of making measurements from a zero point all measurements are made from the uh what he calls the natural reference system and the natural reference system is the speed of light moving outward in all directions uh when you have a motion that&#x27;s moving in all directions that&#x27;s called a scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion with a magnitude but no particular direction and so you would invisible visualize that as uh putting a bunch of dots on a balloon with a magic marker and then blowing up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other uh in no particular direction or in all directions and that is the if that if that balloon was expanding at the speed of light that would be the progression of the natural reference system um now the countervailing force to that is gravity so gravity you would visualize that as sucking in that balloon and then all of the points are moving toward each other and as he pointed out it appears as if they&#x27;re attracting to each other but they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re just pursuing uh their own independent course each Dot so that&#x27;s kind of uh what he comes to with gravitation it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an a countervailing force to this progression of the natural reference system the progression is always there um and then uh gravitation uh can cancel it out um okay so we will wrap up chapter five here and then we&#x27;ll get to chapter six okay this is Larson in his own words the net resultant of the scalar motions of any object the progression of the reference system and the various gravitational motions has a vectorial direction that is a Direction with uh you know a motion with a Direction has a victorial direction when viewed in the context of a stationary reference system even though that direction is not an inherent property of the motion The observed motion of such an object which is the net resultant of all of its motions both scalar and vectorial thus appears to be simply a vectorial motion and is so interpreted in current practice one of the prerequisites for a clear understanding of basic physical phenomena is a recognition of the composite nature of the observed motions it is not possible to get a true picture of activity in a gravitationally bound system unless it is realized that an object such as a photon or a neutrino which is traveling at the speed of light with respect to the conventional frame of reference does so because it has no capability of independent motion at all and is at rest in its own natural system of reference similarly the behavior of atoms of matter can be clearly understood only in the light of a realization that they are motionless or moving at low speeds relative to the conventional reference system because they possess inherent motions at high speed which counter balance the motion of the natural reference system that would otherwise carry them outward at the speed of of the photon or the neutrino it is also essential to recognize that the scalar motion of the photons can be accommodated within the spatial reference system only by use of multiple reference points photons are continually being emitted from matter by a process that we will not be prepared to discuss until at a later stage of the development the motion of the photons emitted from any material object is outward from that object not from the instantaneous position in some reference system which that object happens to occupy at the moment of emission as brought out in chapter 3 the extension space of our ordinary experience is absolute space for vectorial motion and for scalar motion viewed from one point of reference but every other reference point has its own absolute space and there is no Criterion by which one of these can be singled out as more basic than another thus the location at which a photon originates cannot be placed in the context of any general reference system for scalar motion that location itself is the reference point for the photon emission and if we choose to view it in relation to some reference system with respect to which it is moving then that relative motion whatever it may be is a component of the motion of the emitted photons looking at the situation from the standpoint of the photon we may say that at the moment of emission this Photon by participating in all of its motions of the emitting objects the outward progression of the natural reference system the inward motion of gravitation and all of the vectorial Motions to which the material object is subject no mechanism exists whereby the photon can eliminate any of these motions and the outward motion of the absolute location of the emission to which the photon becomes subject on separation from the material unit is superimposed on the previously existing motions this again means that the emitting object defines the reference point for the motion of the photon in a gravitationally bound system each aggregate an individual unit of matter is the center of a sphere of radiation this point has been a source of difficulty for some members of the uh some readers of the first edition and further consideration by means of a specific example is probably in order let us take some location a as a reference point all photons originating from a physical object at a move outward at unit speed in the manner portrayed by the balloon analogy gravitational objects move inward in opposition to the progression and can therefore be represented by position somewhere along the lines of the outward movement here then we have the kind of a situation that most persons are looking for something that they can visualize in the context of the familiar fixed spatial coordinate system but now let us take a look at one of these gravitating objects which we will call B for convenience let us assume that b is moving gravitationally with respect to a at a rate which is just equal to the outward progression of the natural reference system so that b remains stationary with respect to object a in the fixed reference system this is the condition that prevailed at the gravitational limit what happens to the photons emitted from B if the expanding system centered at a is conceived as a universal system of reference as so many readers have evidently taken it to be then these photons must be detached from b in a manner which will enable them to be carried Along by progression in a direction outward from a but the natural reference system moves outward from all directions it moves outward from B in exactly the same manner as it does from a there is no way in which one can be assigned any status different from that of the other the photons originating at B therefore move outward from B not from a this would make no difference if B were itself moving outward from a at unit speed as in that case outward from B would also be outward from a but where B is stationary with respect to a in a fixed coordinate system the only way in which the Motions of the photons can be represented in that system is by means of two separate reference points thus there is a sphere of radiation centered at a and another sphere centered at B where the Spheres overlap the photons may make contact even though all are moving outward from their respective points of origin it has been suggested that the theoretical conclusion that the unit outward motion of the photon is added to the motion imparted to the photon by the emitting object conflicts with the empirically established principle that the speed of radiation is independent of the speed of the source but this is not true the explanation lies in some aspects of the measurement of speed that have not been recognized this matter will be discussed in detail in chapter 7. and that is the end of chapter five so we&#x27;re headed to chapter six which is called the reciprocal relation now don&#x27;t get discouraged if you listen to what I just said uh those last several paragraphs and your head is swimming you just gotta go over it slowly Larson says what he means and he means what he says but he says it in a kind of a convoluted matter sometimes he&#x27;s always wanting to cross his eyes and Dot it dot his eyes and cross his T&#x27;s and so he takes a lot of uh commas and puts a lot of uh you know phrases into his sentences that makes it a little bit harder to follow you have to go through it very slowly and kind of just uh you know follow the language but you know before you get before you start on the next sentence make sure that you understand the previous sentence and that&#x27;s what I found is really the only way that you can really read Larson he&#x27;s a he&#x27;s very dry and he&#x27;s uh you know convoluted but he he he get he does put the the major points out there you just have to ferret them out it&#x27;s you know and you can&#x27;t blame Larson because he&#x27;s trying to do something that&#x27;s never been done before he&#x27;s trying to put in language things that haven&#x27;t been conceived of before and so he&#x27;s having to both you know come up with the theory himself and then also Express the theory in language that a layperson can understand um and those two things are not the same and they both require a different skill set and they both require a great deal of you know competence and I feel like uh Larson did a phenomenal job of doing this but he made mistakes and I&#x27;m sure he chose some language that he didn&#x27;t that you know if he had to do it over again he might use different terminology uh or different analogy G&#x27;s or whatever but you know you got to go with what you got and um you know it it takes people now or for example the late Dr Bruce Perrette who died in 2020 who who who took a lot of Larson&#x27;s work and tried to put it into uh more easily to understand language you know that&#x27;s for people later you know the originator of the theories just got to get it out there you just got to get it out there and hope that the language that you choose is is language that&#x27;s gonna resonate with people but it might not um and that&#x27;s for later people people like me or whoever to uh or you to uh put into language that other people are going to be able to get with okay we&#x27;re gonna start chapter six and read at least a couple paragraphs here of chapter six called the reciprocal relation again remember we&#x27;re studying the reciprocal system and the reciprocal relation is between space and time okay inasmuch as the fundamental postulates to find a universe composed entirely of units of motion and define space and time in terms of that motion these postulates preclude space and time from having any significance other than that which they have in motion and at the same time require that they always have that significance that is throughout the universe space and time are reciprocally related this General reciprocal relation that necessarily exists in a universe composed entirely of motion as a far-reaching and decisive effect on physical structures and processes in recognition of its crucial role the name reciprocal has been applied to the system of theory based on the motion concept of the nature of the universe the reason for calling it a system of theory rather than merely a theory is that it&#x27;s subdivisions are co-extensive with other physical theories one of these subdivisions covers the same ground as relativity another parallels the nuclear theory of the atom still another deals with the same physical area as the kinetic theory and so on it is appropriate therefore to call these subdivisions theories and to refer to the entire new theoretical structure as the reciprocal system of theory even though it is actually a single fully integrated entity the reciprocal postulate provides a good example of the manner in which a change in the basic concept of the nature of the universe Alters the way in which we apprehend specific physical phenomena in the context of a universe of matter existing in a space-time framework the idea of space as the reciprocal of time is simply Preposterous too absurd to be given serious consideration most of those who encounter the idea of the reciprocal of space for the first time find it wholly inconceivable but these persons are not taking the postulates of the new Theory at their face value and recognizing that the assertion that space is an aspect of motion means exactly what it says they are accustomed to regarding space as some kind of a container and they are interpreting this assertion as if it said that container space is an aspect of motion thus inserting their own concept of space into a statement which rejects all such previous ideas and defines a new and different concept the result of mixing such incongruous such incongruous and conflicting Concepts cannot be otherwise than meaningless okay good paragraph there we will uh stop there and we will start up again tomorrow um thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
