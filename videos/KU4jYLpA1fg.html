            <p>imagine a future where you no longer require petrol and other fossil fuels because all transport now levitates even though this future seems achievable to an average person to most scientists this future isn&#x27;t just farfetched but downright impossible turns out in order for it to be a reality we&#x27;d need anti-gravity simply defined as a force that negates the effects of gravity anti-gravity is largely believed to be a thing of science fiction or cartoon physics that&#x27;s not to say scientists haven&#x27;t attempted to make it a reality throughout the late &#x27;90s a physicist by the name of ning Lee published a series of rather controversial papers about the phenomenon but just when people thought she was on the cusp of an anti-gravity breakthrough Lee dropped off the face of the Earth did the government have something to do with her disappearance did she uncover something sinister in her research let&#x27;s find out the answers to these questions and more in today&#x27;s video not much is known about Lee&#x27;s early life except that she immigrated to the United States from China in 1983 originally from Shandong she graduated with a degree in physics from Peking University after arriving in America she took up employment at the center for space plasma and aeronomic research at the University of Alabama in Huntsville as per sources she remained with the university until the year 2000 after which she left to start her own company before we can explain what this company specialized in it&#x27;s important to understand the nature of Lee&#x27;s research as we hinted that before she was a Trailblazer in the field of anti-gravity together with her colleague Douglas T she published a series of articles on the subject the first of these articles was titled effects of a gravo magnetic field on pure superconductors and was published in 1991 then immediately after in the Years 1992 and 199 93 the duo published two more articles in the Year 1997 the journal physica C published an article titled static test for a gravitational force coupled to type 2 ybco superconductors Lee conducted the research for this article with a handful of employees from the NASA Marshall space flight center if it wasn&#x27;t obvious enough from the titles the research was mainly hinged on superconductors although we&#x27;re certainly not expert physicist we know for a fact that a superconductor is any material that can conduct electricity from one atom to another without experiencing resistance at the simplest there is no loss of energy from one point to another if you&#x27;re thinking what we&#x27;re thinking yes these materials have the power to completely change how we utilize electricity however one thing to remember is that superconductivity can&#x27;t be achieved at room temperature at this point in time it requires the material to be cooled down to to a temperature of 133 kelv or - 220° F and that&#x27;s not all the materials being used need to have specialized electronic and structural features as well now some of you might bring up the time that scientists successfully experimented with a room temperature superconductor referred to as a copper substituted lead appetite let us remind you that while this material showcase signs of super conductivity it was nowhere near substantial enough to consider all we&#x27;re saying is that super conductivity isn&#x27;t a walk in the park even for the greatest scientists out there but none of these loopholes stopped ning Lee again since we&#x27;re scientifically challenged here&#x27;s a Crux of Lee&#x27;s findings from Wikipedia she Lee claimed that an anti-gravity effect could be produced by rotating ions creating a gravito magnetic field perpendicular to their spin axis in her theory if a large number of sounds could be aligned in a Bose Einstein condensate the resulting effect would be a very strong gravitomagnetic field producing a strong repulsive Force the alignment may be possible by trapping superconductor ions in a lattice structure and a high temperature superconducting disc now unlike most researchers and despite the many loopholes Lee wasn&#x27;t simply shooting arrows in the dark as a matter of fact she went on to design a 12in prototype discs to support her findings Jim Wilson a contributor for the Science and Tech magazine Popular Mechanics was invited to Le laboratory in Huntsville Alabama to take a look at the disc in his 2,000 article on the Prototype Wilson clarified that while the machine may be capable of constructing a force that acts on matter like gravity it wasn&#x27;t exactly an anti-gravity machine he said strictly speaking it won&#x27;t be an anti-gravity machine but by exerting an ractive or repulsive force on all matter it would be the functional equivalent of The Impossible Machine this same article also revealed that Lee had left the university in the summer of 2000 to commercialize this device what&#x27;s more it talked about how she was looking for several million dollars in funds to help support the making of her htsd disc as we mentioned earlier she left the university to start her own company this company was called AC gravity and at one point in time was located at 511 Sparkman Drive Huntsville Alabama they even had an email address of lining at comcast.net now even though some sources claim that the company went out of business in 2002 as far as we know they continued to renew their license up until 2018 the company was in fact listed as an expectant business even in 2021 whatever may be the case there&#x27;s no doubt that it thrived in its Heyday this would explain why Lee was shortly joined in this Venture by the chair of the physics department at UAH Larry SMY her Theory really must have been worthwhile think about it would she have received a grant of $448,000 from the US Department of Defense if her Theory didn&#x27;t have potential exact amundo surprisingly despite securing this grant in 2001 Lee never published any of her results in 2002 like she was expected to in fact aside from a reference to her chairing a gravitational wave conference that took place in 2003 uh did you ever get a chance to read uh and if so do you have any thoughts on ning Lee&#x27;s 1993 paper on gravid gra uh gravido electric electric coupling via super conductivity well I certainly read all of her papers uh I also participated in the miter conference where she made a major presentation and um originally I thought you know she may really be under something but the fact that it hasn&#x27;t particularly gone anywhere after 2002 it seems she had stopped publishing altogether if you know anything about the scientific world you might know that if you don&#x27;t publish you&#x27;re really likely to perish as a result by 2004 the once celebrated scientist had completely fallen off the radar but was her inability to publish the thing to blame for her disappearance from the public ey or was something bigger at play as opposed to what the world would have you believe it&#x27;s not uncommon for scientists who make Grand discoveries to suddenly Go Radio silent in 1996 for instance Eugene podet no only a grad student back then claimed that there was a way to negate the impact of gravity on objects by placing them on a super conducting disc the said disc which we could call a gravity shielding device as far as we&#x27;ve learned had to be powered by powerful electromagnets initially his research gained much traction so much so that even NASA showed interest in it however within months he withdrew his paper on the subject from a reputable physics journal what&#x27;s more he also lost funding from The Finnish University that was supporting him causing him to return to Russia even though the article being leaked to the Press was cited as the major reason for its withdrawal at the time some troubling information came to light a few years years after this incident pod cnov revealed that a few scientists in Canada and Sheffield had stolen his idea while their projects only turned out to be mere replications Boeing as per sources was thinking of funding a full-fledged project to construct gravity shielding devices using rotating superconductors this project was titled GP grasp Gravity Research for advanced space propulsion but upon questioning Boeing denied its existence however if there&#x27;s anything we&#x27;ve learned over the years it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s nothing powerful companies won&#x27;t do to hide their technology now to return to Lee&#x27;s case could similar things have happened to her as well did someone steal her findings before she could publish them well here&#x27;s where things get interesting Eugene and ning Le&#x27;s stories intersect turns out that in 2004 just as Lee&#x27;s Trail was starting to go cold a journalist by the name of Tim Ventura reached out to pnov he told him that he was trying to track down Dr ning Lee and receive the Ling ning at comcast.net address from before in response sadly even though all of this mail to the address was being read he couldn&#x27;t get a response frustrated he reached out to the Russian scientist again at this point pod cnov assured him that Lee was well and still employed with the dod as a result she couldn&#x27;t speak freely about her work to boot Eugene failed to get Ventura a working email or phone number from the researcher from this point forward ning Le&#x27;s figure became even more shrouded in mystery nobody knew where she was until July of 2008 a scientist named Jack sarfati blew her cover as per sarfatti&#x27;s video interview on YouTube Lee left her position with the dod to return to China and that&#x27;s not all he also accused her of helping the Chinese government to be the first to develop anti-gravity propulsion technology in this video he also made claims about how even the Pentagon couldn&#x27;t get a hold of her here&#x27;s part of what he said she Lee is allegedly back in China and the Chinese are pouring money into similar experiments now that&#x27;s why our intelligence guys are very interested the most likely people to develop the first anti-gravity propulsion technology are the Chinese one of the key scientists in this electr gravitic superconductivity sort of stuff is a Chinese woman named ning Lee and and uh she has disappeared allegedly going back to China and our intelligence agencies do have very good wasn&#x27;t she working at Nasa she was working at Nasa Redstone Aral and you know but she disappeared for several years the people at the Pentagon who had were in touch with her cannot reach her anymore she is uh allegedly back in China and the Chinese uh red Chinese are putting a lot of money into these exotic projects now it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to Guess that the conspiracies only multiplied after the Chinese government entered the equation they don&#x27;t have the best reputation when it comes to transparency this might explain why people refused to believe that Lee had died after her obituary started doing rounds in 2021 posted by the Barry Hill Funeral Home in Alabama it read that the doctor who invented the world&#x27;s first 12 htsd in the late &#x27;90s had peacefully passed away on July 27th it also mentioned that she&#x27;d been survived by a son named George men as well as her grandchildren Vivien Ying Ying men and Andy yangyang men in case you didn&#x27;t notice the obituary points to the fact that her funeral took place in Alabama meaning that she never left for China but as we said people weren&#x27;t ready to take it at face value however things drastically changed after Noah Logan a staff writer at the Huntsville Business Journal got interested in the case after watching a video such as this on ning Le&#x27;s findings Noah decided that it was time to solve the mystery of the missing scientist once and for all now believe it or not it was the contested obituary that came in handy after days of research Noah was finally able to locate her son George Via a number associated with his business after the two got to know each other Noah was then invited to his house to uncover the mystery of his mother speaking of which George revealed that although nobody had given him a call he&#x27;d received several letters from as far as New Zealand asking about his mother&#x27;s re arch in an article that he published about their meeting Noah recalls that George had joked about how his mother had even dismissed his efforts to get to know more about her work here&#x27;s how the article reports on what went down I asked her once he George recalled I said mom do you need to tell me something she Lee told me first off you don&#x27;t know anything second off if you even think you might know something you forget about it I said okay that&#x27;s fine interestingly enough even though though his mother&#x27;s researches counted among some of the world&#x27;s biggest Unsolved Mysteries George wasn&#x27;t aware of this in fact Noah had to give him a quick rundown of all the speculations surrounding ning Lee from this discussion Noah discovered that sarfatti&#x27;s claims from 2008 couldn&#x27;t have been more untrue not only had Lee stayed on in America when the Chinese Communist Party offered her to come to work with them in 2008 Lee declined the offer as well George disclosed that since she first moved with him to the states his maternal grandmother&#x27;s funeral was the only time his mother had attempted to go back to China sadly she didn&#x27;t get permission and as George remembers this made her very upset among other things George also talked about how leaving the university for the public sector changed his mother for the worse now we&#x27;re sure we don&#x27;t need to explain how a position with the dod comes with the burden of keeping everything top secret according to George&#x27;s account this secrecy took a toll on his mother unlike her time at the University where she&#x27;d made somewhat of a track record by publishing one article after the other she&#x27;d come home from her job with the dod completely worn out he also mentioned how his mother had become quieter after quitting her job at UAH he said she would return from work looking worn down with her makeup messed up it wasn&#x27;t like that when she was at the University if you need more evidence as to how much the government values its privacy through the freedom of Information Act Noah requested for ning&#x27;s 2001 findings to be released to the World At Large unfortunately and even though there were a plethora of similar ones his request was denied nonetheless aside from how secretive she was about her role at the dod George recounted a few fond memories of his mother as well for instance he told Noah that the doctor was very single-minded she&#x27;d concentrate on only one thing at a time and had passed this habit down to her children as well he also added that she&#x27;d always told him to make the most of his passion and not to compare himself to others in his article Noah mentioned how George wanted his kids to learn from their grandmother moving on he told Noah how a few events in 2014 turned his family&#x27;s life on its head turns out while on her way back from work one day Dr ning Lee was hit by a vehicle to make matters worse his father who witnessed his wife fall from the impact suffered a heart attack a year later in 2015 he passed away Lee one of her generation&#x27;s smartest Minds meanwhile survived the event only to be diagnosed with permanent brain damage she was only 46 at the time anyway after the accident George took care of his mother until she passed away in 2021 that obituary therefore wasn&#x27;t part of some big conspiracy as people had assumed for years in Noah&#x27;s article George was quoted as saying that seeing his mother suffer from Alzheimer&#x27;s for 6 years before her death was quite challenging as someone who&#x27; made a name came off of her intelligence alone it&#x27;s not difficult to see where he might have been coming from nonetheless when people would ask him about how he&#x27;d managed to do it for all those years he remembered that he only had positive things to say for example he was thankful for Dr Lee for giving him a better life he mentioned to Noah that were it not for his mother he would never have been able to come to the US and get his education finally he revealed that he was really proud of his mother at the conclusion of Noah&#x27;s article where also told that even though she couldn&#x27;t speak the doctor was uncomfortable during her final years as well in moments where George could pick up on her discomfort he recalls playing Buddhist inspired music to help her relax when he discovered that it didn&#x27;t work George Who himself found comfort in the Christian church decided to give Christian hymns a go he told Noah how these hymns would usually help change her mood for the better we don&#x27;t know about you but we think there&#x27;s a lesson in here somewhere for people who think that and Faith are always at odds with each other while on the subject of lessons we think the story also teaches us that sometimes there&#x27;s more to conspiracies than hoverboards and UFOs as a matter of fact if people had gone through the trouble of doing a little more research on Le&#x27;s papers they&#x27;d know that other scientists had poked holes in her Theory as early as 1994 for example a year after she published her third paper on anti-gravity Mark cowit of BDM Federal Inc dismissed her findings for being being overestimated in one of his research articles titled gravito magnetism and magnetic permeability in super conductors he critiqued Tor and Lee&#x27;s work for misunderstanding something called magnetic permeability what&#x27;s more he concluded that the duo had proposed flawed models of the superconductor microdynamics to support their trumped up estimates nevertheless this doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact that ning Lee was brilliant in her field of study and that tinfo Hatters May owe her an apology for reducing her life&#x27;s work to a conspiracy theory but we don&#x27;t want to get your hopes down yet because while previously anti-gravity was the Holy Grail of science researchers are starting to take the subject more seriously take Eugene pod cnov as an example as per a medium article published by Tim Ventura he&#x27;s going to take up his research involving the gravity shielding disc from 30 years ago all over again of course he&#x27;s no longer calling it that but what&#x27;s interesting is that since he&#x27;s an advocate of scientific research being conducted out in the open we&#x27;ve more chances of finding out how gravity is modified if not negated all in all if we were you we wouldn&#x27;t stop looking forward to those hoverboards anytime soon</p>
