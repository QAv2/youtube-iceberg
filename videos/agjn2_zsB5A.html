            <p>so this is the weight i&#x27;m going to dangle here from the balance and it&#x27;s going to be inside of this cup it&#x27;s a vacuum double walled steel cup and in there you can see the super conducting the superconductor puck the ybco and underneath that is a big neodymium magnet so just to give you a close-up view there you see the nylon the nylon rod there the nylon round bar is suspended a couple centimeters above the ybco puck there so what i&#x27;m going to do is pour the liquid nitrogen i&#x27;m going to take this out pour the nitrogen in and then quickly put this back and then put the balance output in continuous mode which sends a reading about every four and a half about four and a half times a second so we&#x27;ll be able to capture uh a spike of of weight change here okay now reading continuously on the balance okay i don&#x27;t know if um it actually went super conducting so i&#x27;ll pour a bit more in here very carefully now being very careful not to pour it on the nylon and i don&#x27;t think i did so let that go for a bit in the first test doing this actually wasn&#x27;t this exact one but i was using this instead of the nylon same kind of thing suspended over top of the super conducting puck and so when i poured the liquid nitrogen in the cup and i looked at the data later there was some there were some sharp transitions a number of them over the couple of minutes when i was cooling it down with nitrogen and then i left it all night so it was just the nitrogen would just boil away over the course of a few hours or a couple hours um and then i just left the thing just suspended over the the ybco puck in the magnet left it suspended all night and i got readings all night long and there was a sharp transition i&#x27;ll show the graph there&#x27;s a sharp transition where uh all of a sudden the weight of this thing decreased uh after about a about 110 minutes in so i think it&#x27;s because the it crossed the critical temperature point and it no longer was superconducting and at that transition point there was a a sudden change in in the uh the coupling between i&#x27;m not really sure how to explain it at this point but uh there was a definite transition in the in the weight of this brass rod being suspended and i read some things from um dr martin tamar&#x27;s paper uh where he a few years ago he was experimenting with rotating niobium superconductors type 1 superconductors in liquid helium and what they found was as soon as it uh crossed the critical temperature which was just like a few degrees kelvin that they detected a gravitational acceleration around it because they had accelerometers placed nearby the superconductor and they were able to detect these little acceleration spikes when it crossed its critical temperature in other words when it became super conducting i was also thinking about trying this copper tube instead of the nylon but i i wanted to be careful not to have any effects due to uh paramagnetism in the copper or any kind of induction effects or whatnot so i thought nylon would nylon would be a good choice here so the liquid nitrogen looks like it&#x27;s boiled away and most likely it&#x27;s not super conducting anymore but i don&#x27;t know for sure so i&#x27;m going to leave it a few minutes i&#x27;m actually going to try this one more time because i don&#x27;t know if it actually got super conducting but i&#x27;m going to make sure looks like there was a big surge there yeah it&#x27;s jumps up there it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s gained a whole gram i am not touching the thing with the ladle and the liquid is not touching the nylon either when i said thing i i meant uh the nylon bar it&#x27;s boiling pretty good there 92.99 it looks like it&#x27;s gained almost a gram 92.9993.00 grams see that now i want to see what happens after that nitrogen boils away and it goes back to our crosses over the critical temperature still at 93 very stable this might take a few minutes camera so it&#x27;s starting to disappear it&#x27;s almost all boiled away but let&#x27;s see what happens to the readings on the on the balance there see if there&#x27;s any sudden change that&#x27;s quite a big jump right there what you just saw it should increase a little bit and then it will drop down again and at that point i think that&#x27;s when it crosses its critical temperature and becomes an ordinary ceramic that is something that doesn&#x27;t conduct electricity yeah that&#x27;s a fairly substantial increase right there from where i started hmm so you</p>
