            <p>squeeze in more a king speaking on the energy machine of t henr henry moray and this will be the first videotaped presentation um on that subject he&#x27;s done a lot of other subjects just somehow never gotten that one taped and then we have [Music] remember to get your memberships 30 a year in the united states you get back issues of the magazine you get a free magazine if you join we also have of course the dvd sets available oh that&#x27;s what i forgot to do a few minutes ago i forgot to get the price on those but anyway you can get a little discount on getting a set of all the dvds in this conference and i&#x27;d like that to happen i&#x27;d like somebody in tibet to get one i&#x27;d like somebody in the uh canary islands to get one you know just have these archives all over the world just in case um okay so pardon excuse me 350. oh thank you that&#x27;s a hand pair of players i should really really get around learning how to read one of these days okay we ready to roll i&#x27;d like to introduce our next speaker larry davenport he&#x27;s been around for a little while i met with him down in amarillo back in 1995 and he&#x27;s a real dedicated researcher he got into this kind of an interesting way he&#x27;s been working for 30 years now in the mental refining industry he&#x27;s uh had to find out about uh t towns and brown who lived until about 1985 and he decided after town 2000 brown died a little few years after that he thought you know somebody really ought to look into this and he looked around didn&#x27;t see somebody so he decided to do it himself and he&#x27;s now transitioning out of metal refinery into doing more internet marketing and research full-time which sounds like a really good way to go because i think what he&#x27;s got here to show us is going to be pretty valuable and we need to have it definitely on hand so let&#x27;s welcome larry davenport [Applause] well uh i guess the best way to start this is to start it with how i got into all this and actually it started about 25 years ago i was reading a newspaper article about nikola tesla and the things that he did and became very very interested in his work and about that same time i uh i i kind of got in i got interested in gravity what is gravity you know how does it work it&#x27;s a pull or a push or how does it work and uh as a result of that i begin to kind of play around at looking at different ways that you might overcome gravity as most people that when they&#x27;re younger do they you get you get these ideas in your head you uh i come from the what i call the star trek generation uh the baby baby boomers generation when star trek was on and growing up we saw that we saw all those uh science fiction shows on tv like lost in space and as i got older i really did get interested in doing some serious things with it i tried building some inertial type mechanisms first to see how well they would work and that was where i really got started and if you could overcome something with inertia some uh force uh then you wouldn&#x27;t by any conventional means you&#x27;d be able to turn on your your apparatus and be able to lift yourself up so that&#x27;s what i where i started and i started the first thing i the first power supply i got was a tesla coil back in 19 about 78 79 and i started playing with it and i got i&#x27;d take it and there was this back of the book of popular science years ago there was a guy by the name of ford he had ion lifters making ion rockets so that was my first interest in that i ordered those plans i got it and you&#x27;re supposed to rotate the wire in a coil inside a little uh like a jet fuselage with a large hole at the top and at the back where it came out it was supposed to be a small hole this guy showed these pictures of how you could use your how an old high voltage uh discharge from a tv set to do this well i i tried that i turned it on and you could feel like an ion wind effect you could feel the wind blowing but it never really did anything so that&#x27;s kind of how i got started so i hooked up my tesla coil then and tried doing the same thing with it and this went on for a while and as time went on i kind of just put it aside and got into other interests well back in always it would always come back to me to to keep trying this try to make it work i ended up building one of the there was a the hagen device glenny hagan came out with a through he came out with some plans i built that and i tried it too and i&#x27;d get the effect and it act like it wanted to lift but still had the same problem it wouldn&#x27;t work so i&#x27;d heard of townsend brown the first time i&#x27;d heard of townsend brown was when i was actually very young in school because his name came up many many times throughout the when i was growing up in elementary school you used to hear a lot more about him when i was younger than you do now you don&#x27;t hear that much about townsend brown as much as you did uh years ago because every now and then he&#x27;d come up with something and you&#x27;d hear you&#x27;d hear you hear about his research but that was in the early 60s and as time went on you begin to hear less and less about townsend brown you begin to hear just every now and then he comes he would come up with something like he had he was doing some research in uh rare earths once and ah the information i read on that he was able to he&#x27;s by sunlight make it lighter at least that&#x27;s what he claimed and in about the 70s uh that was about the end of his research on that and then later when they the first one the first ion satellites came into being there was an article in the amarillo globe news where i live and they had talked to him about the because they had given him this particular author had given him credit for being like the pioneer of ion research a lot of people give dr bell another researcher as being the credit but it was actually townsend brown and they talked to him then and this was in about 1980 81 and that was the last article i ever read on townsend brown i never read any more articles about his work and but that was the first one of the first ion propelled satellites that they&#x27;d put into orbit and since then they&#x27;ve had several probably by now more than probably around 100 by now because in space ion propulsion works very well it&#x27;s since there&#x27;s no gravity you can get the the thrust the thrusting network in space which is it starts off slow and within a few days you&#x27;re going 50 000 miles an hour and in probably weeks or months you get up to using both the ion propulsion research and the gravity mass of the planets you&#x27;re able to get the the system to work uh picture up here that you see right now is uh one of tesla&#x27;s an early article of tesla where he talked about using uh the propulsion system of uh high energy to propel a balloon and i guess tesla was probably the first person to talk about using high energy on planes and blimps or dirigibles at the time for for his research uh he also had written an article long this is before brown was even born that he had noticed in his laboratory the movement of capacitors whenever they discharge and he did make comment that someday that could be used as a useful mechanical energy 1905 townsend brown was born where&#x27;s my guy a picture of brown well anyway he was born in 1905 townsend brown was born in his in grounville ohio is where he was born and right away as he got older he be the his mother and father began to notice that he was very talented with building things mechanical and electrical he&#x27;d take radios apart and he would there&#x27;s a picture of townsend brown in later years but he&#x27;d take things apart and then disassemble radios and he about that same time frame when brown was born after he was born there was buck rogers and all these uh science fiction characters came along and brown somehow as a child got to believing that maybe you could take a uh he somehow acquired an old x-ray machine and uh started playing with x-rays and he began to notice a little bit of movement in the wires when he would he&#x27;d get this machine going and uh supposedly there was an article in the in the ohio newspaper of his of uh granville that he had done this but as he got older in his teenage years and got older and he finally graduated from high school he took a very strong interest in elect electronics and physics electrophysics especially and he went from there to uh he firstly went to university of uh he went to southern cal and he tried to interest some of the professors and what he would notice with some of these elective charges and to no avail they were not interested in it so he eventually went back to ohio and he transferred and eventually got to denison university where he met dr paul b field and paul b field assigned him to a project where they would he explained he got in good with him i guess and explained his they both came up with a similar ideas about electricity forming a mechanical working force so paul b field assigned townsend brown to this project and working on these capacitors and they came up with this eventually called the b phil brown effect where in an electromagnetic state if you had a dielectric separation between at high voltages between the positive and the negative you would get movement or a mechanical working force in your your system and it it could be used as some form of useful energy brown was the one that was going to take this and make it his life&#x27;s work so after he left the university he went to work for at one point he went to work for the naval research laboratory in the 30s around 35 36 early 30s and at the same time about that same time he had he had come up with this in the in the 20s he&#x27;d come up with this capacitor discharge type apparatus which he called electrogravitics later to change the name to electrokinetic energy and he in the old version he had these capacitors that were rolled and he had a negative and a positive end on it and he called it a electrokinetic motor and i don&#x27;t have a copy of his 1929 patent but this is how he did it and he described it as a motor that could be used someday to power equipment so he did this and then later he went to work for the u.s naval research laboratory and he studied this was back in the late or mid or late 30s and he worked for them for about four years and he was also assigned to study gravity research through what would be like the national geographic now he went on expeditions during that time frame later and for like two years where they went and they measured gravity and one of the things they found out is that gravity varied it wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t stable everywhere on earth as you went higher usually it was less and in places closer to the sea level the gravity would be uh seem to be a little bit heavier your gravity was stronger but this lasted about two years the depression the depression had come and work was getting scarce and so he uh eventually but as a result of the depression his work played out with the naval research laboratory and he eventually uh went ahead and joined the navy to do his stint in the navy mainly because he had gotten married during this time frame and he had us and he needed some work to uh to pay bills like everybody else and that&#x27;s what he did so he went the navy it is known that while he was in the navy that he did do some uh research with uh and uh gauzing de-gauzing of mines and stuff and apparently while he was in the service he did get some patents to his name where he had he perfected the the rd gauzing and as i understand today some of those mining mine sweeping techniques are still classified even today of towns and browns he was later people tried to connect him later with the now famous philadelphia experiment myth we don&#x27;t know if it was ever true or not but they many people believe that he may have worked on the antenna configurations we know that he did do work with antennas and with radar and then at one point even radar blocking mechanisms for the navy while he was in the navy in about 1943 he suffered a nervous breakdown and had to leave the day or 40 is actually 44 around that time for me he did suffer a nervous breakdown and had to leave the navy so he left the navy and from there he went to uh he went back to working on his apparatus all during this time frame he&#x27;s working on this electro gravity electrokinetic energy and he&#x27;s trying to come up with a theory a working theory as to how it worked and every place that he went and he that he would talk about the electro kinetic energy he&#x27;d run into usually with a mainline physicist he&#x27;d run into friction because what he what he saw and what he described was not how they were taught they were taught by conventional physics methods and so he ran into friction everywhere he went he eventually moved to hawaii where he did some more work he began to come out with more of the the disk shaped size he decided to go with that and on his electro kinetic apparatus and he&#x27;s he started on the front end he started doing the the curved arcuate electrode and he just came up with a little bit better every time he perfected it more and more he began to learn more and more what it was doing and so by the 40s after he went to hawaii he decided in the early 50s to go back to cleveland and with a project called winterhaven and there was um about that same time frame there was uh the uh in the 50s and mid 50s the military for a brief time became interested in gravity so in an article of innervation aviation magazine and also through rand in english ran ltd limited in england there were several articles written about gravity the uh they were the article basically talked about a positive gravity and a negative gravity how could you overcome it there was this article talked about how you could overcome gravity either through uh nuclear using nuclear uh physics by having like a positron and a a negative electron and in that time frame they did sight towson brown&#x27;s project winter haven in cleveland ohio project winterhaven townsend brown was able to get he claimed it first started out with slow speeds like four to five feet per second or less and he had these three feet disc they were very low about this big in diameter he had two of them hanging from a kind of a merry-go-round like this except it was a lot bigger i think it was more like 15 or 16 feet and he began to apply dielectrics or insulators on the surface of the aircraft right in here on this this part right here he&#x27;s able to uh he began to experiment with first he started out with rubbers and plastics and glass and then he went to later on he went to like a real high dielectric strength materials like barium titanate and as he did this he applied this and he started out at 50 000 votes initially on his machine we don&#x27;t know exactly how far up his voltages went later on but we know that that was in the range but what he noticed about this was as he applied the dielectric as he got changed dielectrics and he did he started out with distance like the air in the beginning but as he applied the dielectrics the field would get better and better and better as he would uh as he would turn this machine on every day and he&#x27;d change the dielectrics he&#x27;d get it get fast finally it got he had it up to around people say around this uh 15 to 16 feet per second and then he began to get supposedly got speeds even greater than that and when this happened he contacted the military in the military for a brief period of time uh classified i don&#x27;t know if it was ever classified top secret there&#x27;s uh a controversy and nick cook&#x27;s book he says it was never cla he could never find the information and his zero point energy that it was ever classified top secret but the military did come in and uh come up with an interest and when he tried to explain to him what was happening with the dielectrics the physicist of the of the time of the u.s air force tried to say it was ion wind said no it&#x27;s just ion wind causing this effect well if it had been ion wind it would have had to have speeds of a tornado or a hurricane to get the speeds up to the to the speed he was getting it to make it move so uh after a year or two he became just disappointed with the military kind of lost interest or put it aside and from this point on he decided to go overseas in france and uh he worked with a major french aerospace company over there it was like the national uh i&#x27;d call it like a national it&#x27;d be like nasa is now but it was in france and there he was able to take his unit and to prove that it was an ion wind and one of his tests he put it in a a low pressure vacuum and he was still able to get the effect which this disproved that the ion wind theory was not correct there was no way it could have worked he was able to get the movement so that&#x27;s how he did it then later after he was in france about two to three years the government of france cut off his funding again he the same thing always happened to brown he always seemed to be started doing something and then they&#x27;d just cut the funding off from him and he&#x27;s practically start all over again well from about 1957 to about 1959 agnew bonson a very wealthy individual who had money became interested in townsend brown&#x27;s work and so he had he&#x27;d heard about brown he contacted brown and hired brown as a consultant to build lifters for him so i&#x27;ve got a few of those lifters pictures later on i&#x27;ll show you on them but agnew bonson and had a brother-in-law named james frank king who was also he was an aerospace engineer and he and him and brown did the initial research sometimes there was a third party in there but the funding came from agnew bonson and uh they built probably several hundred different types of apparatuses that they tried they tried different kinds of dome shape they tried mostly dome shaped one of the ones that they had actually spun around the fields and the the dielectric on top and they even did some reversal did some reversals where they put the negative on top and the positive on bottom to see if they could generate lift they&#x27;d spin this and if you&#x27;ve seen any of the videos of of tom bolone or standeos of browns using using this apparatus when they hit they used a very high voltage system and when they hit it the the they&#x27;d pulse it with a pulse dc waveform and it would actually lift up they&#x27;d use like counter balances on it and one one picture they&#x27;ve got a a crescent wrench used for the balance and they hit it and it and it it goes up and it actually moves and [Music] it would they did weight measurement they found that there was a weight loss of in some of these uh contraptions that they built they they did what is known as a pension ballistic test which is what the navy accepts for uh showing that there&#x27;s a loss of weight but they did they built several of these and initially brown came up with uh a patent of his own and he he did have some he came up with some of his own later that he patented after he had was not under contract by bonson but some of the ones that they did bonson retained the patents on and then they even experimented with ac fields and james frank king many of y&#x27;all have probably seen in tom vallone&#x27;s book especially electro gravitics too he&#x27;s got pictures of where he came up with the system using this uh using ac to using ac waveforms he he tried to come up with one that would work off ac fields but uh in 1950 right after 1959 after townsend brown had just finished his work with bonson shortly after that agnew bonson was killed in a plane crash and again there seemed to be no interest in the the research after that and from that time on he finally went to work there&#x27;s not much more said other than that he did he did patent the stuff that he had learned by doing that research and in the all the way up to about 1965 or 66 there&#x27;s patents of browns some of them are with dielectrics and different configurations of the b field brown effect one of the most important patents that he had switch that again this is just showing the the disk and the experiments and photograph while he was at winter haven next this is this was in the this shows the intera inner aviation magazine it shows the positive and the negative field the negative charge and a positive charge being separated from the negative and how it would work as a flying disk shaped aircraft next this is an early this is probably the it&#x27;s actually the second uh patent of townsend browns uh showing the uh that shows the he calls it a electrokinetic motor in this and you can see in figure three there the they were kind of cylindrical shaped this is an early version of townsend browns uh on how it would work he did have the on the front right here he had a you can see how it was kind of almost like a t-form shape yeah that helps a little pressure switching okay see that one right there push down on that yeah move your thumb up there you go yeah right here you can see it a little bit in the uh you can see the difference and how he used to do this they were cylindrical shaped originally and then they were kind of parallel to the front and then you had like a single discharging back and it would spin around and it was a very efficient working motor he later said in his one of his well his patents it was like a million to one efficiency so uh next photo this is this is a uh ion wind tap type apparatus by g hagen i put this in here because this is what i started out on lifters very similar to what tim i think uh tim has taken this to a very fantastic level working with these but this is what i built you what it is you got cloth in here you got wires going between here and i actually think this is more electrogravitic the way this works than just ion wind because you got a you got a dielectric separation you got little wooden struts on these and it&#x27;s separated and i think that&#x27;s really what produces the effect you&#x27;ve got a negative on the bottom and a positive on the top and you use very very very thin wires going through the cloth to the cloth kind of to give it a little bit of lift but these are very light aircraft they&#x27;re very the wires on them are extremely small next this is another version of ge hagans this is just another version of it is six sided craft and it shows a little bit more detail down there next this is a generator of towns and browns that he built in 1934 this it&#x27;s actually uh part of the other patent i think it just shows the generator how it was built it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a dc uh generator built that put out quite a bit of uh force that to for his electrogravidic electrokinetic apparatus next this one here is probably his most famous uh patent of all 2947 550 i think is the number you can see the difference in uh the the geometry and the disguise shape of the aircraft as it changes as he gets into improve he improves it uh the thing that i noticed here too is right here in the in the shape of the aircraft with his die uh you&#x27;ve got he&#x27;s got a this shape right here for cylindrical is all also works very well i&#x27;ve done uh work with cylinders but this shape right here is the best design for cylindrical ii also as well he&#x27;s uh the way this is you&#x27;ve got your negative charge here and your positive is on the outside and uh and this particular he&#x27;s got uh struts that hold it out like that away from the to separate the charges and with these here when he i&#x27;m suspecting that when he did this and here he had already covered it with a strong dielectric medium because these are very close together in this drawing and i think he covered it with a very strong dielectric medium and that&#x27;s why he was able to run them so close you run these my experience with running these is anything under 50 000 votes or about 50 000 votes you can use air as your dielectric and you will get movement but then you sacrifice the air by having uh you start having a breakdown between the positive and the negative there especially as the speed goes up it will start turning and then it it starts breaking down on you i kind of i did this mine&#x27;s different from his a little bit uh he had his connectors on the top he had like a little uh he had two wires one one was a larger he had a smaller concentric circle in the the one and then he had the wires for the like the positive or the negative out further and it would make contact from the top what i did different on mine was uh instead of doing it like that i chose to go ahead and put the ground in the center come through the pvc column and then put the positive right here on the outside and make contact with by using a little brass screws to connect for the positive on mine i use right here the wires i use i choose to use enamel grade wire magnetic grade wire you can use insulated wire it works pretty good the reason i choose to use that is i could make it bend and there was enough insulation on the enamel there wouldn&#x27;t be discharge from the distance because i normally keep these things here about eight inches apart on the top side of mine next photo please there&#x27;s you can see right here he&#x27;s got uh a dielectric separation and on the here on the negative side and then on the this he also another thing brown did later on was he experiment first he started out with air but he was able to make a fuel burning unit for jets that produced a large amount of dc voltage and a very high volume dc volume jet motor which is believed to be used in the the stealth bomber as for charging the negative um disbursement on the negative side of the engine to cool the fuel you know uh it&#x27;s been mentioned here before by other researchers that the stealth 2 bomber might be electrogravitic i don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve ever released that that that&#x27;s what the how they use it but they more than likely probably we do know they probably use it for radar to deflection because brown did say that the electro gr kinetic effect the dc would have block out radar so it&#x27;s very pop we don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re using it but there&#x27;s uh speculation that they could be using the electro grav vitix or not but it&#x27;s more is not really known this is three uh three thousand twenty two four i think it&#x27;s 130 is the number yeah yeah he can see it better than i can it was february 1962 townsend brown that&#x27;s three zero two two four thirty yeah and you can see right here he&#x27;s got a curved acute electrode here and then on the negative end he&#x27;s okay next you got that what you need okay this is the jet this is the electrokinetic uh thermal generator you could use gas and as you charge through these plates they&#x27;re separated and they build up voltage as the flame goes out and this shows how he made them they&#x27;ve got an indenture here and one side to be hooked to the one side would be positive and one would be negative i think if i think that&#x27;s how it how it works but it would build a very large charge and high volume charge at that and this is the same one same numbers as part of that same patent next here&#x27;s uh this is just showing a side view of the same thing how it would work but he also built the first hydrothermal dynamic magnetic engine he&#x27;s one of the first people to be using fluid where he could charge it and use it for a generator and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s how this here could be used if you had any enclosed circuit using uh i guess a dielectric oil or a oil source circulating you could also build up a charge that way next these are other uh patents of his later on uh using various i think that what this is and i could be wrong on this dialect there&#x27;s dielectrics it&#x27;s uh for the surface kind of acting as more or less like it&#x27;s another way of building up charge and i&#x27;m not real sure exactly how this works tom belong could probably tell you more about how this patent works he does show a toroidal down here uh effect i think this is probably where he also did experiments with lifters kind of in a vertical design next this is i think this in here he has uh a charge he&#x27;s got a charge on the bottom down here and negative r positive i think and then this was like for the surface area of the uh using a symbol like a semiconductor effect or or even a strong dielectric you could put on that side of the to build your charge but if you look at this it&#x27;s very similar to to the overall design of how uh the aircraft works you gotta excuse me excuse me oh i&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s three one eight seven i think it&#x27;s two or four is that right or is that 304 on the patent number uh the patent number is 3018 394 and these are pages 308 and 310 out of the same patent the previous slide uh shows the breakdown of the umbrella and the flat disc and how he ripple cut it so he could get more effect on the same space yeah that&#x27;s what it is next these are just other variations of charges i don&#x27;t know if this was uh i think this here is a breakdown of like capacitors where you got plates together and you build up charges along the the edges there because i can&#x27;t see that real well my eyes don&#x27;t let me see that anymore it looks like you have a generator here and you just build up a charge across these plates another way of building up strong capacity in this patent and it&#x27;s what&#x27;s the number on that patent next this is uh this is one of bonson&#x27;s patents november 1960 what they did here is they had a motor that turned this and the dielectric would spin between the editor oil up there it spin between the fields and it turned around around and it the way i understand this worked you&#x27;d have a section that was dielectric crossing over uh in the opposite opposite of the electrode and it would spin around in opposite directions from it and they tried this to to get greater lift so this is probably one of the first spinning effects that they did and that was at bonds and laboratories you&#x27;d have to really read the patent i read this a long time ago to understand how it works next these are other lifters that they tried uh this is just different sources uh i can&#x27;t see this real good but the charge would you had three different rings three different charges and uh i don&#x27;t think this in here spun i think they actually used a way of charging them up to to get the the field spinning or kind of going around like a like a motor effect between it and it would charge and it would lift that way you had a dielectric separation from the bottom down here on the system and you&#x27;d have the charge gold at the top and one would be negative one would be positive who knows they may have reversed these two to make them work next this is the first power supply used whenever i originally when i built these discs i built i used some real small ones they were like i made them out of uh i took a piece of aluminum and i cut them out and i made some real thin ones the first ones i made were not dished like these uh big ones here you you i had these have a dish in the middle and i made them that was my first unit i made it was a very crude device i brought it to the tesla society after i got it working the biggest problem i found when i started building the apparatus was a bearing problem the first one i built uh i actually used one of these old heat lamp that spun around bearing and it was on a needle bearing real real fine needle and when i turn it on that was the best thing i found before i found bearings later on that were small enough to make these where you could demonstrate the uh electrokinetic apparatus but my first power supply did not go to 50 000 votes it actually went to about i&#x27;m going to guess 30 to 35 000 votes and it did show the effect i learned after i came to the conference and showed it later on from uh lavalette and tom valone both they said that i probably ought to try addition putting some uh dished the the hump on the top there dishing it in and seeing if it doesn&#x27;t work so the next year i came back i built went back home and i found some um what i actually what these actually are is they&#x27;re indian zeals my wife was my late wife was into music she was into playing flutes and stuff and i was telling her i said man i need something that&#x27;s like that and she said well i know where you get these zeals that are shaped like that and she had bought several of them and showed me some of them and i said that&#x27;s what i need so she ordered me some and i took them and i modified them because usually with these zeals with the in in indian music the zeals ones usually very heavy ones uh lighter than the other to get the ringing effect in them so i took them and i i took them and machined them down to where they were real close to the same weight and began to use them and they worked pretty well these here originally were a lot bigger they were about this they were about five inches in diameter and these last ones i made i cut them down to the size of the other ones that i had and but that&#x27;s what i began to use and my next unit uh i modified it i found some bearings the bearings that are using them now are they&#x27;re real small they&#x27;re eight by four millimeter they seem to work well and then there&#x27;s also some bearings that are that you can get are like 5 16 by 3 8 they work pretty good but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re the the bearings in these are that are that i use are used for race car wheel bearings real small these remote control racers that you buy they seem to work i take two of them and stack them on top and i just set this i made mine portable where you just take the whole top off from the the column there and you set it down on top and it works real well next that was a this is my first original unit that i built and uh you can see like you can&#x27;t see it here real good but the wires are crossed and i ended up finally end up just making the ground at first i had two uh a piece of metal on there but it seemed to cause too much drag on this column at the top and so i finally just used the wire itself as it crossed over here at this beam to make contact with as for the negative and it just crossed over the two positive ones would come and they&#x27;d cross underneath as this one is way underneath there where there wouldn&#x27;t be any contact to these uh to this ring here and this is the contact ring right here so what i did i use pvc support and i have a rod the rod goes all the way down and it&#x27;s connected and then it goes to ground this was my first one that i built i think i this is the one that i gave the tesla society back in 1995. uh i don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s at now but the old tesla society would have broke up uh this is all but that that was the one that i gave them and you can see mine i used uh pieces of plastic first i started using wood when i built my first early versions the problem i found out with wood was when you charge it up it if it started arcing it if if there was any moisture in this wood at all there it would catch on fire and it&#x27;d start burning and they&#x27;d be going around and it looked like it looked like little fighter planes going to the smoke be going around it it&#x27;s kind of hilarious but what i ended up doing was changing these over to uh plastic some plexiglas and what i do is i&#x27;d put several holes in it to adjust because i was just working with air as a dielectric then in it to move it out that way next this is the disc and you can see uh i&#x27;ve got some uh over right over here i&#x27;ve got these aluminum big discs they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re more like this these were like the second ones that i had made the ones over here and i used a little bit bigger piece of aluminum to machine them and then later i went to the dish the hump in the middle of the center being uh exaggerated upward uh anybody that knows bernelli&#x27;s principal knows it would actually get better if you charge that up uh you&#x27;re going to create a little bit better lift because someone when these things would spin around i don&#x27;t i never measured it but i it&#x27;s almost like they would lift up try to lift up when they were running uh but this is how they were constructed your positive uh curved arcuate electrode was there then you i used the negative charge back there i modified mine a little bit different from browns but they worked next photo or our next next one this is just another version of a circuit you could build to to make it the uh for a small power supply uh this one here was twenty thousand volts one milliamp dc output and then you&#x27;d go through a craft walton ladder to build up your voltage this is just this is using diodes and capacitors to do your switching next and then here&#x27;s your using mosfets here you create a push and pull to using a square waveform you going back and forth on your circuit your transformer you come out and it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s uh like ac and then it it then you go through a crawl fault and ladder this just shows the uh crawfault matter this shows the the pulsing uh peak of the discharge of the capacitors but you go through here and you it just builds up anybody knows crawfaltons were originally used before the vandy graph came along in your high voltage research and you&#x27;ve got a capacitor on each side and as you go forever two capacitors like if you&#x27;ve got 10 000 volts here it takes you build up 10 000 then you switch and crisscross and then you get 20 well the next two and it just you can go up to and this unit here that&#x27;s what i use and you can go up to as high as many as 12. i&#x27;ve got two that are paralleled with each other and this this in here and then i got this oil filled as with a dielectric oil to insulate it i use a conventional transformer here on mine now i use just a regular uh like a neon transformer and it gets it&#x27;s a 20 000 volts about 20 milliamps and then i have it go through a variac uh of a five amp uh variac when i adjust it now and then i then i go through these uh parallel in series combination through 10 000 vote ac capacitors before it goes into the crawfault and multiplier next this is just this shows the cylinder shapes that i&#x27;ve used in the past uh what i do with them is i put right there on the front end i put i ended up using some of these plastic covers for a drink that you&#x27;d buy they worked very well for insulating the the field so it wouldn&#x27;t discharge on the front side there so and the good thing about the cylinders they work very well by the way i could extend them out and just working with air i would extend them out and i could adjust it in and out and with a higher voltage i could extend it out where it wouldn&#x27;t break down as fast but when i was doing experiments with the cylindrical versions of the b field brown effect i got a very they worked very well at one point and then and not with this unit here because the dielectric on this is much stronger the one that i got now of uh at one point in my research in my garage i actually got them going close to six feet per second and that&#x27;s the fastest i&#x27;ve ever been able to get them to go and i don&#x27;t know if it was just atmospheric conditions were right but that&#x27;s the best i&#x27;ve ever the fastest i&#x27;ve ever been able to get them to go next this is a letter from paul avalep i had talked to him in 95 or 90 yeah it was 90 94 i guess it was 95 i guess it was the first uh what do i got 1995 see my mind&#x27;s already it was 94 whenever i had done i went to the international testing society and met him there and he was working using trying to do he was trying to do the b phil brown effect and dielectric oil and he didn&#x27;t seem to to have much luck i don&#x27;t know if the dielectric was too strong or what but he had the right idea in his theory that much i will say the way the way he described the theory later on uh he was on the right track and i think uh if it had it not been for his input on these discs and stuff i probably would never have tried the the indentured the raised up disc but he was the one that suggested that and i told him what i was trying to do then but uh this is a letter that he sent me after i was able successful in february to get it done in 95 and in 19 it was 95 later in march i went to the yeah that&#x27;s when the letter was sent to me but he congratulated on my success uh was getting the uh electrokinetic apparatus working and the first conference i went to was a new energy conference in denver which i don&#x27;t think they have those anymore they may but they that was the first one i did and uh i take that back let me go back a step that was in 96 95 i brought the the small unit to the tesla society that was when i did the little real alum small two inch aluminum disc and that&#x27;s where i met tom vallone and it was maybe back to backstab a little bit that&#x27;s where they told me to go ahead and and make the raised dish uh on it so i did that then and was able to get it to work and and but in 96 i did a conference there i did one i did a demonstration and then later that night tom did a talk and then we did a demonstration and we got it to work at that time frame i wasn&#x27;t using real high insulated wires like i&#x27;ve got on the front end here this is a new kind of a new thing and we come up with this the other day because as this this multiplier was putting out too much voltage and it was breaking down and i kept wanting to coat this i knew the dielectric needed to be stronger and we coded it and i&#x27;ll have to credit forrest for making a suggestion he said well why don&#x27;t you just use the high voltage wire in its place to as your front electrode and we did that this week and and by golly we did that and it started working pretty good it&#x27;s not working as good today and i don&#x27;t know why but we had it up to about 30 rpms when we had it in my room the other day running it so uh we did that we went ahead and insulated this front end and really what this shows is uh that uh that it is not an ion wind effect that&#x27;s the probably the main reason of this conference what we&#x27;re trying to show is that when you do run it that an ion wind because we got these insulated where there&#x27;s no leakage and with the way we checked to see if there was leakage is we turn the lights out see if there&#x27;s any leaks and there was none so the effect is not an ion wind effect and here shortly i&#x27;m going to turn this on and i&#x27;ll have forrest turn it on and run it not right now but at the end of of the talk and uh just just to show you that it&#x27;s some of y&#x27;all that were in here earlier saw it run a little bit but it shows that it&#x27;s not an ion wind effect uh next this just shows the the this is a drawing i actually got this from t townsend brown eat current and voltage and uh it&#x27;s really more proportional to a voltage rise uh actually it&#x27;s more of a curve it goes it goes like this and then it goes up like that as your dielectric increases as you increase your dielectric and so uh your electrogravitic effect is relative to the rise of uh voltage and not current i&#x27;ve tried increasing the current but what a lot of times happens is it&#x27;ll if you if you over voltage it or your your current is not affected it&#x27;s actually the voltage that controls uh when you pass it through a dielectric that this uh what we call gravity field or the b failed brown effect is more noticeable this was off a disc i used i also tried this with a holtz-type wimbhurst generator that i bought and it works uh it doesn&#x27;t go as fast but it does work the way i hold stop horse generator works is you you have to electrostatically start it it doesn&#x27;t have any metal stators in it like a regular uh wim hurst generator the reason for that is you have two dielectric surfaces and you&#x27;re spinning it around and you use a i found the best way to start it was to get one of these shoe shining brushes to start it and once it starts you get the static flow going and you get it going you&#x27;ll get a lot higher voltage with it than you will a normal wim hurst generator most of your stator type wim hurst generators go to 75 000 voting the one i&#x27;ve got will go up to about 400 000 votes next you can&#x27;t see this real well it didn&#x27;t come out real well i tried to draw this uh i&#x27;ll have to explain what&#x27;s going on it doesn&#x27;t show it uh what i was trying to show here and you don&#x27;t see it is as it comes out the negative charge comes out the back and around and you got the positive lead on the front uh what what happens is uh you&#x27;re creating what i call electrical void that may not be right terminology but you&#x27;re stripping away this and you&#x27;re creating a void and then and what&#x27;s happening is uh this energy is going to fill this void you&#x27;re going to get a pushing effect on this side and on the front side you&#x27;re going to have the pulling effect now uh if this is a craft what would happen is your charge would go this way and then you have energy coming in this way to fill the void and it&#x27;s like a fluidic action uh i think the i call it ether or whatever it is you create a fluidic action that&#x27;s hydraulic in nature and this is where lavalette talked about the surfing wave where you&#x27;re actually like surfing on it you this as this closes up on the as this field closes up it pinches the craft like it&#x27;s like putting water between your hands when you used to get in the pool and pump it and it pumps this craft forward is what it actually does and you got your wave and you&#x27;re riding it&#x27;s like riding the wave basically is what you&#x27;re doing and on the positive side this on this side you&#x27;ve got a counteracting field which is like warping the field basically kinda and it&#x27;s rolling out this way the fluids rolling out this way and on the negative so you&#x27;re using a a positive pull action and then on the negative side you&#x27;re using a negative uh action that&#x27;s actually pushing the craft and i think that&#x27;s why it works you can read paula velez in his books and also where he&#x27;s talking about the stealth bomber and the brown he he explains that he doesn&#x27;t he doesn&#x27;t show the the force coming in this way closing it up but he talks about it because he talks about the wave and how it pinches it forward in uh tom vallone&#x27;s book electro gravity x1 he explains that because he puts paula some material in there by dr paul owellette i don&#x27;t know if you can see these these is a little bit better this is just showing the negative action going to the positive uh next one next well i think there&#x27;s one in there one more there yeah yes real quick okay that was your last slide okay i have three slides on the bag okay yeah go ahead this is some i don&#x27;t know who did this but this is uh there was a i think this was two conferences ago somebody had built these and i think they demonstrated them here too but they put plastic over it and these were much bigger than some of the ones that i&#x27;ve did i wasn&#x27;t here the year they did this but they said that they some people said they did work but they moved slow next one yeah yeah this is a i don&#x27;t know this individual but i&#x27;m sure somebody here does know him y&#x27;all probably but this is just another he did try to do brown&#x27;s copy browns design probably better than i did to get it to work but the my understanding is it did work is anybody in here that would that probably saw this would probably know and yeah bags i think he was demonstrating dielectrics when he did this i&#x27;ve seen this picture before but i&#x27;ve never uh i don&#x27;t know this individual but i think it was i remember reading something about it i think i know in the electric spacecraft journal there was a fellow that had tried this and then later there was somebody get working on i think their masters or doctorate they were doing brown&#x27;s work this is just the top section of it looking down he&#x27;s got the plexiglass connectors there for the and i think he&#x27;s using copper tubing here i think it&#x27;s like half inch copper tubing on this are you ready to turn it on forrest i&#x27;m going to have him turn this on now what we did this weekend was you need you need to flip it all the way up you got you don&#x27;t have it up all the way we&#x27;ve had trouble with it here for some reason it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s but it is starting to work uh but uh in the room we were able to get to work a lot better than this uh i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something in here or what but uh or maybe because i had it on a table or something could be yeah we had to kind of start it a little bit huh it&#x27;s starting to move it&#x27;s just moving slow uh plus we did coat it with uh on this one here we coated it with a silicone type glue and we did total isolation on this to keep from to to get the to keep the dielectric from we didn&#x27;t want any discharge between it but uh we worked on getting it level uh what&#x27;s it showing up there off level let&#x27;s see sometimes you can bump it to get it started and it&#x27;ll start but we did it started on its own in my room and [Laughter] maybe it&#x27;ll start here if not we&#x27;ll do it we&#x27;ll do it out there we&#x27;ll move it out there later if we don&#x27;t get it here so uh i have run some a lot faster than this that didn&#x27;t have the dielectric shielding on this we purposely did that to show that the dielectric shielding on this is what causes the effect and not the uh not ion wind each each time you do a lecture you do it on different things this time i wanted because the voltage was higher we wanted to isolate it and see if it had a higher voltage if you could get it going if you isolated it and that&#x27;s the reason why we&#x27;ve got this like that with these high voltage leaves insulated brown i don&#x27;t think ever insulated his front end like that we&#x27;re probably the first ones to try that but you can see it is starting to pick up any questions please hit me up and if i don&#x27;t know the answer i&#x27;ll tell you i don&#x27;t know yes uh i&#x27;ve done it with a breaker on this and then the little units that i bought the they were pulsed they were they&#x27;d be they were at 28 kilohertz so the original ones that i had but the bigger units other than having breakers on it i haven&#x27;t built a pulsing unit i think brown actually had a power supply that that did pulse a lot greater than and it was made i think that&#x27;s why when you see the when you see the uh in his uh some of his old video footage he actually he hits it and even though it breaks down it moves quite a bit so i think he had some kind of i don&#x27;t know how he built this power supply uh i understand it was somebody in canada that bought it which and i think it was a great loss that his equipment got broke up and auctioned off but the family sold some of it and [Music] that&#x27;s what happened but i don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s maybe somebody in here knows who who bought it do you who bought the unit but i&#x27;d heard several years ago that it had gotten purchased by somebody anybody else yes yes something tim ventura said he talked about a ion wind in his lifting devices that went really really fast and so i started thinking about what the cross section of a typical flying saucer would look like if you had a positive charged top and a negative charged bottom it could be a not a gravity effect it could be an ion wind going over the whole surface giving a pressure drop to lift the whole unit up i did so let&#x27;s get a double effect later i did do some experiments with uh pulsing uh the charge across where i did actually cause it break down and and it did move it it didn&#x27;t move it as fast however nasa uh has considered in the in the past building uh pulse discharge where you actually create a breakdown where you build up your voltage and your capacitors and to move it like extremely fast this is the opposite effect you build the voltage up and the diet goes through a dielectric and causes it to move anybody else yes that&#x27;s the reason we insulated it was to keep from i on the ion wind down on it uh one of the controversies was that the military said back in the 50s it was an eye on wind effect well uh you&#x27;d have to have hurricane speed winds to to make it move and then in my earlier versions that we didn&#x27;t have the the front electrode insulated at all we it was open and you did get eye on wind but i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what caused it to move where is the insulation on it right here on the red and then we&#x27;ve taped this over and glued it on these uh this this time well larry thank you very much for your presentation there was another gentleman up there we&#x27;ll get some more questions out in the hall [Applause] [Music]</p>
