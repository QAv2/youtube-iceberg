            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Podcast Summary English Channel. Get ready for a deep dive into something truly unbelievable. &gt;&gt; We going deep today. &gt;&gt; We really are. Joe Rogan recently had this intense conversation with a physicist named Hal Putoff.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And that original video, it runs for nearly 2 hours and 49 minutes. It&#x27;s It&#x27;s a marathon. &gt;&gt; It is. But our mission right now is to save you that time. We&#x27;re going to deliver the absolute maximum essential knowledge and insight right here.</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary discussion and our commitment to you is to provide the full cinematic experience of this uh frontier science. &gt;&gt; It really is frontier science. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re going deep on a man who has not only worked at the highest levels of conventional physics but who then dedicated decades of his life to classified government secrets that honestly they read like science fiction. &gt;&gt; Awesome. And we are talking about how Putoff, a figure who back in the 1970s was on an unbelievably cool role in the world of normal, you know, accepted science.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Absolutely. This isn&#x27;t some fringe character from the start. We&#x27;re talking about a guy with a PhD from Stanford, an officer at the National Security Agency. &gt;&gt; He invented one of the first broadly tunable infrared lasers. And get this, he patented it while he was still a grad student, &gt;&gt; and co-authored a graduate level textbook, Fundamentals of Quantum Electronics.</p>
<p>I mean, this book was translated into Russian, French, and Chinese. It was serious stuff. &gt;&gt; He was the definition of a high-level conventional scientist. &gt;&gt; He was. But what makes his story so compelling and what we&#x27;re going to unpack is how he took this massive, completely random left-hand turn into what he calls weird physics.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And it wasn&#x27;t because he was a believer. &gt;&gt; No, not at all. It was driven purely by curiosity and the rigorous application of the scientific method to phenomena that frankly everyone else just dismissed out of hand. &gt;&gt; Oh, and here&#x27;s where it gets really interesting. This deep dive covers two revolutionary areas and they are so intertwined.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They really are. &gt;&gt; First, the shocking origin and frankly the stunning success of psychic espionage, which became known as remote viewing. &gt;&gt; And second, we examine the extreme theoretical physics. I mean, the stuff of science fiction that&#x27;s required to explain the confirmed maneuvers of non-human intelligence or NHI crafts. &gt;&gt; Prepare yourself for some serious aha moments because the evidence Putoff presents is well, it&#x27;s rigorous.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, so let&#x27;s unpack this shift in his career. He&#x27;s teaching, he&#x27;s writing this graduate textbook and he realizes there&#x27;s this fundamental question just gnawing at him, &gt;&gt; right? A question that traditional physics really couldn&#x27;t answer. &gt;&gt; He started wondering, is life and consciousness just atoms and molecules? you know, the standard model or are there are there additional fields, forces or dimensions involved in the mystery of human awareness? &gt;&gt; And this intellectual curiosity, it pushed him straight toward the fringe. He began investigating the work of a man named Cleave Baxter. &gt;&gt; Now, Baxter was no mystic.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Not at all. He was a highly respected polygraph expert. This is the guy who trained the CIA and the FBI in interrogation techniques. &gt;&gt; And what happened next was phenomenal. Bastard on a complete lark just for the heck of it decided to connect his polygraph account, a device designed to measure physiological responses to emotional stimulus, &gt;&gt; right? To measure stress in humans.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He connects it up to his office plants. He just wanted to see if they&#x27;d react at all. &gt;&gt; And they did. The plant started producing signals that looked remarkably like the physiological signals you would expect from a human being undergoing stress or emotional excitement. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>But the real shocker came when Baxter decided to escalate, you know, treating the plant as if it were a subject in an interrogation room. &gt;&gt; Exactly. He decided without touching the plant that he was going to burn the plant&#x27;s leaves. He didn&#x27;t even do it. &gt;&gt; He just had the thought.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He just thought about it and reached for the matches. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s the key. The intent alone before any physical action was taken generated a big response on the polygraph machine. a massive surge just like a strong fear reaction in a human &gt;&gt; which suggested that consciousness was registering the threat instantly &gt;&gt; instantly. And Baxter went further.</p>
<p>He started looking into well what might be communication. He connected two plants to polygraphs in the same room. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And he found that if he harmed or affected one plant, say he dropped it on the floor, the distant connected plant would respond at the exact same time with a similar signal. So some kind of information transfer was happening. &gt;&gt; It was highly suggestive that there were unknown non- electromagnetic fields involved.</p>
<p>A transfer of information happening instantly between biological entities which put off realized you know this might be a new form of physics. That was the moment his curiosity was cemented. &gt;&gt; So put off the physicist thought okay this needs a rigorous a pure physics experiment. &gt;&gt; Exactly. He designed a test to measure the propagation velocity of this this unknown field.</p>
<p>He wanted to grow an algae culture, split it, put half of it at a distant laser link site, I think something like five miles away, and then zap the local culture with a massive stimulus. &gt;&gt; A classic physics test. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If the distant half responded instantly, he could measure if this fuel traveled faster than light. &gt;&gt; A great idea.</p>
<p>But then fate intervened. &gt;&gt; It did. Poff sent this proposal to Cleave Baxter. And Baxter just happened to run into Ingo Swan, the famous artist and self-proclaimed psychic. &gt;&gt; And Swan saw Putoff&#x27;s detailed algae experiment proposal.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Ah, and Swan was intrigued, but he was also a bit dismissive of using algae as a test subject. &gt;&gt; Right. He wrote to Poff and essentially said, &quot;If you&#x27;re interested in the borderline between animate and inanimate physics, why are you dealing with algae? They can&#x27;t tell you anything. You should be dealing with somebody like me who can articulate their experience. &gt;&gt; Puto Hoff admitted he was skeptical of dealing with a psychic.</p>
<p>Of course. &gt;&gt; Of course. But Swan had attached a detailed scientific report from experiments at City College in New York where he seemed to raise and lowered the temperature of temperature measuring devices across the lab without touching them. &gt;&gt; So there was prior controlled data &gt;&gt; and the controlled nature of those earlier tests. That&#x27;s what caught Putoff&#x27;s attention.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Nice. So put off being a scientist first said, &quot;Come to my lab. Let&#x27;s run a real test.&quot; &gt;&gt; He invited Swan to his new location at Stanford Research Institute, SRRI, where he was doing his laser work. And he had the perfect, most stringent highsecurity test imaginable. &gt;&gt; This is where it gets crazy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Putoff was using a lab that was set up for looking for theoretical particles called quarks. This required eliminating all possible external noise, which made it the perfect fortress against conventional energy. And the target was a small quantum chip, a highly sensitive device that was protected by this rigorous multi-layered isolation system. &gt;&gt; But we should detail that isolation because this is key to understanding the sheer impossibility of what happened next. &gt;&gt; Go for it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re talking about electrical shielding, magnetic shielding, and most importantly, superconducting shielding. &gt;&gt; Okay, what does that mean? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a state achieved through extreme cold that completely cancels out magnetic fields. On top of that, the whole assembly was completely acoustically isolated. &gt;&gt; So the premise was simple. Absolutely no way, 0% chance that any known external force, electrical, magnetic, acoustic, thermal, could affect that chip.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The graduate student whose life depended on keeping that chip isolated, was meticulously monitoring it. &gt;&gt; And the results were just unbelievable. They defied everything the graduate student knew about his own equipment. Swan sitting outside all that shielding was able to generate all kinds of signals in that tiny quantum chip. The steady slow oscillation signal coming out of the device which normally ran for about 30 seconds.</p>
<p>It just stopped. &gt;&gt; It just stopped cold. &gt;&gt; Then when Swan asked if they wanted to try something else, he made the oscillation return and run fast. &gt;&gt; The graduate student must have been freaking out. &gt;&gt; He went berserk.</p>
<p>He was terrified that months of his work were ruined. He was frantically trying to find a mechanical or electromagnetic glitch, but he couldn&#x27;t find one. The chip was still perfectly isolated. &gt;&gt; And Swan did it again, right on Q, proving he was the cause. But here&#x27;s the absolute clencher.</p>
<p>This is the part that pushed Putoff past simple skepticism and straight into validation. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s an incredible moment. Put off asked Swan, &quot;How did you know what signal to aim for? How did you manage to stop and start the oscillation so precisely?&quot; And Swan just replied, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what to do, so I just looked inside.&quot; &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Through all that multi-layered superconducting electromagnetic shielding, he looked inside. And then he did something even more remarkable.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He drew an accurate diagram of the chip and its circuitry deep inside the shielding information that had never been published anywhere. &gt;&gt; Think about that for a second. It wasn&#x27;t just influencing the chip from a distance. No, it was visually perceiving the complex unpublished architecture of a device that was by all known laws of physics completely shielded from any kind of perception. &gt;&gt; This validated his claim that he could just look inside, that he could transcend physical barriers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So what does this all mean? The implications for national security were staggering. Once put off circulated these stunning findings among other physicists, well, the CIA came landing on his doorstep. &gt;&gt; And not because they believed it. &gt;&gt; No, because they had to evaluate it. They immediately pulled Putoff&#x27;s old intelligence file, saw his high clearances from his NSA experience, and they presented their national security problem.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And the problem was simple and urgent. Russia, the Soviet Union, was spending millions of dollars at their best institutes trying to use ESP psychic abilities for espionage. And the US had no way to evaluate this threat because as PutF notes, no mainstream scientist in America believed such a thing even existed, let alone knew how to test it rigorously. &gt;&gt; So the CIA&#x27;s initial hope was that PutF, the rigorous scientist, would just prove it was all BS and they could dismiss the Soviet threat. &gt;&gt; But after a full day of testing with Swan, where Swan accurately described hidden items in lock boxes and sealed envelopes, the CIA representatives were totally blown away.</p>
<p>They immediately commissioned a highly classified project, started small, maybe $50, $60,000, &gt;&gt; just to see what else this capability could do and how reliably it could be performed. And that&#x27;s the origin story. That project, initially called Scan 8 and eventually known as Stargate, lasted for over 20 years at a highly classified level. &gt;&gt; And the CIA&#x27;s primary overarching fear stemming directly from that quantum chip experiment was truly terrifying. If remote viewing or RV was real, could Russian viewers reach into a superconducting safer vault designed to protect the most sensitive materials and view classified documents? &gt;&gt; The implication was that if you couldn&#x27;t shield a tiny quantum chip, you certainly couldn&#x27;t shield a vault.</p>
<p>That capability transcended any physical security measure we had. &gt;&gt; Meaning the United States had a massive unadressed vulnerability. Okay, so let&#x27;s look at how the program developed beyond those initial lab tests. Swan, he quickly got bored describing objects in the next room. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he said, &quot;If you want to know what&#x27;s in the next room, go look.</p>
<p>The real test is, can I find something just using coordinates?&quot; &gt;&gt; And this shift, it marked a crucial breakthrough in understanding the mechanism. &gt;&gt; It really did. Once they started doing experiments where the target was simply latitude and longitude, just coordinates, Swan could still describe the location accurately. This proved the ability wasn&#x27;t limited to telepathy with the person who knew the target, &gt;&gt; right? The person they sent out to the target site wasn&#x27;t necessary for the information transfer. That person was just acting as a beacon to define the location, but the viewing itself was accessing information independent of that person&#x27;s mind.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, they were tapping into the actual location data itself, bypassing the need for a human intermediary. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And this led to one of the most wonderfully convincing breakthroughs with a new viewer named Pat Price. &gt;&gt; Who was Pat Price? &gt;&gt; Price was an ex- Burbank police commissioner who had this reputation for solving cold cases based on his, you know, unnervingly accurate gut instinct. &gt;&gt; So they tested him and he was targeted on coordinates corresponding to the highly classified NSA Sugar Grove facility in West Virginia.</p>
<p>a massive site involved in accepting Soviet satellite transmissions. And Putoff and his colleagues, they kept themselves completely blind to the coordinates. They just handed them off to Price without any discussion. &gt;&gt; And Price provided absolutely unbelievable highfidelity detail. &gt;&gt; It was stunning.</p>
<p>Not only did he describe the general structure of the site, but he claimed to have focused his awareness on the classified information inside. He stated he had merged his mind into a safe and then he proceeded to list a whole bunch of cryptic words. highly classified project titles that could only have existed within that NSA facility. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. The immediate aftermath of this debriefing was just chaos.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Why happened? &gt;&gt; Law enforcement descended on Putoff and SRRI, demanding to know how they got that information. They were convinced Putoff had an insider source, a mole. &gt;&gt; Because the details were just too sensitive and too accurate to be random guesses. And this incident, which the CIA later published 20 years after the fact, it definitively confirmed the reality of RV penetration. It wasn&#x27;t a parlor trick.</p>
<p>It was a security breach that demonstrated this unknown field could harvest critical intelligence. &gt;&gt; So they immediately escalated the tasking. CIA deputy director John McMahon insisted, &quot;Let&#x27;s not waste this on our own science. For God&#x27;s sakes, do a Soviet site.&quot; &gt;&gt; So the target became a highly sensitive Soviet R&amp;D facility at Semipalatinsk. And Pat Price targeted the coordinates and produced this stunning drawing and description.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He accurately described a massive giant crane rolling over the top of a building on rails, which at the time sounded utterly bizarre and improbable. &gt;&gt; But later, highresolution satellite imagery confirmed exactly what he drew. A massive specialized gantry crane was moving over the top of a large assembly building. And that was the definitive moment the espionage phase of the SRRI remote viewing program officially began. They were delivering actionable intelligence that conventional means just could not access.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The program was a success lasting two decades. But POV highlights these contrasting almost schizophrenic reactions they got when briefing highle US officials. &gt;&gt; Nice insight. You had the skeptics of course. Some officials just dismissed it as some kind of psych test of our gullibility, accusing the presenters of manipulating the data and literally storming out of the room.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They just couldn&#x27;t integrate this information into their worldview. &gt;&gt; But then you had the complete opposite reaction from other high-level decision makers. CIA director Bill Casey under Reagan was so entranced by the briefing that what was scheduled as a 45minute overview &gt;&gt; turned into a 5-hour intense questioning session. &gt;&gt; 5 hours. These were the people whose job required them to decide whether to act on this new form of intelligence.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And this observation led Putoof to what he calls the CEO hypothesis which offers a great insight into how successful people operate. &gt;&gt; The hypothesis suggests that people who rise to the top of the food chain CEOs, highlevel generals, major political leaders. They&#x27;re constantly making critical high stakes decisions based on insufficient fragmented information. They&#x27;re trained to rely heavily on their gut instinct. And they actually tested this which is brilliant.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They conducted a study involving 67 CEOs of major corporations. They tked these highly rational successful individuals to try and predict numbers generated randomly by a computer the next day. &gt;&gt; And it turned out that those CEOs who scored positively and significantly on the ESP tests, meaning they could slightly beat chance in predicting random future numbers. &gt;&gt; They were the same CEOs who led the most successful profitable businesses. But what&#x27;s fascinating is the psychological disconnect.</p>
<p>When these same CEOs were asked if they believed in ESP, they have vehemently denied it. They called it nonsense and crackpot stuff. &gt;&gt; Yet, they all admitted, &quot;When I trust my gut instinct, I&#x27;m usually right.&quot; &gt;&gt; Which strongly suggests the ability isn&#x27;t some magical gift. It&#x27;s an unconscious low-level perception that is happening all the time. Particularly strong in people who have learned to trust their inner sense when facts are lacking.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a deep point. It normalizes the ability. Yeah. Which brings us to perhaps the most significant realization in the whole program, the build curve discovery. &gt;&gt; They did full medical workups, including seven layer brain scans on the successful remote viewers, &gt;&gt; right? They needed to know if these people had unique neurological structures, you know, a psychic gland or a different brain wiring.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And the results were clear. The top viewers were neurologically speaking just normal people. &gt;&gt; This was profound. It meant RV is not a unique neurological trait reserved for a chosen few. The conclusion based on solid medical evidence was that like athletic or musical ability, RV ability exists on a bill curve.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You have the Ingo Swans and Pat Prices at the high end and non-performers at the low end. &gt;&gt; But anyone can do it to some degree. &gt;&gt; They confirm this by testing a woman from the SRRI labs, Hila Hammed, who actively dismissed the whole idea of ESP. They send someone out to a specific unique target, a fenced in overpass over a freeway with a distinctive structure. &gt;&gt; And she sat in the viewer&#x27;s chair, followed the methodology, and produced a drawing that accurately nailed the place.</p>
<p>She described a trough up in the air, but it&#x27;s got holes in it so it couldn&#x27;t carry water, which was the fenced overpass grading. &gt;&gt; And she noted that something was going by fast beneath it. It confirmed the bill curve idea. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the raw capability is ubiquitous, but only a few people can consciously learn to access it reliably. &gt;&gt; This ability quickly translated into major realworld triumphs.</p>
<p>The most famous documented example involves finding a Soviet Tu22 bomber that was downed somewhere in Africa. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re talking about an area covering hundreds of thousands of square miles of possible hostile terrain. A total needle in a hay stack. Putoff&#x27;s team worked directly with the foreign technology division at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, tasking two remote viewers on the same challenge simultaneously. &gt;&gt; Their viewings, when cross- referenced, pinpointed the wreckage within 3 miles of where the plane landed.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. Within 3 miles. &gt;&gt; And this allowed the US military to quickly deploy a retrieval team and secure the bomber full of valuable, highly classified electronics before the Russians could find the site. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s amazing. And this success was later confirmed publicly years later by President Carter.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the use of so-called remote viewers in finding the plane. &gt;&gt; A serious breach of protocol at the time, but it underscores the reality of the program&#x27;s successes in high stays environments. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s also the story of the hardcase CIA fraud investigator. &gt;&gt; Oh, this one&#x27;s great. He was specifically sent to debunk the entire program.</p>
<p>He was insisting that the experimenters must be signaling the location or that the results were simply coincidence. This guy was a professional skeptic. Spent an entire day trying to prove fraud. &gt;&gt; Finally, Putoff&#x27;s colleague, Russell Tar, made this brilliant move. He put the fraud investigator himself in the remote viewer chair.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Huh. Turn the tables on him. &gt;&gt; Exactly. They targeted a specific location where another team was sent. And the skeptic, forced to follow the protocol he didn&#x27;t believe in, ended up producing an accurate drawing of the target.</p>
<p>a playground with a merrygoround. &gt;&gt; He looked at his own drawing, compared it to the target photo, and just said, &quot;Okay, you&#x27;ve convinced me.&quot; &gt;&gt; Excellent. He went back to the CIA, not only convinced, but armed with a methodology, and eventually became one of the AY&#x27;s star remote viewers over the years. That is perhaps the best proof of concept imaginable. &gt;&gt; The program also rigorously tested the limits of the ability against the constraints of physics, specifically distance and time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Distance was dismissed as irrelevant pretty early on. Putoff recalls tasking Ingo Swan to remote view Jupiter before the NASA Voyager flyby. &gt;&gt; Swan accurately described the planet, but then he added a strange detail. There&#x27;s a thin ring around Jupiter. &gt;&gt; And Carl Sean, the famous astronomer, happened to be visiting the lab at the time, and he vehemently dismissed this report as nonsense.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right? Conventional astrophysics dictated that gas giants like Jupiter could not retain thin rings. But when the Voyager flyby finally reached Jupiter, Swan was proven absolutely correct. There was a small previously unknown ring &gt;&gt; which confirmed that distance across millions of miles presented no barrier to the RV phenomenon. &gt;&gt; Now time is a whole different beast. Putoff highlights the work done by the Princeton Anomalies Research Lab or PR lab which replicated and extended the SRRI work focusing on the time element.</p>
<p>Robert John, the head of engineering at Princeton, found that if they tked a viewer to describe a site one week into the future or one week into the past relative to the moment the coordinates were given, the results were equally good. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a radical finding. It suggests that time for this ability isn&#x27;t the fixed unidirectional progression we experience. It behaves more like a slippery slope where information from the past or the near future is just as accessible as the present. Okay, let&#x27;s look at the actual process because it sounds like this isn&#x27;t visualization.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s much more technical and intuitive. How did they train the army intelligence officers to do this? &gt;&gt; Put off explained that RV is fundamentally counterintuitive. Viewers must not try to imagine the target. &gt;&gt; Why not? &gt;&gt; Because imagination is almost always wrong and based on bias. Instead, it&#x27;s a multi-stage visceral feeling process.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They sit down with a blank pad of paper and wait for the raw sensory data. They sketch feelings, textures, colors, flashes of images, but without trying to interpret them. And that&#x27;s the most difficult part. &gt;&gt; Right? They might feel hard, smooth, cold, or vertical structure. They call these raw sensory impressions AOLs or analogs of location.</p>
<p>The training is about systematically peeling back those layers. &gt;&gt; Hudolf described it like drilling a hole through a door and then another until finally the door crumbles and you get a clear cognitive feeling for the site. It&#x27;s essentially a disciplined method for accessing subconscious information. And Joe McMoney, one of the top Army remote viewers trained at SRRI, provided a stunning example of this rigger. &gt;&gt; He delivered a full description and sketches of an unbelievably giant Soviet Typhoon class submarine, which was highly secret at the time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And he included the strange detail that the missile silos were placed on the top of the sub rather than the sides, which is a very unconventional design. This was later confirmed when the sub finally rolled out &gt;&gt; and McMmon eventually received a Legion of Merit award for successfully completing over 200 viewings for the CIA and National Security Council. The rigor was proven and the accuracy was undeniable. &gt;&gt; But as you naturally asked, if this works, why didn&#x27;t they just use it to become multi-millionaires? Why weren&#x27;t they gambling in Las Vegas? Putoff got a chance to answer this with a rigorous financial experiment, the silver futures test, which proved the phenomenon&#x27;s financial viability, but also why it&#x27;s not a viable path to easy riches. &gt;&gt; This was funded by a wealthy dentist who was willing to stake money to help raise $25,000 for a local grammar school.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The dentist traded silver futures and agreed to give the school 10% of any profit. The aim was scientific proof, not continuous wealth accumulation. So put off relying on that bell curve principle that anyone can do this to some degree decided to use non-expert school board members as his viewers. &gt;&gt; He prepared two hidden objects labeling one market up for the market rising and the other market down. But he kept the label secret &gt;&gt; and the school board members were tasked to describe using the visceral feeling process the object he was going to show them the next day.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They had to rely purely on the feelings, the textures, the shapes, the colors. &gt;&gt; This is incredible. After 30 days of trading silver futures, relying entirely on the low-level visceral responses of these non-expert community members, &gt;&gt; the investor made a whopping $260,000. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. And the school got its $26,000 bonus.</p>
<p>The experiment was a resounding financial success. &gt;&gt; It proved the efficacy of the technique in a realworld highstakes [snorts] environment. &gt;&gt; But they stopped. Why? put off emphasized that the ambition was proof and they achieved it. They stopped because monitoring the market, running the experiments, analyzing the data, and placing the trades turned into a non-stop 24-hour a day job that consumed them completely.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They had other commitments &gt;&gt; like training army intelligence officers, which demanded their full attention. The phenomenon was proven, and that was the goal. &gt;&gt; Okay, let&#x27;s shift gears completely. We&#x27;re moving from the world of consciousness to the world of extreme theoretical physics. &gt;&gt; A huge jump &gt;&gt; it is.</p>
<p>Put off developed a reputation in the intelligence community for taking on impossible problems. And that eventually led him to the UAP UFO issue in the 1990s with his work accelerating significantly around the Bush 2 administration. &gt;&gt; And his first task in this new domain was purely high stakes and hypothetical. &gt;&gt; He was tasked with running a full comprehensive study. Score the pros and cons of official government disclosure, assuming it was true that advanced ET crafts and bodies had been recovered by the US, Russia, and China.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh my god, this wasn&#x27;t just philosophical. They had to get into the granular details of potential societal breakdown. &gt;&gt; What kind of factors did they weigh? &gt;&gt; They compiled a long list of cultural, economic, and geopolitical impacts, scoring each potential outcome from plus 9, which was highly positive, to minus 9, highly negative. They looked at scenarios like global economic collapse if energy secrets were revealed or mass religious upheaval. &gt;&gt; And the worst scenario from a policy perspective was the economic impact.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. For example, if corporation A got access to the retrieve materials for reverse engineering, but corporation B was legally excluded to massive lawsuits against the government and potential societal chaos. So when they aggregated all the factors, every group running the scenario came back with overwhelming negative scores. &gt;&gt; The conclusion at the time was clear and it served as the justification for decades of secrecy. If you&#x27;re thinking about disclosure, forget it.</p>
<p>The risks outweigh any benefits. &gt;&gt; But POV&#x27;s later perspective shifted. &gt;&gt; It did. He was heavily influenced by Edward Teller, the father of the Hbomb, who argued passionately that openness was a far better route for technological progress than intense secrecy. &gt;&gt; Tiller used history as his example.</p>
<p>In nuclear energy, which was highly classified, the US and Russia marched slowly, step by step, in secret, mirroring each other&#x27;s progress. But in the electronics field, which was open and unclassified, the US took off like a rocket, dominating the industry and leaving Russia far behind. Openness fosters rapid innovation over suffocating secrecy. &gt;&gt; This brings us to 2008 when US senators like Harry Reid and Ted Stevens pushed for a new official government program to analyze the phenomenon AASC, which later morphed into ATIP. &gt;&gt; And put off was tasked with analyzing the theoretical physics behind the UAPs.</p>
<p>This is where we hit the compartmentalization nightmare which became put off&#x27;s proof of existence. &gt;&gt; So despite holding the highest clearances possible, top secret SCI gamma hcs which grants access to the nation&#x27;s most sensitive compartmentalized information. &gt;&gt; He was denied access to materials by aerospace executives who were allegedly holding the retrieved debris. &gt;&gt; Wait, if he had the highest clearance, how could a corporate executive deny him access? They claimed the materials were too compartmentalized, meaning they existed within a special access program, SAP, that operated outside even the standard high-level clearance systems. &gt;&gt; So the information was only accessible on a highly restrictive need to- know basis.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And that denial, as Putov stated, was the definitive proof. If the material didn&#x27;t exist, they would simply say, &quot;We don&#x27;t have it. You&#x27;re chasing ghosts.&quot; Instead, they said, &quot;We can&#x27;t share it with you, even with your clearance.&quot; So since direct physical access was denied, Putoff had to get creative. &gt;&gt; She had to understand the physics based on observation and theory. So he assembled 38 highly advanced theoretical papers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is awesome. He couldn&#x27;t study the crash retrieval, so he studied the physics needed to build them. &gt;&gt; Right? He solicited these papers from subject matter experts under the guise of Biglo Aerospace asking, &quot;Where will your field be in the year 2050?&quot; &gt;&gt; And these weren&#x27;t crackpots. These were established leaders in fields like propulsion and general relativity. &gt;&gt; They wrote about neutronic fusion, warp drive, dark energy, traversible wormholes, and critically space-time metric engineering.</p>
<p>And the hunger for this information was evidenced by the fact that these papers were wildly popular on the Pentagon&#x27;s classified servers. &gt;&gt; The need for this extreme theoretical physics was driven by the behavior of the UAPs themselves, particularly the famous 2004 Nimmits incident involving the Tic Tac object. The tic-tac challenge defines the problem. We&#x27;re talking about objects confirmed by advanced sensor systems radar, infrared pilot visual confirmation making right angle turns at speeds estimated around Mach 3 &gt;&gt; and instantly dropping from 50,000 ft to sea level without any discernable lift, propulsion, or sonic boom. &gt;&gt; A physical object making a right angle turn at Mach 3.</p>
<p>I mean, that&#x27;s an instantaneous change in velocity that would liquefy any organic occupant and likely destroy the material structure of the craft. It&#x27;s way beyond our engineering capabilities. &gt;&gt; Put Hoff, the seasoned physicist, argues it cannot be beyond our physics, just beyond our engineering. &gt;&gt; Exactly. He took the bizarre effects, the extreme acceleration, the time dilation reported by occupants where 5 minutes inside was 2 hours past outside, the object seeming to change size or color upon approach, and he matched them up with Einstein&#x27;s general relativity equations.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And here&#x27;s where the theory of space-time metric engineering comes in. This is the core of his explanation. General relativity states that gravity isn&#x27;t a force, but the warping of the space-time fabric caused by mass and energy. So, if you could engineer Einstein&#x27;s equations, you could manipulate the very fabric of space and time. &gt;&gt; So, if a craft could create a localized bubble of warped spaceime, shrinking space in front and expanding it behind, the principle of the Alcuber warp drive, &gt;&gt; then the craft itself would not be moving through space.</p>
<p>It would be moving space around itself. &gt;&gt; Nice. So, it&#x27;s not moving through space, it&#x27;s moving space itself, &gt;&gt; which explains the zerog effects, the instantaneous acceleration, the lack of sonic boom, because the object isn&#x27;t fighting inertia or friction. It&#x27;s being carried by the spacetime itself. &gt;&gt; The bizarre UAP observations are exactly what you would expect to see if you could engineer the metric tensor.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a hand and glove match. &gt;&gt; The major obstacle, however, is the energy density. To execute this kind of space-time manipulation, even the most conservative models for a traversible wormhole or warp bubble, it requires a phenomenal amount of energy. &gt;&gt; How much are we talking? &gt;&gt; The energy density required is hundreds of times the energy of the sun. &gt;&gt; So, the physics is sound, but the engineering challenge is astronomical.</p>
<p>If they can perform this trick, they must have discovered a source of power that makes our current nuclear fusion experiments look like a flashlight battery. &gt;&gt; Kudov believes the clue lies in vacuum energy. This is the zero point energy, right? The energy of quantum fluctuations, which theoretical physics dictates exists everywhere, even in empty space. &gt;&gt; Modern physics calculates this energy to be 120 orders of magnitude too high. If it were all coherent, gravity would collapse the universe instantly.</p>
<p>So, it must remain random, canceling itself out most of the time. So the theoretical solution and the key to the propulsion mystery is somehow cohering that random vacuum energy pulling usable energy from the quantum foam of spaceime &gt;&gt; and put off points to an incredibly weird historical tangent to illustrate the biological link. The levitating saints &gt;&gt; a great provocative insight. &gt;&gt; Consider historical figures like Joseph of Copertino in 1628. He was [snorts] a simple frier who in a state of extreme ecstatic prayer was repeatedly observed to spontaneously float 10 ft into the air.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And the Catholic Church documented this extensively. Multiple consistent witness depositions because they actually hated the spectacle. They found it disruptive. &gt;&gt; And he did this without a massive power pack or engineered structure. put off posits that the only way to explain this physically is that this extreme non-ordinary state of consciousness allowed the saint to somehow access and momentarily cohhere the vacuum energy through a biological mechanism providing the anti-gravity force necessary for levitation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It connects the two strange parts of Putoof&#x27;s career consciousness and extreme physics. If consciousness can manipulate the vacuum energy field even temporarily, it provides a crucial link to how an advanced craft might draw power. Wonderful. And this theory also consistently explains the UAP heat and radiation signatures. &gt;&gt; How so? &gt;&gt; The act of manipulating the space-time metric creates energy effects.</p>
<p>This process raises the craft&#x27;s ordinary invisible heat spectrum infrared radiation into the visible spectrum, which explains the reports of brilliant blinding light surrounding the craft &gt;&gt; and the risk of getting too close. &gt;&gt; Getting too close to a powered craft that is actively engineering spaceime shifts the radiated energy even higher into the ultraviolet and soft X-rays. This is consistent with the reports of people getting severe sunburn or radiation poisoning near landing sites or closely observed objects. &gt;&gt; So all these seemingly disperate phenomena, the extreme maneuverability, the power source, the light, the radiation, they&#x27;re all unified under this single theory of engineered general relativity. &gt;&gt; Exactly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s move to the physical evidence. The materials themselves, which Puts managed to analyze despite that compartmentalization nightmare. He discussed a specific sample allegedly recovered from the 1947 Roswell debris. &gt;&gt; This sample was a layered meta material composed of titanium and bismouth. While the chain of custody was, you know, questionable, an army person claimed his grandfather picked it up, put offs to the stars academy managed to get the sample analyzed through a legitimate official government channel via Oakidge National Laboratory.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And the results were scientifically anomalous. They raised more questions than they answered. Oak Ridge found that the isotopes in the material were terrestrial. There was no clear chemical proof it was extraterrestrial in origin. However, the construction method defied all known manufacturing capabilities.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The material consisted of impossibly thin layers the size of human hair bonded together. &gt;&gt; And an aerospace corporation, one of the world&#x27;s leaders in material science, attempted to bond just two layers of magnesium and bismouth like the sample. They spent over a million dollars on the effort &gt;&gt; and then they ended up breaking their instruments. &gt;&gt; The conclusion, it was structurally impossible to manufacture today, let alone with 1947 technology. &gt;&gt; So you have a material of common terrestrial composition, but of impossible construction.</p>
<p>This leads back to Putoff&#x27;s main lament about the secrecy. &gt;&gt; The harsh reality he emphasizes is that compartmentalization is the deathnell on technological progress. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The moment information is hidden, innovation stops. He recounts a story of a corporation hiding retrieved materials in its own basement, denying access even to its own topfloor scientists because the access program was so restricted.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This stifling secrecy means that the information is siloed and it can&#x27;t be cross-pollinated with other scientific fields. &gt;&gt; And put based on his intelligence contacts and highle interviews including with figures like General Exxon who had been head of Wright Patterson Air Force Base, he estimates that the US possesses more than 10 retrieved NHI vehicles. He is convinced the wreckage is the real deal based on his access to individuals who had hands-on involvement. The evidence is solid, but the decades of secrecy have created a situation where the government itself doesn&#x27;t fully know what it possesses or where it is stored. &gt;&gt; But the future look exciting due to the political will finally forcing a change.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re talking about the UAP Disclosure Act 2023 pushed by Senator Schumer and rounds. &gt;&gt; This is a landmark piece of legislation. It&#x27;s a multi-page official government document that crucially uses the term non-human intelligence, NHI, more than 20 times. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s normalizing the terminology at the highest political levels &gt;&gt; and it proposes a formal disclosure and accountability process recognizing the decades of hidden programs. &gt;&gt; The most dramatic part of the bill is the proposed use of imminent domain to retrieve materials.</p>
<p>This acknowledges that these retrieved NHI materials are not likely to be in government vaults, but rather in the hands of private aerospace contractors who refuse to relinquish them. &gt;&gt; And to correct the decades of lying and misdirection, the bill also proposed presidential amnesty, an executive order to address the misappropriation of funds and lying to Congress that has characterized this intense secrecy. And while the bill passed the Senate, it was killed by the House, which just shows the immense deep-seated resistance to full disclosure. &gt;&gt; But Schumer and rounds promised not to give up, integrating key parts into the 2024 NDAA, proving the issue is now impossible to ignore. The public, thanks to the gradual drip of information, is far more ready now than it was in the 2000s.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Finally, Putoff is now actively working on a new frontier that directly connects back to his consciousness work in part two. Sabrosa quantum communication. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s unique about sabrosa communication? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a technology designed to suppress and bypass electromagnetic fields entirely. This allows a pure quantum signal to pass through materials that ordinarily shield conventional communication like deep sea water, kilometers of rock, or the superheated plasma surrounding a spacecraft re-entering the atmosphere. He first got proof of principle for this back in the 1990s, but had to shove it because the necessary quantum detection technology wasn&#x27;t available yet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But now, thanks to the massive global effort going into quantum computing, the necessary cryogenic circuitry and ultra sensitive detection systems are finally available to realize this technology. &gt;&gt; And there&#x27;s a critical link back to consciousness. &gt;&gt; Right. put off notes this work connects to the Penrose Hammeroff theory which suggests that microtubules deep inside the brain may use quantum processes for consciousness. &gt;&gt; So the idea is that if the brain is using quantum mechanisms it might be biologically capable of detecting or sending these pure quantum signals &gt;&gt; which could finally provide the physical mechanism the how for the remote viewing phenomena that has eluded physicists for decades.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; what a massive journey of information &gt;&gt; it really is. Put off&#x27;s entire career starting with polygraphs on plants and leading to the CIA&#x27;s psychic spy program all validated by satellite imagery and financial proof and now culminating in cuttingedge quantum physics seeking to explain UAP technology. It demonstrates a profound truth. &gt;&gt; The truth is that what seems impossible today is often just waiting for the right engineering breakthrough. The evidence put off compiled, confirmed by intelligence operations and now backed by serious theoretical physics, moves the concept of non-human intelligence rapidly into the total philosophical fabric of our society.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The unbelievable is real, and the future holds even more secrets to unlock. We truly appreciate you taking this deep dive with us. &gt;&gt; Thank you for exploring these incredible frontier areas. And here&#x27;s a final provocative thought for you to chew on. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Considering the rapid speed of quantum computing, which can perform complex calculations in minutes that would take billions of years normally, the massive energy barrier separating us from the propulsion technology of the UAPs may be overcome much, much sooner than we imagine. &gt;&gt; So, the ability to engineer spaceime might be closer than you think. &gt;&gt; It just might be. We need to be ready for the engineering breakthroughs that redefine reality. &gt;&gt; Indeed.</p>
