            <p>hi this is dr. Rhonda besets founder and chair of the international site of unified science I&#x27;m president trans power corporation a commercial and custom software manufacturing certified systems engineering company I work as a theoretical physicist and as a systems and mechanical engineer today I&#x27;m going to begin a series of screencasts on the two reciprocal system database modules the macro cosmos and the micro cosmos I&#x27;m going to start with the macro cosmos database we&#x27;re going to go through each lay out one layout per screencast so here on the left side you see the macro cosmos databases this has the properties and calculations for the universe as a whole galaxy clusters and groups galaxies star clusters stars planets moons minor bodies nebula gas and dust events and voids comes with a fine graphing program general progression versus gravitation graphs and historic apps here to the right is the micro cosmos database I&#x27;m not gonna go into that today but I just wanted to show this to you because it proves that the reciprocal system is a theory of everything of course I don&#x27;t have any metaphysics here but the reciprocal system and succession of non-physical realm does cover all of existence all right let&#x27;s begin with the universe as a whole this is the subject of cosmology and before we get into that let me explain a little bit how I set up a FileMaker database The Help button is right here if you click on new you can create a new record form as the general display for a record table if you want to display a set of records find if you want to find a particular record sort of run a sort the records in some sort of order print the record or records revert the record back to the way it was for free meaning changes and delete the record here course that&#x27;s the close button if you&#x27;ve selected one or just a few records and you want to share them all again you click that now you can see my tabs here at the universe galaxy clusters and groups are there galaxies star clusters stars planets moons minor bodies the mule nebula gas and dust events and voids so you don&#x27;t have to go back to the main menu you can just click here this is of course the relational database so you can go all the way from the universe all the way down to moons in fact with this it&#x27;s very interesting so you can see here you can click on boys you go click you can go to voids there or you can go to these galaxy clusters and groups here let&#x27;s scroll down and you can go directly to say the Milky Way I&#x27;m sorry not to Milky Way the local group somewhere in here hopefully and these are voids excuse me I&#x27;m over here these are Hawaii things you go here and must go down to the local good for example I&#x27;ll scroll down alright it&#x27;s enough on that okay so I&#x27;m gonna go through each field now object name there&#x27;s the universe by the way down below here it shows you the number of Records I put in the second record just to show that it&#x27;s okay the form number if you duplicate a record by clicking on the clicking control d that&#x27;ll duplicate the record but then you should up the fornum form number so if I I go here to the second record which is blank the phone numbers - if you wanted to experiment with different values that but you didn&#x27;t want to change the original record you would just go here and you can play with the different values of course you can go up or down the database using the other buttons here all right now let&#x27;s get into some actual properties well right here you show video or picture so here I have a list of things you can check on these are all special files or videos for example space-time dimensions naturalizer physical Connery&#x27;s is fine these are my papers here which can go to and also a pod is the Astronomy Picture of the Day from NASA that&#x27;s public shared pictures and so on and then we&#x27;ll close that and events are here you can see like 25 stars you put you would put stuff here which have to do with the universe as a whole rather than with a specific celestial objects I&#x27;m not going to click on Amy&#x27;s right now but you can just see claim super cluster super clusters are not true actually and most of the closed most of the galaxies clusters that astronomers have identified are actually composed of groups which are very slowly moving apart that&#x27;s right so you can add you can add a picture of video here&#x27;s your ball all right now let&#x27;s begin that&#x27;s made me made it&#x27;s in the universe 50 billion light years now why do I say that not only is the universe as a whole cyclical but stars go through cycles themselves so a white dwarf does not become a black dwarf the white over actually comes back to the main sequence the same thing a red giant actually contracts back to the main sequence the first star first generation would be an individual star created in a globular cluster now after about 10 billion years that star will explode as a supernova type 1 creating a binary star system a red giant white dwarf pair that&#x27;s why you see all these red giant white white dwarf pairs in the galaxies and other galaxies so uh what happens then both of those stars contract back to the main sequence ten billion years later they explode again but I&#x27;m creating a red giant white dwarf pear so you&#x27;ve gone from 1 to the 4 and then those 4 can move slowly up the main sequence and they&#x27;ll explode in a supernova type 1 so that&#x27;s another 10 billion years making 40 billion total at that point age becomes a factor and the age limit of the stars reach after about another 5 billion years as 45 billion years and then the galaxy itself ejects chunks of matter from supernova type 2 explosions which and these chunks become quasars these are ejecta from galaxies Mountain ARP showed this in his atlas of peculiar galaxies and the quasars can last around 5 billion years before their matter is dispersed into the inverse cosmic half of the universe which is localized in time rather than that in space if you&#x27;re not following this then you&#x27;ll have to get my I&#x27;m mysterious universe and existence interactions of computational treatise of the reciprocal system the 2/3 of everything the 2 database modules the astronomical properties and matter properties are basically the conclusion of the work so it&#x27;d be the last thing that you would purchase if and when you want to use the science in your scientific or engineering practice ok so it&#x27;s 50 billion years and the maximum speed possible in space is speed of light so that translates into 50 throw my ears if we had an isolated galaxy group which is isolated away from everybody else so that it&#x27;s meaning away at the speed of light that would be the maximum distance 50 billion light years that the universe would be now of course in a lot of cases the the galaxy or the large galaxy group which combines into a very very large galaxy well explode before reaching the speed flight so anyway fifty billion light years is what it is so the timer with the hundred billion letters and megaparsecs this is one point five through seven times ten to the fourth and in commas four point seven three oh four times ten to the 23rd kilometers now from that we can get the estimated volume in the universe and light-years cubed is five point two three six times two thirty second and megaparsecs cubed it&#x27;s one point five one when two times ten to the thirteenth and in kilometers cubits four point four three three nine times ten to the seventeen one power now the smooth space density of matter galaxy clusters is say to be now this comes from Alan&#x27;s Astrophysical quantities this has not been estimated from the theory at this point and that&#x27;s point zero zero zero zero one two galaxy clusters per cubic mega parsec the number of material galaxies clusters one point eight one three four times ten to the eighth cement density of matter two times ten to the minus thirteen grams per cubic centimeter one times ten to the minus seven atoms per cubic centimeter three times in ninth masses of the Sun per cubic megaparsec it&#x27;s all calculated based on this they may may be some universe okay so now we can get the totals for the nurse for both the material section the cosmic sector now note that the cosmic sectors inverse stars so there&#x27;s no symmetry that&#x27;s actually inverse well it&#x27;s a tutu unit mess so this is grams atoms look at that four point four three three nines I&#x27;m saying to something like that so they&#x27;re saying number four atoms but the atoms in the cosmic sector of course have less mass in terms of the mass of the Sun is four point five to three zero six something the twenty-second Feiglin one zero two two times in 20 seconds for the cosmic sector and here you can see the average atomic weight this meter space density time galaxies point zero two that&#x27;s my number of n galaxies this is 100 billion same for the cosmic sector luminous emission in terms of the luminosity of the Sun computed mega parsec three times ten to the eight the fields that you see in Y here are changeable these represent my best estimates right now the main color index of the night sky that means C equals B minus V minus point one one point seven estimated mean lifetime of man and material section and cosmic sector that&#x27;s 50 billion years which is one point five seven seven eight times ten to the eighteenth seconds so it&#x27;s 50 billion years in material sector which is localized in space that&#x27;s our sector and then 50 billion years equivalent and the cosmic inverse sector which is localized in time the estimated cyclical period of the universe is there 400 billion years double 50 now the energy density come along the material matter star light is estimated it&#x27;s really well its measured I should point 5 electron volts per cubic centimeter cosmic matter would be the same point five times at 0.5 asantos cubic centimeter matter is the amount of the energy that&#x27;s leaving as the quasars discombobulates one travel per cubic centimeter and for the cosmic matter raised by symmetry is also run by saw evolve per cubic centimeter so here you have the perfect symmetry now let&#x27;s look at the number density of masses charges particles this is the number of per cubic centimeter so we know that for photons it&#x27;s a twenty three point seven two four I&#x27;m going to skip down here to neutrinos we know that this is measured here 110 so by symmetry we the cosmic neutrinos would be 110 as well the rest of these have been interpolated the masses neutrons material cosmic should be the same as material cosmic neutrinos now as for the masses charges cosmic electrons material like material positrons cosmic positrons of material I&#x27;m sorry there should be yeah before material electrons cosmic electrons material positrons cosmic positrons these are interpolated these are more complex than photons but less complex than neutrinos or masses neutrons so my interpolation is for in 67 number divided by a cubic centimeter now the number density of the cosmic microwave background radiation photons again number purchase any was for eleven point eight seven the 21 centimeter radio waves temperatures two point six three six I say your initiative on our Islands heated buys cmbr industry the same there are four tons and matter Starly an equilibrium is reached at two point six three six Kelvin and so the thermodynamic temperature of soon be our photons in Kelvin it&#x27;s two point seven two five the Hubble cost for the work of group six of seven tiers of accountability it&#x27;s not a constant to the universe each galaxy cluster has its own better okay so that pretty much covers it I guess I could read this I&#x27;ve notes here if you on this package you can of course add to my notes or subtract from - a few more by the way recently trans power corporations reduced the price of both modules to $95 and originally a microcosmic database was priced at $295 the macrocosmos database was priced at 195 dollars now they both been reduced to the low low price of only ninety five dollars so it&#x27;s truly a bargain let me just read them out here I think it&#x27;s important the physical universe is comprised of two sectors the material section the cosmic century CE Center now I&#x27;m balanced the universe is cyclical there will not be a heater it&#x27;s possible that there are a few other universes of multiverse with with the central metaphysical around anarthas Corral but each universe is isolated physically inside the only possible means of knowledge of such universes such other universes would be by intuition which would come from the kata the non-physical the Stata base module allows entering speculative data for other universes by adding new records but name is a physical verification would be possible missing observations have indicated that the space entity of M galaxies may be higher than originally understood that not verified check so this value here might be 300 done down she&#x27;s said 100 100 done but I&#x27;m keeping that to the time being okay well that wraps up the first layout of the reciprocal system macro cosmos database for the simplest possible treatment on the theory is obtain my work the unmistakable has all the concepts many diagrams very little mathematics very easy to understand but if you do want all the mathematics please obtain my magnum opus existence and interactions of computational data the computational tree treatise of their inseparable system the true theory of everything and once you get through with that you can get the two database modules we started discussing the macrocosmos database a micro cosmos database as you can see over here has all the properties of matter of photons sub atoms atoms compounds alloys all the properties contains a great graphing package as well all right well that wraps it up for today please study the reciprocal system improvement for yourself and thanks for your attention</p>
