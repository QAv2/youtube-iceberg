            <p>Software to die for the promis software scandal and how the US justice department became software pirates in the name of national security with Ted St. Green or TED if you prefer brought to you by tour and tocon.org or check them out. www mediaarchchive.com proudly presents this material. Thank you for watching. Also, check out www.promiscandal.com.</p>
<p>And so we have Wackenut. Of course, Wackenet&#x27;s got a new thing, you know, Wackenut Security, you know, G4 Power. Um and so Wackadut&#x27;s uh once again a very interesting thing because they&#x27;re the ones that hand they&#x27;re the ones that are involved with the Cabazon Indian Reservation. They&#x27;re the ones handling security on some of these facilities. They&#x27;re the ones that are in the inside track when you want a security company that you know that will keep your secrets.</p>
<p>You know, this is who you turn to. You know, I&#x27;m still waiting for my job offer. Folks, by the way, I don&#x27;t have any family anymore. They&#x27;re all in prison or dead. So, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a candidate for the CIA.</p>
<p>But in any effect, uh, you know, the big brother&#x27;s watching and it&#x27;s watching in in numerous ways, more ways than one, no doubt. These satellites we keep talking about. And of course, um, you know, DARPANET and ARPANET and all that other stuff, you know, part of this base we&#x27;re on right here, this Titan one missile base, you know, was part of this whole network where the internet came from. You know, they wanted to be able to transmit, you know, singles here to be able to launch the missiles. And maybe in another reality, you know, I&#x27;m also involved into time travel.</p>
<p>you know, go to um the theory of almost everything.com. I have a this other website. It&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s 78,000 slides now. So, we&#x27;re doing here we&#x27;re doing 150 slides and in 90 minutes. Imagine.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m doing like this 400 hour PowerPoint. Say called the theory of almost everything. Ted&#x27;s grand unified conspiracy theory. So if you want to learn all about time travel and quarks and nutrinos and how we&#x27;re all just cond, you know, all the matter around us here is all just condensed out of energy that basically from the milliseconds before the universe was formed. We&#x27;re all like that pawns gone phase change.</p>
<p>You know what people phase changes like from ice to water to air. You know, we&#x27;re on the we&#x27;re we&#x27;re just in a phase change. That&#x27;s all this matter around us is just a little bit of a phase change. There&#x27;s all these different energies on either side of it that uh you know is all from a different lecture but look for that the theory of almost everything.com or maybe it just be theory of almost everything. Uh so anyways we got these arpanets and we got the NSA of course doing their you know listening.</p>
<p>Anybody heard of Pine Gap Australia? Anybody? Nobody. I&#x27;m putting them all to sleep. This is terrible. And so there&#x27;s this huge listening post out in the middle of and almost exact center of Australia that&#x27;s designed to listen to all the communications coming from all the satellites because it&#x27;s got a good view of a lot a lot of the southern facing satellites. So that&#x27;s plan gap and they write about it down in the Australian papers about how this is our link to the you know the sauce the spy sky and basically just enables this thing that you know it&#x27;s called echelon that a lot of people heard about it carnivore you know it&#x27;s the email version of that and you know it brings us our to back to our friends uh you know the NSA and um this is a great one I picked this up off the EFF site um they got a lot of great images there and it&#x27;s just kind of funny uh we&#x27;re going to be talking about Anybody heard of room 641A? We&#x27;re going to be talking about that in a minute.</p>
<p>But so it&#x27;s interesting because the EFF has done a lot of research on the NSA and what you know what their civil liberties are. And they&#x27;ve even developed these maps that you know and and it&#x27;s funny they even call it the octopus, the NSA surveillance octopus, you know, and where all these data transmitters. And look, see we look right up here up in the corner there. We got one right up there, right near us. Uh right right out of sight of Seattle.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s right here. Yakama, Washington. And so, you know, I couldn&#x27;t help but just turn the octopus the other way cuz that&#x27;s what it is, you know. It&#x27;s the the NSA octopus, you know, and they basically um they got us, you know, they got all our data, they got all our stuff, AT&amp;T. And uh yeah, speaking of AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>And so, uh anybody know who this is? Mark Klein. I&#x27;ll give you a hint. His name&#x27;s Mark Klein. And so, um, once again, he used to be up, you know, at AT&amp;T and, uh, that switching center up in the, uh, San Francisco Bay area that broke the story, um, that broke the story on on what we see here, room 641A. And it was this mysterious room that nobody could get into except like one person that had s super secret security clearance from the NSA cuz the only guy that could get in here.</p>
<p>And and it turned out it was this guy Mark Klein was the guy who was coming in later to do the maintenance on the system and whatever. And he kept hearing this reference to this room 641A and and I got the name of the process. There&#x27;s a certain processor that&#x27;s in there like SP3 or something like that. Uh and he kept hearing all these references. What&#x27;s this? I need to get in here.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s in here? And and so he started investigating and he he turned out to be his own investigative reporter. And so the 641A, nobody knew what was in there. They thought it was like mission control, you know, like the the control dome and so, but it was probably just a bunch of hackers in there, you know. Um, but basically what happened is that he had come across some of these documents at the AT&amp;T facility and somehow or another he leaked them out or snuck them out or whatever and he got it basically uh here it is, the SG3 LX LGX. Yeah, imagine having that in your basement.</p>
<p>Um, and so, um, and actually here&#x27;s another better shot of it in color that the EFF had, uh, created for us. Uh, thank you, EFF. Um, and so, um, and so basically does exactly what Promise wanted to do, uh, you know, 30 years ago, but now, you know, they got a box to do it and just pipes right into the, you know, all your communications go right through this box. Any email you send probably gets sent through this 641A, this SG3. Um, this is the one that was back in the uh uh late &#x27; 80s, early 90s where they were also tapping into international uh well they already can do that.</p>
<p>Now, see what&#x27;s interesting about the Indian reservations and when the NSA wants to spy on Americans, all they got to do is plop a listening post onto an Indian reservation in Yakoba, Washington. Um, plop an, you know, and right next to the cell tower or right next to the trans, you know, whatever. They just pop a It&#x27;s on sovereign land. They can spy on Americans all they want, but this uh I think this story broke in the &#x27;9s actually. Uh late &#x27;9s, 2000, like whatever.</p>
<p>They were searching like on keywords and things too, like president bomb. Oh, yeah. Well, that&#x27;s all Yeah, that&#x27;s all keyword recognition software. Yeah, you can&#x27;t be talking about killing the president on the telephone or smuggling drugs on the telephone um cuz you could get in trouble, you know. But, you know, this is what Promis was great at and this is why, you know, we&#x27;re all here today and it gives us something to do.</p>
<p>you know, what would we do otherwise? You know, we just sit around and screws MySpace. Um, so I don&#x27;t know anybody here seen this billboard. The uh the EFF activists or whoever they were went out in the middle of the night and and AT&amp;T works in more place and they had a video you go post on the internet and look for this and then when they were done they they changed the billboard to say AT&amp;T works in more places like NSA headquarters and so uh so EFF and where was that at? Uh this is in San Francisco somewhere and it was a regular billboard works and more whatever I forget what it was going to say and they came out and and so there&#x27;s a video of this you go to YouTube and so once again totally support the EFF if you haven&#x27;t already please join it&#x27;s relatively cheap um here&#x27;s the super secret Google images uh view of of the Yaka base I don&#x27;t know if anybody knows this but if you pull up this site that we&#x27;re on right here if you pull up um the Titan one missile silo number one in eastern Washington. Um, the eastern half of this uh the southern half of this site has been blocked out by Google. You can&#x27;t see the entrance to the missile base, by the way.</p>
<p>So, if you you&#x27;re hoping to like wave Oh, and by the way, I think it was 2 days ago at 12:30, uh, we got our own satellite shot if anybody know that. Hopefully, they&#x27;ll post it up on tour.org soon, but we had our basically our own satellite uh, came over and snapped a shot of us. Well, that&#x27;s a pretty big What&#x27;s that? Big glance, huh? Yahoo. Coincidence. Well, I think I think we like pulled some connections, you know.</p>
<p>We got we got people, man. Us hackers. And so there&#x27;s u there&#x27;s a Yaka Yaka. And so anybody hear this story. This is brand new.</p>
<p>Wire just did a bunch of articles on this. Uh but some the Houston Herald over this is in Houston or San Antonio San Antonio Tribune or whatever. The reporters were out there snap. They kept hearing about this super secret facility out south of San Antonio. And so they went out to do a story on they started taking pictures and they got their c cameras confiscated.</p>
<p>This is like a big news, you know, and finally they let them go. They got interrogated for two hours. But it made huge news in San Antonio. Now everybody knows about the secret super secret NSA facility. And it basically what it is, it&#x27;s a promise software um processing center for the data that they pull in from these various sites.</p>
<p>and they&#x27;re spread out all over the United States, but this is just like two weeks old that this story broke that you know, so it&#x27;s all going on around us. Um, so once again, we got uh these fusion centers, these NSA fusion centers where they basically um pull in all this data that they&#x27;re collecting from, you know, these different ports all they probably have these room 641A all over the place and they basically they&#x27;re pulling all the data in and they&#x27;re sending it worldwide to the the master, you know, echelon, you know, computer, you know, the beast. It&#x27;s called the B what what it used to be called the uh the um the battle engagement area uh system tracker the beast. Um you know and then you got the mark. You know about the mark on the 666 on the barcodes, right? Every every barcode has actually those guard bars.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a six that starts at a six in the middle and a six at the end. And then each side of the barcode is separated depending on what the barcode is, but it&#x27;s separated by the numbers. But it&#x27;s basically to turn on a barcode, you read six. To read the second kind of numbers, you read a six. And then the the to end the barcode, it reads six.</p>
<p>So every time you scan a barcode, it&#x27;s 666. Just like Visa, you know, the the number visa on your Visa card. Well, visa in Roman numeral is the V is six. And S is like sig sigma, the sixth letter of the Greek alphabet. And A is like the Babylonian letter A from a from the six something of of of Babylon.</p>
<p>So the Visa card you have in your wallet spells 666 in three different languages. Look into that. Google that if you really want to freak out. Um another lecture theory of almost everything. So now we get into our friend Google.</p>
<p>Um Google is wonderful. It&#x27;s everywhere. It helps us u but it also at times gets a little um gets a little too intrusive. And you wonder why why is Google placed like this? Why is Google on top of everything? Were they just smart? Or did they have a little help? Um, anybody know what this is? This is the garage that Google was started in. Apparently, this is the homeowner.</p>
<p>Um, this is the garage that the Google servers were in when they started. And this is where the internet was running off the Google servers for many a couple of few years. And just like the rest of us out here, you know, living like squirrels, as my Bulgarian film student friend would say. We&#x27;re living like I took her to Burning Man last year. We&#x27;re living like squirrels.</p>
<p>Oh, I can&#x27;t handle this. Um, so anyway, the Google uh the Google garage, what&#x27;s interesting about Google is that they um uh they were running on hard times. And as the conspiracy theory goes, you just Google this, you know, if you want, but search for it on Google. um you know they were uh they were given a $50,000 front money from the CIA you know when they needed they needed some money and they they sold out basically and they took this money supposedly allegedly whatever term I need to put in there and they basically from that point on they became a front company for a CIA and whenever time they needed money they just called up their handler and hey we need another 50 grand and oh no no problem here you go let&#x27;s take over the world and in the process you can have a few billion dollars so this is where it all started. Um, the Google garage.</p>
<p>Ain&#x27;t it great? Love technology. Uh, just like Apple computer. And so, uh, anybody know who this is? Speaking of the hope, the next hope.org. Uh, Robert Steel, XCIA. He lectures every other year at the the last hope, the next hope, the final hope.</p>
<p>Um, and so, uh, so he knows all about this kind of stuff. And he, in fact, he gave a a lecture, um, oh, what was it called? But freaking I filmed uh ran from 10:00 a.m. The conference started at 10:00 a.m. and uh Steel started his lecture I think at 11:00 p.m. and ran till 5:00 a.m.</p>
<p>So at the Last Hope conference I filmed from one day on Saturday I filmed from 10:00 a.m. until 5:00 a.m. that the next morning like 20 hours of content in that one track 5 minutes. Oh wow, we got to hurry. Okay, so we got this octopus and basically controlling all the money and controlling all the good stuff and um and we got Danny Castillo um who basically helped break the whole story.</p>
<p>Uh interesting story as it is. Um of course it ties into a lot of things and oh damn, how did that get in there? Um but anyway, so there&#x27;s all you know all sorts of conspiracies and other stories that you know you could get into. Um, you just have to, you know, pull up Google video or something. And so, uh, God rest his soul, Danny Castillo. Here&#x27;s one of, uh, the flags somebody made for him.</p>
<p>Investigative reporter, 1947 to 1991. Once again, I want to dedicate this presentation to him. Uh, he&#x27;s really been an inspiration to my life and his perseverance and how he basically was able to research this kind of stuff. Of course, we never know what the CIA is up to these days. you know, they&#x27;re just busy there, you know, sweeping up, you know, after the aftermath of all the different stuff.</p>
<p>And um and you know, I think we&#x27;re going to leave it there. The next slide, there was one guy I couldn&#x27;t talk about. I couldn&#x27;t even mention his name. His slide&#x27;s coming up next, but I&#x27;m not even going to show his thing cuz he&#x27;s threatened to sue for slander over mentioning his name that he was associated with Promise, but his initials are EB and um if you find him, you&#x27;ll know who I&#x27;m talking about. he was all involved with the cabons and anything.</p>
<p>But so I guess we&#x27;re going to wrap it because we&#x27;re almost out of tape and uh so look for this on my website hackerdvds.com and also um promiscandal.com and I guess that will be it. Thank you.</p>
