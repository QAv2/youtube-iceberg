            <p>Max swells four equations reduced to a is replaced with a where the new B field then becomes a new e field will also be formed so let Pro Jaxon a are habitually chosen so that the net symmetrical ruing separates variables two in homogeneous wave equations result equations one and two are arbitrarily changed to seven and 8 extraordinary physics Maxwell&#x27;s lost unified field theory about the time of the US Civil War James Clerk Maxwell succeeded in unifying magnetism and electricity actually he did far more than that in his theory as originally written in fact he had produced a theory which also captured the free interchange between electromagnetic energy and gravitational energy but no one including Maxwell himself realized it at the time Maxwell wrote his original theory in querian and querian like mathematics the modern form of vector mathematics had not yet been finalized by Gibbs and heide it is most instructional to examine some of the fundamental differences between a vector and a querian in a conventional three-dimensional Vector one may have three Vector components such as V equal a i plus BJ plus c k 4 to1 where I J K are unit vectors in the directions of the X Y and Z axis respectively and a B and C are constants obviously if the vector components of vector v are Zer then V equal 0 4 to2 we shall be interested in the vector product of two identical vectors V where VX V equal a sin equal 0 4 to3 and a is the length magnitude of vector v is the angle between the two vectors in this case Zero and Zer is the zero Vector now let us look for a moment at the querian situation first in addition to the three Vector components a querian also has a separate scalar component W so the querian Q for this situation is Q equal W + a i + BJ + c k 4 to4 now when this Quan is Multiplied times itself the vector part zeros just as it did for the vector ression however the scalar part does not go to zero instead we have qxq equal A2 equal A2 + B2 + C2 425 there is a very good physical interpretation of this result it is a square of the amplitude hence for the vector part of a wave it is directly proportional to the energy density of the vacuum as a function of time at the particular position however we now need to make a short short explanation of variation of stress energy density of space-time first we note that according to general relativity the gravitational potential is just a conglomerate of potentials of all kinds basically a potential represents a g potential and consequently a curvature of space-time the potential also represents trapped energy second we note that Kusa combined electromagnetics and gravitation as a unified in 1921 Kusa added a fifth spatial Dimension to minkowski&#x27;s force space and applied Einstein&#x27;s relativity Theory to five Dimensions to kuo&#x27;s Delight a common 5D potential is responsible for both electromagnetic field and gravitational field the bleed off of this five potential in The Fifth Dimension which is wrapped around each point in our three space is what we know as the electromagnetic force field the the bleed off of this five potential in and through our three space is what we know as the gravitational force field since the M field is very much stronger by a factor of 1042 for electrons than the gravitational field it is obvious that most of the bleed off of the five potential is in The Fifth Dimension as mforce field only a tiny bit is left to bleed off in three space producing a very weak gravitational field LL electrom magnetics is five gravity sliding around our three space three gravity is five gravity oozing through our three space we State this fact as a mass Moves In Space it generates increased activity with the virtual particle flux of vacuum itself The increased virtual particle flux activity exchange between vacuum and mass is analogous to a strange kind of virtual resistance since the resistance is virtual it does not observably slow down and observable object moving in an unobservable virtual particle flux vacuum the increased flux activity represents an increased virtual energy density of SpaceTime and an increased trap potential Mass resistance to an accelerating force of the moving object it represents a rotation of the SpaceTime frame visis the laboratory observer in the virtual vacuum which contains both positive and negative time one sees two antiparallel virtual forces one in positive time along the velocity Vector of the object and one in negative time time reversed or phase conjugated the reason one sees virtual forces is that each virtual sub quantal change in the virtual flux activity represents an individual unintegrated separate change hence a virtual acceleration The Observer where things are integrated sees the integral of of all these accelerations hence observable velocity the vector sum of these two virtual forces in the vacuum is a zero Vector however the two taken together represent a stress in the local energy density of vacuum since we may regard an mwave as a stream of virtual electrons SL positrons each engaging in tremendous virtual particle flux exchange with the vacuum then the same basic picture applies now for our physical interpretation of 4 to 5 if we refer to an mwave moving in the vacuum the rotation of the frame is maximum 90° but this same rotation is just the same as additional vacuum stress so the vacuum stress is maximum this leads to these conclusions an electrical force field Vector represents a local maximum linear stress in space time along the line of the vector note we specifically deny that the electrical force field vector of an mwave in vacuum is transverse instead it is longitudinal that has been addressed elsewhere by the author and will not be covered further here another electrical stress Vector interacting with the first one adds more urging stress to the first however this action is occurring in the rotated frame of the moving wave and so is rotated 90° from the electrical velocity Vector therefore it is lateral but in a Hyperdimension not in three space at right angles to the electrical velocity Vector the combined urging action of the two vectors thus sweeps out an area with respect to the laboratory Observer this means that the total urging or stressing action of the two vectors is analogous to a vector area it also means that this area function may be taken as the swirl of the electrical Vector but in a Hyperdimension not in three space that is we have described Des the magnetic force field thus any two electrical vectors that interact will have an area or resistance component generated any two that interact whether they add vectorially cross-product multiply or dotproduct multiply what is actually happening is that the wave exists in the five potential the E and B fields just represent the oscillations in that five potential they represent oscillations in the bleed offs of that potential as e field longitudinal and B field swirl the drag area represents the accumulation of extra potential hence the local rotation of space-time since this accumulation is moving along with the mwave as it passes a point it represents a change in the local virtual particle flux density of vacuum at that point hence a local curvature of SpaceTime hence the mwave makes a five-dimension g potential wave as it travels the threedimensional gravity wave associated with this is normally very very much smaller in magnitude Say by a factor of 10 to 42 or so however if the two vectors interact so as to produce a vector zero resultant then all the electromagnetic energy of the two vectors is captured that is all the M Vector Z resultant means is that the M bed off of the five- space gravitational potential wave has been stopped the five potential is still oscillating and now all its trap five energy must bleed off as three gravity force field Mass acts as an accumulator for this trapped M energy turned into local curvature of five space if we continually irradiate a mass with such a wave the atomic nuclei of the mass slowly charge up with a new energy note that this potential Delta may be positive or negative if one adjusts accordingly in this fashion one may change the mass of a static object in the laboratory one may either increase the mass or decrease it or cause it to float or even cause it to accelerate upwards but to return to our Vector interaction and our interpretation of the scalar remainder of the querian the rule is when the two M vectors interact so as to form a Zer M resultant then the M energy represented in each of the two vectors has been converted into a special form of five space gravitational potential one that is not bleeding off in The Fifth Dimension electromagnetically but one which will gradually produce a three gravity potential in a Mass&#x27;s Atomic nuclei as a function of time the individual element permeability and absorption factors of those nuclei Etc therefore in our mathematical Theory we ought to have a scalar component remaining when two M vectors interact to form an M Vector Z resultant that scalar component represents what is happening in the five potential that will only bleed into three gravity with exploration of this phenomenology in the laboratory one can work out the functions constants coefficients and parameters which specify how the 5G to 3G and vice versa component Works in conjunction with mass motion and other fields that&#x27;s the magic secret of electr gravitation it was captured inherently by the querian theory of Maxwell published during the American Civil War after Maxwell&#x27;s death when the scalar portion of the querian was discarded by Oliver heaviside to form modern M Theory that also discarded the unified field interaction between electromagnetics and gravitation electromagnetic field and gravitational field were then modeled and regarded as mutually exclusive mfield therefore was thought to produce no specific gravitational effects in the vacuum itself hence when Albert Einstein was formulating general relativity some decades later he knew only one way to curve SpaceTime that was gravitationally by attraction of mass forces but gravitational force was so weak that only a huge collection of mass would exert enough of it to measurably curve SpaceTime that would require a sun or Star since the Observer and his instruments would never be on the surface of the Sun or a star Einstein assumed that the local SpaceTime of the Observer would not beur D hence he severely crippled his general relativity theory in the west it remains an assumption to this day it is not a universal assumption in the Soviet Union however since the Soviets have long since written and developed in the laboratory unrestricted general relativity with local space-time curvature and hence local violation of conservation laws so the scalar part of the querian interaction that remains when the vector part of the result resultant is zero is Magic indeed that is the magic unified field portion that everyone has been seeking for decades and decades it was there at the beginning then we inexplicably threw it away but to return to our Vector SL querian examples note also that the two vectors V1 equal AI + BJ plus CK V2 equal AI BJ CK 4 to6 sum to zero vectorially when added such that V1 + V2 equal 0 4 to7 however querian May behave quite differently even under addition for example the two querian q1 equal W + AI + BJ + CK Q2 equal W AI BJ CK 428 sum their Vector parts to a vector zero resultant but do not sum to a scalar zero as well instead they sum to to q1 + Q2 = 2 W 4 to9 as can be seen quorans which have the same Vector Parts as vectors do not necessarily yield a complete zero when the vector Parts sum to zero and when two vectors multiply two provide a zero Vector resultant corresponding querian May yield a scalar term that is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors in this way the querian approach can capture the stress of the medium induced by opposing or multiplying vectors in the vector approach the stress of the medium is entirely lost when the two vectors sum or multiply to a zero resultant let us see just how important this vacuum stress can be first the stress in the medium represents curvature of SpaceTime when that Medium is the vacuum SL space time in other words the querian approach captures the ability to utilize electromagnetics and produce local curvature of SpaceTime in an engineering fashion heide wrote a subset of Maxwell&#x27;s Theory where this capability is excluded asterisk asterisk Dr Henry month has independently discovered that Maxwell&#x27;s original querian theory was a unified field Theory see his important Dynamic gravity and electromagnetic processes in publication note that by Maxwell&#x27;s original querian Theory however Einstein&#x27;s assumption need not be true at all for example look at equations 4:5 and 4:9 here we may utilize electromagnetic force querian to produce zeroed M forces and an increased stress in local SpaceTime in other words we have curved local SpaceTime electromagnetically since with electrons electromagnetic forces are about 1042 times as strong as the gravitation Force this local curvature of space time is not negligible that is we have produced a scalar effect from zeroing Vector operation between electromagnetic forces I have called this scalar electromagnetics and pointed out that it is truly electr gravitation we stress again that this violates one of the severely limiting assumptions that Einstein placed upon his theory of general relativity he assumed that curving SpaceTime could only be done by the weak gravitational force due to Mass since gravitational force is so weak only a stupendous collection of mass such as the Sun or a star could curve SpaceTime enough to notice experimentally since obviously the Observer and his laboratory instruments would never be located on the surface of the Sun or a star Einstein assumed that the local SpaceTime would never be curved in other words the local frame would always be a Lawrence frame this meant that locally The Familiar conservation laws of of physics would always apply curvature of SpaceTime would only occur at Great distances and at huge collections of mass such as a star or dwarf star Einstein did not write a complete unlimited general relativity he wrote a sort of special relativity with distant perturbations if Einstein had had electromagnetic theory in querian the scalar vacuum pressure Parts would have been there for him to ponder it is highly probable that he would have captured the electromagnetics to gravity conversion remainder in the querian interactions if so he would have written the full theory of general relativity involving local violation of conservation of energy a unified field Theory and the direct engineering of gravitational and anti-gravity effects on the laboratory bench by electromagnetic means in that case we should long since have navigated all around the solar system colonized the planets produced practical free energy devices and Power Systems and avoided two great world wars and a host of little ones but let us now see if we can make a gravitational wave electromagnetically again regard equations 425 and 4 to9 suppose these are instantaneous operations of M Force querian whose Vector parts are varying in magnitude but in such a manner that the vector Parts always form a zero Vector resultant now one can see that the scalar part remaining which represents the stress of local SpaceTime is varying as the product of the magnitudes of the vectors in the interaction vary this means that one has now produced a scalar wave that represents the local variation of space-time curvature in an oscillating manner rigorously this is a gravitational wave it has been produced locally it has been produced by Maxwell&#x27;s original unified theory again I have called this area scalar electromagnetics the Soviets call it energetics where local space-time curvature is vared conservation laws energy conversation Etc need not hold curved one way the local space time acts as a source of energy charge Etc curved the other way the local space time acts as a sync of energy charge Etc the Soviets often do not utilize the same restricted kind of general relativity that Western scientists adhere to Soviet papers in general relativity regularly point out the complete and unrestricted Theory where local space-time curvature is allowed they also point out that all conservation laws may be violated by such local curvature thus the Soviets have no unduly dogmatic respect for conservation laws further by assuming the possibility of local SpaceTime curvature Soviet scientists have assumed the possibility of direct experimentation with general relativity on the laboratory bench in the west we have assumed that such cannot possibly be done because of Einstein&#x27;s limiting Assumption of no local space-time curvature thus Western physicists are strongly conditioned away from electr gravitation this is particularly ironic since the basis for just such an experimental theory was produced by none other than Maxwell himself in his original theory of electromagnetism indeed shortly after the US Civil War we should have been developing anti-gravity spaceships we should have developed electromagnetics along Maxwell and been on our way to the planets of our solar system for Maxwell had admittedly somewhat unwittingly given us the basis for the necessary engineering theory of unified electr gravitation heide&#x27;s mutilation of Maxwell&#x27;s Theory well after Maxwell&#x27;s death Oliver heide helped to finalize what is today Vector analysis then he undertook to translate Maxwell&#x27;s Theory from querian form to the new Vector mathematics form now querian were devilishly difficult to calculate in so much so that a majority of the electrical scientists there were not very many of them in those days were in despair not to worry heide took a broad a figuratively speaking and simply chopped off off the scalar term leaving only the vector components with that artifice he greatly simplified the calculations to be performed of course he also threw away the M stress of space-time that is he threw away the gravitation part of Maxwell&#x27;s Theory let me stress this fact most strongly after Maxwell&#x27;s death a single man Oliver heide directly altered Maxwell&#x27;s equations eliminating localized electr gravitation and producing the form of the theory taught throughout the West today as Maxwell&#x27;s Theory Maxwell&#x27;s theory has never been taught in Western universities only heav Aid&#x27;s crippled subset of the theory has been taught then shortly before the turn of the century a short sharp debate erupted in a few journals mostly in the journal Nature only about 30 scientists took part in the debate it wasn&#x27;t really much of a debate the vector ists simply steam rolled right over the remaining querian ists sweeping all opposition before them they simply threw out the remaining vestages of Maxwell&#x27;s querian Theory and completely adopted heaviside&#x27;s interpretation thus a little over a decade later when Einstein wrote his general relativity theory he did not know that the original work of Maxwell already indicated the unification of gravitation and electromagnetics and indicated the ease with which local SpaceTime could be electr gravitationally curved locally and engineered accordingly he placed the scientists of the West on a road which rigorously assumed that a unified field theory was yet to be discovered it also strongly discouraged any experimentation aimed at curving local SpaceTime for it assumed that such could not be done after Potsdam and World War II a frustrated Stalin was to drive his scientists to review the entire scientific literature of the western world actively seeking a great new technical breakthrough areas such as the Allies had demonstrated with the development and use of the atomic bomb great Soviet institutes one staffed for example with over 2,000 phds were set up to thoroughly review all the Western Scientific literature from its very beginning anything interesting anomalous or unknown was put aside for further examination it is a good bet that the meticulous Soviet scientists disc discovered the difference between Maxwell&#x27;s original electromagnetic Theory and heide&#x27;s mutilation of it great mathematicians that they are Soviet scientists would have realized the implications of the difference with their knowledge of unlimited general relativity they would have made the connection to electr gravitation by 1950 they had indeed done so and were deeply into the development of what they called energetics and I have called scalar electromagnetics they had also reached another Milestone about the same time 1950 or so after World War II both the Soviets and the US were keen on securing the best of the German scientists the US particularly wanted missile scientists and Rocket Engineers the Soviets wanted them too but they also wanted the German radar Specialists and infrared Specialists the West didn&#x27;t care about the German radar scientists and engineers and the I fellows the Soviets did and they got them that was to prove a most spectacular benefit indeed during the war the Germans had placed extreme emphasis upon radar and radar absorbing materials Ram the German scientists had fantastically developed and extended the science of radar cross-section which is the heart of the matter and very very complex they were much further ahead in radar cross-section Theory at the end of world war to than where the US is today in the opinion of some US radar experts so the Soviets started with a great jump on us in radar knowledge and they have steadily increased the lead over the years in addition the Germans had developed highly successful radar absorbing materials and much of the theory to accompany them such materials turn out to be the key to how to build and develop a radar phase conjugation mirror to produce a Time reversed radar wave thus because of the German scientists by 1950 or so the Soviets had already discovered phase conjugation and they had discovered it in radar first not in Optics they would have been primed for the discovery by their great review of Western literature and the foundations of science since they would probably have noticed that the time reversed wave is a solution to the wave equation if so they would certainly have realized its generality throughout all physics all frequency bands and all types of waves superb mathematicians that they are the Soviets would certainly have made the kusine theory connection and also realized that phase conjugate waves carry negative energy as well as negative time they would quickly have seen the gravity and anti-gravity implications so about 1950 or so the Soviet Union would have started phenomenology experimentation in Earnest with phase conjugate radar mirrors and phase conjugate radar s this is what was referred to as energetics the Soviets began a massive program in energetics about the time of the beginning of the Korean War by 1957 to8 the Soviets had progressed to the point of a giant scaler M accident in the urals which exploded nearby Atomic wastes devastating the area they had also progressed to development of great new super weapons using their new energetics weapons to which crev referred in 1960 when he informed the Soviet presidium of a new Fantastic weapon in development a weapon so powerful that it could wipe out all life on Earth if unrestrainedly employed about the same time mid to late zeros the Soviets had also started the Eerie low-level microwave radiation of the US Embassy in Moscow to see if the US knew of scalar electromagnetics energetics and was developing its own Electro gravitational weapons and defenses building a upon Whitaker&#x27;s fundamental work in 1904 a most fundamental paper in the foundations of electromagnetics was delivered by the British mathematician ET Whitaker ET Whitaker on an expression of the electromagnetic field due to electrons by means of two scalar potential functions process London math social Series 2 volume 1 1904 P3 367 to 372 in this important paper wittaker showed that the electromagnetic force field equations can be replaced with the derivates of two scalar potential functions he also derived the most general form of electromagnetic disturbances in The Ether this means that the coupling of two Dynamic scalar functions can replace Vector electromagnetics in the vacuum note that Whitaker&#x27;s work pointing out the overriding importance of scalar fields also accents the erroneously discarded scalar part of Maxwell&#x27;s querian electromagnetic Theory even more strongly let me explain now how I got from wit taker&#x27;s paper to scalar electromagnetics Soviet Tesla weapons free energy anti-gravity and electromagnetic healing when I discovered Whitaker&#x27;s paper I had already strongly objected that charges and electromagnetic Vector force fields as presently included in the heaviside version of Maxwell equations included observable mass of course there was no observable mass in the vacuum hence the prescribed kind of M force fields could not exist as such in the vacuum obviously the foundations of our ordinary electromagnetics Theory were seriously flawed although my objections fell on deaf ears I determined to examine the foundations of M Theory discover the flaws and at least point out the necessary corrections to be made though this was an AR ous task to undertake and it required many years slowly the flaws showed themselves and the necessary correction slowly became clearer most exciting of all in working with several unorthodox researchers I was able to see many of these new ideas tried adjusted and demonstrated in addition the proprietary discoveries of these colleagues continued to reveal new and unique principles and Concepts the only disadvantage was that I could not reveal the propriety apparatuses and demonstrations of my inventor Associates but only the principles and Concepts that developed in turn I also developed principles and Concepts to explain what they were doing and the results they were obtaining so over the years I have slowly been releasing the principles and Concepts some of them are my own discoveries many of them are the discoveries of my associates some of them are simply a mixture of both early on it became obvious that the Soviet Union was far ahead on this path and was already utilizing the new unified field Theory to build URI powerful new super weapons since no one else in the US seemed to be watching this particular store I was rather universally regarded as some peculiar sort of fool I also began to compile information and data on the Soviet weaponization of this unrecognized technology this information I have released in a series of papers briefings and books the most recent being a 1hour videotape Soviet weather engineering over North America 1985 and a detailed book verdance a briefing on Soviet scaler electromagnetic weapons Tesla booko Greenville Texas 1986 building upon wittaker important work I formulated a conceptual revision to electromagnetics which I dubbed scaler electrom magnetics to accent that the observable M Vector force fields did not exist as such in vacuum but Dynamic scalar fields did I also wish to call strong attention to the fact that observable force does not exist until an observable particle of mass is coupled to the interference of the two scalar Fields much like in the aerono bom effect the Soviets of course call this area energetics energetics technology has been used in gigantic weapons programs of the Soviet Union for decades and it appears to be developed under the most highly classified program that the Soviet possess all development and deployment of energetics weapons is under the KGB and controlled directly by that organization not by the Soviet Armed Forces Peter kopita the Great Soviet physicist was once pressed by Nikita kushev for a total defense against missiles and air and spaceborn vehicles kitza replied that it could only come from the new energetics in 1960 of course crev gleefully announced to the presidium that a new Fantastic Soviet weapon was in development so powerful that if unrestrainedly used it could wipe out all life on Earth ironically crev jumped the gun before his new super weapons were deployed in the fall of 1962 he began inserting long-range missiles into Cuba bracketing the US with nuclear Firepower in an attempt to immediately change the balance of power Kennedy of course backed him down eyeball to eyeball so to speak in a blunt confrontation but promised not to invade Cuba kushev with his days numbered was desperate to deploy his new super weapons and provide a dramatic demonstration to recover face by destroying the USS Thresher on April 10th 1963 and on the next day producing a gigantic underwater explosion 100 miles north of Puerto Rico the Soviets demonstrated that the new super weapons had been deployed crev managed to retain his position a while longer in the 1960s and early 1970s I was also deeply involved in the study of paranormal phenomena in 1969 I entered the Georgia Institute of Technology to pursue a master&#x27;s degree program in nuclear engineering graduating in 197 71 in 1973 I published a rather simple paper Quinton / perceptron physics a theory of existence perception and physical phenomena in which I pointed out the nature of quantum change gave a new definition of mass and acceleration and pointed out the fundamental nature of inversion of time the paper also contained a simplified derivation of Newton&#x27;s Laws of Motion relativistic form the elements of this paper had been worked out in 1971 while I was finishing my master&#x27;s program in nuclear engineering finishing the work had been interrupted by a slight Sidetrack a tour in Vietnam from Summer of 1971 until summer 1972 at about the same time I formulated a fundamental correction to Aristotle&#x27;s logic adding a fourth law of logic to Aristotle 3 and a proof of it the New Logic was of great use in discovering and uncovering New Concepts in unified field Theory incorporating kusine five-dimensional Concepts scaler M became a field theory that unifies electromagnetics and gravitation incorporating Dynamics some zeroed M Vector systems which are discarded in normal M Theory allowed the direct engineering of the unified field Theory including structuring the vacuum curving local SpaceTime and producing effect effects at a distance and in higher Dimensions actually it allowed the recovery of much of the scalar part of Maxwell&#x27;s original Theory I then realized that inside a vector 0 m force field summation multiplication the virtual particle flux of vacuum SLS SpaceTime was ordered and controlled locally and macroscopically this of course violated one of the major assumptions a postulate of quantum mechanics the assumption that the structure of vacuum was ran rized and could not be deliberately ordered engineered and curved locally adding phase conjugation time reversal aspects and extended quantum mechanical Concepts allowed local anti-gravity and local curvature of space-time to be included again on an engineering basis it also allowed one to produce a mechanism responsible for Newton&#x27;s third law and to engineer the reaction force at will further it revealed that the law of entropy was simply the positive time statement it showed that there was another half of the law the negative time part or the law of neant tropy in addition a startling New Concept of Mind thought life biofields disease and healing emerged from all this again on an engineering basis as we stated in the beginning of this book it is now an urgent necessity to release my work on the basis for electromagnetic disease and electromagnetic healing we must produce a very quick positive treatment and cure of AIDS and other coming lethal viruses before the world is decimated accordingly this work is being released in this book in this chapter we will next present some perhaps surprising material on phase conjugation from the scalar M Viewpoint after first briefly explaining Symmetry and parody in following subsections we will cover briefly the remaining major Concepts in scalar electromag magnetics this will then set the stage for the following chapter extraordinary biology in which we will deal with the basis for unparalleled electromagnetic healing Symmetry and parity the basic idea of symmetry is the arrangement of the parts of a body or system about an axis so that two or more parts appear the same with respect to some operation the most obvious example is to look in a mirror where we notice that our image has been reversed left to right yet other wise there is no difference and so we may say that the reflection has mirror symmetry it&#x27;s the same except that left and right are reversed if you know the details of a system at one point and at another source site D Thomas Bearden httpwww.youtube.comwatchv</p>
