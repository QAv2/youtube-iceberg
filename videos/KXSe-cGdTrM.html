            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What&#x27;s up, veters? Patrick here with Vetted. Today is going to be kind of a UFO roundup, if you will, because I&#x27;ve got several different clips from several different interviews. So, you&#x27;re going to hear from Gary Nolan on Joe Rogan. You&#x27;re going to hear from Jeremy Corbel on Vice with um Shane. Uh you&#x27;re also going to hear from Ross Coltart who interviewed Kai Dickens with the telepathy tapes and an update on what&#x27;s happening with that.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re also gonna hear from Danny Shehan. So, we&#x27;ve got a lot to cover. Let&#x27;s jump in. Please vet that like button. That really helps out the videos.</p>
<p>And of course, if you&#x27;re not already subscribed, hit that subscribe button. I&#x27;m trying to get to 100,000 subscribers before the end of the year. And I know y&#x27;all get tired of me saying that and I apologize. All right, first clip. This is Jeremy Corbel on Vice.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Somebody asked him, &quot;Were there any beings on some of these craft?&quot; And he says, &quot;Yeah, some of the crafts we retrieved biologics. Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? &gt;&gt; Biologics came with some of these recoveries. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn&#x27;t say um beings bodies. He said biologics.</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s a reason he said that. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Well, I think you should ask Dave. He&#x27;s smarter than me. But I I think &gt;&gt; he&#x27;s not here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s true.</p>
<p>We can call &gt;&gt; Keep going. Biologics. Biologics. &gt;&gt; Biologics. I think because we make the assumption that that&#x27;s why we changed it to nonhuman intelligence.</p>
<p>We make assumption extraterrestrial alien. Well, maybe they&#x27;re from here. They&#x27;re ultraterrestrials. Maybe some of these things are just like printed flesh with AI. We&#x27;d call that a biologic.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, I see. &gt;&gt; Because we do that. &gt;&gt; We print organs. So, I think he&#x27;s leaving the terminology open for interpretation. But what he&#x27;s saying is, yeah, aliens and craft.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s interesting. And I think a lot of people always wondered why David Grush used the term biologics. And I&#x27;m glad they showed that clip of Nancy Mace asking David Grush, but the truth is um David Grush has said alien bodies before. This is an interview that maybe many of you haven&#x27;t seen, but before um David Grush did his infamous interview coming out with Ross Colt in June of 2023, one month before he testified before Congress, he actually did a backup interview. um at the home of Bryce Zable with Bryce Zable&#x27;s son um recording him.</p>
<p>And in this interview, you can hear David Grush clearly say that yes, we have alien bodies. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re saying that the United States government has retrieved alien technology? Yes, the assessment was non-human, presumably extraterrestrial, but we do have retrieved non-human material and craft that we have in our possession. &gt;&gt; Do we have alien bodies? &gt;&gt; We do. &gt;&gt; You know, I get what Jeremy&#x27;s saying. It does leave room for interpretation, but it also leaves room for, you know, an out that is not alien, which I get, but that&#x27;s kind of what they&#x27;ve said.</p>
<p>No, no, these are not human, right? But I don&#x27;t know. So, does the distinction bother you? Let me know in the comments. I&#x27;ve got one more clip of Jeremy Corbel on Vice. Here you go. &gt;&gt; Why was Arrow really put together, you know, to shape the emerging UAP narrative? those exact words.</p>
<p>If I&#x27;ve ever seen those in a document, it would be to shape the emerging UAP narrative. Why you got to shape something if it&#x27;s made up? &gt;&gt; Well, also, yeah, because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s growing in popularity and so therefore &gt;&gt; something&#x27;s happening coming out to some degree. People got cell phones, people talking, people are coming forward, whistleblowers. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, man. So, Dr.</p>
<p>Kurpatre, they watch all this stuff, by the way. I love it. I always get intel when people are watching stuff. Era, when you watch this, why are you having your former director do a PR campaign on select podcasts where you try to say you can&#x27;t trust whistleblowers when you are a known liar who goes against whistleblowers when you ask whistleblowers to come to you? Why do I send you whistleblowers &gt;&gt; as a test? And then they &gt;&gt; and then they don&#x27;t put out what they &gt;&gt; and then they come back to me and I put it up. Why? Why is that happening? Why did um Tim Phillips, the intram director of Arrow, who&#x27;s no longer any director of Arrow, also going on a media tour and telling absolute lies &gt;&gt; to the American public, now the new director of Arrow, I hear is a really good guy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But he did say to a friend of mine, fact, I can&#x27;t even part my hair without getting authorization. So even if he&#x27;s a good guy, how much is he able to tell the American public that he wants to? Now they&#x27;ve admitted some good things cuz they have to cuz we forced them. Cuz they look like dopes when they don&#x27;t. They look like dopes when people come back to me say I testified to them and they lied. They look like dopes when they go to the Wall Street Journal and use Joel Sheckchman as the guy that they&#x27;re going to um put out false information and George and I tell Joel Sheckchman, &quot;Hey, that&#x27;s factually incorrect.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the guy that was in the nuclear bunker. you got the story wrong, just do a correction. And they don&#x27;t. They double down and attack whistleblowers. So, Arrow, I got no love for them.</p>
<p>Now, the employees of Arrow, lot of love for good folks in there. From the top down, they got a mandate. And I&#x27;m going to say it one last time cuz no one ever listens to me. And I&#x27;ve been saying this for years. There&#x27;s one thing &gt;&gt; we&#x27;re listening.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; To shape the emerging UAP narrative that is a CIA mandate about the Yeah. about media and UFOs. They have something by the way that they call um perception management. It&#x27;s a office and they um have a budget and uh that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to do. &gt;&gt; And so look, a lot of people are not fans of Arrow and Jeremy makes some solid points.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think Arrow initially was run quite efficiently. Um you know, but at the same time, is it an office we need? I mean, before Arrow kind of came out officially, everyone in the UFO community was touting them, right? That they were touting Arrow. So, it just only when Arrow started to basically say things that a lot of the UFO community didn&#x27;t agree with that now Arrow was this horrific organization. But I have to admit, even through my, you know, research and doing the show, I have seen a lot of instances where Arrow was not very forthcoming and definitely handled a lot of the witness testimony and not in a way that I think would have been appropriate. I mean, there were instances where people were on phone calls giving their testimony and the way they had the phone system set up, it was all messed up.</p>
<p>People could hear each other talking, right? you could hear someone else give their testimony while you waited for your like what the hell? Like there&#x27;s supposed to be private conversations, you know what I mean? So, they just clearly weren&#x27;t taking some of this seriously. And I can understand the push back on this. But as Jeremy&#x27;s saying, this new director, um, Kazowski, I believe is his name. Um, people are excited about him. But he did tell um James Fox that&#x27;s who Jeremy is talking about when he says my friend.</p>
<p>Um he&#x27;s saying James Fox. James Fox said that he was told by John Kosowski that um yeah he can&#x27;t even part his hair without asking the DoD. All right. So let&#x27;s move on to the next clip. This is Gary Nolan who just appeared on Joe Rogan yesterday.</p>
<p>And here is Gary talking a little bit about the NASCA mummies. &gt;&gt; You look at you go, &quot;Oh, come on.&quot; Right. &gt;&gt; That never lived. You know, that&#x27;s &gt;&gt; then there&#x27;s the fetal position. &gt;&gt; Then there&#x27;s the fetal position ones, the big ones.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I was at the beginning I was, you know, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m always open to being wrong. I was at the beginning thinking, &quot;Oh, well, because of the small ones, those are probably not real.&quot; But then the MRIs started coming out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. the full body MRIs and the the ligature and the bone construction and the finger and then perhaps most I think extraordinarily the the um the fingerprints on on them being clearly not human.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s interesting. &gt;&gt; All right, let me know what you think in the comments. The mummies very interesting. The fingerprints, I don&#x27;t know. I mean, I&#x27;m still leaving it open for sure.</p>
<p>I have to be honest. All right, this next clip of Gary on Joe Rogan is him talking about Skywatcher. Um, and honestly Joe can&#x27;t really understand the whole dog whistle thing and the way they leave it is kind of like even Gary&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t know, you know, it seemed very unusual to be honest with you, but we&#x27;ll talk about it on the way back. &gt;&gt; You probably know of the Skywatcher group. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;ve heard of it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And uh Jake Paul, &gt;&gt; did they just stop operations? Did something happen? &gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s strange because people said, &quot;Oh, we stopped.&quot; No, actually it had been it had been determined from the beginning that we were going to go from January until July or August and collect data. And now we&#x27;re in the okay, what does the data mean phase where um we&#x27;re uh literally going through the data, looking at the data files and trying to we&#x27;re, as I said before, we&#x27;re filtering the data. We&#x27;re looking for the obvious mistakes, &gt;&gt; uh, etc. Um, and so, uh, no, they&#x27;ve not stopped. Yeah, there was something on Twitter about the something about the equipment, I forget.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No. Um, so James Fowler uh one of the guys who brought a lot of his equipment and technology to us decided uh that he wanted to basically go off and uh work uh in a DoD capacity as opposed to the research capacity. But he&#x27;s still advising us. I was just on a phone call, a Zoom call with him last week going over the data files. So, explain this sky watcher thing to people because it sounds insane.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, the idea behind it was that uh there might be ways to um send a signal and get things to show up and James Fowler claimed that he had such a thing. Um I was at one of the events where something showed up. Um, it was transient momentary but indis, you know, indisputable. But it&#x27;s just like &gt;&gt; what did it look like? &gt;&gt; It was just a silver ball moving quickly through several frames of a of the um of a video which was not fast enough, frankly, to pick it up. We just saw it move.</p>
<p>It went that way. And then &gt;&gt; you didn&#x27;t see it with your naked eye? &gt;&gt; No, I didn&#x27;t see it with the naked eye. &gt;&gt; Uh, which of course is a problem. &gt;&gt; Do they sometimes see things with the naked eye? &gt;&gt; One guy did. Yeah, &gt;&gt; one guy.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, &gt;&gt; so are these things variable in their appearance? &gt;&gt; I wish I had my I don&#x27;t have my phone here. Um, but uh we do have a picture of one next to a next to the helicopter about 200 feet away and it&#x27;s just kind of a fuzzy white blob uh against a blue sky. Um, but it was there, you know, and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not a cloud and it&#x27;s not a balloon, &gt;&gt; you know, it&#x27;s not discernible as anything uh obvious, but it was there and it happened during one of these events out in the middle of the desert. M &gt;&gt; uh and so you know so the the idea is behind Skywatcher is to see if there are ways to get them to show up and if so in a reproducible manner and then have the right kind of simultaneous multi-ensor capabilities to measure it meaning radar IR visual uh people on the ground &gt;&gt; what are they sending to get these things to go what what signal &gt;&gt; um James has a signal that unfortunately he won&#x27;t um I don&#x27;t know what it is. &gt;&gt; He won&#x27;t let everybody know what the bat signal is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You know, I mean maybe. Yeah, exactly. I mean it sounds kind of silly, but I mean why would you put that out on the internet? &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s interesting is Gary brings up Skywatcher at the very end of the interview. Um, and one thing that was kind of interesting about the interview is Gary doesn&#x27;t bring up his trip to a alleged UFO crash site with Deanna Pasula and Tim Taylor aka Tyler D. He doesn&#x27;t even bring that up.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s kind of interesting. You You went to an alleged UFO crash site and you don&#x27;t bring that up talking about UFOs and aliens. Wouldn&#x27;t that be the first thing you would bring up? Wouldn&#x27;t that be exciting? I don&#x27;t know. I guess maybe Gary&#x27;s been involved in so many things that that just didn&#x27;t come up. And to be fair, a lot of these conversations sometimes you just don&#x27;t get to talk about everything.</p>
<p>And and really the first half was just Gary talking about his work with cancer research and all of that, which is absolutely commendable. And Gary is, you know, a superstar when it comes to that. Let&#x27;s be real, right? He he deserves the respect he&#x27;s earned uh with the cancer re research he&#x27;s done. Um that is true. Forget aliens, UFOs.</p>
<p>Gary deserves a huge pat on the back um for what he&#x27;s done. I think anyone in the world has someone in their family that&#x27;s been affected by cancer. So to have someone like Gary dedicating their life to it, props. Respect. Much respect.</p>
<p>Now, the Skywatcher thing again, they they kind of continue to talk about this this um uh dog whistle and it&#x27;s very interesting how Gary kind of can&#x27;t understand it either, right? Like because Joe kind of breaks it down. I think we all had that question, right? And you know, at the end of that clip, Gary&#x27;s like, &quot;You don&#x27;t want to put on the internet.&quot; And Joe&#x27;s like, &quot;You know what&#x27;s the what&#x27;s the issue?&quot; And basically he goes on to say like, well, if everyone knows the signal, then everyone will put out the signal and then maybe they won&#x27;t show up. It&#x27;ll just flood the airwaves with this signal and right, it won&#x27;t work anymore. So that&#x27;s interesting. But again, I thought the whole idea was that the psionic assets were the ones that brought in the UFOs, not the dog whistle, right? So I&#x27;m not too sure.</p>
<p>And you know that&#x27;s confusing there. But you know I remember talking to Carl Crusher who brought out that stuff about Skywatcher on my show and on the live stream. He said that the dog whistle was like more to help the psionic assets more than anything. Not the UFOs, right? It was more to help the psionic assets. And something that got revealed in this um Skywatcher clip that I&#x27;d never heard before about Skywatcher from Gary Nolan.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s saying that James Fowler claimed to have a way a signal to bring him in and so they started it with that. But I&#x27;d never heard that before that James Fowler came saying, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ve got a way to bring these things out, right?&quot; So they sort of capitalize on that. And yeah, I guess that would be interesting if James Fowler&#x27;s taking that equipment now to do something else. What&#x27;s Skywatcher going to do? I understand they&#x27;re going through the data and all of that stuff right now, but what&#x27;s the next step? So, I I&#x27;m still trying to understand how these psionic assets fit in. Now, let&#x27;s get to a clip u from NewsNation&#x27;s Ross Coltart, who interviewed Kai Dickens and a neuroscientist who&#x27;s working with Kai on a documentary about the telepathy tapes.</p>
<p>And they also have a season two coming out of their podcast. So they give some details about some of the work they&#x27;ve been doing and what to expect um coming up in their documentary. And so Kai, without giving away the detail, are you in a position to say definitively that you think that you can prove that non-verbal autistic children, people have a capacity to do what we call telepathy? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. Without a doubt.</p>
<p>I mean unequivocally. Yes. In fact, like when you were asking it, I could feel like my eyes tearing up because it&#x27;s been such a journey of just like the vindication for these families really like and they have been doubted and doubted and doubted. And that&#x27;s the thing is like when you know people have been like trying to tear it apart, it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re watching these little tests, they&#x27;re forgetting all the things that are happening in these individuals homes and mothers know, fathers know, teachers know. Like when you are connected to someone, people aren&#x27;t dumb, right? So, it&#x27;s like you know what&#x27;s going on in your own roof and you&#x27;re being gaslit and gas lit and gas lit and yeah, I mean last week was amazing and I think like even my on my own film team like this the producer was there um but some of our assistants and the editors and all that weren&#x27;t there you know all those people weren&#x27;t there and like we&#x27;ve been trying to download them on what happened and and it&#x27;s just so unbelievably clear what the individual capable of to the point where I left there thinking the tests that we are doing are almost so below below them.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re capable of so much more and and we need to be now pivoting to try to meet and amplify their individuality, meet them where they&#x27;re at, integrate them into society instead of testing them at nauseium. &gt;&gt; And neuroscientist Dr. Julia Mosbridge, can I ask you formally from what you&#x27;ve seen, from what you&#x27;ve witnessed in that test that was done, a randomized controlled trial with nonverbal autistic children, people, what do you believe about telepathy as a result of what you&#x27;ve seen? &gt;&gt; For sure, it&#x27;s I mean I&#x27;m for sure it&#x27;s real, but that&#x27;s not the most interesting thing. &gt;&gt; Tell me what&#x27;s the most interesting thing. I mean we could already explain telepathy using you know entanglement in quantum physics and so it sort of feels like that&#x27;s not the most interesting thing to me what&#x27;s the most interesting thing is there may be two different kinds of telepathy and and one of them is this close proximity telepathy that Kai has seen in her podcast etc and then the other is what we were investigating this distance kind of telepathy and and the distant kind of telepathy seems to emerge in two ways one you can test And it&#x27;s a little hard to test because these students are extremely associative.</p>
<p>So even if they get the target, they&#x27;ll tell you what they associated with and you have to back extrapolate, you know, to what the target was. But you could do that mathematically. But um it&#x27;s also they&#x27;re activated by need. So if if there&#x27;s a need for a telepathic linkup because one of their friends is having an argument or whatever it is that comes through. And so the the most mind-boggling thing wasn&#x27;t so much telepathy to me although I did cry at one point because I was overwhelmed with the evidence and it was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Um but the most mind-boggling thing to me was the validation of what they call the hill which is where the non-speakers seemed to be um just in conversation with each other like all the time like even during the trials and um that that there was evidence for that and that was powerful. So, look, this is interesting and I looked up that neuroscientist and she&#x27;s very qualified for sure. But one thing that&#x27;s interesting is she has a history going back decades of already believing in telepathy and teleportation and time travel and all kinds of other things. Um, you know, it&#x27;s just interesting like I hope the telepathy tapes also gets neuroscientists and scientists involved that don&#x27;t have any skin in the game. Does that make sense? Like they didn&#x27;t they&#x27;ve never done this before.</p>
<p>like a mix. I think it&#x27;d be good to have a mix, people who maybe like, you know, her who are familiar, but also some neuroscientists and scientists that aren&#x27;t familiar with this, but at the end of the day, for it to be truly accepted, it would be peer reviewed, right? And so people would test their sources and methods and verify. So maybe at the end of the day, it doesn&#x27;t matter. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not a scientist and to be honest, not even that smart.</p>
<p>All right. Now, I do have one clip from Kai on Twitter that she posted that I thought was interesting. Um, to add a little context, um, take a look at this. &gt;&gt; What will it take for the world to believe these findings? &gt;&gt; H, you know, I don&#x27;t know. And that&#x27;s one thing I thought about a lot lately and I know I&#x27;ve talked to many of the families about and teachers and people part of the project, part of the film, part of the podcast and and every extension they&#x27;re after is that, you know, you could really work hard to try to get every skeptic out there to believe in telepathy.</p>
<p>And is that the point or is the point to listen to the parents to the people who are experiencing this every day? You know, I think for so many of the parents, the siblings, the teachers, the communication regulation partners, the occupational therapists, the speech pathologists, like there&#x27;s so many people who&#x27;ve been experiencing this and witnessing it. And for all of them, they don&#x27;t care about the proof oriented research. They know it&#x27;s happening. They believe so deeply it&#x27;s happening. And the question is why? And what does this mean? And what do we do from here? And and what is it? Is it telepathy? Is it sharing a consciousness? Is it pulling down a signal together from somewhere else? Is it proof of soul? I think that that&#x27;s where this community is.</p>
<p>Those are the questions they&#x27;re asking and those are the questions I&#x27;m asking. So it does feel like h we take 20 steps back to get someone to believe in this and like the only way to get them to believe is they&#x27;ll be in two separate rooms behind a partition and like we have that stuff coming up in the film. You know, we have partitions and blfolds and all the things. But but at a certain point like people who don&#x27;t want to believe won&#x27;t believe and everyone else who wants to I think is going to go on the best adventure trying to figure out what this means and and not just for for non-speakers and their families and those who love them but for all of us. &gt;&gt; All right, our last clip of the show.</p>
<p>This is Danny Shehan um on a local Fox News channel talking about aliens, UFOs, government cover up, the whole nine yards. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve been uh meeting with some lawmakers here and you&#x27;re calling on Congress to pass the bipartisan UAP disclosure act. If they do pass it, what were what will we find? Well, what what we&#x27;re going to find out is that the there is an element deep within the defense department and the operations director to the Central Intelligence Agency that has been committing perjury to Congress uh lying, denying the fact that they have recovered a nonhuman uh origin extraterrestrial spacecraft and the bodies that they&#x27;ve now DNA tested and know to be nonhuman. You&#x27;re saying because you represent some whistleblowers. You&#x27;re saying that they have uh disclosed to you that this evidence exists, these documents exist, that these phenomena have come indeed from out of this world with actual alien species &gt;&gt; that they know they&#x27;re nonhuman.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Do they describe what those species are or look like? &gt;&gt; That Well, actually, not yet to the uh to the public. Uh we&#x27;ve gotten this information out. Uh but the fact of the matter is that if we get this bill passed and we&#x27;re getting in the process this in the first week of September, we&#x27;re hoping as soon as they come back from their summer break that there the Senate is going to pass a 64page bill that mandates that all of the information that is 25 years old or more that&#x27;s basically anything before 2000 basically has to be immediately publicly released to the to the people. Okay. uh and the anything else is going to be submitted to a nine-person panel to be appointed by the president.</p>
<p>And that panel is not only to go through it and decide what else to release right away, but they&#x27;re going to set up a seven-year program uh called the the UAP controlled disclosure campaign plan to release all of this information over the next seven-year period so that we can adjust our economic systems, our uh geopolitical structures, our domestic political structures to try to accommodate the fact that we now aware of the fact that there&#x27;s an extra extraterrestrial civilization surrounding us. &gt;&gt; So this law is set up to that if we do confirm this evidence that uh the American people, the world population will learn about this uh in a measured fashion. Um, does this include some of those uh space or those craft that were captured by US Air Force pilots uh that seem to descend from the atmosphere to the sea, you know, within seconds uh defying the laws of gravity and physics? &gt;&gt; 7/10 of 1 second. &gt;&gt; 7/10 of 1 second &gt;&gt; from 80,000 ft uh in stopping instantaneously at at the surface of the ocean. 6,000 gs of uh of centrifugal force on them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And I think these are some of the videos that some of those pilots had caught. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the tic tac. &gt;&gt; They were on Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the Tik Tok. Uh and those were picked up by the F-18 Super Hornet gun cameras uh on them.</p>
<p>Uh they have myriad other photographs of them, up close photographs taken right out of the cockpit of some of these craft. uh and that they&#x27;ve now, as I say, recovered the craft and they&#x27;ve recovered the bodies that they&#x27;ve DNA tested and have now confirmed that they are non-human. &gt;&gt; So, this is you&#x27;re just say the defense department is keeping this secret from everybody. They have and they have lied to the public. Um &gt;&gt; and and to Congress, &gt;&gt; I mean, could we theoretically say that those uh those craft uh were secret defense department programs from contractors testing out new technology? some some kind of them have been because they&#x27;ve been engaged in a back engineering program.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve had these craft for some time and they&#x27;ve been engaged in back engineering the technology trying to replicate some of these uh and so there appear to be some craft that have been backgineered and constructed and that are being flown by US Air Force personnel uh in a deep secret program. But the reality is that there are a major number of other craft that are not ours. They&#x27;re not Soviet or they&#x27;re not Russian and they&#x27;re not Chinese. Uh, and so they&#x27;re from somewhere else. But now that they&#x27;ve recovered the bodies, uh, and they&#x27;ve actually DNA tested them, they know that they&#x27;re non-human.</p>
<p>All right, betterers. What do you think about what Danny said? Let me know in the comments. All right, veters. I&#x27;ll put links in the description to everything. Um, I highly recommend checking out that full interview with Jeremy Corbel, um, Gary Nolan, and the Telepathy Tapes one, to be honest with you.</p>
<p>The Gary Nolan interview is really good, and so was that Jeremy Corbell one, to be honest. Uh, with Vice and Shane. That that was a really good show. So, shout out to Jeremy. Uh, really good show.</p>
<p>Um, and the Gary Nolan interview on Rogan was was great. I I have to be honest, I was completely entertained. I listened to the entire thing. I and you know that&#x27;s hard to do. So anyway, all right y&#x27;all, we&#x27;ll see you on the next video.</p>
<p>Remember, everyday is a gift, y&#x27;all. Peace. [Music]</p>
