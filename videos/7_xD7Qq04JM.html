            <p>Eola Tesla, the genius who gave us alternating current, radio, and wireless technology. But in 1905, Tesla claimed he had something even more extraordinary. A device that could provide limitless free energy drawn directly from the Earth and the air around us. He called it the Warden Cliff Tower. Tesla believed it could send power wirelessly across the planet.</p>
<p>No wires, no fuel, no bills. But just as the project neared completion, his funding was cut. His main investor JP Morgan famously asked, &quot;If anyone can draw power from the air, where do we put the meter? Soon after, the tower was dismantled. Tesla&#x27;s notes disappeared, and the invention vanished from history. Was it just an impossible dream? Or was free energy buried to protect the profits of the powerful? Maybe the world isn&#x27;t ready for what Tesla had in mind.</p>
