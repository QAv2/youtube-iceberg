            <p>The crucial thing here is to always make the distinction that when I say I, I don&#x27;t mean the body. And when I when we say I, we tend to generally mean the body. So the body is not where consciousnesses exist. The body is is a quantum classical structure that exists in space and time, but is also connected with this quantum reality. And that&#x27;s why it is a monism.</p>
<p>The electrons are not objects separate from the fields. In quantum physics, an electron is a state of a field is some structure, some form that appears in the field itself. Just like a wave of the sea, a wave of the sea is part of the sea cannot be separated from the sea. So the properties of the electron are the properties of the quantum fields of electron which is conscious and has free will. So the fact that you cannot separate the origin of matter from the deeper reality tells you that is a monism.</p>
<p>Matter is a manifestation of spirit.</p>
