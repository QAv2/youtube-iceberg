            <p>&gt;&gt; ARE WE FINALLY ON THE EVE  OF A TRUE AGE OF DISCLOSURE,  WANT ALL GOVERNMENT SECRETS  ABOUT ALLEGED ALIEN LIFE AND  UFO&#x27;S WILL FINALLY FINALLY BE  REVEALED. PERHAPS AFTER  PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE THE GREEN  LIGHT FOR GOVERNMENT FILES ON  EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE TO BE  RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. IT IS  A DIRECTION THAT A GROWING  NUMBER OF VOICES HAVE BEEN  CALLING FOR FOR YEARS FROM  UEFA WHISTLEBLOWERS TO TOP  RANKING CONGRESSIONA  OFFICIALS HERE AT NEWS NATION.  WE HAVEN&#x27;T JUST BEEN FOLLOWING  THE STORY. WE&#x27;VE BEEN LEADING  IT 2 YEARS AGO.</p>
<p>WE BROUGHT YOU  THE EYE-OPENING STORY OF DAVID  GRUSCH, THE FORMER AIR FORCE  INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WHO  BECAME A WHISTLEBLOWER AND  ALLEGED GOVERNMENT COVERUP OF  A RETRIEVAL PROGRAM. I NEVER  WANTED TO DO BUT MY SENSE OF  SERVICE I DECIDED TO DO THIS  FOR THE FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.  I THINK HOLD CONGRESS  ACCOUNTABLE OLD THE IG  ACCOUNTABLE IN THE EXECUTIVE  BRANCH ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE WE  HAVE A  &gt;&gt; SEVERE COSTA TO SHUTTLE  CRISIS RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THIS  IS NOT A LAUGHING MATTER.  &gt;&gt; NOW THAT CALL FOR  ACCOUNTABILITY COULD SOON BE  ANSWER.</p>
<p>TRUMP POSTED ON TRUTH  SOCIAL THAT DUE TO QUOTE,  TREMENDOUS INTEREST. HE IS  DIRECTING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES  TO BEGIN IDENTIFYING AND  RELEASING FILES RELATED TO  EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE. PEAS  AND FOES. TRUMP HAS BEEN  DANCING AROUND THE DISCLOSURE  TOPIC FOR YEARS. SO THIS  ANNOUNCEMENT MIGHT NOT BE TOO  SURPRISING COMING AS IT DID  JUST HOURS AFTER FORMER  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA MADE  HEADLINES ON THE SUBJECT, HE  SAID ON A PODCAST HE THOUGHT  ALIENS WERE REAL.</p>
<p>THE COMMENT  LIT UP SOCIAL MEDIA YESTERDAY  REPORTERS ASKED PRESIDENT  TRUMP TO WEIGH IN.  &gt;&gt; ALL OBAMA ALIEN A REAL AND  YOU SEEN ANY EVIDENCE.  &gt;&gt; HUMAN VISITORS WHAT PLAYERS  RIGHT. INFORMATION IS ASKED  SPEAK MY MAY GET A BEACH LAST  WEEK.  &gt;&gt; AND WITH THAT, HE ORDERED  THE FILES TO BE DECLASSIFIED  AND RELEASED, PERHAPS WANTING  TO CREATE A LITTLE VIRAL  SENSATION OF HIS OWN.</p>
<p> &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN WE WHEN MIGHT WE  SEE ANY OF THEM? THERE&#x27;S NO  WORD ON THAT. AND NO WORD ON  WHAT THOSE FILES MIGHT  CONTAINED.  &gt;&gt; AND PLEASE REMEMBER THE  RELATIVE NOTHING BURGER OF THE  JFK FILES RELEASED LAST YEAR.  SO HOW BIG REALLY IS THIS?  WE&#x27;RE JOINED NOW BY MARK FUN  READ AND COMPHER SERVED AT THE  DEPARTMENTS OF STATE DEFENSE.  HE&#x27;S AALSO A ONTRIBUTOR AT  THE.</p>
<p>SO MARK, YOU SAY THIS IS  A HUGE DEVELOPMENT, BUT WE  SHOULD BE CAUTIOUSLY  OPTIMISTIC. HOW COULD IT BE  BOTH?  &gt;&gt; HEY, GOOD EVENING WITH A  AND I THINK ANY TIME THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  PUTS THE WORDS ALIEN  EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE INTO A  SOCIAL MEDIA POST RIGHT NEXT  TO LANGUAGE SAYING IT&#x27;S  SUGGESTING THAT HE WILL ORDER  THE RELEASE OF FILES RELATED  TO UFO&#x27;S. IT&#x27;S THAT&#x27;S QUITE AN  EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT. AND  THAT&#x27;S ESPECIALLY THE CASE  AFTER 80 YEARS OF DENIAL,  RIDICULE AND OBFUSCATION FROM  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ON THIS  TOPIC.</p>
<p>THAT SAID, AS YOU AS  YOU HAPPILY RIGHT, THAT WE  HAVE SEEN PRECEDENT FOR  QUARTER, QUOTE, NOTHING BURGER  WITH SOME OF THESE OTHER  RELEASES THAT HAVE BEEN HYPED.  THERE&#x27;S A LOT OF CHATTER ABOUT  THIS POTENTIALLY BEING A   POLITICAL DISTRACTION. SO I&#x27;M  I&#x27;M INDEED, CAUTIOUSLY  OPTIMISTIC. BUT I DO WANT TO  MAYBE JUST BRIEFLY LEVEL SET  BECAUSE A LOT OF THE COVERAGE  THAT I&#x27;VE SEEN HAS BEEN QUITE  DISMISSIVE OF THHESE COMENTS.  BUT AT THE END OF DAY, THIS IS  AN EXTREMELY BIPARTISAN ISSUE.</p>
<p> CHUCK SCHUMER OF ALL PEOPLE  STATED ON THE SENATE FLOOR  THAT MULTIPLE CREDIBLE SOURCES  HAVE COME TO CONGRESS STATING  THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,  THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS  ILLEGALLY WITHHELD INFORMATION  ON UFO&#x27;S. GREAT AGAIN FROM  CONVERSE. THAT&#x27;S PRETTY  EXTRAORDINARY. WE SEE IN THESE  HEARINGS, NEW VIDEOS KEEP  COMING OUT. MARCO RUBIO STATED  JUST IN DECEMBER THAT GENERALS  AND ADMIRALS, THE THE TOP TIER  OF OUR MILITARY, THE UNITED  STATES MILITARY TOLD HIM AND  THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE THAT AN REPORTED UFO  RETRIEVAL IN REVERSE AND  TURNING ENGINEERING PROGRAMS  HAVE BEEN WITHHELD FROM THE  PRESIDENT.</p>
<p>SO THERE&#x27;S A LOT OF  SMOKE. THERE&#x27;S AN ENORMOUS  AMOUNT OF SMOKE HERE. I&#x27;M  CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. WE&#x27;LL  SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU&#x27;VE  BEEN FOLLOWING THE STORY  CLOSELY. YOU KNOW, AS YOU HAVE  AND AND WE HAVE BECAUSE WE&#x27;VE  BEEN REPORTING ON A LOT.</p>
<p> &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT IT&#x27;S SORT OF  THE DEFENSE CONTRACTING  INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN REALLY  WORKING ON ALLEGEDLY THIS  REVERSE ENGINEERING PROJECT.  WE&#x27;RE TAKING EXTRATERRESTRIAL  REMAINS OF CRASHED VEHICLES  AND TRYING TO REVERSE ENGINEER  THEM. IF THERE&#x27;S BEEN ALMOST A  DELIBERATTE ATTEMPT TO CUT OUT  ELECTED LEADERS, EVEN ELECTED  PRESIDENTS BECAE THEY&#x27;LL BE  GONE IN 4 OR 8 YEARS. WHERE IS  FOR DECADES THESE COMPANIES  HAVE WITH THESE LABORATORIES  ARE ABLE TO WORK IN AND IN  EXTREME SECRECY ON  EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT.  &gt;&gt; THAT CERTAINLY IS THE  NARRATIVE THAT HAS DEVELOPED  AND THAT IS BEEN TOLD BY  MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT SOURCES.</p>
<p> AND IT&#x27;S A CAN. IT&#x27;S A IT&#x27;S A  VERY CONSISTENT NARRATIVE  WHICH MAKES BIT WHICH IS  FASCINATING TO YOUR POINT. BUT  YES, THAT IS POTENTIALLY A WAY  OF OBFUSCATING FREEDOM OF  INFORMATION ACT WAS, FOR  EXAMPLE, OF HIDING TECHNOLOGY  IF IT HAS INDEED RECOVERED,  BEEN RECOVERED. I WILL SAY  THAT THAT SENATOR CHUCK  SCHUMER AND MIKE ROUNDS,  REPUBLICAN OF SOUTH DAKOTA  HAVE REALLY LED THE CHARGE IN  THIS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR  LEGISLATION, THE EU, AP  DISCLOSURE AT IT SPECIFICALLY  GETS TO YOUR POINT AND IT HAS  A REQUIREMENT FOR THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT TO ASSERT EMINENT  DOMAIN OVER IT AND ALL.</p>
<p> &gt;&gt; YU AP.  &gt;&gt; CRAFT THAT HAVE BEEN  TRANSFERRED TO PRIVATE DEFENSE  CONTRACTORS. AND AND THAT  EXTENDS TO ACCORDING WHAT THEY  DESCRIBE AS BIOLOGICAL  EVIDENCE OF NON-HUMAN  INTELLIGENCE. AND THAT&#x27;S IN  BLACK AND WHITE LITTLE BIT.  THAT&#x27;S PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY.</p>
<p> BUT YES, YOU HEAR RIGHT. SO  THE QUESTION IS, IF RIGHT, IF  IF THE ANY POTENTIAL RELEASE  OF INFORMATION IS OF  GOVERNMENT FILES AND THE BULK  OF THE THE EQUIPMENT. THE  HARDWARE IS ACTUALLY IN  PRIVATE HANDS. THAT DOES RAISE  A VERY INTERESTING ISSUE. BUT  WE SHALL SEE.</p>
<p>I FOR ONE WILL  BE WATCHING TUESDAY STATE OF  THE UNION ADDRESS VERY CLOSELY  IN THE EVENT THAT PRESIDENT  TRUMP EXPANDS ON THTHESE  COMMENTS, WHICH AS YOU NOTED,  HAVE TAKEN OFF LIKE WILDFIRE  CERTAINLY ON ON SOCIAL MEDIA.  DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT  ACTUALLY DO THAT? I MEAN, AS  YOU POINT OUT,  &gt;&gt; THERE&#x27;S BIPARTISAN SUPPORT  FOR THIS VERY HIGH RANKING  MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES.  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE  TALKED ABOUT THE NECESSITY.  &gt;&gt; OF RELEASING THESE RECORDS.  &gt;&gt; KNOW,  &gt;&gt; IT WILL BE INTRIGUING IF  YOU MENTIONED THAT NOW.</p>
<p> &gt;&gt; 1, 100%. BUT YOU&#x27;RE RIGHT.  WE&#x27;RE GETTING TO A FEVER PITCH  I WANT TO ALSO POINT OUT THE  THE FILM, THE AGE OF  DISCLOSURE, WHICH DID  INCREDIBLY WELL AS THE HIGHEST   GROSSING DOCUMENTARY O ON AMAZO  PRIME VIDEO WITHIN 48 HOURS OF  COMING OUT. AND AS RUBIO,  SENATOR GILLIBRAND, RIGHT  CENTER AROUND ALL THESE  INDIVIDUALS MAKING PRETTY  EXTRAORDINARY STATEMENTS. SO,  YES, I THINK REALLY IS A A I  THINK WE&#x27;RE AT A CRITICAL MASS  HERE.</p>
<p>THERE&#x27;S REALLY A  GROUNDSWELL OF BOTH PUBLIC AND  CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATIVE  SUPPORT FOR FOR TRUE  TRANSPARENCY. AND AFTER YEARS.  &gt;&gt; IT&#x27;S ALL RIGHT, 10 SECONDS  BECAUSE THAT&#x27;S ALL I&#x27;VE GOT.  MAYOR MARK, ARE WE READY FOR  IT? BECAUSE IN AGE A  DISCLOSURE, THEY TALK ABOUT  THE FACT THAT PREVIOUS  ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE ALKED  ABOUT RELEASING THESE FILES  AND RULE AND DECIDED THAT THE  AMERICAN PUBLIC, THE WORLD, IN  FACT, WASN&#x27;T READY TO LEARN  THAT THE QUOTE, TRUTH.  &gt;&gt; I THINK WE&#x27;RE READY FOR.</p>
<p>I  THINK THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT  HAPPENS DAY AFTER  GEOPOLITICALLY ECONOMICALLY  SOCIALLY AND CULTURALLY? YEAH. </p>
