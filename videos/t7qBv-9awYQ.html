            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Now I want to talk about a few companies that are doing things. Defcalian research originally out of Greece but uh they had worked with Rossi on and so they had worked with this nickel and this hydrogen which is different than the original palladium that most of the researchers done in the early years and they&#x27;ve uh and they uses uh nickel and hydrogen again but it must be replenished about every six months. So you don&#x27;t have to refuel this very often. And they&#x27;re working on a 5 kilowatt reactor. There it is.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s your 5 kilowatt fusion reactor. You don&#x27;t see any lead shielding around this. You don&#x27;t see any radiation danger radiation warning signs around this. You don&#x27;t see any concrete pit underneath there in case it melts down kind of a stuff. Pretty benign equipment.</p>
<p>And so, you know, they published uh pictures of what they&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s pretty open. You can see it how it works. and they got theories about what&#x27;s happening and it&#x27;s all about getting that nuclear active environment in there getting finding that thing that Fleshman and Pond spent so much time trying to figure out what is it that causes this fusion reaction to happen. Uh and so they published a actual spec of of their equipment of what they&#x27;re trying to build.</p>
<p>I got it here someplace in the pile. Here is what their reactor is. It gives a detailed spect. There&#x27;s about 20 pages in here about every every piece they use in that reactor. The only thing they don&#x27;t tell you is that catalyst that they used to coat the nickel powder.</p>
<p>And uh so that&#x27;s what they hold. Uh so they expect commercialization of this third quarter of this year. You can go to that website and you can find that information. Um, Brilliant is another company that is uh started by a longtime researcher, Robert Goats in Berkeley, California. And uh they use metal hydrides.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s the actual description of what&#x27;s going on. And I don&#x27;t understand it. Uh but uh they have a reaction that is very controllable. They can start it and stop it at will. And they use electromagnetic pulses and they start this reaction of creating hydrogen uh again inside a metal lattice structure uh uh fusing together to create helium and it goes through a several stages.</p>
<p>Hydrogen proteium uh fuses into dutarium into tridium and then into helium 4 which go or to hydrogen 4 which goes right into uh decays into helium and you get all of this excess heat. Here&#x27;s their equipment. Inside that reactor on top of that table is where it&#x27;s happening. So, they&#x27;ve got a uh uh they&#x27;ve they also have got quite a little bit of money. Uh they&#x27;ve raised $2 million in 2012 and they&#x27;re now going after a 40 million see a $20 million second stage of financing.</p>
<p>So, again, serious money being put into this. They&#x27;ve signed a a license u uh with Sunrise Securities New York and the condition being that they have to go out and retrofit an old coal fired power plant, take the coal fired boiler out and put a fusion boiler in. And that&#x27;s the deal and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re working on. And there&#x27;s just a pictorial of what their hot tube boiler. They don&#x27;t call it cold fusion, they call it hot tube boiler is.</p>
<p>So they&#x27;re going to be issuing licenses, additional license by the end of 2014. Hopefully have this thing uh up and running as a demo by then. Lenuku and I met this gentleman at the conference, Dr. George Miley, five colleagues from the University of Illinois. They have achieved 200 watts of excess heat not using nickel but using zirconium oxide but again uh with hydrogen the dutaterium and they get their product right from the Ames lab right in Ames Iowa they get their their product and they have generated about 7 kilowatts and here&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to build this little thing it&#x27;s about twice as big as my wine bottle now three times as big as a wine bottle got one moving part in it and it&#x27;s a fan it&#x27;s a fan down at the left side to cool off the thermal coupled thermmoelectric generators, no moving parts.</p>
<p>You put hydrogen in, you get heat out, and you uh and and you get heat caused by fusion. So, they&#x27;re saying that this is going to cost about $3,000. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;ll cost 6,000. And uh you got to refuel it every six months for $500. And if you take the kilowatt hours, divide it by 500, you get seven cents per kilowatt hour for the fuel.</p>
<p>They have uh he&#x27;s one of the few uh people that have US patents is on LNR which has been very hard to get. So they&#x27;re expecting the prototypes this year. Lattis Energy LLC. This guy Lewis Larson uh he he&#x27;s not a researcher so much as he&#x27;s just an enthusiast and he wants to get uh you know accelerate this whole thing. And this guy comes up with the most colorful PowerPoint slides there are on the internet.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s why I like this guy. and he demonstrates, okay, here&#x27;s all these energy sources. Here&#x27;s the energy density. And you look down at the bottom and lenr on the bottom of this table. It&#x27;s 57 million uh is that energy density, watt hours per kilogram of reactant versus all these other things that you know, it blows the world away when it comes to energy density and being able to do things.</p>
<p>And he&#x27;s saying that someday, hey, it&#x27;s not very far off. This in my dreams, it&#x27;s going to be this. I&#x27;m going to have something like this and this is going to be my little uh lenr type of a reactor. So I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll get there or not. Black light power a little bit different approach and it&#x27;s a solid fuel catalyst and uh it&#x27;s converts H2O uh u hydrogen um some sort of a hydrogen but it&#x27;s in the form of a a solid fuel.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s the strangest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen. He&#x27;s got these gears and uh he it puts a lot of electricity through this reactant at the right time and it creates a a plasma. So, and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a hot fusion reactor in a sense, but it&#x27;s on a little tiny micro scale and uh and and he runs this hot plasma through a magno he magneto hydrodnamic generator, a converter. And if you&#x27;ve been in the power world, you know what that is, but it&#x27;s a way to create electricity out of a hot plasma flow gas. And it produces 10 times as much power as you put into it.</p>
<p>And so, u there&#x27;s a picture of it. Uh it&#x27;s a little mockup. uh it doesn&#x27;t look nearly that neat the the prototype you have and you can go on the internet right now and see a demonstration of it. It&#x27;s hard to understand what&#x27;s going on until you read it all and you say hey that&#x27;s kind of neat. So again about the size of this table going to produce you know 100 kilowatts and what&#x27;s the fuel it fuels hydrogen.</p>
<p>Uh so very neat other companies u Dr. Pantelli from Italy is working on a uh 10 to 100 watt item today. Energetics uh lenr cars. This guy just wants to figure out some way to use this to power cars. I guess he doesn&#x27;t like to buy gasoline.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s hard to understand how this guy is going to make it happen. But you know what? It takes people like this in the world to make things happen. People that are excited about it. Hunt Utilities Group. This is up in Minnesota.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re working with the Martin Fleshman uh memorial project and they are trying to build this uh this equipment that can be sent anywhere around the world to demonstrate LENR quantum potential corporation. Uh and this is this is where they&#x27;ve produced fusion in cavitation and there&#x27;s been now six uh uh demonstrations of of cavitation. You know what cavitation is? This is like in a pump where uh you get little bubbles inside in the liquid or water and these bubbles collapse and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s usually bad. Cavitation is bad in the pump world. But cavitation is a small bubble that collapses in on itself and if you create it just the right way, you can get a tremendous pressure on the molecules inside there and you can actually have fusion.</p>
<p>So fusion has been observed seven different experiments. Here is a simple pump. It&#x27;s not a simple pump and it used dutarium water which is kind of expensive and they said hey this thing will give us 100 kilowatts of heat. Again the fuel is hydrogen. So there&#x27;s a lot of work going on uh around the world.</p>
<p>Jet energy. This is another MIT professor. I met this guy brilliant guy. He&#x27;s a medical doctor who worked in radio uh radio isotopes and therapy and he got interested in L&amp;R and he developed a little device uh a fuser and electrochemical cell and he said well this is neat and uh and then so he went on to develop another device called a he he kind of liked the word fuser so he called it a nanner and a nanner is about this big ai big a thing this is like a quarter watt resistor two leads on it, you put electricity through it. And normally in a resistor, you put electricity through it, you generate a little bit of heat in the resistor.</p>
<p>Except with the nanner, you get more than the I squared R loss, which is normal. You get like many times the I squared R loss. So you put a little electricity through this and you get a whole bunch of heat out. And you say, well, that&#x27;s neat. What good is it? You know, what can I do with this thing? And so the point is is that he&#x27;s achieve achieved a ratio of 20 to1.</p>
<p>So how would that be useful? Well, lithium ion batteries, we got a lot of them. When they get really cold, and Gary knows this, they don&#x27;t perform as well, do they? Now, what if you could take just a little bit of that electricity from that battery and warm the battery up with it? You would get a lot more electricity out of your battery, wouldn&#x27;t you? So there&#x27;s the first application of his little product right there. So and here&#x27;s some test and it&#x27;s just amazing to see this. And here&#x27;s the experimental results. And voila, you get this extra heat out of it.</p>
<p>And so uh even though it&#x27;s uh you know you only get a watt out, the energy density for the energy that&#x27;s used inside there is a little bit of hydrogen in that thing is you know 10 million times that of gasoline. He&#x27;s now working on the M manner. Now MIT must have felt guilty about really uh destroying the reputation of those guys. So now you can go to MIT and take a cold fusion 101 course and it&#x27;s online. You can take it online.</p>
<p>Uh I was they&#x27;ve got one coming up in March 21. I was thinking about going out there and actually taking it in in Cambridge. and Peter Hicklestein there one of the other brilliant guys that I met him and uh just as intelligent he is one the guy that came up with the 200 theories of is down now down to one so he&#x27;s also teaching it and then here&#x27;s a regular old guy Bob Higgins from he formed a little cutie he is a guy I met at the conference he&#x27;s a motor oil research engineer worked for the company for his entire career he retired after 37 years worked in a lab and he got interested in the last few years. He was an electrical engineer. He says, &quot;This is really neat stuff.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can do this.&quot; And so he got some lab equipment on the cheap, put it in his garage, built his own little reactor, and this guy worked in a research lab for all of his career. He knew how to do things. And so after uh trying this out, he achieved thermal outburst that lasted 40 to 100 seconds. So, here&#x27;s a regular guy, could be me, except I&#x27;m not as smart as Bob, but it&#x27;s a guy that starts from scratch two years ago and says, &quot;Hey, I want to achieve this.&quot; So, he published his work, little white paper. I got copies of it up here if you want it.</p>
<p>And in that white paper, he says, &quot;The thermal events observed during preliminary testing this powder in HR consistent with the previously reported LER uh mini explosions.&quot; And so he said, &quot;At present, there is no other supporting data to report these events having a nuclear origin.&quot; So he says, &quot;Hey, what I observed can&#x27;t be can&#x27;t be explained by anything else.&quot; So here&#x27;s Bob in his garage. There&#x27;s his lab. Here&#x27;s his I got this from Bob right here. This nickel powder. This is what it looks like under a scanning electron microscope.</p>
<p>This little chunks of nickel. And then he coats them with this catalyst that&#x27;s top secret. Well, he figured out what it was. Iron oxide as Fe302. He said, &quot;That&#x27;s got to be it.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s got to be what Rossi used.&quot; So, he coated it in there and then he baked it in a furnace. You know, these research guys, you know, it&#x27;s quite a little process. comes out of the furnace out of that top thing right there and he takes his mortar and pestl down pedestal or however you say that grinds it up. Takes some more electron micro uh uh scope pictures of it. And this is what it looks like after it&#x27;s gone through the furnace.</p>
<p>This is the stuff. This is the stuff where you get a cold fusion out of. And if you blow up on there, do you see those little whiskers down there? That&#x27;s little particles of nickel coming out, growing out of those crystals. So, here&#x27;s his test setup here. Schematic drawing of it.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s got a bottle of hydrogen. He&#x27;s got a test reactor down the bottom. He&#x27;s got those two buckets of water to cool things off. There&#x27;s his all of his lab lab equipment and his little reactors off to the right there. And there&#x27;s the data.</p>
<p>See those two little purple things? Unexplained humps in the data. That&#x27;s my excess energy. first time out he achieved ex excess energy. So let me step back just a little bit. Hot fusion that&#x27;s where the billions and billions and billions of dollars are going into hot fusion.</p>
<p>You know in United States in there&#x27;s the national ignition facility in Lawrence Liverour National Laboratory in California in 2013 they announced if you recall hey we finally got out more power than we put in and and and there&#x27;s a picture a pictorial diagram of this facility. Now this is really big. That&#x27;s really expensive equipment in there. lasers and uh super cooled conductors, superc conductivity and uh that&#x27;s a different picture of a reactor, but uh pretty pricey stuff to make that happen. And then right now we&#x27;re building the international thermonuclear experimental reactor, the ITER ITER in France.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re one of seven countries $18 billion. Here&#x27;s just part of the footprint. And see all those ground the uh r-rod in there. Look how thick that is. And look how big that is.</p>
<p>And guess what? This is the cheap stuff here. This is the cheap stuff. So lots of money in it. 2013 Loheed Martin said, &quot;Hey, we think we can develop a 100 megawatt nuclear power plant by the year 2017. Get it ready to go by 2022.&quot; So out about 10 years.</p>
<p>Hey, well, I think we can do it. We can do it. give us enough money. And the neatest thing is last week Jaimeie Edwards became the youngest person ever to achieve fusion. Did you know that you can go home and achieve fusion yourself? It&#x27;s not very important if you do it.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s called a device called the Farnsworth Fuser. There it is. There&#x27;s a picture of it. That&#x27;s not Jamie, but there&#x27;s a picture of it. And it&#x27;s, you know, use electricity and and you create a little bit of fusion in there.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s not a big deal. 2,000 bucks and he did it. But again, what&#x27;s the big deal about that? How can you use that to help solve the world&#x27;s problems? You can&#x27;t. So comparing hot fusion to cold fusion. One of the books uh a good books is by Edmund Storms and uh the forward is one of the better parts of it and it just talks about hey uh cold fusion uh it appears to be so simple that any household could afford a device and hope to use it to supply all of their energy.</p>
<p>I mean if it&#x27;s this big it&#x27;s no elaborate type of equipment surely we can use this to uh for our own around the homes uh instead of the huge central generator of unimaginable complexity and cost the flying uh fleshman pawns device is something that a bright high school student might understand and afford to construct. So you just compare that picture I had of the INF in Livermore, California versus something you can hold in your hand and say they both are producing uh excit excess heat. So anyway, he goes on and makes some very, you know, just really uh pertinent observation and says, you know, uh in short, uh brute force is used to cause hot fusion while cold fusion requires a complex environment this in which a process similar to seduction is used to make it work. You know, that&#x27;s what Fleshman and Hans pawns were doing. And they were trying to seduce those hydrogen to get it to just the right spot.</p>
<p>And and then magic occurs, you know. And cold fusion has been difficult to replicate, very difficult until the last few years. Hot fusion has been difficult to make useful. Hot fusion is very dangerous. Lots of neutrons and all that.</p>
