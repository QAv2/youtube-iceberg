            <p>in this mesmerizing physics demonstration we are able to see the electromagnetic force in motion at the base and there&#x27;s large farad ring magnets an aluminium anodized copper bowl is connected with a wire to a direct current pole at the centre of the bowl a brass bolt and a smaller conductive cut are electrically insulated from the container and wired to another Pole of direct current one kilo of mercury is poured into the container and the circuit is introduced to a 2 volt direct current [Music] this generates a strong magnetic field and that supports of the system with these favourable conditions the electrically conductive mercury starts to rotate as the current runs through it the operating voltage is 2 volt DC controlled by DC inverter the rotation speed of mercury depends on the voltage being given marvelous [Music]</p>
