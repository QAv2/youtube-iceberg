            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I was asked to translate this video, so here it is. Hi there, I am Andi from behind the camera. We have news.</p>
<p>Today we try some cold fusion in the pot. Here is a quick overview. This is all you need. 200ml of water 20g of sodium hydroxide a stainless steel mug or pot a tungsten welding electrode a thermometer and a DC power source of at least 40-50V.</p>
<p>Here I took 200ml of destilled water. But ordinary tap water also does it. We add 10% of NaOH to the water</p>
<p>to make the current flow. It looks like this. You get it from the wholesale store. For 200ml water we need 20g of NaOH, this is 10%.</p>
<p>Stir well. Looks like this. A fine soap sud. Now we need a stainless steel mug or pot.</p>
<p>I found this mug for 3eur. Its double walls keep the temperature. A stainless steel thermos bottle would be perfect but that would be to narrow for the camera.</p>
<p>Heat up the solution to 60°C / 140°F. Put the mug onto a fireproof plate. Now we need a tungsten</p>
<p>welding electrode. It withstands great heat. You get it from the hardware store for a few bucks.</p>
<p>Large anode: mug walls. Tiny cathode: tungsten tip = enormous heat This is my power source. Batteries are best, the reaction starts from 40V. 40V would be 4 batteries.</p>
<p>But I had these pack and I was curious :-) Don&#x27;t do that. Voltage above 50V can kill. This is a simple serial connection.</p>
<p>Connect (+) to (-), so that the voltages add up. Red wire (+) to the mug Black wire (-) to the electrode I fastened the electrode with a chop stick.</p>
<p>I drilled a hole into the chop stick. 2 pegs hold everything in place. The electrode just slightly touches the water a bit. Black (-) to the electrode.</p>
<p>Red (+) to the mug. Be careful, the lye will splatter. (loud popping noise) Watch the temperature. This is the entire setup I used.</p>
<p>Please follow the safety advices and don&#x27;t exceed 50V DC. This is safer. And now Peter will explain more. He likes it simple and cheap and explains a bit more. - This is the electrolyte from the DryCell?</p>
<p>- Yes, this is 400ml. Now this is a measuring jug. It&#x27;s got a 5ml graduation. I heat the electrolyte up in the pan.</p>
<p>You see, there is still some dirt inside. That&#x27;s a thermos bottle for just 6eur. There is a vacuum in between</p>
<p>the double walls. Best insulation. I use such a bottle for my experiments here. The outside is the anode (+).</p>
<p>I wrapped a copper wire around the neck. - You drilled a hole into it? - No, just wrapped it around with a pair of pliers. - You heat up the electrolyte to...?</p>
<p>- To about 60°C / 140°F. It also works when it&#x27;s cold. But that would take hours because I just have 1.6Wh input. And I want to find the</p>
<p>best efficiency range. The warmer the water, the more efficient. I heat up to a bit more than 60°C, because it will cool down anyway.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just like the DryCell. You can&#x27;t measure the efficiency when it is cold. So we bring it up to operating temperature.</p>
<p>61°C - that&#x27;s enough. I just have to get the scales. We measure its weight before we start experimenting. You see, it is not</p>
<p>very exact. 582g including the container. We have to write down these 2 figures.</p>
<p>138g when empty. 582...? No, 583g... And 138g when empty. I cut a rubber closure that fits tightly.</p>
<p>This is a velcro with a hole in the middle. It has to match the hole in the rubber. We measure the heat</p>
<p>before we start. 58°C This is our cathode. A tungsten welding electrode. Ordinary metal would instantly burn up.</p>
<p>We connect the (+) here. - How much electrolyte did you use? - 10% NaOH My anode (+) is black. That&#x27;s not correct, but it&#x27;s all I have. There is a multimeter</p>
<p>looped in. It measures the Milliampere. This is the power meter from the grid. You see the marker? This is a toroidal transformer</p>
<p>with 2x 25V secondary output. I paired them together. We get 2x 25V = 50V. Between the red and orange wire I get about 52V AC output.</p>
<p>They are rectified with this bridge rectifier then smoothened with a capacitor. That&#x27;s all. The caps have about 940uF</p>
<p>and 1000uF, that&#x27;s 1940uF. And 4 diodes here. - A Graetz circuit? - Yes. This is just improvised.</p>
<p>Oh, it already shows a value even in idle. No cables attached! There is no power connection! No connection with the power grid! - This is the cathode? - Anode? - Yes. Here the anode is black,</p>
<p>the cathode is brown. The toroidal transformer is powered from this cable. When I plug this into the mains, we have power.</p>
<p>- We have 10mAh although there is no connection. Now we plug it in! I push the welding electrode down a bit. (Audible popping noise) You hear this? I start the timer.</p>
<p>I want to see how long we do this. I pull the electrode a bit up again. (Popping sound fades) - What happens inside?</p>
<p>- I will show you later. 0.019A, 0.02A Let&#x27;s calculate this: 80 V x 0.02 A = 1.6 W The water cooled down, so the value goes up a bit. 58°C, I wanted to</p>
<p>write that down. Now we have 0.03A. 0.03 A x 80 V = 2.4 W - Now this is one of these typical Youtube videos where you see a mess of cables and nobody can figure out from the video</p>
<p>what&#x27;s really going on. - Actually I just did this for myself, not for anyone else. Now while we wait, we do the same with batteries.</p>
<p>Here we have 72V only. That must do it. 6x 12V each. The small batteries have 1.2Ah only.</p>
<p>The larger ones have 7.2Ah. - This is a normal stainless steel jar? - Yes. - This is water with 10% electrolyte? - Yes, I did some experiments</p>
<p>with this before. - There is dirt in it! - No, it&#x27;s shungit powder. And yes, we have electrolyte in there.</p>
<p>But it is cold. We should... - How do you know that? - It it soapy. I just heat it up for you.</p>
<p>After 7 minutes we still have 0.026Ah. The warmer it gets, the less power it draws. You see, it goes</p>
<p>down to 0.019 - It wobbles. - Yes, because there is plasma inside. This is what I want to show you in the open pan. - And it still runs and runs.</p>
<p>I should do the wiring correctly, sometime. Now this is my anode and my cathode. - Oh, cool. - You see this? See what happens? It&#x27;s the same thing that happens</p>
<p>inside the thermos bottle. But these are batteries! They have almost no amperes! - What&#x27;s the temperature of the soup? - 42.6°C, 40°C (104 °F) It cools down quickly. Of course, this pot has</p>
<p>such a large opening! - This is no heat, even for a cold plasma! - Yes, that&#x27;s next to nothing. - You see the smoke in the middle. - What&#x27;s that? It is gas and vapor. - HHO?</p>
<p>- Yes, also. You see that the vapor comes from the center. We have vaporization at 40°C.</p>
<p>Now I tell you something. Wiki says about evaporation enthalpy that it is 2260 Joule per gram at 100°C. At 40°C it is</p>
<p>2400 J/g still. It needs more energy to evaporate water at low temperatures. Remember those values, we will do some calculations then.</p>
<p>You see, it drops down to 0.015Ah again. It runs for almost 13 minutes already. - Virtually no ampere draw.</p>
<p>I can feel the heat! - Yeah, you will definitely feel the temperature in the end. - .014, .013? Which value shall we take? Sometimes it even falls down to .012, 2 I think we&#x27;ll read it as .02,</p>
<p>do you agree? This might be a good average. That means we draw 1.6 Watt. I feel the thread is</p>
<p>getting warm. So there is thermal loss, even at just 50°C. Pretty much thermal los, if I can even feel it.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t measure this energy, it is simply lost. - The gas that builds up, where does that go? - Into the air. But these are so small amounts,</p>
<p>we would need weeks of operation to see a result. Now this is the electrolyte. - What is it exactly? - This is from another experiment. - NaOH, perhaps KOH.</p>
<p>This time we didn&#x27;t preheat it. Now it is not dark so you will see more. (Loud hissing sound) - Oh! Now I can see it. You couldn&#x27;t see anything from the black powder.</p>
<p>See, I just slightly touch the surface. Now I understand why you use the tungsten electrode. The vapors irritate</p>
<p>the throat. Pure natrium (coughes) It is most efficient when I just touch it. Water has a</p>
<p>surface tension. When I touch it, it bends up around the electrode. You can&#x27;t see it here. This is what happens when I touch</p>
<p>the surface, the membrane. This effect is stronger when I get closer to the rim. The secret is very simple, and nobody did this before: We have a large anode surface,</p>
<p>and a tiny cathode surface. If you measure it, it is about 1mm2 compared to several hundreds of cm2! It is at least 1:500 even at a low water level.</p>
<p>This disproportion causes an extremely high electron density. This is why the tungsten immediately starts to glow. Let&#x27;s see, it is down to</p>
<p>0.014 for some time now. 0.012, 0.011 Now 30 minutes have elapsed, I shut it off. Switch-off in 15 seconds. And off.</p>
<p>It ran for 30 minutes. I remove the cathode. Disconnect the wires. Now let&#x27;s see how much heat we produced.</p>
<p>This takes some time. In the beginning we had 58°C. I have to shake it. Ah, it is 60°C. 60°C.</p>
<p>60.1°C. Let&#x27;s read it as 60°C. - As you said, this might be the operating temperature. - It is already steaming.</p>
<p>Here comes the calculation. As I said in the beginning: We don&#x27;t know yet how much water condensed. The water is still hot. Hot water has a larger</p>
<p>volume than cold water. But you see, now it is definitely below the line. First it was a bit above 400ml, now it is below the 395ml line.</p>
<p>We have to wait until it is at 17°C again. Usually 5ml in cold state were about 7ml in hot state. So let&#x27;s assume 7ml.</p>
<p>I cover it, so no water can get lost. You know how I can measure the weight precisely? With my gold scales. It just works on even ground.</p>
<p>It has 3 digits precision behind the decimal point. I can weigh out exactly every 1/10th gram of water. Then I fill up</p>
<p>exactly to the line and measure the weight. Ok, now let&#x27;s calculate. We had 80 volts DC. This is just an assumption. It could have been 76V</p>
<p>or any other similar value. We just assume conservatively 80V. 80 V x 0,02 A = 1,6 W 30 minutes = 1800 seconds We used 1.6 Watts during these 1800 seconds.</p>
<p>1.6 W x 1800 = 2880 Joule This is the energy we used. Our input was 2880 Joule. Now for the output. We started with 58°C</p>
<p>and ended with 60°C. The water was heated up for 2°C. 400 ml x 4,2 Joules We need 4.2 J to heat up 1g of water for 1°C.</p>
<p>400 ml x 4.2 J x 2°C = 3360 J This is just the water temperature! - Without light emission, sound, heat, line loss,... - What do you mean? Which light? - Well, there is light emission.</p>
<p>We have to add this to the equation. Oh, there is much more... 3360 J is even better than any immersion heater.</p>
<p>An immersion heater would just have 2400 J output. But it is 85-90% efficient perhaps. We exceeded this values.</p>
<p>But we didn&#x27;t take into account the water vapor. You saw, there are at least 5ml missing. When it cooled down,</p>
<p>it is at least 7ml. At 60°C this needs about 2400 J per gram of water vapor. Let&#x27;s just say 2260 J, this is the value for 100°C.</p>
<p>We take the conservative value. 7 x 2260 J = 15820 J from the water vapor. We have to add this. (Camera operator)</p>
<p>This is too much output. 15820 J + 3360 J = 19180 J output (Camera operator) That is 10x more output. How to calculate the efficiency? Divide output by input.</p>
<p>19180 / 2880 = 6.65 COP (Coefficient Of Performance) COP 6.65 But there is even more. Let&#x27;s assume we didn&#x27;t have 7g of water vapor but 6g instead, and 1g of gas.</p>
<p>1g sounds too little to me, but let&#x27;s just assume this. We want to calculate conservatively. If we made 1g of gas,</p>
<p>how much is this? 1l of water makes 1860 liters of gas. So 1g of water becomes 1.86l of gas. Thus we must have made</p>
<p>1.86l of gas. 1l of gas stores 8000 J of energy 8000 J x 1.86 = 14880 J Now this would add 14880 J to our equation. This would make:</p>
<p>14880 + 15820 = 30700 Minus 1g of vapor. 30700 - 2260 = 28440 J I still did not add this: 28440 + 3360 = 31800 J 31800 / 2880 = COP 11 (values corrected) - 11x more output than input? (values corrected) Nobody knows this. They don&#x27;t want us to know this.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s how it is. I can show you a circuit diagram. No big deal. - You bought all of this?</p>
<p>- Yes, I bought all parts. In the beginning we started with 583g (correction: 582g) Now we have 581g. Let&#x27;s do this again... 581g You can already see</p>
<p>the difference, even though it is still warm. We are below the line. 7g of water must have dissolved, at least. But it lost just 1g of weight.</p>
<p>(Correction: 1g) How? Did we make heavy water, or...? (laughs) Another unanswered question. According to radiation: 0.1... 0.2... It shows some</p>
<p>values! Perhaps some microwave radiation remained in the wires? But 0.12mW/cm2 is harmless. - Where does the radiation come from? We did not even have</p>
<p>resonancy in the pot! - Of course this is possible. If you make plasma, you get a lot of frequencies. Up to 1GHz.</p>
<p>Now this is interesting. - Do you know the spectrum of the meter? I don&#x27;t think it is very precise either. - With my hand,</p>
<p>nothing happens. - Oh, there is something. - But this is impossible! - Let me try! Now where does the radiation come from? - Perhaps your camera? - Wait, I step away.</p>
<p>- No, it even reacts to my hand. I don&#x27;t think we are the radiation source. Are we perhaps</p>
<p>contaminated? Resonating? With HAARP? LOIS? - You know how they measure the microwave radiation from mobile phones? They keep 1m distance to the phone with the meter! Because in 1m distance it shouldn&#x27;t exceed 5mW.</p>
<p>But we use it directly at our head. I get close to the mobile. This is way above 5mW/cm2 at my ear.</p>
<p>You see this? They say above 5mW it gets dangerous.</p>
