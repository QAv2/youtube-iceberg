            <p>it into the record but 12 pages about this unacknowledged special Access program that your government says does not exist thank you thank you very much um chairwoman I want to thank the chairwoman and uh and the chairman um both for their continued support the first section uh talks about the unacknowledged special Access program called Immaculate constellation and the second section about uh USG imagery intelligence and uh representative Luna just told me if I say Immaculate constellation I&#x27;ll be on some list uh maybe if f a warrant so uh come at me bro I guess but uh in a time of heightened distrust of our government uh institutions I believe more transparency is not only needed but is possible and obviously we can respect National Security limits but we also have to provide our constituents with the information and oversight that they have tasked us for has there been any to your knowledge any communication with a non-human life form so the term communication is a bit of a trick word because um there&#x27;s verbal communication like we&#x27;re having now and the problem is you also have non-verbal communication and so I would say definitively yes but from a non-verbal meaning when a Russian reconnaissance aircraft comes into US airspace we scramble two f-22s and we are certainly communicating intent and capability um I think the same goes with this we have these things that are being observed over controlled us airspace um and they&#x27;re not really doing a good job hiding themselves they&#x27;re making it pretty obvious they have the ability to even interfere with our our nuclear equities our third witness is Mr Michael shellenberger founder of the newsletter public our best tool for unlocking the mystery of UAP is science but we cannot conduct a proper inquiry if the stigma is so overwhelming that just daring to be part of a NASA research team elicits such a vitriolic response therefore one of the most important actions that can be taken relative to exposing the truth of UAP is to combat the stigma and this is where I believe that NASA can be eminently helpful our first witness is rear retired rear Admiral Tim gallet who retired from the US Navy and is now the chief as the saying goes the truth is out there we just need to be bold enough and brave enough to face it Mr berett for five minutes of questions thank chair lady I

original document from the Pentagon about Immaculate constellation that Michael shellenberger delivered to Congress today so thank you Mr shellenberger for this information we are all reading it in real time now and Mr burat will enter it into the record but 12 pages about this unacknowledged special Access program that your government says does not exist thank you thank you very much um chairwoman I want to thank the chairwoman and uh and the chairman um both for their continued support the first section talks about the unacknowledged special Access program called Immaculate constellation and the second section about uh us G imagery intelligence and uh representative Luna just told me if I say Immaculate constellation I&#x27;ll be on some list uh maybe if I a warrant so uh come at me bro I guess but uh in a time of heightened distrust of our government uh institutions I believe more transparency is not only needed but is possible and obviously we can respect National Security limits but we also have to provide our constituents with the information and oversight that they have tasked us for has there been any to your knowledge any communication with a non-human life form so the term communication is a bit of a trick word because um there&#x27;s verbal communication like we&#x27;re having now the problem is you also have non-verbal communication and so I would say definitively yes but from a non-verbal meaning when a Russian reconnaissance aircraft comes into US airspace we scramble to f-22s and we are certainly communicating intent and capability um I think the same goes with this we have these things that are being observed over controlled us airspace um and they&#x27;re not really doing a good job hiding themselves they&#x27;re making it pretty obvious they have the ability to even interfere with our our nuclear equities our third witness is Mr Michael shellenberger founder of the newsletter public our best tool for unlocking the mystery of UAP is science but we cannot conduct a proper inquiry if the stigma is so overwhelming that just daring to be part of a NASA research team elicits such a vitriolic response therefore one of the most important actions that can be taken relative to exposing the truth of UAP is to combat the stigma and this is where I believe that NASA can be eminently helpful our first witness is rear retired rear Admiral Tim gallet who retired from the US Navy and is now the chief as the saying goes the truth is out there we just need to be bold enough and brave enough to face it Mr burett for five minutes of

there is a document that will be entered into the Congressional Record today uh Mr Tim burchat from Tennessee has this document and we just distribute it to every member up here on the dis of this document but this is going to be uh the original document from the Pentagon about Immaculate constellation that Michael shellenberger delivered to Congress today so thank you Mr shellenberger for this information we are all reading it in real time now and Mr burat will enter it into the record but 12 pages about this unacknowledged special Access program that your government says does not exist thank you thank you very much um chairwoman I want to thank the chairwoman and uh and the the chairman um both for their continued support the first section uh talks about the unacknowledged special Access program called Immaculate constellation and the second section about uh USG imagery intelligence and uh representative Luna just told me if I say Immaculate constellation I&#x27;ll be on some list uh maybe if f a warrant so uh come at me bro I guess but uh in a time of heightened distrust of our government uh institutions I believe more transparency is not only needed but is possible and obviously we can respect National Security limits but we also have to provide our constituents with the information and oversight that they have tasked us for has there been any to your knowledge any communication with a non-human life form so the term communication is a bit of a trick word because um there&#x27;s verbal communication like we&#x27;re having now the problem is you also have non-verbal communication and so I would say definitively yes but from a non-verbal meaning when a Russian reconnaissance aircraft comes into US airspace we scramble two f-22s and we are certainly communicating intent and capability um I think the same goes with this we have these things that are being observed over controlled us airspace um and they&#x27;re not really doing a good job hiding themselves they&#x27;re making it pretty obvious they have the ability to even interfere with our our nuclear equities our third witness is Mr Michael shellenberger founder of the newsletter public our best tool for unlocking the mystery of UAP is sence but we cannot conduct a proper inquiry if the stigma is so overwhelming that just daring to be part of a NASA research team elicits such a vitriolic response therefore one of the most important actions that can be taken relative to exposing the truth of UAP is to combat the stigma and this is where I believe that NASA can be eminently helpful our first witness is rear retired rear Admiral Tim gallet who retired from the US Navy and is now the as the saying goes the truth is out there we just need to be bold enough and brave enough to face it Mr burett for five minutes of questions thank you chair lady I request cassan to enter into the thank you I&#x27;ll now recognize Mr moscowitz for a five minute introduction uh thank you uh chairwoman good morning is there is a document that will be entered into the Congressional Record today uh Mr Tim burat from Tennessee has this document and we just distribute it to every member up
