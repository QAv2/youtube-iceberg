            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel and uh we took we take deep dives into some great theories of everything and uh show you how they work um and hopefully help you to adapt them to your own situation your own Paradigm shifting and your um Awakening to 5D Consciousness forming your holistic worldview and uh anything else that you might uh be able to glean from these uh great theories of everything today is our 489th video on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson and um U Mr Larson&#x27;s Theory is it&#x27;s not really out there I I seem to be like the only person on the internet that&#x27;s doing um reciprocal System videos in bulk that you can see you can find a few here and there but um I don&#x27;t think anybody&#x27;s done 500 almost 500 videos on the reciprocal system and um it&#x27;s a darn shade because uh Mr Larson put together a generalized Theory of Everything and um made great strides in the course of uh 60 years up until his death in 1990 in uh showing how it works and has uh at least a small group of people that are still trying to um kind of put it together now Larson did make a few mistakes in my opinion and um that&#x27;s kind of set the uh progress back but uh you know the truth always comes to the surface eventually and so um you be best to pay attention to these videos because sometime in the near future everyone is going to need to learn this because it is going to be the basis of all our Sciences in the future not only our Sciences but all our entire educational curriculum and religious curriculum and everything else you&#x27;re going to need to learn the reciprocal system uh and so I am not um you know maybe a perfect messenger for this because I don&#x27;t understand the reciprocal system in all its ins and outs at this point but um I think I understand it well enough to at least present it to you especially if you are are some kind of a um you know a digger and that you can you know uh do some research on your own and um you know maybe fill in some of the uh blanks that I leave but B mainly what I do on this channel is go through Larson&#x27;s own uh words so we read U mostly read his writings and some of his other followers as well um you know because I don&#x27;t feel like I can you know summarize what he says as well as as his own words so today we&#x27;re looking at his uh 1987 book um basic properties of matter we&#x27;re in Chapter 13 of that book on um electrical charges and this book is primarily on chemistry it&#x27;s one of the books that he wrote where he basically uh you know Larson in 1959 he arrived at his two fundamental postulates that he put out and uh basically two sentences about how he believed the universe operated and then he uh elaborated those postulates into a theoretical universe and then in books like this one here he Compares his theoretical Universe what he what the universe would look like if his postulates were correct with the empirical universe of the Legacy science stist so the the measured uh laboratory measured and compiled um table scientific tables and so on for the basic properties of matter in this case like the melting point and the specific heat and the compressibility and in this case this chapter is on electric charges now if you want a a more detailed uh summary of larsson&#x27;s um reciprocal system other wise known as the universe of motion uh you can uh watch any of my first 474 videos on this subject where I go into it a little bit a little bit of detail but uh I&#x27;d like to try to you know get through the text here today so we&#x27;re going to start up right away I pretty much going to assume that you know enough to follow along here uh but if you don&#x27;t check out one of my four first 474 videos on this topic okay the so-called fundamental forces of nature the presumably autonomous forces that are currently being called upon to explain the origin of the basic physical phenomena are necessarily properties of underlying motions they cannot exist as independent entities every fundamental Force must originate from a fundamental motion this is a logical requirement of the definition of force and it is true regardless of the physical theory in whose context the situation is viewed present day physical science is unable to identify the Motions that the definition of force requires an electric charge for instance produces an electric force but so far as can be determined from observation it does this on its own initiative there is no indication of any antecedent motion this apparent contradiction of the definition of force is currently being handled by ignoring the requirements of the definition and treating the electric force as an entity generated in some unspecified way by the charge the need for an evasion of this kind is now eliminated by the identification of the charge as a rotational vibration it is now clear that the reason for the lack of any evidence of a motion being involved in the origin of the electric force is that the charge itself is the motion electric charge is thus a onedimensional analog of the three-dimensional motion of an atom or particle that we identified as mass the SpaceTime dimensions of mass are time to the3 over space to the 3 in one dimension this is time over space rotational vibration is a motion similar to the rotation that constitutes Mass differing only in the periodic reversal of scalar Direction it follows that the electric charge a one-dimensional rotational vibration also has the dimensions t/ s the dimensions of the other electrostatic quantities can be derived from those of charge the electric field intens a quantity that plays an important part in many of the relations involving electric charges is the charge per unit area t/ s * 1 / s the 2 power = t s 3r electric field intensity the product of field intensity and distance uh t/ S 3 * s = t s^2 equals is a force the electric potential for the same reasons that apply to the production of a gravitational field by a mass the electric charge is surrounded by a force field however there is no interaction between mass and charge as brought out in chapter 12 a scalar motion that alters the separation between A and B can be represented in the reference system either as a motion a a motion of a toward b or a motion ba a a motion of B toward a thus the problem uh the Motions a b and ba a are not two separate motions there are merely two different ways of representing the same Motion in the reference system this means that scalar motion is a mutual process and cannot take place unless the objects A and B are capable of the same kind of motion consequently charges one-dimensional motions interact only with charges masses three-dimensional motions only with masses the linear motion of the electric charge analogous to gravitation is subject to the same considerations as the gravitational motion as noted earlier however it is directed outward rather than Inward and therefore cannot be added directly to the basic vibrational Motion in the manner of the rotational motion combinations this restriction on outward motion is due to the fact that the outward progression of the natural reference system which is always present extends to the full unit of outward speed the limiting value further outward motion can be added only after an inward component has been introduced into the motion combination a charge can therefore exist only as an addition um to an atom or subatomic particle although the scalar direction of the rotational vibration that constitutes the charge is always outward both positive time displacement and negative space displacement are possible as the rotational speed may be either above or below unity and the rotational vibration must oppose the rotation this introduces a rather awkward question of terminology from a logical standpoint a rotational vibration with a space displacement should be called a negative charge since it is since it opposes a positive rotation while a rotational vibration with a Time displacement should be called a positive charge on this basis the term positive would always refer to a Time displacement low speed and the term negative would always refer to a space displacement highp speeed use of the terms in this manner would have some advantages but so far as the present work is concerned it does not seem advisable to run the risk of adding further confusion to explanations that are already somewhat handicapped by the unavoidable use of unfamiliar terminology to express relationships not previously recognized for present purposes therefore current usage will be followed and the charges on positive elements will be designated as positive this means that the significance of the terms positive and negative with respect to rotation is reversed in application to charge in ordinary practice this should not introduce any major difficulties in this present discussion however a definite identification of the properties of different motions entering into the combination that are being examined is essential for clarity to avoid the possibility of confusion the terms positive and negative will be accompanied by asterisks when used in the reverse manner on this basis an electro positive element which has low speed rotation in all scalar Dimensions takes a positive as asterisk charge a high-speed rotational vibration an electr negative ele which has both highspeed and low speeed rotational components can take either type of charge normally however the negative asterisk charge is restricted to the most negative elements of this class those of division 4 many of the problems that arise when scalar motion is viewed in the context of a fixed spatial reference system result from the fact that the reference system has a property location that the scalar motion does not have other problems originate for the inverse reason scalar motion has a property that the reference system does not have this is the property that we have called scalar Direction inward or outward we can resolve this lat Problem by introducing the concept of positive and negative reference points as we saw earlier assignment of a reference point is essential for the representation of a scalar Motion in the reference system this reference point then constitutes the zero point for measurement of the motion it will be either a positive or A negative reference point depending on the nature of the motion the photon originates at a negative reference point and moves outward toward more positive value values the gravitational motion originates at a positive reference point and proceeds inward toward more negative values if both of these motions originate at the same location in the reference system the repres representation of both motions takes the same form in that system for example if an object is falling toward the Earth the initial location of that object is a positive reference point for purposes of the gravitational motion and the scalar direction of the movement of the object is inward on the other hand the reference point for the motion of a photon that is emitted from that object and moves along exactly the same path in the reference system is negative and the scalar direction of the movement is outward one of the deficiencies of the reference system is that it is unable to distinguish between these two situations what we are doing in using positive and Ne negative reference points is compensating for this deficiency by the use of an auxil auxiliary device this is not a novel expedient it is common practice rotational motion for instance is represented in the spatial reference system with the aid of an auxiliary quantity the number of revolutions ordinary vibrational motion can be accurately defined only by a similar expedient scalar motion is not unique in its need for such auxiliary quantities or directions in this respect it differs from vectorial motion only that it has a broader scope and therefore transcends the limits of the reference system in more ways although the scalar direction of the rotational vibration that constitutes the electric charge is always outward positive asteris and negative asteris charges have different reference points the motion of a positive asteris charge is outward from a positive reference point toward more negative values while that of a negative asterisk charge is outward from a negative reference point toward more positive values thus as indicated in the accompanying diagram figure 20 while two positive asterisk charges line a move outward from the same reference point and therefore away from each other and two negative asterisk charges in line C do likewise a positive asteris charge moving outward from a positive reference point as in line B is moving toward a negative asteris charge that is moving outward from a negative reference point it follows that like charges repel each other while unlike charges attract as it the diagram indicates the extent of the inward motion of unlike charges is limited by the fact that it eventually leads to contact the outward Mo movement of like charges can continue indefinitely but it is subject to the inverse Square law and is therefore reduced to negligible levels within a relatively short distance electric charges do not participate in the basic motions of atoms or particles but they are easily produced in almost any kind of matter and can be detached from that matter with equal ease in a low tempature environment such as that on the surface of the Earth the electric charge plays the part of a temporary appendage to the relatively permanent rotating systems of motions this does not mean that the role of the charges is unimportant actually the charges often have a greater influence on the outcome of physical events than the basic motions of the atoms of matter uh that are involved in the action but from a structural standpoint it should be recognized that the charges come and go in much the same manner as the translational kinetic or thermal motions of the atom indeed as we will see shortly charges and thermal motion are to a considerable degree interconvertible the singlest the simplest type of charged particle is produced by imparting one unit of onedimensional rotational vibration to the electron or positron which have only one unbalanced unit of one-dimensional rotational displacement since the effective rotation of the electron is negative it takes a negative asteris charge as indicated in the description of the subatomic particles in volume one each uncharged electron has two vacant Dimensions that is scalar dimensions in which there is no effective rotation we also saw earlier that the basic units of matter atoms and particles are able to orient themselves in accordance with their environments that is they assume the orientations that are compatible with the effective forces in those environments when produced in free space as for instance uh from the cosmic rays the electron avoids the restrictions imposed by its spatial displacement such as the inability to move through space by orienting in such a way that one of its vacant Dimensions coincides with the dimensions of the reference system it can then occupy a fixed position in the natural system of ref reference indefinitely in the context of a stationary spatial reference system this uncharged electron like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system in this electron uh if this electron enters a new environment and becomes subject to a new set of forces it can reorient itself to conform to the new situation on entry into a conducting material for instance it encounters an environment in which it is able to move freely in as much as the speed displacement in the motion combinations that constitute matter is predominantly in time and the relation of space displacement of the electron to the atom time displacement is motion furthermore the environmental factors favor such a reorientation that is they favor an increase in speed above the previous unit level in a high-speed environment and a decrease in a Lowe speed environment the electron therefore reorients with its active displacement in the dimensions of the reference system this is either a spatial or a temporal reference system depending on whether the speed is below or above Unity but the two systems are effectively parallel they are actually two sections of a single system as they represent the same one-dimensional Motion in two different speed ranges where the speed is above Unity the representation of the variable magnitude is in the temporal coordinate system and the fix position in the natural reference system appears in the spatial coordinate system system as a movement of the electrons the electric current at the speed of light where the speed is below Unity these representations are reversed it does not follow that the progression of the electrons along with the conductor takes place at these speeds in this respect the electron aggregate is similar to a gas the individual electron are moving at high speeds but in random directions only the net excess of the motion in the direction of the current flow the electron drift as it is usually called is effective as a unidirectional movement this idea of an electron gas is generally accepted in present day physics but it is conceded that The Simple Theory runs into greater difficulties when exist examined in more detail as noted previously the prevailing assumption that the electrons of this electron gas are derived from the structures of the atoms encounters many problems there is also a direct contradiction in the specific heat values the electron gas would be expected to contribute an extra three Hales R to the specific heat of Metals but no such specific heat increment is found experimentally the theory of the universe of motion supplies the answers to both of these problems the electrons whose movement constitutes the electric current are not derived from the atoms and are not subject to the restrictions that apply to this region uh to this origin the answer to the specific heat problem is provided by the nature of the electron motion the motion of these uncharged electrons units of space through the matter of the conductor is equivalent to motion of the matter through extension space at a given temperature the atoms of matter have a certain speed relative to space it is immaterial whether this is extension space or electron space the motion through electron space movement of the electrons is part of the thermal motion and the specific heat due to this motion is part of the specific heat of the atom not something separate once the reorientation of the electrons takes place in response to the environmental factors it cannot be reversed against the forces associated with those factors the electrons therefore cannot leave the conductor in the uncharged State the only active property of an uncharged electron is a space displacement and the rotation and the relation of this space to extension space is not motion however an electron can escape from the conductor by acquiring a charge a combination of rotational motions uh with a net displacement in space can move only in time as indicated earlier and um one with a net displacement in time can move only in space as motion is a relation between space and time but unit speed is unity in both time and space it follows that a motion combination with a net speed displacement of zero can move in either time or space acquisition of a unit negative asteris charge usually actually positive in character by the electron which in its uncharged state has a unit negative displacement reduces the net speed displacement to zero and allows the electron to move freely in either space or time the production of a charged electron in a conductor requires only the transfer of sufficient energy to an uncharged electron to bring the existing kinetic energy of that particle up to the equivalent of a unit charge if the electron is to be projected into space the additional amount of energy is required un additional amount of energy is required to break away from the solid or liquid surface and to overcome the pressure exerted Ed by the surrounding gas at energies below this level the charged electrons are confined to the conductor in the same manner as when they are uncharged the necessary energy for the production of the charge and the escape from the conductor can be supplied in a number of ways Each of which therefore constitutes a method of producing freely moving charged electrons a convenient and widely used used method furnishes the required energy by means of a voltage differential this increases the translational energy of the electrons until they meet the requirements in many applications the necessary increment of energy is minimized by projecting the newly charged electrons into a vacuum rather than requiring them to overcome a gas pressure the C cathode rays used in x-ray production are streams of charged electrons projected into a vacuum the use of a vacuum is also a feature of the um thermionic production of charged electrons in which the necessary energy is imparted to the uncharged electrons by means of heat in photoelectric production the energy is absorbed from radiation evidence of the electron as a free charged unit is usually of brief duration within a short time after it has been produced by one transfer of energy and eject it into space it again encounters matter and enters into another energy transfer by means of which the charge is converted back into thermal energy or radiation and the electron reverts to the uncharged condition in the immediate neighborhood of an agency that is producing charged electrons both the creation of charges and the reverse process that transforms them back into other types of energy are going on simultaneously one of the principal reasons for the use of a vacuum in electron production is to minimize the loss of charges by way of this reverse process charged electrons in space can be observed that is detected by various means and because of the presence of charges they are subject to electric forces this enables control of their motions and unlike its elusive uncharged counterpart the charged electron is an observable entity that can be manipulated in to produce physical effects of various kinds it is not feasible to isolate and examine individual charged electrons in matter as we do in space but we can recognize the presence of such particles by evidence of freely moving charges within the material Aggregates aside from the special characteristics of charges these charged electrons in matter have the same properties as the uncharged electrons they travel readily through good conductors less readily through Poe conductors they move in response to voltage differences they are restrained by insulators which are substances that do not have the necessary open Dimensions to allow free electron motion and so on in their activities in and around Aggregates of matter these charg electrons are known as static electricity okay that is the end of the chapter chapter 13 on uh electric charges uh chapter 14 is called the basic forces and we will start that chapter tomorrow um now uh Larson&#x27;s theory on Electra uh electricity uh especially electric charges is subject to some dispute by some of his followers Dr Bruce paret has kind of overhauled a lot of Larson stuff as far as elect electricity is concerned and um you know we will go through Dr Pet&#x27;s along kbk n&#x27;s different versions of this as well um and I I have to admit I do not understand larsson&#x27;s electronic uh Theory as well as I understand the rest of his stuff so I&#x27;m uh pretty lost about this stuff as well but uh be that as it may we will uh you know proceed on and thanks for tuning in and have a great</p>
