            <p>we understand exactly how these craft work our one limiting factor is our Material Science and you say we know exactly how they work yeah it doesn&#x27;t break our laws of physics this concept of amplification of gravity this concept of gravity propulsion we understand how things can move from point A to point B almost instantaneously my whole point is our Material Science has not caught up with the physics that we understand for these field propulsion systems I&#x27;m just telling you that our Material Science in 1989 and today is our limiting factor and as our Material Science gets better as humans we know how these things work now the fuel source that&#x27;s a whole other conversation but as far as creating these machines that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to do that&#x27;s why there is secrecy we&#x27;re trying to exploit the technology because whoever exploits it first wins it&#x27;s a game changer we don&#x27;t want Russia to do it we don&#x27;t want China to do it if we had a non-reactionary propulsion system the world would look different instantaneously</p>
