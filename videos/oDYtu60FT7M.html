            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>For decades, officials denied that the US government studied UFOs. But behind closed doors, two secret programs quietly did exactly that. The names were ARSAP and at the files would one day expose one of the strangest truths in modern defense history. It began in 2007 inside the corridors of the Pentagon. Senator Harry Reid joined by colleagues Daniel Inowin and Ted Stevens.</p>
<p>quietly approved funding for a classified project under the Defense Intelligence Agency. His purpose to investigate unidentified aerial phenomena craft that defied known physics tracked by radar and witnessed by trained military personnel. The program was called the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Application Program or OSAB. His contract was awarded to a private aerospace company owned by Robert Bigalow who had long studied unexplained aerial encounters, including those at the now infamous Skinw Walker Ranch. ORAP scientists didn&#x27;t just collect sighting reports.</p>
<p>They studied biological effects on witnesses, analyzed materials from alleged crash sites, and explored technologies beyond known human capability. Your internal documents spoke of warp drives, invisibility cloaks and energy manipulation at the quantum level. For some, it sounded like science fiction. For others, a quiet acknowledgement that science fiction was becoming real. When ARAP ended, a smaller, more focused program continued under the name ATIP.</p>
<p>The advanced aerospace threat identification program led by intelligence officer Lewis Alzando. ATIP zeroed in on military encounters with unknown craft, videos from US Navy pilots like the tic tac and gimbal footage. would later confirm that these objects were real, trackable, and unidentified. For years, Alzando worked in silence until 2017. When he resigned and took the story public, the New York Times broke the headline, &quot;Glowing auras and black money, the Pentagon&#x27;s mysterious UFO program.&quot; Suddenly, what was once conspiracy became congressional record.</p>
<p>Today, declassified documents show that the government spent millions studying aerial anomalies and not just in the sky. Researchers link phenomena at Skinwalker Ranch to the same intelligence network, suggesting that what we call UFOs might be part of something much broader, stranger, and older than anyone expected. Two secret programs, one hidden thread connecting sightings, science, and silence. If this much has been revealed, what still lies classified? Since ATIP&#x27;s disclosure, congressional hearings have forced the Pentagon to acknowledge anomalous phenomena as a real defense concern. But even now, many reports remain redacted, and the people who run these programs say we&#x27;ve only seen a fraction of the truth.</p>
<p>Orop and AI began a studies of the unknown. But what they found blurred the line between science and something else entirely. If these programs were the beginning, then discovery may already be underway.</p>
