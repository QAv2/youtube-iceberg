            <p>If you&#x27;re not looking at it, does it even exist? Most people believe reality exists whether or not we&#x27;re paying attention. But in quantum physics, that&#x27;s not true. The observer effect suggests that particles don&#x27;t have a definite state until they&#x27;re observed. Meaning, reality only becomes real when you look at it. It&#x27;s like the universe is waiting for your attention to come alive.</p>
<p>Spiritually, this has deep meaning. You&#x27;re not just a part of the universe. You&#x27;re the one giving it meaning. What if your awareness is the projector of the entire movie? Here&#x27;s a thought. When you close your eyes, does the world pause or do you bring it back when you open them again? Comment I if you believe that awareness creates reality.</p>
