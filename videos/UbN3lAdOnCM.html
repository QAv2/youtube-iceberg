            <p>this is a standard Geiger counter that measures the alpha beta and gamma rays with its transducer right now I have it on the lowest scale which is x point one and as you can tell that there is some activity going on very low low activity which is what I want I did not want it to be extremely active but I believe with its measuring that this particular point is some gamma rays which you&#x27;re looking at right now is the test setup I have with the wires running into it which is the DC voltage of approximately 10 volts and roughly 0.25 amps and the current seems to be determined by the voltage that I am running this app and I wanted at low voltage because if I run it a lot higher there is evaporation of the deuterium that causes that water level to go down to an unsatisfactory level and I don&#x27;t have a recovery system yet the wires that you see are platinum and palladium and this is the standard fusion cell that is described in Fleshman as ponds although the deuterium has had special treatment to it that&#x27;s undisclosed and will remain undisclosed it appears that the treatment of the deuterium is what causes the reaction to take place every time the object to the right as you can see here happens to be the radiation detection cell so that I could tell exactly what&#x27;s going on with the output of the reaction so the reading that you may or may not be able to see on the infrared thermometer is 78.8 which happens to be the room temperature the temperature that you would be seen now is ninety eight point four and that is the temperature of the reactive cell or the difference between the temperature in the room and the temperature in the cell happens to be roughly twenty degrees Fahrenheit so that the waters picked up twenty degrees differential heating because of the reaction but you&#x27;re seeing now happens to be the power supply that runs over to the reaction cell you can see underneath it is a constant temperature device for a water bath that keeps it at a constant temperature so we can tell what the gain of the cell is here I have turned the voltage up to 20 watts and what I want to show you on the power supply is this is a nonlinear type of reaction if you notice as I pan over to the power supply here and to the voltage and to the current well the voltage is 20 volts which is on top the current on the bottom is now 0.86 which happens to be a very nonlinear function if it was linear at 20 volts it should have been about 1/2 old but this is jumping up and you will notice that he keeps raising 10 seconds later is now risen to 109.5 so it&#x27;s rising rapidly there it is here and as you can see it&#x27;s a very nonlinear reaction and let me see if I can get you back to the fuel cell here so you can see what&#x27;s occurring inside the fuel cell the reading is also at this particular point 33 watts so it has gone from 2 point 2 watts at 10 volts to 35 watts have 30 volts can I say positively that this is a low energy nuclear reaction no obviously it&#x27;s going to take much further study and it will have to be validated by a great number of scientists at this current temperature I&#x27;m not sure that you can read it so there was a hundred and thirty five degrees and if we pan over you&#x27;ll be able to notice that I have set it back to 10 volts and you notice that the current is at point three one amps or that the average is now two point eight one which I&#x27;m hoping will decay back to roughly of the two point two amps that it was at before it&#x27;s a possibility that will stay as this higher currents could not decay back that time will tell</p>
