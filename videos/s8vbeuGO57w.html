            <p>Your reality is shaped by what you repeatedly focus on. In quantum physics, there is something called the observer effect. Scientists have found that subatomic particles exist in a state of pure potential, waves of probability, until they are observed. The moment attention is placed on them, they collapse into physical form. What does this mean? It means your attention literally influences reality at a fundamental</p>
