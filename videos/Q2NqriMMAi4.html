            <p>oh who looks like it&#x27;s going behind the Mesa the reality of the phenomenon has become even more compelling there&#x27;s something in the sky above the rocket we may be looking at the anomaly for the first [Music] time NOP got the shoe coming down fast Eric are you doing something at 1.6 I&#x27;m not broadcasting a signal 1.600 want to try and listen to it yeah is chirping in frequency that&#x27;s a communication signal or something from my experience as a rocket scientist this sound frequency was like the kind of communication signal you would get from a satellite orbiting the Earth or even farther out in space I&#x27;m looking through some footage I&#x27;ve got something here that doesn&#x27;t fit in what on Earth is that you can even see the trail behind it and let it watch it go it leaves a trail behind it as it goes or stop there&#x27;s a black line through the center of this thing in one night one span there we see a strange communication beam and then and we see this thing and interestingly enough at the same instant we see this signal at 1.6 GHz is pretty bizarre you&#x27;ve captured a UAP on camera here Eric and we don&#x27;t know what it is I wonder what that block stuff is what is that look at that oh my it&#x27;s brittle this is really thin look at that so this is telling me on this first reading on this side we&#x27;re looking at calcium iron silicon aluminum magnesium let&#x27;s take a look at this other side that number is much different yeah this side of this thing is showing up at almost 72% iron that was quite the noise that was just making yeah I&#x27;m up against something pretty hard right now he&#x27;s hitting some kind of a hard layer that he describes as perhaps a dome inside the Mesa there&#x27;s no good reason for that as far as we&#x27;re aware there we go I say we bag this up the next day Eric received a report from the material science and engineering department at the University of Utah about the metal the guys drilled out of the Mesa on one side of the material there&#x27;s torium and on the other side of the material there&#x27;s europium torium is a semiconductor material that is used in solar panels the europium under certain circumstances is a superconductor tum is the second most rare element on the planet same goes for europium both of those materials are used in developing modern quantum computer systems so it sounds like we&#x27;re looking at a structured material how else do you get one of the elements only on one side and one of the elements only on the other side I have read some speculative scientific papers that suggest that if you took layers of semiconductors conductors and super conductors and you put these in multiple layers you could actually create a region uh that might manipulate the SpaceTime metric meaning it might bend Space and [Music] Time Ranch manager Jim Morris and Navajo Ranger John Dover brought out a group of drummers from an indigenous musical organization known as blazing bear our plan tonight is to have blazing bear perform a series of ceremonial songs in front of the Mesa where the serpent Petroglyph is located which is also just below where the spiral of Boulders sets up on top of the ridge meanwhile as the sound waves bounce off the rock walls and Encompass the entire East field video expert David Mason will be using thermal imaging cameras to look for temperature changes or other visual anomalies that might appear during the ceremony okay let&#x27;s go [Music] there yep well when they started singing the temperature literally changed Eric the stone circle is where it&#x27;s heating up on top of the Mesa are you kidding me and according to the traditions of the ancient indigenous Nations here that formation was built hundreds of years ago to represent an interdimensional portal [Music] right as the drumming stopped the anomaly started to cool off but as Eric pointed out while the drummers were playing their sounds reach the frequency of 192 Hertz that&#x27;s the same frequency Eric played the other night when we saw the UAP from the exact same spot this interval really caught my attention Watch What Happens so they just start playing it looks like so we&#x27;ve got the ridge line fairly well defined and now look at this there wo there it is go back back what is that to me it looks like it&#x27;s going behind the Mesa right at the spiral of Boulders that are meant to depict an interdimensional portal something seems to be interacting with stuff over the triangle but from almost the ground up to 5,000 ft or more for tonight&#x27;s experiment berett Anderson will be recording with his high-speed cameras and technologist David Mason will also be filming the experiment with his highresolution thermal Fleer cameras if anything affects the shape of the Flames that&#x27;s 31 ft wow who wow I have something that might look a little strange oh there&#x27;s clearly some empty spots it seems to be going around it something at the 31 ft level literally split the flame from Nathan&#x27;s device in two and I have some high-speed footage now that&#x27;s interesting how you&#x27;re getting this separation what&#x27;s pushing the flame downwards hey back up back up back up what is that right right here look right there I think you see one it it kind of okay appears and it&#x27;s not connected to the flame look it&#x27;s below the flame there it is there is is in this look right here now it&#x27;s gone it&#x27;s gone we recorded evidence of a white or black UAP right where the Flames that we shot into the 31 ft High blob Zone were split into there&#x27;s something physical going on there absolutely where were they coming from and then where did they go was this more evidence that supports the legends about portals on the ranch we&#x27;ve heard for [Music] years oh yeah wait Thomas look right right there right there right right above the Horizon it&#x27;s moving south quickly just it just switched off like a switch we still got a lot of rockets to launch here we&#x27;re getting a lot of static interference on the [Applause] radio you know I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen noise like this before broad spectrum oh what the hell you got just something went by looked like smaller orbs there&#x27;s another one at the same time we&#x27;re seeing these elevated levels of RF noise he&#x27;s only seeing them in this night vision technology here one right underneath us I don&#x27;t know whether to be terrified or excited Brandon I&#x27;m uncomfortable yeah I&#x27;ve got this clenched feeling in my chest I feel exactly the same pressing yeah that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a good description of it yeah let&#x27;s take it down Cameron made the right call I say we close up shop and then start looking through the data this is a camera on the exterior of the helicopter just above the Mesa oh went behind the Mesa it appears as if there&#x27;s a corresponding light and illuminated area what I interpret to be directly below this thing you know where that is it&#x27;s right by the petp it looked just like what I was seeing in my night vision at high altitude it came right out of the Mesa you realize that we&#x27;re talking about objects looking like they&#x27;re flying into the actual stone of the Mesa and then appearing and coming back out I have to think this is going on more than we have suspected to this absolutely it&#x27;s awful lucky for us to fly once and see this right awfully lucky yeah we welcome bad Anderson he specializes in a high-speed camera system our plan was to launch rockets up through the triangle where we&#x27;ve seen numerous uaps and detected what we believe to be some kind of anomaly between 300 and 5,000 ft okay it&#x27;s on yeah while berett photographed each launch at 1,000 frames per second 3 2 1 hey did you see that it turned before it could get to wherever the anomaly is I noticed that in midair it suddenly veered a little off course like it ran into something invisible that deflected it hey we got a light there that&#x27;s moving where yeah we got it there is right there Eric we got something moving right overhead of us right now did it look like it just sped up to y&#x27;all yes did I&#x27;ve got eyes on the adsb map there&#x27;s nothing over us there&#x27;s nothing near us it&#x27;s still going look at it it just vanished one more Sparky rocket oh we got a malfunction everybody watch out oh oh oh it&#x27;s on fire we got a fire we got a fire we caught the malfunction on on the high speed there&#x27;s something in the sky above the rocket right here yeah look at that look at the light no no way we may be looking at the Aly for the first time guys that&#x27;s crazy after 4 years of investigating Skinwalker Ranch as a team we finally got good Visual Evidence berett Anderson captured some kind of blob likee feature on his high-speed camera that literally appeared out of nowhere and caused the rocket to explode this isn&#x27;t an anomaly in the lens because it didn&#x27;t move you can&#x27;t make that up oh yeah my gosh we couldn&#x27;t wait to review the high speed camera footage it&#x27;s clearly becoming illuminated or something and it&#x27;s growing in size and it looks like an object right there but there&#x27;s something else going on I think yep right as the rocket gets there boom could this blob like thing that appeared just 31 ft High be the anomaly that we&#x27;ve been trying to pinpoint at the triangle for the last four years if so then what the heck could it be this is a three-dimensional model it&#x27;s Point cloud data individual points that have been located through a complex algorithm turns out there are some very interesting artifacts showing up whoa you might I just saw one did you see it yeah okay in the sky oh right there yes oh weird yes well what would cause it to do that if that&#x27;s up in the air that&#x27;s the question look at this structure this Phantom structure that&#x27;s sticking up in the sky what&#x27;s so strange here is is if the GPS was being spoofed for the whole survey the final photogrametry image would be a big blur this one specific spot over the ranch is confusing the photogrametry data and confusing it from a number of different angles I want to show you something at another location that we&#x27;ve visited this is right above the Petroglyph area just on the edge of our property and you&#x27;ll recognize the Stone Circle here yep oh there you see what&#x27;s there you there so let me spin us around here well now look at this and you may observe the same thing I yeah so line those two up and where are they pointing you have three points in a line wow what are the odds of that right we&#x27;ve got a line being drawn here then what is that line pointing to you remember last year when we had that expert out he said that the Petroglyph was depicting a portal that pillar&#x27;s alignment with it kind of looks like in the data points a spiraling thing portal type feature could it have actually captured Visual Evidence that there really are portals on Skinwalker Ranch and could it help explain why we see uaps appear and then suddenly disappear thanks for coming these guys specialize in data collection using all kinds of high-tech equipment on projects for the Department of Defense NASA and other other sensitive government programs as the International Space Station orbits the planet it constantly sends a strong radio signal back down to earth so we&#x27;re going to use high-powered antennas to lock onto that signal and track it through the anomalous Zone as the space station passes over the ranch this afternoon meanwhile Jim Royston is going to be flying an advanced drone-based lar device if something strange breaks our connection with the space station signal we&#x27;re hoping that the light will be able to see it and help us identify just what in the heck it is oh any second now oh there it is tracking the space station now just got it locked on yep okay so we just lost the space station oh what just happened just crashed right when the ISS was over the triangle Travis we got something stroll you have something what frequency 1. 6510 no kidding really really straight up and it&#x27;s but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a constant signal that&#x27;s the signal we&#x27;ve been detecting above the triangle for the past 4 years oh there it is that&#x27;s the space station right there yeah it&#x27;s starting to show up stronger and stronger right there now that it&#x27;s ped us we picked it up again and it&#x27;s stronger now when Jim said the lar device was finally operational I immediately wanted to launch a rocket up through the triangle while he scanned the anomalous Zone I&#x27;ll show you I thought we would see just a tight little line going up as the rocket it dispersed all the points out really wide according to the lar it passed right through something that dispersed and split the lar beam into multiple wav likee patterns at about 30 ft High it penetrated an invisible object that caused the light R data to Ripple like waves of water this is what we saw oh what are we looking at that spot okay what would cause this void of all the data we&#x27;ve collected above the triangle Omnitech lidar identified the clearest evidence yet of something strange right at the 31 ft level where we saw the blob earlier this year in this area you know it&#x27;s pretty dense so you go from like really dense scan to nothing wow it&#x27;s like it absorbed the L our lasers who look at that what is this whole area circle around it in high reflectivity but the black just made no sense it was like an open void that&#x27;s the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever seen out here I&#x27;m picturing an approximately cylindrical Zone that flares out of the top I&#x27;m picturing two funnels stuck together at so you know what that is guys that is a traversable lorenzian wormhole that is exactly what scientists have theorized a traversible lorenzian wormhole or a portal to another place in the universe would look like this could account for everything that&#x27;s happened at the triangle [Music]</p>
