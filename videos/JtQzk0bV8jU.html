            <p>Mainstream physics either has no explanation for or characterizes as an illusion all of these four axiomatic aspects of existence. So the experience that&#x27;s the hard problem of consciousness no explanation for it whatsoever. The flow of time is uh considered to be an illusion that have a vision of something called the block universe where the past the present and the future all exist simultaneously. Your consciousness is in everyone simultaneously. See, so at at what rate would you be moving through time? A second per second doesn&#x27;t even make sense.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s not a degree of freedom to move through the block universe. So the flow of time is uh considered an illusion. And then similarly, there&#x27;s nothing privileged about now. You&#x27;re being right here is you&#x27;re just a location in the block universe, but you&#x27;re in the past, you&#x27;re in the future in the very same way. And then finally, of course, free will is an illusion.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s considered to be a big problem as well. So, so my feeling is is that the the current mainstream view, it&#x27;s just not addressing these things that I feel are absolutely self-evident aspects of existence. And for me, that suggests that we should maybe that should be humbling and maybe recognize that there needs to be more to the picture. And critically, we need to develop a an autology. We need to develop an understanding of reality in which subjectivity is included as a instead of being swept under the rug.</p>
