            <p>all right hey everybody so i usually don&#x27;t like doing videos like this at least where i&#x27;m talking i don&#x27;t know why i&#x27;m new to this but anyway i figured i&#x27;d have to to explain some of the misconceptions going on here this is a mig it&#x27;s my mini i&#x27;ve got one that i&#x27;m still building that&#x27;s bigger right a lot bigger this is the amc320 i can&#x27;t remember what this is this was only 45 on i&#x27;m sorry 25 on mouser electronics made by itachi metal so there&#x27;s a lot of people that try to replicate these there&#x27;s one guy on youtube that does it kind of right he&#x27;s got the right cores the right wire seems to know the equations real good but one of the things that&#x27;s going on is that a lot of people are using function wave generators to try to do this and you can&#x27;t do that that&#x27;s not what bearden used it&#x27;s not what he said and it&#x27;s not what he used he uses pulses of dc that are going in it&#x27;s cutting in it&#x27;s energizing and it&#x27;s dead energizing and dead there&#x27;s a rise in a decay time that&#x27;s not going to the negative side a sine wave goes positive and negative right we&#x27;re not doing that you have to pulse it because yes a moving electric field can only be transferred in a transformer that&#x27;s why you got to pulse it because a static field or a straight dc field isn&#x27;t going to transfer and excuse me for my terminology if it doesn&#x27;t match your books i don&#x27;t i didn&#x27;t go to college for this i do this myself so anyway i just wanted to show you this is i&#x27;m not done yet i&#x27;m still printing a couple more spools i&#x27;m trying to get the spool prints right um bought a lot of timers and stuff from mouser i&#x27;m gonna build a board probably gonna have one printed for myself too and uh i&#x27;ll publish that probably for free all my designs will be for free i put a lot of money into all this to try to replicate it and get it actually working and stable but if you want to try to replicate this a couple of things you&#x27;re going to need you&#x27;re going to need something that can hold those spools very well and straight i just 3d printed these with pet g it&#x27;s not that hard i mean to make this on tinkercad you&#x27;re going to have to have the real high frequency cores really good tight magnets those are i think in 42 gauss one by eighth inch one by one by eighth inch i&#x27;ve got i&#x27;ve got like a thousand dollars in magnets different sizes so um this this particular small one is going to have a second coil right here so to do the switch and back and forth um i don&#x27;t really like this brand but it was cheap so on ebay i only get about one coil out of one because you don&#x27;t want to splice these but this is a good brand this is one that you could you could get that was like 47 bucks for three and a half pound spool i&#x27;m using 24 gauge you don&#x27;t have to use that gauge it just depends this one i&#x27;m going to use 16 gauge depending i&#x27;ll probably do a couple 16 here for sure and uh just depends on how much input voltage i put in because that&#x27;s what ultimately is going to set your output even though yeah your coils are stepping it up but if you put one bolt in here theoretically i should only get two or three because this is this uh this is a hundred spool this is a hundred turn and this is a hunter 220 on both sides but that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m going to push in a little more vote i want to push about 50 into this if i can get away with it i&#x27;m going to try we&#x27;ll get there but uh yeah i just wanted to make this video to help get rid of that misconception he didn&#x27;t build a sign generator to send power into this and yeah you can get some results it&#x27;s still experimental but that&#x27;s not what he did that&#x27;s not what he did you have to have pulses and that&#x27;s something i think you&#x27;re probably going to have to build it i don&#x27;t think they make they might make something that can do that but just show you real quick when i&#x27;m printing i&#x27;m printing some more of those spools almost looks like a grow tent i just got this enclosure it&#x27;s pretty cool but yeah just running some petty uh i can show you all this real quick that&#x27;s my spools i got going on there trying to these are small so the the support doesn&#x27;t want to stick for some reason but anyway all right i&#x27;ll uh keep doing these videos as i keep going i&#x27;m going to end up probably doing a rough board on the pulses and then eventually i&#x27;m gonna design my own board hopefully that i could put a lot of this tedious crap on there electronically or computerized that way it&#x27;ll be easy to replicate and i&#x27;m not selling nothing i&#x27;m not not doing this for money i&#x27;m not doing this for any other reason other than to try to you know get some get some more energy get some more over unity energy because a lot of people seem to think it&#x27;s not true well you don&#x27;t know who charles proteus diamonds is you haven&#x27;t read his books you probably don&#x27;t understand anything about his equations that are in there even though we still use him today so i suggest you go look at his book it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s free on archive.org it&#x27;s charles proteus assignments electrical waves and impulses and other transients you need to read it and try to figure that out if if you only knew what you could do with the data in that book you&#x27;d probably yourself literally you&#x27;d probably yourself it&#x27;ll take a while to get it but anyway hope y&#x27;all have a good day it&#x27;s a little meg just to give you a perspective this one i&#x27;m really hoping to get like maybe maybe be able to charge a phone on it for free that would be nice this one i&#x27;m not even sure maybe three 400 watts if i&#x27;m lucky after i close loop it which i am going to do i&#x27;m not going to stop somewhere but anyway oh these were the good spools that came out for this one a little thick but they fit real good on here but all right peace</p>
