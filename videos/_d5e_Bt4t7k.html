            <p>[Music] hello I&#x27;m Doug stand up physicist sitting down to give a talk a whiteboard talk and this is based on some comments I got on another YouTube video by purple penguin he&#x27;s a gentleman who&#x27;s been following me for some time and he&#x27;s better physics than I am and he&#x27;s trying to you know make me be better and he actually came up with this idea of how to derive some of the expressions I&#x27;ve been working with these ëthey gravity so he starts with two assumptions and they&#x27;re pretty simple ones like when you measure time it&#x27;s just a watch you carry with you and when you measure distance you say a distance is going to be two events that happen simultaneous to the observers observation that come to them and then it&#x27;s the difference in time of that sort of thing and that&#x27;s it well what&#x27;s missing it&#x27;s missing is saying hey the origins got to be here so the origins doesn&#x27;t matter so much when you really care about differences in time and differences in space because you care about differences in space-time and this is the deeper one you&#x27;re not going to say that two observers are going to have to agree about the speed of light it&#x27;s like isn&#x27;t that illegal it&#x27;s like we can do that later if we choose but we&#x27;re trying to free things up so we can just see if there&#x27;s something interesting going on so let&#x27;s start with the transformation we know works and that would be T prime equals gamma t plus gamma beta X great where these are the usual things gamma equals one over the square root of 1 minus a velocity squared and that beta is in fact a velocity a dimensionless sort of velocity and then there&#x27;s the corresponding change in space X prime equals gamma X plus gamma beta T and we&#x27;re really going to keep our lives simpler and Z prime equal to Z great so we can decide to add an arbitrary function to time as long as it&#x27;s like a constant sort of thing because if we are really interested in differences that constant is just like gonna go away so how do we pick a an interesting function to look at in other words I&#x27;m saying that T prime T double prime now equals the t prime plus this function of a simple function well what we&#x27;re going to try and do is simplify those transformation laws come up with the simplest expression for what T would be alright so what I&#x27;m gonna do for this guy is I&#x27;m going to use a function that is just minus x times beta great ok so now I just plug plug away all right so I said T double prime equals T prime oh that&#x27;s that first line the gamma T plus gamma beta X no need to alter a thing and then we&#x27;re gonna do minus beta oh this is X prime X prime you go oh it&#x27;s not good to have unprimed and primed in the same expression there well we have X prime already that would be this thing so we just had to expand that out gamma t + gamma beta X minus gamma beta X plus gamma beta squared oops minus gamma beta squared teeth great imma go hey I wanted something simpler and so this equals then gamma T one minus beta squared and we go oh hold it that&#x27;s like a gamma squared in there so this really equals T over gamma noise that&#x27;s simple okay and so in particular we say well if I were looking at differences of these things that we know that&#x27;s like DT double prime equals DT over gamma great that that&#x27;s really nice and in particular we&#x27;ll notice that if if say DT / double prime equals zero which is to say that it&#x27;s simultaneous the events are simultaneous that means that they will be simultaneous in the other reference frame and if you know your special relativity you&#x27;re like well that&#x27;s different because now one of the deep lessons of special relativity is that if it&#x27;s two events are simultaneous in one inertial reference frame they may well not be simultaneous in another one that&#x27;s traveling had a velocity relative to the other person now if you&#x27;re not traveling relative to the other person that can actually be true I mean we&#x27;re not going it&#x27;s not completely illegal it&#x27;s just considered like kind of rare because once you start moving relative to somebody it&#x27;s actually necessarily the case that that&#x27;s not true but with that choice of the function there we&#x27;re in a situation where it is always going to be true all right so now we say well what happens with X double Prime how is that related and so the usual way to do this is to draw a space-time diagram and see what happens with that okay and so if we have a nice stick over here and we say this is a distance L and this is a distance 2l great then we these two are our definition of how to measure it is that these guys at the same time send out photons and the photons hit that world line of the observer and we say hey this is happens at T and this happens at 2t great but what time of what what time does it happen in this double crunch prime train hmm okay well it all depends on on what the gamma is and let&#x27;s see the gamma was - okay then if this was - then - gamma t double prime equals the DT so this will be 2 T double Prime and this one will be four double T Prime and that means this is going to be twice the length or gamma the length so the other transformation law we get is the X double prime equals gamma DX nice okay now what we do is we look at what is some of the consequences of these two expressions and we say hey well that&#x27;s kind of nice we&#x27;ve got a new kind of symmetry going on here we have that D of space-time space-time equals DT gamma gamma D X of course those wipe out hopefully cleaner than that and so this is a new conservation idea out there but mmm I bet I bet the whole speed-of-light thing I bet that doesn&#x27;t work out that would be the ratio of the changes in space to time so that would be the X DT double Prime and that equals okay we get a gamma DX and we get DT 1 over gamma so we get a gamma squared okay now that&#x27;s not a conservation law I mean these are going to be different for these two different observers but since we&#x27;ve been precise about what we mean but I mean it&#x27;s okay thing to do and is here&#x27;s one more relationship we can do and that is if we think about the the difference of these squares of these terms in other words if we think about this DT tau double prime squared equals DT double prime squared minus DX and again I&#x27;m simplifying it by not paying attention to the Y and the Z oh and now of course it&#x27;s true but let&#x27;s see what it looks like to the other observer in the other it&#x27;s system and let&#x27;s see that had the one over so this is going to be deep DT no primes squared gamma squared and this is going to be gamma squared DX squared and you could say well you&#x27;re you&#x27;re just doing like math and this has no physical significance but actually the only place I know where people are going to say hey you&#x27;re in a role is they&#x27;re from my interval is when we start dealing with gravity and type of velocity that&#x27;s associated with gravity that you don&#x27;t have to be like a traveling that is an escape velocity in other words I have a particular escape velocity here in this basement in Massachusetts if I was at the top floor of this building it would be ever so slightly less it gradually changes as you move up and down in the in the gravitational field so if we just said let&#x27;s just use you know the escape velocity that Newton himself derives back in the day you know thinking about a cannon on top of a mountaintop and like firing it until it went not only made in orbit but actually decided to leave entirely the gravitational field he would say using Newton&#x27;s work this equals approximately 1 minus 2 GM over C squared R DT squared unprimed you know because this is the difference of opinion about what the interval is and as seen by the other person okay that kind of game is going on and then we get this so the cool thing about that is that would be consistent with some of the weak field tests it has specifically like light bending around the Sun which is kind of like the first hurdle to clear of that general relativity did with flying colors in 1919 so that&#x27;s cool and look we haven&#x27;t actually used the field equation we had we don&#x27;t have a Lagrangian we don&#x27;t have that usual kind of situation but I can&#x27;t I definitely very much like this derivation because it saying that Minkowski space-time has a kind of symmetry that we should also look into and and now that I understand what&#x27;s going on I could I can tell you what&#x27;s going on okay and that is that we are saying okay we&#x27;re looking at at space-time where this is this X and this is T and we&#x27;re saying hey those horizontal and vertical lines those are the zeros I&#x27;m dealing with here not not the zeros that that make up the light cone okay that&#x27;s the world of special relativity and you have the relativity of simultaneity I&#x27;m saying no let&#x27;s actually I should put let&#x27;s do it that way these guys are the zeros I&#x27;m starting to think about and then you&#x27;re going to have a series of hyperboles in here just like you would in special relativity except they&#x27;re rotated by 45 degrees because you&#x27;re talking about the light cone as being your zeros and all I&#x27;m saying is treat those though the vertical and horizontal guys as your zeros and look at the collage achill consequences and I think you can quickly get to something that&#x27;s a consistent with light bending around the Sun which would be rather remarkable if it&#x27;s eventually accepted by physicists in general thank you very much [Music]</p>
