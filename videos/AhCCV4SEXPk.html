            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>It was 12 ft high, shaped like a bell, and according to the legend, it [music] didn&#x27;t just kill you, it turned you into black sludge. In the final days of the war, 60 scientists were allegedly executed in a single night just to keep it secret. This is the story of DLock, the Nazi bell. Some say it was an anti-gravity engine. Others say it was a time machine.</p>
<p>But the scariest part isn&#x27;t what it did. It&#x27;s that [music] we can&#x27;t prove it ever existed. The year is 1997, not 1945. That&#x27;s when this story really begins. Polish journalist Igor Witkovski sits across from an unnamed intelligence officer.</p>
<p>Between them, classified transcripts, or so he claims. Interrogation records from 1950. The confession of SS General Jacob Sporinberg [music] recorded after his war crimes trial just before his execution. And in those pages, a code name Kronos Dlo. Sporinberg allegedly described a research program [music] buried inside a mountain complex called Deriz the giant.</p>
<p>Underground tunnels carved by concentration camp prisoners and at the center a bellshaped device that needed its own power plant. Here&#x27;s the problem. Wowski says he was allowed to read these documents, not copy them, not photograph them, just read and transcribe by hand. No one else has ever seen them. No historian, no archive, just Whitski.</p>
<p>In 2000, he publishes his book in Polish, The Truth About the Wonder Weapon: The Nazi Bell Enters Public Consciousness. In 2001, British journalist Nick Cook, a respected aviation editor for Jane&#x27;s Defense Weekly, picks up the story for his book, The Hunt for Zero Point. Suddenly the bell is everywhere. Books, documentaries, video games. But the original documents still missing, still unverified, still only Wikoski&#x27;s word, the Owl Mountains, lower Celisia, then Nazi Germany, now Poland.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what we know for certain. Project Ree was real. Starting in 1943, the Nazis poured massive resources [music] into this region, forced laborers, thousands of them, from concentration camps, dug tunnels deep into solid nice rock, miles of underground passages, reinforced chambers, secret facilities. The scale was staggering. More concrete was allocated to Ree than to all civilian air raid shelters in Germany combined in 1944.</p>
<p>The official explanation, an underground headquarters complex, protection from Allied bombing raids, possibly a secure facility for weapons production. Seven separate underground complexes were started. None [screaming] were finished. Allied forces arrived in May 1945 before completion. The Germans destroyed documents, collapsed some tunnels, and fled.</p>
<p>Today, you can tour three of these complexes, Osufka, Rushka, and Toddars. Miles of tunnels carved into mountains. Some sections still flooded. Some never fully explored. The mortality rate among prisoners horrific.</p>
<p>Approximately 5,000 forced laborers died during construction. Malnutrition, disease, exhaustion, murder. The purpose of this massive undertaking remains partially unclear. Because the Nazis destroyed most documentation before retreating, locals call it the hinge. It looks like Stonehenge made of reinforced concrete.</p>
<p>And this is where the bell believers point and say, &quot;See evidence.&quot; Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s unusual about it. The concrete [screaming] shows heat damage, discoloration. Some areas have a greenish tint. The ground around it remains bare of vegetation even 80 years later. The structures dimensions roughly match the bell&#x27;s alleged size about 12 ft high 9 ft wide.</p>
<p>Could this [music] have been discated? Or this is what most historians believe. Was it just an industrial cooling tower or a foundation for a water tower or part of a ventilation [screaming] system? Similar concrete structures exist at other German industrial sites from the same period. The heat damage could simply be from explosives used to destroy equipment in 1945. The truth we don&#x27;t know. And that uncertainty is where legends thrive.</p>
<p>To understand why anyone believes this story, you need to understand 1943 to 1945 Germany. Hitler was losing badly. Stalingrad was a catastrophe. Allied bombs flattened German cities every night. Italy had surrendered.</p>
<p>The Soviets were pushing from the east, Americans and British from the west. Conventional warfare was over. So Germany went allin on Vunderwaffa wonder weapons. And here&#x27;s the critical part. Some actually worked.</p>
<p>The V2 rocket was the world&#x27;s first long range ballistic missile. First man-made object to reach space. Revolutionary technology. the ME262 jet fighter faster than any Allied aircraft. The Nazis weren&#x27;t just dreaming.</p>
<p>They built functional revolutionary weapons while their country collapsed around them. So when researchers talk about exotic physics experiments, anti-gravity, time manipulation, it sounds insane until you remember this regime put a rocket in space in 1944 with 1940s technology. If they achieved that under those conditions, what else might they have attempted? This context, real technological breakthroughs mixed with desperation is the foundation the Bell legend is built on. According to Witossky&#x27;s account of Sporinberg&#x27;s alleged testimony, here is what the bell supposedly looked like. About 12 ft tall, 9 ft in diameter, bellshaped, made of hard, heavy metal covered in ceramic material.</p>
<p>inside two counterrotating cylinders. These cylinders allegedly contained something cenamed Zerum 525, a mercurylike substance, violet or purplish colored, highly radioactive. When activated, the cylinders would spin in opposite directions at high speed. The device would glow pale blue, a humming sound. the temperature would drop dramatically.</p>
<p>Power requirements enormous. Allegedly needed a dedicated power plant. But here&#x27;s the problem. Zerum 525 isn&#x27;t a real chemical designation. No isotope matches.</p>
<p>No compounds match. It doesn&#x27;t exist in any wartime documents except with Kaussky&#x27;s transcripts. Some researchers speculate it could have been irradiated mercury. Others suggest thorium or burillium peroxides, but these are guesses trying to reverse engineer a description. Here&#x27;s where the story gets darker.</p>
<p>The bell allegedly killed things horribly. First, plants exposure turned them into decomposing black matter within hours. Then animals. Same result. Cellular breakdown, a black gelatinous substance.</p>
<p>Then, because this was Nazi Germany and concentration camp prisoners were considered disposable, human test subjects. Five scientists working on the project also allegedly died from exposure to whatever the bell generated. The test chamber supposedly had ceramic tiles on the walls and special drainage to wash away organic remains after each experiment. After testing, tiles were smashed and replaced. This is the story.</p>
<p>But again, no physical evidence, no photographs, no surviving test chamber with these specific features, no medical records, no witness testimony beyond what Wikowski claims to have read. Just a description that sounds horrifying and scientifically plausible enough to be believable. So, what was it supposedly designed to do? Theory one, anti-gravity propulsion. Counterrotating cylinders filled with dense conductive liquid mercury could theoretically produce unusual electromagnetic fields. Some fringe physics theories suggest this could create gravitational effects.</p>
<p>Mercury has unique properties. extremely dense, electrically conductive, odd quantum behaviors. The problem, anti-gravity remains theoretical even today, 80 years later with vastly superior technology. Theory two, time manipulation. Einstein&#x27;s relativity showed time can be bent.</p>
<p>Could intense electromagnetic fields create time dilation effects? It&#x27;s a sexy theory, completely unsupported by evidence, but sexy. Theory three, particle accelerator. The 1940s saw the birth of particle physics. Maybe the bell was an early attempt at high energy physics research. This is actually the most plausible theory.</p>
<p>if the device existed at all. But particle accelerators of that era were massive installations, not portable bellshaped devices. The reality check. Mainstream physicists point out that the energy requirements described would have been impossible with 1940s technology. The effects attributed to the bell, gravity manipulation, time dilation, spontaneous organic decomposition, don&#x27;t align with known physics.</p>
<p>But believers counter, what if the Nazis stumbled onto something we still don&#x27;t understand? After all, they did create the world&#x27;s first practical jet fighter and ballistic missile. Maybe the bell was another leap, one that was lost when everything was destroyed. Every secret project needs a leader. For the bell, that was supposedly SS General Hans Comler. And here&#x27;s where the story gets genuinely mysterious because Comler was real, powerful, and his fate remains uncertain to this day.</p>
<p>Hans Comler was a civil engineer turned SS general. By 1945, he was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany. He oversaw construction of concentration camps, including Awitz. He ran the V2 rocket program. He controlled underground weapons factories where thousands of prisoners died from forced labor.</p>
<p>By late 1944, Comler answered only to Hitler and Himmler. He had authority over jet aircraft production, missile programs, and secret weapons development. Then in May 1945, he vanished. Official SS records claim he committed suicide on May 9th, 1945. Multiple conflicting witness accounts, no body ever found, no dog tags, no physical evidence.</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s where it gets interesting. A 1949 US military report by investigator Oscar Paky stated that Comler was arrested by American forces on May 9th, 1945, the same day he supposedly killed himself. Other reports suggest he appeared at a US counter intelligence corps office in Gundan, Austria shortly after the war ended. One former OSS agent, Donald Richardson, claimed before his death that he supervised Comler in American custody until 1947. Did the Americans capture him, give him a new identity, use his knowledge? We know this happened with other Nazi scientists.</p>
<p>Operation Paperclip brought 1600 German scientists to America. Some had worked on chemical weapons, some on rockets. Warner von Braonn Comller&#x27;s subordinate and an SS officer himself became a hero at NASA. But Comler, no paper trail, no records, just contradictory stories and a mystery that persists 80 years later. The cover up.</p>
<p>January 1945. Soviet forces advancing from the east. According to the Bell narrative, the Nazis made a decision. The device cannot fall into enemy hands. Sporenberg allegedly claimed that 60 people, scientists, technicians, witnesses were executed by a special SS unit.</p>
<p>All killed to maintain secrecy. Buried in a mass grave never found. The bell was dismantled, evacuated, possibly by convoy, possibly by aircraft. The test facility was destroyed, tunnels collapsed, ceramic tiles smashed, documents burned. When Soviet forces captured Lower Slesia in May 1945, they found extensive damage.</p>
<p>If they discovered anything about exotic weapons projects, those files remain classified in Russian archives. But here&#x27;s the critical question. Why would the Nazis invest enormous resources in an unproven exotic technology when they desperately needed conventional weapons? By 1944, Germany needed tanks, planes, ammunition. not experimental physics projects with no clear military application unless they believed it would work. Unless they thought it could change everything or unless, and this is what skeptics believe, the bell never existed and were trying to rationalize a myth.</p>
<p>Where is it now? If the bell was real, what happened to it? Theory one, South America transported by submarine to Argentina or Paraguay, hidden in Nazi refugee communities that sheltered war criminals. Some claim it&#x27;s still there, buried in the jungle. Theory two, America captured it. Secret operation by US forces brought to America became the basis for classified aerospace projects maybe even connected to UFO sightings in the 1950s. There&#x27;s a famous incident Kexsburg, Pennsylvania, December 1965.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported a bellshaped object crashed in the woods. The military arrived, cordined off the area, removed something on a flatbed truck. Official explanation, a Soviet Venus probe. Bell believers, they think it was a test flight gone wrong. Theory three.</p>
<p>Still in Germany, buried in unexplored tunnels of the Rissa complex, sealed away, waiting. About 30% of the Wadar&#x27;s complex remains flooded and unexplored. Theory four, destroyed. The simplest explanation, the Nazis blew it up. nothing left but rumors and a legend born from chaos.</p>
<p>Theory five, it never existed. The entire story is a postwar myth, a fusion of real Nazi projects, classified documents that describe something entirely different. Cold War UFO paranoia and one journalist&#x27;s interpretation of documents no one else can verify the truth. Here&#x27;s what we know with absolute certainty. The Nazis built massive underground complexes in the Owl Mountains.</p>
<p>Fact. They conducted horrific experiments on concentration camp prisoners. Fact. They had brilliant scientists working on revolutionary weapons technology. Fact.</p>
<p>They destroyed evidence before Allied forces arrived. Fact. Hans Comler vanished under mysterious circumstances and his fate remains genuinely unclear. Fact. But the bell itself, no Nazi documents mention Belga or Exxurum 525 in millions of pages of captured records.</p>
<p>No photographs exist. No blueprints were ever found. The entire story rests on one man&#x27;s account of documents he claims to have seen but cannot prove existed. Yakob Sporinber was tried and executed for war crimes. His interrogation transcripts are real, but researchers who have accessed them find no mention of exotic devices.</p>
<p>Maybe the bell was real, a failed experiment, a conventional project that got mythologized. Maybe it was something else entirely, a code name for a different program that Whitoski misinterpreted. Or maybe, probably, it never existed at all. The henge still stands in Poland. Tourists visit it.</p>
<p>The tunnels are still there. Some flooded, some sealed, some open for exploration. And the story endures because humans love mysteries. We love the idea that there&#x27;s more to history than we&#x27;ve been told, that secret knowledge exists, that maybe, just maybe, the Nazis discovered something extraordinary that vanished into darkness. DLA.</p>
<p>Hitler&#x27;s final weapon or his final ghost story. The truth, if it exists, waits in sealed archives, forgotten tunnels, or nowhere at all. Real weapon or cold war legend. The evidence suggests legend, but the mystery, that&#x27;s real. Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>
<p>It was 12 ft high, shaped like a bell, and according to the legend, it didn&#x27;t just kill you, it turned you into black sludge. In the final days of the war, 60 scientists were allegedly executed in a single night just to keep it secret. This is the story of DLock, the Nazi bell. Some say it was an anti-gravity engine. Others say it was a time machine.</p>
<p>But the scariest part isn&#x27;t what it did. It&#x27;s that we can&#x27;t prove it ever existed.</p>
