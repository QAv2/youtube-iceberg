            <p>all right hello everyone out there good to see you um my name is Thomas and I do educational videos on this channel uh we are embarking on a survey of the reciprocal system of theory first um discovered by Dewey B Larson back in the early to mid 20th century and also um updated here in the 21st century by uh Dr Bruce perrett and Dr kvk nehru among others and um we were just doing a little bit of I uh biographical information on Dewey Larson hopefully we&#x27;ll wrap that up today and then I will move into one of his uh texts uh going over one of his texts here uh hopefully starting tomorrow so uh where we left off the other day was just that um Larson was basic basically got no play from the academic establishment and that might have been uh you know partially his fault uh as he well he appealed to the academic establishment um he saw that he you know uh he saw his audience as the physicist and chemists and astronomers out there um and uh space and time people uh and he tried to uh you know send his books to them and appeal to them and like I&#x27;ve said uh I think personally that those are the last people in the room that are gonna that would get it um the people that are most invested in the status quo are going to be the last people that come over uh to recognize the new uh the new material because they&#x27;re entrenched in their old ways they would be humiliated by having to say that I had everything wrong the whole time um you know their career would be jeopardized they&#x27;re standing in status in the community would be jeopardized and also their livelihood would be jeopardized so um I believe that the best audience for the reciprocal system our intelligence but un um you know intelligent adults who haven&#x27;t been indoctrinated by science classes too much and or um intelligent teenagers who haven&#x27;t even really started taking science classes and so and my experience of that is really just having you know I took those classes in high school all those classes and I took a few of them in college too but I I never was really indoctrinated by it you know I didn&#x27;t really take High School very seriously or college and so you know I might have taken those classes and I might have even gotten an a in in one of those classes or whatever but I didn&#x27;t learn anything you know I might have memorized something for the test or I conceptually I never really learned anything from those but then later on after studying nothing but Larson for years I went back and got my hands on uh textbooks from astronomy and physics and chemistry and I was able to Breeze through them understanding all the concepts and even being able to critique their their writing because of missing information or when they were too overconfident in their proclamations I was able to like kind of look over a c uh a higher Viewpoint of their textbooks after studying Larson so I didn&#x27;t really have any type of sight I was not coming with any type of scientific background into those books but I was able to Breeze through them with no problem because of my study of Larson and that&#x27;s because he uh is a very thorough a teacher in terms of you know giving you the background giving you the context uh you know and kind of explaining what the mainstream Legacy position is before he goes into what his alternative is so he gives you a safety net you know now it you know it gives you a safety net and you can say now it&#x27;s very easy to jettison your your prior Paradigm because there&#x27;s something to fall back at so anyway um I just want to go over a couple of Larson&#x27;s uh important books um during the 60s he wrote this book uh new light on space and time which was the first one that I read um you know and he just goes over the space and time kind of stuff he also wrote a couple books on economics during this period uh one is called the road to full employment and the other one is called the road to permanent prosperity um and so those are books that maybe you know we can read read them now and maybe they would help out a little bit but what I thought was important about uh those books and I can&#x27;t say that I fully understand them but what he&#x27;s really doing in um in the road to permanent Prosperity is he&#x27;s he&#x27;s comparing the economic system to like the physical system so where he breaks down the physical system into okay everything is made out of motion emotion is the relationship between space and time the economic system is also broken down into um you know there&#x27;s this economic system and there&#x27;s a you know motion of the economic system and those two that that Duality is in what he calls purchasing power and goods so this kind of the space and time substitutes for the economic system are purchasing power and goods and they work in a reciprocal manner um and so that&#x27;s that just kind of shows how the reciprocal system works that you&#x27;re you&#x27;re really trying to kind of find the analogs of space and time and to be able to plug them into whatever discipline you&#x27;re talking about like so for me I&#x27;m a historian you know history is usually regarded as being change over time um and so change itself is motion uh motion over time so that space over time or time over space and that then is all of that is then divided by time so I&#x27;m not exactly sure I haven&#x27;t really I&#x27;ve never tried to write the reciprocal system uh of history or reciprocal history um uh one over history uh or inverse history or anything like that um but that&#x27;s maybe how you would get started with that approach so uh Larson did contend that his books on economics were were very important uh more important than his scientific books um because that they were just more applicable to you know daily life but he also uh in the early 70s wrote a book called quasars and pulsars and that was important uh in that uh he uh he predicted uh the existence now I think he had written some articles on this beforehand um and so his predictions I think went back several years before uh he wrote these books uh the book quasars and pulsars but um he predicted the existence of quasars along with a number of their properties uh years before the mainstream scientists um uh came up with uh discovered quasars so he was this is an area where Larson was able to predict uh what was coming down the pipe uh coming down the pike in terms of um the Legacy science and so he predicted the existence of quasars long before or at least a few years before uh regular science and you know for him a quasar was basically an exploding Galaxy um similar to a pulsar which was a an exploding star um when the uh the explosion of a stellar explosion or Galactic explosion was what he said was really the only way that um a material being could actually um get beyond the speed of light uh through a powerful explosion and then by getting beyond the speed of light um you know a supernova isn&#x27;t like an explosion of a star if a star is exploding in time in space you know it blows up like this but if a star is exploding in time time is the inverse of space and so a star that&#x27;s exploding in time once it goes beyond the speed of light the explosion is no longer in space but it is in time and when some so when something explodes in time uh we don&#x27;t see time we only see space and so we you know we can say this this star is exploding in time but the way that we see that is by an implosion in space so we see the explosion in time as an implosion in space and that&#x27;s where you get the phenomena of white dwarf stars and also pulsars and also uh for in terms of galaxies um there&#x27;s um some kinds of compact galaxies as well as as well as quasars um that are all this whole family of of uh Stellar um entities as a result of exploding explosions in time as a result of explosions being powerful enough to get beyond the speed of light and so he was again just from theory he was able to predict the existence of quasars and pulsars um so that was a book that he came out with in the 70 early 70s uh in the 80s that&#x27;s when he was busy working on his most important books in my opinion but he also wrote a book at that point called the neglected facts of science which I think um you know he kind of it doesn&#x27;t really delve into the reciprocal system of theory but it looks at things that have already been discovered by science that really haven&#x27;t been um publicized to the point uh that he thinks that they should have been um and that goes to clarify a lot of his uh his reciprocal system okay then now what we&#x27;re going to be surveying in this course are his um his three books of the struct structure of the physical Universe nothing but motion 1979 uh basic properties of matter 1987 and universe of motion 1984. and though so those books are his structure of the physical universe and they&#x27;re on you know uh physics and physics pretty much and then chemistry and then astronomy then before that we&#x27;re going to look at the beyond space and time which was his last book published posthumously in 1995 and in that book he goes over all kinds of metaphysical um phenomena a lot of stuff from psychology and philosophy and religion but also um I guess psychology okay so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to go first but before we even get to that we&#x27;re going to look at one of his articles Larson wrote many important articles as well and you can all you can find all this stuff on the website which I&#x27;m not sure of the address right now but if you look up if you just look up Dewey B Larson collected works of Dewey B Larson or something like that you should be able to find it and all all of his stuff is on there for free but uh since you probably won&#x27;t do that we&#x27;re going to be kind of going through his articles or his books and we&#x27;re going to stay close to the text I&#x27;m probably gonna just read the text and if I have a comment to make I&#x27;ll make that comment outside of the text so it&#x27;ll probably be where you know if my eyes are looking down I&#x27;ll be in the text if if I&#x27;m looking at the camera or looking up then that&#x27;ll be my two cents on the um on the text um because I know sometimes uh I I hear a lot of times people um on the internet who are trying to go through a text or quoting somebody and then they they start uh expounding on the on the text and you can&#x27;t it&#x27;s sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell you know is this is this a quote or is this the person&#x27;s opinion so I&#x27;m going to try to make that distinction um but the so the first thing that we&#x27;re going to be going over hopefully starting tomorrow is Larson&#x27;s uh article that&#x27;s called the deductive development of uh the reciprocal system or maybe it&#x27;s the deductive development of the universe of motion one of those but it&#x27;s a I think I think 150 175 different um steps that he takes to get to go from nothing to this whole universe that he builds up so it shows his thinking one step at a time [Music] um to go from nothing to this full Universe of motion so it&#x27;ll probably take us a little while to get through that you know a couple weeks or at least a week um I doubt that I&#x27;ll be able to do more than you know 20 or 30 um steps in in a 20 or 25 minute video so we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna go through that it&#x27;ll give you an idea of kind of Larson&#x27;s thought process you&#x27;ll be able to follow his thought process and you&#x27;ll be able to see his method like okay this is how he he has derived the reciprocal system I don&#x27;t know exactly what the time period is on that article when he actually did that book we&#x27;ll figure that out and I think that so I think that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re headed here starting tomorrow is with um the deductive development of the reciprocal system and we&#x27;re going to go through that article it&#x27;s about 20 25 page article um and I&#x27;m going to just go with the text and then I&#x27;m going to make some parenthetical comments which hopefully I&#x27;ll try to keep to somewhat to a minimum at um and maybe I&#x27;ll stop at certain stopping points and then I&#x27;ll uh expound a little bit at that point okay so stay tuned for that now just uh just for some housekeeping uh if you&#x27;re uh have been watching in my tree of life videos and you want to get my free Guide to the uh 144 fractal faculties you can get that by leaving your name and email in the comment section you can also donate to me through cash app and venmo or you can also through that same system you can buy a copy of my book or either one of my books uh the first one is on Tree of Life an introduction to the Tree of Life called the mass tree and then also uh so 10 bucks will get you that 15 bucks uh minimum will get you a copy of my book on um a couple groups of really great uh far out there Jazz musicians in Chicago in the 50s and 60s uh that was my field of study for my PhD in history and uh super interesting stuff and I would turn you on to some really really great music as well okay so um thanks for tuning in today and uh come back to uh you know hear about uh how Dewey Larson went about putting together his reciprocal system in his own words uh when we go over the deductive development of the reciprocal system and um you know if you want to follow along you can find those articles if you you know look up the collected works of Dewey B Larson and uh otherwise have a great day we hope to see you soon</p>
