            <p>foreign [Music] [Music] we&#x27;re going back to 1945 in a case that should have been as well known as Roswell but is just now being fully revealed it shows the mystery and challenge in deconstructing the UFO story and we have a very special guest with us Jacques Valley and Paola Harris who have come together as a team and I have to say this for our audience shock you&#x27;re a bit like a unicorn everybody has heard of you but nobody ever gets to like nail you down in a seat and talk to you personally Powell has been with us and she&#x27;s the backbone of so many of the contacts that we have here at Gaia that are now coming out into the public eye you know what strikes me in in the current debate which is becoming more and more active and of course there may be a report from the government from the Navy about the current state of the phenomenon and the government reaction to it supposedly what strikes me is that all the attention everything you see on TV and so on is what is government going to reveal to us right now my you know my Approach isn&#x27;t that I think I don&#x27;t think you should wait for the government to tell you what&#x27;s going on I mean young neighbors have seen UFOs you know in this case I have a colleague who says well you know you&#x27;ve had some clearances along your way when you worked on you know space Pro projects and so on but you&#x27;ll never have the clearances it takes to know what&#x27;s really going on in a case like this you know and at in the Manhattan Project yeah and my response is I don&#x27;t need the clearances I I have the witnesses yes you know these two little kids who are there the government wasn&#x27;t there you know these two little kids were there on the spot when the thing crashed it actually didn&#x27;t crash it crash landed it was under power it didn&#x27;t break apart and the entire thing was recovered okay it&#x27;s an incredible so the more and and Paula had been researching this for oh well you&#x27;re in your 12th year or something by now five years before yeah yeah no I came in because I had been looking at other cases in New Mexico and uh Sirocco and a friend of mine knew one of the um of the witnesses who by then was in his late 70s and 80s and wanted to introduce me to him and then I discovered that Paula had already done research with that witness so we combined you know the the information we had yeah and then we went back to the site and that was the story yes and fella I mean Paula hears something she says I&#x27;m on my way she&#x27;s like Indiana Jones when it comes to it when there&#x27;s field research and people who are ready to talk or there&#x27;s evidence somewhere I have to get there you have to get there immediately even with this case Jack um what had happened is that I got to the six-year-old Remy Baca thank God I got to interview him in Washington because he passed away and and we needed to to get the two sides of the story Jacques red Remy&#x27;s book so he was able to get Remy&#x27;s but when he was doing the book he needed the other witness he needed the six-year-old we had the nine-year-old yes and I realized that you know seven years he&#x27;d become seven by the time this happened and what had happened is that we need both sides and even though they weren&#x27;t living in the same place field research and I&#x27;ve enjoyed doing it with with Jacques because we keep going down there I don&#x27;t enjoy the snakes and I don&#x27;t enjoy I don&#x27;t he likes Mexican food better than I do but because you&#x27;re hanging out in some with her and a lot of options when you&#x27;re out there in New Mexico desert desert High Desert and then we even went to Ground Zero because uh ironically I mean you might want to talk about the the impression we went to Ground Zero where the actual bomb was was exploded but we are going to talk about that yeah it it it does do something to you it does it&#x27;s it shows the background of what these little boys live through the when you reconstruct the history of what happened there the the first atomic bomb in the history of mankind history changed and that that entire area was a secret area and people were afraid they knew you that you don&#x27;t talk about what you see you don&#x27;t talk about what you&#x27;ve done even the people you know their their fathers their uncles were hired you know as Carpenters to work on on some of the structures that held the bomb yeah but you go home you don&#x27;t talk about and they never told the people that they were going to detonate this thing and what it could do to them physically which it did to them that&#x27;s right and it affected generations of them they were very heavy decisions that were made there that people regretted before regretted you know after after the the explosion but they just didn&#x27;t have the science they didn&#x27;t know how powerful the bomb was going to be the bomb turned out to be four times more powerful than all the calculations I had made they didn&#x27;t even know if a bomb would work many experts said this bomb will never work you can&#x27;t do it now it&#x27;s a month later the kids are out riding the fences because they&#x27;re cattle ranchers and they have binoculars with them because you got to be able to read the brands on the cattle along the fences so they might only be seven and nine years old but great powers of observation because that&#x27;s their job and they&#x27;ll get in trouble by their dad if they don&#x27;t do it right and they do the Terry they knew the territory and they were they were on the Halls back so they could quickly go to any place they also drove the truck because all the adults were like wow the window that&#x27;s all you need so that case is incredible because you know as opposed to Roswell as opposed to many other cases the the kids were there before the UFO came in yes okay they saw it come over their head and crash it it bumped into a communication Tower bent out of the tower it didn&#x27;t explode an airplane would have blown into pieces at that point the the craft kept its Integrity there was one panel that was ejected and they found the material later and they kept it that&#x27;s true they eventually for nine days yeah they were short and they could go in and they knew the brush they knew where they could hide they could watch everything and when they went home at the end of the day they would sneak down there and get stuff so I mean this is an amazing story okay let&#x27;s talk about when what they had to say about the experience of after it crashed there were a couple things going on they saw little funny looking occupants and I don&#x27;t remember the Spanish name for the cricket head they were explaining insects little men with kind of insecty looking heads well you know I had the privilege of working when I started you know reconstructing the story and doing working on the book of working from the transcripts that Paula had already done yes with the with both Witnesses including the one who had passed away what&#x27;s fascinated me was looking at every word and every comma you could you could see their emotions and you could see when when things changed sometimes they call them men sometimes they call them little men little men sometimes they talk about them as their as if they were insects all right they were so you know yes Paula tells how they they saw their faces because it was I think either the binoculars by the way from a couple hundred yards away let&#x27;s start by saying that there were no Flying Saucer magazines Kenneth Arnold hadn&#x27;t come out with that word yet there was no television there was no YouTube so these kids had there was no contact there was no context to what they were looking at and it was not a flying saucer it was an avocado shaped craft right and and so the when the little kids went up to see it and and they could see the beings that were floating back and forth well this is key what you just said they weren&#x27;t like walking they appeared to be kind of just and they heard the sounds I mean Jose in particular the older boy thought that they were in trouble that they had been hurt so his feelings they had and Jack was had mentioned the the psychic connection between because they watched them for over an hour with the binoculars so the site the connection they had and Jose&#x27;s wanting to go in and help them because they were hurt and they were making this high-pitched sound which is so unusual and then you know Remy being the the younger one it was started to cry but you couldn&#x27;t understand because it was a lot of smoke and and the Mesquite was all burning and he was scared and this this contact this emotion though thing when when I started reading about the emotion part yeah I I my mind flashed back to Clifford Stone when Clifford Stone was initially going on his investigations um for on behalf of the recovery the recovery um he said he would become over throughout his life overwhelmed with emotions of what these creatures that he saw they were able we&#x27;re trying to say yes we&#x27;re in trouble yeah we&#x27;re you know we&#x27;re in trouble and this is the same thing the boys were going away with this this feeling of empathy and sympathy and great emotion which we don&#x27;t hear in these yeah which is not done verbally it&#x27;s done from the context from these mortal pastors yeah and and and you know when you&#x27;re talking to little kids I mean because there&#x27;s so many different stories where little children like the African case and so forth have had contact with beings that the little kids aren&#x27;t making this up no they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re reliving it they they&#x27;re very honest and in the case of Jose maybe Jacques would like to uh talk about this he has a photographic memory he&#x27;ll tell you the day yes that this happened right he was an amazing witness yes well we we would come up and you can see that in in your transcripts you know when when did the when was the tower taken out you know and and he will go 45 48 54 and 86 it was taken out in 86. his mind goes like a computer you know it was a perfect job to be riding the rails and and looking at Brands and counting Counting cattle head some of it you know it&#x27;s almost unbelievable from where we stand of what what they did and then you have to remember we we ask you know they were talking about getting a souvenir okay that&#x27;s appropriate getting a souvenir and then they um I think it was Remy who explained to to Paola that in those days you know your father might not come back from the front right you might lose an uncle you might lose a relative you know so souvenirs for families were very important you would say things that reminded you of that person and so on this was you know the end of the war many people did not come back so that that&#x27;s why that&#x27;s why people say well how did that little boy go in and and you know which is Jose go in and borrow he&#x27;s saying I didn&#x27;t steal anything I didn&#x27;t it was well he has something what did he call it a crowbar he has a crowbar because he couldn&#x27;t pull it off the the bracket inside smooth curved walls yes it was on a plaque that had a a copper Circle and this piece was in the middle uh and we still don&#x27;t know I mean this is Jack&#x27;s job as a scientist to go into the piece but to pull it off he had to get a crowbar to pull it off and then the pin fell on the ground and he he took it and they went and they had to hide it because there was inventory taken and when that piece from the inside of the craft is missing the Army is not happy because we have to re-establish again that the Army did not come and take that away for what was it nine days so the boys knew where it was and had access his father knew where it was another one of the Town constables knew where it was so three people that&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s unique about out of the ten things yes that we&#x27;ve listed that are unique about this case in all of UFO history the you know three people who actually went into the craft yes the on the second day of the actually the third day the the father I mean the kids reported to them right away they still thought that it was probably Place some aircraft there are lots of aircraft that you know were damaged experimental stuff going on out there experimental things also so they um the the father and a policeman a state policeman yeah you know went inside together and then on the last day when the soldiers were not were relaxed because the thing was loaded on the truck ready to go back to you know uh to White Sands right they decided to go in uh Jose and Jose Padilla went in and looked for a souvenir yes like it no there isn&#x27;t this is not a production okay they walked into the craft absolutely okay so they went in so now we have this and it&#x27;s something where the local people knew you don&#x27;t tangle too much with the government don&#x27;t give them too much information they&#x27;re living their lives you&#x27;re trying to live yours so there&#x27;s another piece of this that I found just absolutely fascinating and kind of a fun uh fine way of phenomena and that was was it a cousin of theirs so the name of the souvenir souvenir in Spanish is Tesoro right yeah so they had that means treasure treasure they had their treasure their Tesoro that they&#x27;d hidden away and they&#x27;re wildly enough to know military were coming around asking questions they put it under the floorboard of a shed now it refreshed my memory there&#x27;s a cousin I think it was who was a shepherd and I think he was in that shed was he sleeping in that shed when three little and three little cousin it was a man they hired to take care of the cattle yeah when it was going to be sold okay so this man&#x27;s in there and there&#x27;s an employee he was it scared the bejesus album that these three little beings seemed to show up in his room they came through the wall and they racially he went to he was hired by the Baca yeah by the Baca family and he came over and he said I think I have to leave here because three little men came through my wall looking for the tazoro which presents a problem for Jacques and me because we both I think thought he didn&#x27;t know about you yeah but we thought it was a terrestrial the bracket we tend to believe that so if that&#x27;s the case and this we&#x27;re just putting it all out there if this is true if this is terrestrial peace and why uh is the testimony of the sheep herder saying that the beings are coming in looking for the Cesaro using their language telepath yes yeah we&#x27;ll let that more remain a mystery because that is a mystery if it&#x27;s belongs to the Army and we tended to believe that was the case then why did this testimony say this and he&#x27;s not making it okay I have an idea for you both maybe it was the he teased Tesoro that they&#x27;d picked up on a trip and hammered it into their own walls but you know sometimes I think it would be an interesting day in court if the government wanted to claim it because I have it now okay and we&#x27;re studying it with my my colleagues it&#x27;s not in my house but so don&#x27;t go looking for your address anybody we&#x27;re going to pass it out to different teams you know metallurgists space people and so on it looks like a perfectly ordinary piece of you know a bracket you might have in a in a rotating machine you know in on a farm or you know and except that it&#x27;s all in metric system you know who&#x27;s producing the metric system in New Mexico in 1945 okay and it doesn&#x27;t have a brand it&#x27;s something it&#x27;s pretty crude something that you might mold it in in college in the lab you know for particular experiments so you wouldn&#x27;t bother to put a brand on it you know so it looks like an industrial part but it it isn&#x27;t you know what was it doing inside a UFO so my theory and I&#x27;m you know we get into heated arguments in Silicon Valley because it hasn&#x27;t been settled as science quite yet maybe it&#x27;s still being examined well um you know my feeling is it looks like an ordinary bracket that you could you could get from Farm you know equipment so maybe the Army improvise you remember they are a long way from electricity normally from power right they may generate the power with you know on the Jeeps on the trucks and then use it to do whatever they need to do inside this the subject okay so they need power they bring a cable and you need something to wrap up the cable this would be perfect to wrap up a cable is on this copper plate inside is fixed to the wall and everything fit perfectly in metrics I mean well but that&#x27;s the only thing inside so it&#x27;s something that the Army could have improvised could have could could have done something well the engineers that&#x27;s your hypothesis now that was my initial working hypothesis because it looks it looks human it looks very crude it looks like an industrial part right it is very simple you get on eBay you know you can buy things like that and now Paula and you guys have been in heated arguments over this right because you know we tend to agree that it could be but then these things keep cropping up like the metric system and and the the beings coming out of the world looking for it and other things that are cropping up in the and so we have to keep changing our minds the Army came back nice right let&#x27;s talk about the other things that were found because the boys were very very resourceful and filled up a gunny sack full of what they call Angel Hair which becomes very interesting when the third witness later in years later so they get this translucent stuff that&#x27;s all lit up it&#x27;s all letters it shines at night it&#x27;s very pretty and the boys give it to people to put on Christmas trees and in their windows it&#x27;s cool for me that&#x27;s what you do when a UFO crashes in your backyard what do you do you think the angel hair and you put it on the Christmas tree of course you do what anybody would do I can see it I can see the move I can see a movie of this book and I guess it has to be amazed it starts with these kids you know decorating a Christmas tree with fiber optics right you know thinking because they don&#x27;t know oh I&#x27;ve got the other scene then you have the cousin testifying later saying yeah we used to play and I it bit me it hurt my hand and bit me we should we should stop on on the cousin because we were ready to publish the book yeah you know we announced it on the internet and so on and then Paola found Sabrina yes and Sabrina comes in you know at right angle to every every other she&#x27;s very several years later she&#x27;s a seven-year-old right she you know is essentially you know comes to live with the family because that&#x27;s the only family she has at that point and she is there with her her eyes of your young child discovering all this and she&#x27;s the one who you know tells that story but she was saying she used to play with this foil which was very thin and very very light like a feather no weight and she would scrunch it up in her hand and she thought it was trick foil it was a joke foil because when she&#x27;d open her hand it would pop back out and be smooth again right yes let&#x27;s talk about that that would be called Memory Metal today yes something like that right and it was speculated of course it showed up at Roswell yeah later two years later and so the argument could be said that you know people were researching that kind of that kind of thing um but tell Memorial Institute in Ohio was a leader in meteorology and they were researching that kind of medal for uh Aerospace applications Aviation and later for space was it thought that it was molten because there was high heat that it might have been in the molten State initially and settled into this veneer no I I was did it come I think what happened and this is amazing because Jose did not know that that there were long strips of this metal because all they found was a little square that they they they fixed the uh the windmill way so Jose didn&#x27;t know the testimony of Sabrina well he was shocked because that means the father went back there and he he went and got some stuff that he never told his son about so the father who&#x27;s riding the horse could found these chips of metal never told the Sun never told Jose but then Jose had left for the Korean War at the age of 17. so Sabrina is playing with other materials that the father went back to get and I don&#x27;t know if you noticed but she kept telling us that the soldiers kept coming back to their farmhouse in the back door that&#x27;s important to point out the armies happen on their land yes the military had to get permission to build a road and gate on their land to come retrieve this thing you know one thing I learned along the way talking to the right people is that most reverse engineering doesn&#x27;t work they do 80 that&#x27;s why I asked you that earlier we can&#x27;t figure out what that is that the the Russians did all the Chinese did you get a piece of something that fell from the sky yeah and you find you find some Gadget inside you don&#x27;t know what that thing does and maybe it&#x27;s intended that way maybe it was not it was done in such a way that there was no way at this point in our history until we get a little smarter wiser and more collaborative to have it engineered so I can live with that mystery and I want to thank you both this has been just delightful I&#x27;ve so been looking forward to it and I so loved the book I was reading it like a novel right I&#x27;m not sure you did your your homework your questions were right on why thank you thank you and and I hope to see you both again in the studio one day as is appropriate thank you thank you thanks again the book is titled Trinity the best kept secret which you can find through all the normal booksellers it&#x27;s a fascinating beautifully written reflective study of where we are as a species in our connection with the UFO and ET phenomena until next time thank you for joining us here on open minds thank you [Music] common people around the world are doing The Uncommon it is literally the Netflix of spirituality [Music] [Applause]
