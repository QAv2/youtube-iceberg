            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>oh hello good afternoon everybody today I&#x27;m going to make a new video and this video it will be about why to build wind turbine or free energy generator instead of buying one in the store yeah yeah many people are calling me and sending me emails that they just want to buy the finished product on the finished wind turbine or generator and I sell them no I sell only documentation I built the prototype and test it and it works and I just sell documentation but again I encourage you that you build yourself one you want you know and why why would that be wise yeah because actually if you build one you will actually learn something now you will learn how electricity works how electricity is produced in real life how three-phase system works yeah and you will see how how actually current is is flowing through the to the conductor&#x27;s yeah to actually get the electrical current with the magnets yeah this is a simple simple way and today i will show you many people are asking me how much these turbine costs when i said ok 500 bucks you will get it from if you have some materials you by magnets you will get it for 500 bucks you will build it at home and then i will compare on the internet if you if you go to internet and you start searching the turbines vertical axis wind turbine with one kilowatts of rated power you will get very very lot of results and they are built from many producers and then you have lots of chinese stuff which is cheap not even so much cheap i did i expect it to be but ok you will see ok this is phase two go to page alibaba com and there shoot the vertical winter generator in search and you will get many many turbines yeah with the columns the complete sets just plug and play and you buy inverter and you have the current but you will see it&#x27;s very colorful and the prices are very different but you can see let&#x27;s say first result from from some unknown brand name to me from 300 Watts 23 kilowatts it price goes from 1,000 to $1,500 for set plus some delivery if you if you count that because it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a lot of it&#x27;s a half done you know if you see here of materials you will actually buy it for two two hot two thousand yeah and yeah I would not recommend maybe chinese stuff it works I&#x27;m sure but but it will not be the best solution or it will not last long yeah but if I opens one more it&#x27;s like 500 watts for 982 dollars some of them are are are selling complete sets with the column some of them are sending only generator and wings and you will see you can find it but if you go to to some yeah it&#x27;s some good producer of wind turbines like at a city ATC green or or semen sore vestas or something like that you&#x27;ll you will find their real rate attend and the serious generators yeah this is like with vertical axis generator with saviano&#x27;s fing cell rate it at 1 kilowatt and they have everything documented that the charts and and when you see this charge you actually see that evenly the the best possible I&#x27;ll turbines here the rated power is somewhere around the 15 meters per second wind speed yeah this is like 50 km/h this is a it&#x27;s a very high spin yeah but if you then go to some normal speed average speed in your in your let&#x27;s say place which is from from 3 to 25 meters per second on the yearly basis you will get 100 watts in average and this is real oh so I can tell you all now that you you can forget to expect some some serious power in the wind speed 0 of 5 meters per second or less yeah because all the true binds are rated for wind speeds above 10 meters per second yeah they have rated power at that speed and you have something known as some statistics here how to how much they have heavy and stuff yeah so so this is like I i&#x27;m not sure but I&#x27;m pretty sure that this turbine costs around 23 thousand dollars yeah and I don&#x27;t know if in this set it&#x27;s even the column now but yeah this can be expected like from two to three thousand dollars and it samsung turbine which will last for years costs and it will pay off maybe in the end that time yeah but the purpose of this video is actually to build through buying instead of buying one yeah because you will actually learn something else this is the idea of my my spreading this video and this knowledge to actually learn something many people are doubtful about my documentation they actually x asks for it yeah the but they are suspicious to buy it because they believe I will cheat them that I will just take them this miserable two dollars yeah and that I will not send them actually and it it doesn&#x27;t exist yeah documentation exists i will show you now this is the PDF file i&#x27;m selling it secured this is the home page and this is now the content page which you have in the below in description of my video and now is introduction and then some images and and it&#x27;s stuff stuff i explaining detail now i will not show the whole project because i will not sell then anyone anyone more yeah but documentation exists is 30 pages PDF file with all the all the descriptions I made at home yeah to be to be to be understandable to the average user yeah and not just the the USA and the english-speaking audience because I&#x27;m actually it&#x27;s for the complete world and that&#x27;s why everything is simple and maybe it has some mistakes but I apologize and I&#x27;m not from I&#x27;m from Croatia not from united states but it doesn&#x27;t matter now you will understand what i wanted to say if i go back to image this is the finished product actually it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a pretty pretty sight when it&#x27;s finished a weight&#x27;s it&#x27;s like some huh yeah it looks good yeah when you and you actually put it and you know that you build it yourself now with these sewage pipes which is funny but they are very convenient for that yeah and you build some column then and ensure that this does not fall and it works really fine I can assure you well it works fine and again I encourage you all that you build your own generator with my project following my project because you will really learn something yeah you learn how how is how is energy produced in the big systems and I i know i i&#x27;ve been in some factories in in Siemens Factory for example they built to 224 megawatts you know generator and they cost enormous money a few millions of dollars per piece but they produce some real power but it is the same principle well this is this one here and this one for 42 million dollars the principle is really seen any and when you build this one here you will know how big one works yeah they have some securing mechanism that damage these turbines and that they can slow down the wings and then and stop them and remotely control them and everything but but if you build a simple one you no how actually big one works huh and this is the idea idea is to get some knowledge and and one more thing yeah yeah people are are writing some comments about using the term free energy generator yeah it&#x27;s actually a wind turbine yeah everybody knows that when they see the end of the video well but I just use it because I wanted the tissue this video will be seen by as many people as it can be huh as it can be because very few people are searching vertical turbines and and most of the people are searching free energy and they will ya they will not find easily some actually self-powering or prepared perpetuum mobile devices maybe they exist I didn&#x27;t see one working in the real life now but I&#x27;m doubting that but everything is possible to say huh but this is like yeah it&#x27;s not the free energy generator you have to invest some money to to get free energy but you will get free energy and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called free energy generator now and this is it if you have any questions leave comments I will gladly respond to them and giving ever having any more questions regarding project don&#x27;t be suspicious I did not cheat people I send them what I did it&#x27;s it&#x27;s even impossibly it&#x27;s it&#x27;s too cheap I think he&#x27;ll but ok i&#x27;m not i just want that actually sell at least one yeah if you have any questions contact me on my email on my video and you will get answer thank you very much bye bye</p>
