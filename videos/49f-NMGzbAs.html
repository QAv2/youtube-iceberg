            <p>tonight on kitchen nightmare hans and Fritz  own a wonder weapon Factory in Poland however   they have yet to turn out the tide of war and with  no Engineers or scientists working at the wonder   weapon Factory the chance of making something  useful are very slim will Gordon Ramsey manag   to turn this around and will hunts and Fritz  manage to make some dumb [ __ ] weapon on time   that and more tonight on the History Channel if </p>
<p>you are anything like me you like history just   a bit more than the average person and when you  are talking with somebody about military history   of the 20th century you might forget that not  everyone is as enthusiastic about tanks planes   boats and all the other things that we like to  talk about with conversations often ending in   this so yeah the header was only Built because the  factory that was making the stooks was destroyed   oh and fun fact the only reason why they didn&#x27;t </p>
<p>continue building more stooks was because the new   Factory didn&#x27;t had a crane that could lift the  heavy chassis of the SC so instead they decided   I mean it&#x27;s very interesting yeah yeah I mean  that that that does sound very interesting uh so um have you ever heard of [Music] DL DL where to even begin with this piece of  [ __ ] I think I&#x27;ll do the least YouTuber thing   possible and start start with what most other  videos end with this thing probably didn&#x27;t   exist now forget it this thing for sure didn&#x27;t </p>
<p>exist okay so when I research subjects for these   videos I usually start with Wikipedia but I  never rely or trust Wikipedia 100% I use it   as a starting point and then I Tred to find some  books or some articles checking the information   however I&#x27;m going to believe Wikipedia 100% on  this one because I really like the title that   Wikipedia is using the look conspiracy theory  so yeah as you might have noticed already   I hate the GL it wasn&#x27;t always like that I </p>
<p>went from being fascinated by it to being   mildly interested in it to not being interested  at all being slightly annoyed when I heard about   it and now just hating it I remember the first  time that I heared about the Glo I must have   been like 12 or 13 it was at the summer  camp and some Camp leader told us about   German secret weapons like the V2 rocket and  the Gluk and according to him this thing shot lasers which sound [ __ ] awesome I mean when </p>
<p>you&#x27;re 12 that just sounds like the coolest   thing ever I did try to look it up online but  doesn&#x27;t seem like anyone is saying that it shot   any lasers so I don&#x27;t know where he got that  information from but uh who knows maybe he had   some insight information also I&#x27;m going to call  the Bell from now on so if the Bell didn&#x27;t shoot   lasers what could this wonder weapon do and how  did it work well get ready and put on your tin   foil hat because this [ __ ] doesn&#x27;t make any </p>
<p>sense the Bell was a bell-shaped device it was   about 4 M high or 12 ft high and 3 m wide 9 ft  wide and depending on which schizophrenic you   ask it could be anything it could be an  anti-gravitational device a time machine   wherein the mustache man escapes to the year 3000  a flying saucer in which the mustache man escaped   to the Moon a teleportation machine a perpetual  motion machine generating endless energy or a   machine that could melt bones oh and it also </p>
<p>admitted a bright light made people who came   close to it sick and made plants that were close  to it grow faster now this wonder weapon worked   by having two highspeed rotating cylinders  filled with Mercury or filled with a purple   metallic looking liquid which was supposedly  highly radioactive and had the code name serum   525 and if you are wondering what serum 525 is  well serum 525 was closely related to [ __ ]   the Bell was made with alien technology and </p>
<p>because the Bell was such a highly secretive   weapon the scientists and technicians that were  working on this device and who did not die of its   effect were wiped out by the SS in the closing  days of the war the device was then moved to an   unknown location but we do kind of know where this  unknown location is you see the Bell was moved   with a train full of gold somewhere in Poland an  SS officer later traded this information and the   technology with the United States in exchange </p>
<p>for his freedom so that&#x27;s how we know all of   this okay so that was a lot of nonsense to take  in and I don&#x27;t blame you if your brain decided   to shut off and start playing images of subway  server to cope with the stupid [ __ ] that I was   telling you so here comes a serious question who  is to blame for this nonsense well we have a few   people to blame for this the first one that  we can be disappointed at is Nick cook cook   is a journalist with expertise in Aros face he </p>
<p>wrote a book called The Hunt for zero point in   his book he talks about how the United States in  secret has anti-gravitational technology now cook   used a Polish book as a reference now excuse my  polish but I think it&#x27;s pronounced pra PR proud W weapon which would translate to something like  the truth about Wonder Weapons written by eigor   wowski now eigor is just a straight  up conspiracy theorist again my poish   is not that good but just looking at these </p>
<p>covers you know what you&#x27;re getting into he&#x27;s   also a lying piece of [ __ ] he claimed in his  book that he found evidence of the Bell while   researching World War II era polish government  documents that had recently been Declassified   this led him to further investigate and Research  into the subject but little eagor is lying right   here he used instead a French book of the 1960s  as a source of his fantasy story about Bell this   book was called the morning of The Magicians and </p>
<p>as the author is disclaimed in the introduction   of this book the book is intended to challenge  the readers viewpoint on historical events   whether they believe the explanations or not but  the goal is to give the reader the opportunity   to test their level of cognitive dissidence  and critical thinking skills and yeah this is   the book that first mentions the Bell but more  as an object of Science Fiction and not as a   historical event so why why why why are people </p>
<p>talking about the Bell like it&#x27;s a real thing   so let let me just get this straight that we&#x27;re  all on the same line here we have a journalist   that uses a book of a conspiracy theorist as  a source this conspiracy theorist also uses a   book as a source which is basically a fantasy  book and because of these two idiots we now   have documentaries about this thing unsealed case  File dig Loa oh that&#x27;s real [Music] nice we have a   ton of YouTube videos about this thing we have </p>
<p>articles written in magazines on internet about   this stupid thing that the normies will read and  will think that it&#x27;s based on history and not just   some fantasy and don&#x27;t try to hide it History  Channel just because you deleted the videos   doesn&#x27;t mean that it never happened I remember  those videos now to be completely honest Nick Cook   and Little eager are not completely to blame these  two clowns didn&#x27;t come up with all the nonsense   that you hear about the bell in their book books </p>
<p>they do say that it could be a time machine an   anti-gravitational machine or a flying saucer and  they also came up with the nonsense of the serum   525 all the other add-ons the little nonsense and  [ __ ] yeah that&#x27;s just other conspiracy theorist   building on to this [ __ ] and it&#x27;s just really  easy to just prove that this thing never existed   I mean if the Americans really did get all of  that information from that SS officer then why   don&#x27;t we have flying saucers right now if it was </p>
<p>a time traveling machine why did nobody show up   to Steven Hawkings time traveling party and for  anyone that is unaware of to this Steven Hawking   in 2009 organized a party for Time Travelers  but he only gave the invitations after the   party happened so yeah the Bell is probably also  another time traveling machine the same with the   serum 525 we know almost everything about the  second world war at this moment why is there   no mention of anything on the internet about this </p>
<p>serum well because it&#x27;s fake it never happened if   something like this was real we would have seen  at this moment in Ukraine Bells siiz drones or   the us having bell-shaped bombers and I could  continue on like for example the structure that   it&#x27;s supposedly tested on turned out to just be  an industrial water cooling tower but let me just   get back to the point that I wanted to make for  this video now I&#x27;m pretty sure that most of the   people who are subscribed to this Channel and who </p>
<p>watch my videos already knew before even clicking   on this video that this story was nonsense and  even for the people that clicked on this video   out of curiosity I&#x27;m pretty sure that most of you  you knew that this story was fake in the back of   your head but there are still a lot of people that  think that this is a real historical event and to   be honest I I don&#x27;t even blame you I don&#x27;t think  that you&#x27;re stupid if you believed in this because   you just fall for a lie and to be honest I also </p>
<p>fall for the lie and why wouldn&#x27;t I the History   Channel had documentaries about this thing there  were magazines that had articles about this thing   there&#x27;s big YouTubers making videos about this  thing it would leak you to believe that there&#x27;s at   least some form of Truth in there and I think that  that is the thing that I hate the most about the   Bell the last 10 years we slowly moved away from  the Weir Bo World War II fantasy that Germany just   was the best in everything the best generals the </p>
<p>best tactics the best tanks the best technology   we slowly moved away from that but having the myth  floating around of this German piece of technology   that we don&#x27;t understand till this very day plays  perfectly into the superiority that these were   Boos want you to believe and again don&#x27;t take me  wrong wrong the Germans made some impressive stuff   like the V2 night vision equipment and some of  the tanks but for example the Americans made the   atomic bomb and the b29 weapons that seem more </p>
<p>at home in the 1960s than in the 1940s and we   don&#x27;t say that those weapons were created using  alien technology meanwhile people look at the   hor in 229 and think aliens even though we have  this plane the aidl which existed in the 1920s   in Britain like what do you think did you think  that the British all of a sudden decided to share   SC their alien technology with Germany and the B  was just that technology that we don&#x27;t understand   because the Germans during World War II were just </p>
<p>so good no it clearly isn&#x27;t it&#x27;s just a conspiracy   theory that I really wish would just die thank  you for watching till the end uh this time was a   little bit more of an opinionated video I hope you  liked it if you want to see something a little bit   more historical XR then go check out this video  of the T28 it&#x27;s a only super heavy tank build   Americans and if you want to see more videos  like this then subscribe see you next time bye</p>
