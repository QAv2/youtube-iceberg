            <p>hello earth it has been some time since I posted my last video but I am working on one project one big project and you will see soon what is that but let&#x27;s get back to my turbine now so many viewers and and many people who are interested in this project are sending me emails about how much does it cost yeah it really depends so how much cost you to build this turbines will depends on their how many tools you have at home and how much excess material from the spare materials you have in your garage and at the end it will cost you about five to six hundred dollars to build this turbine and what is the most expensive part the most expensive part are the neodymium magnets they cost about $200 but if you have to import them from the USA to let&#x27;s say to Africa or to Europe it will cost you additional about fifty to hundred dollars for the customs and this is this is really the most important the most expensive part but everything else you have inside my project documentation that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m selling it for two dollars you have the Bill of material is and now I say it will cost you five to six dollars what&#x27;s inside what do you need and we can go a little bit closer now that I explain you what what tools you need to build it and what material you need to finish it so this is okay so this is the turbine yeah and you you can see these are the weight this is the standard sewage pipe red sewage pipes they are very strong and they cost that much unit just so to split them in half then what you need else you need some kind of steel material really it&#x27;s not important which one for which I used for the for the support pillar anything you have or if you don&#x27;t have you can buy it the garbage and it will do fine just fine then you need some you need some pipes the pipes are not too expensive for this wind support and you need and you need these steel plates which are used for the rotor you have to so for this you need the laughing machine and if you don&#x27;t have it at home you need to go to somebody somebody who can make this for you I think I paid it 20 bucks so this is not expensive steel plate and somebody needs to cut it here for you and also this part over here where is the let&#x27;s say mechanism from the car mechanism from the car and this is this should be a little bit fixed on the last machine you will see when you when you get this shaft from the car if you if you will use that configuration and this is everything yes it&#x27;s really nuts not too much you need some screws bigger screws you need the you know this material is how it&#x27;s called yeah which is not non-magnetic the stainless steel sorry stainless stainless stainless steel and and this is it you really don&#x27;t need to too many too many materials to build this turbine if you everything what you have at home can be used and you need to of course you need a drilling machine you need them lastly machine you don&#x27;t have that but you have to pay that somebody that for you and you need the drill and you need to really just just have the garage and most of the people have the tools at home and people who are working something they have also the access material which they don&#x27;t throw in the garbage they put it somewhere in the corner I don&#x27;t know and they can use it afterwards for what I need so if you don&#x27;t have any tools and if you have if you don&#x27;t have any excess material yeah then you&#x27;re screwed you need to buy further tools that you can this machine but uh if you have the tools then it really cost you about five to six hundred dollars and this is so this is this is what I say yeah it&#x27;s not too expensive it&#x27;s really a do-it-yourself project and you will learn something when you do that and I intentionally I don&#x27;t want to give the bill of material list for free because I&#x27;m selling the documentation with little images and everything how to construct this turbine and how to assemble it and you don&#x27;t have to think too much and and this is related so I hope I helped you and soon I will be posting my next video which is yeah which lasting a long time but it&#x27;s a little bit different it&#x27;s not about the free energy but you will see what what it&#x27;s all about and I hope you like it so thanks for watching bye bye</p>
