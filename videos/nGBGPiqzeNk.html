            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I came across another one of these free  energy spring engine type videos and I   look for how the video was manipulated  to make it look like it works and I can&#x27;t   figure it out so I thought why don&#x27;t I just  build one like that and see how it works. I&#x27;ll start with some coat hanger </p>
<p>wire to try to make it a crankshaft   it&#x27;s tricky to make that crank small and  accurate enough but it worked out okay. And in the video I saw the flywheel was  this big ball bearing I don&#x27;t have one   like that so I&#x27;m just going to make  that out of a block of heavy hardwood And trying to make the edges </p>
<p>all smooth on the belt sander But then I put on my metal lathe  to make it perfectly round and I   also milled the sides to look  a bit more like a ball bearing And then drilling some holes in the  sides to make it look more like a ball   bearing which it turns out is actually  quite important to make this thing work And trying to flywheel on the crankshaft i </p>
<p>still have to bend that crankshaft a little   bit to adjust and I&#x27;m just running the coat  hanger wire straight in holes in blocks of wood I don&#x27;t have any small ball  bearings like that kicking   around i guess that spins true enough now and Now I&#x27;m attaching the springs although  if I wanted to make this like one of the   typical Spring Engine videos I shouldn&#x27;t  be narrating it cause they&#x27;re mostly made   in Spanish-sp speaking countries but </p>
<p>targeting English-speaking countries And let&#x27;s give it a spin holy crap it It works holy crap i got to try to make  some electricity with this thing Got a little generator with an  LED on it and now let&#x27;s add a belt Wow that&#x27;s lighting up pretty good  and this video is not manipulated   in any way seriously straight off the camera So I got to come clean with  how this machine actually works   let me rewind so I got to come clean...</p>
<p>And you know how I hinted that the look of this   flywheel is actually kind of  important let me show you why So while recording this at some point  I had to step on this thing here that   turns on this blower and it comes down here and  that was just out of frame. That&#x27;s wrong way...</p>
<p>And that part of the machine should be good and if  I blow the air just at the outside of the flywheel   that doesn&#x27;t grab it enough so this texture on  here is really important and the other video with   the ball bearing also wasn&#x27;t smooth here because  he&#x27;s got the balls in there and of course what&#x27;s   also really important is that it runs fairly  well on its own for quite a while so if I take   the belt off these springs are the softest springs </p>
<p>I had they&#x27;re really thin wire but they&#x27;re large   enough diameter so they look like they might be  doing something so like this it runs for quite a while now while I was building it I showed  spinning it up and it spun down fairly quickly   that&#x27;s because I jammed the sliver of wood  inside the bearings deliberately to make it   slow down more quickly otherwise if you could  see it spins so long on its own that would be   rather unconvincing wouldn&#x27;t it and this nozzle </p>
<p>originally was just like this but I found I&#x27;d   see too much of a shadow from it like that so  I had to extend it a little bit so that uh the   shadow is less noticeable i also changed the  lighting so I put a bright lamp here and I used   to have a lamp right here turned that off so that  there&#x27;d be less of a shadow in frame like this   you don&#x27;t really notice that there&#x27;s any shadow  from this thing whereas if it was up close like   this and the light behind it then the shadows </p>
<p>become noticeable and it would have been easier   to just use an air compressor for this but my  air compressor doesn&#x27;t have a big enough tank   to sustain volume like that so just using this  blower worked out okay and not quite as loud   of course it&#x27;s still way too loud and even the air  whistling out of the jet would have been too noisy   so I had to dub over different audio for when  the engine was running and that was just done   by recording a closeup and spinning the engine up </p>
<p>by hand and I had to splice a whole lot of clips   of that together because the engine doesn&#x27;t run  for that long so I was being totally honest when   I said the video wasn&#x27;t manipulated early the  audio of course was but I didn&#x27;t say anything   about the audio and the whole thing started with  somebody challenging me to debunk this free energy   video and I had a look at it very carefully and I  just could not find the place where the video was   manipulated so I figured it must be powered by </p>
<p>something but when you look at the construction   of this video the tools the guy&#x27;s got at his  disposal he&#x27;s not going to be able to uh fit   a little motor inside the hub there or something  like that so it had to be something else and then   I realized it&#x27;s got to be air blown at the thing  but the only direct tell of that is right here in   the video see that dust flicking around back  and forth that&#x27;s from wind because of course   he needs some wind to spin up the flywheel and </p>
<p>using that big ball bearing for a flywheel keeps   it going even if it&#x27;s not directly in the wind for  a few seconds so that helps a lot uh my hardwood   flywheel doesn&#x27;t have quite as much inertia  but it&#x27;s a little bit bigger so it helps too   and I also mentioned these videos seem to mostly  be coming from Spanish-sp speakaking countries   like South America or the Philippines and why is  that well um the currency is a lot lower for those   countries and if you can make a video that does </p>
<p>well in North America you&#x27;re going to do fairly   well with AdSense money and that is probably very  competitive with other earnings opportunities   in places like the Philippines this video for  instance which I debunked earlier on my other   channel I&#x27;m pretty sure is from the Philippines  and funny enough by now my video debunking this   spring engine has got more views than his video on  spring engines has done quite well on AdSense so I   can understand why these people keep making these </p>
<p>videos and this guy has now made a video in fact   this video right here debunking all these other  spring engines and I&#x27;m like &quot;Oh he&#x27;s finally come   clean.&quot; But no first he says &quot;Oh these don&#x27;t  work.&quot; And then he&#x27;s explaining &quot;Well mine is   different and this is why mine works.&quot; Yeah right  um I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother debunking his debunk   video because if you watch my video explaining how  he&#x27;s done the video and watch this one carefully   works the same way basically video cuts and </p>
<p>compositing that&#x27;s how he tricked this one   i quite liked this one in that it was done without  video trickery like seriously no video trickery   it&#x27;s just the nozzle is just slightly offcreen  so it&#x27;s simple it actually runs the only thing   the guy had to do is fake the sound and if you  look at like when he first starts it that sound   doesn&#x27;t make sense for what&#x27;s happening on the  screen but you know as a video creator I actually   feel a certain sense of camaraderie with these </p>
<p>guys um and that they&#x27;re just trying to make a   buck and trying to make videos uh it&#x27;s too bad  it&#x27;s about pedaling something that&#x27;s dishonest   that part I don&#x27;t like so much but I&#x27;m like  you know if I can cash in on this free energy   thing and debunk them at the same time I was like  I&#x27;ll definitely do that and debunking that other   uh free energy spring engine that&#x27;s worked  out well for me so far and looking at what   I&#x27;ve got so far I&#x27;m just past the 8 minute mark </p>
<p>and that&#x27;s important because if you&#x27;re over 8   minutes you get to have mineral ads in your video  and that means it earns more and all those free   energy videos over eight minutes every single  one of them because it&#x27;s about the ad money</p>
