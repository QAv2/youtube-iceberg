            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel and uh this is an educational Channel we try to look at important theories of everything at least important to me and they&#x27;ve been important to my life and I&#x27;m hoping that they&#x27;ll be important to yours if you can get into it um so just give it a try uh we look at uh you know different uh all-encompassing views and um Magnum opuses from obscure crackpots and um today is our 366 video on the reciprocal system of theory from one Dewey Bernard Larson and Mr Larson was an engineer that worked in America in out west in Portland primarily in the 20th century and um he was born in 1898 died in 1990 about uh 1930 he started having his first epiphanies about the reciprocal system took him about 25 30 years to develop his ideas put out his two fundamental postulates in 1959 and then from those postulates he derived through a process of deduction a theoretical Universe about you know what would Mr larsson&#x27;s what would this reciprocal system Universe look like if his postulates are correct what what would be the you know uh ramifications of that and then uh in his books which he wrote many books uh starting in 1959 all the way up until his death and even one book came out posthumously um um he more or less compared his findings his theoretical findings with the empirical findings of the Legacy scientist uh particularly you know the measurements that they made in their Laboratories uh and different findings that they&#x27; made of also some theoretical stuff um and so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s interesting to to find how arson was able to in many cases come up with the exact same um you know you read the scientific tables about say something having to do with the periodic table you know the uh melting point of of um different elements and Larson is able to basically reproduce the tables strictly from Theory not from uh measuring it in a lab and uh in many cases when he he has a dispute when he he comes up with an answer that they didn&#x27;t come up with he is able to demonstrate how his answer is correct uh so uh or at least why there is this discrepancy now the basic idea behind the reciprocal system again is articulated in his two fundamental postulates the first of the two postulates is much more important and fundamental and that is that we live in a uh universe that is composed entirely of one component which is motion and motion exists in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so that&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s the basic U First postulate second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and is its geometry is ukian the second postulate has been contested by some of lar larsson&#x27;s followers including Dr Bruce pet uh who prefers to use use uh his postulate uh Dr Bruce pet came up with what he calls rs2 the reevaluation of the reciprocal system which is basically a um an attempt to be in the spirit of the reciprocal system but to change a tweak a few of the um things that uh maybe Larson didn&#x27;t know about or things that maybe need to be updated LaRon certainly knew about nonukan geometries but he I don&#x27;t think he was really up on it and um he he&#x27;s been quoted as as really saying that well yeah I could use these nonukan geometries but it would introduce things that are even more complicated and it would just complicate the whole situation uh but it appears as if Dr pet uh by using projective geometry rather than ukian geometry and by using non-commutative mathematics and non primary magnitudes uh was able to actually simplify the system like quite a bit not so much in the Physical Realm but in the metaphysical realm uh some some of Larson&#x27;s postulate Larson&#x27;s first two postulates don&#x27;t really apply to the metaphysical realm and Larson had to propose four new postulates for the metaphysical realm the you know things having to do with beyond the physical the mental and the ethical um the religious um he had to come up with four new postulates but by when Dr BR is able to change that second fundamental physical postulate he no longer needs those four um metaphysical postulates so that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s kind of a story for a later time or we&#x27;ve already kind of told that story a little bit uh in past episode maybe a month ago or something but um what we really want to focus on is that first postulate the universe is made out of motion motion is the the relationship between space and time that basically creates a reciprocal relationship between space and time and that basically means that Spa uh motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator and um all forms of your scientific quantities you know whether it&#x27;s uh speed or energy or mass or acceleration or force or capacitance or uh electric charge or magnetic flux or viscosity or fluidity or pressure these are all fractions with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator with uh either one of them being potentially in multi multiple Dimensions uh as lson says the universe is made out of motion motion uh exists in three dimensions now um one thing that I have trouble with in that first postulate is that he talks about how what we&#x27;re talking about is motion but in Larson&#x27;s formulation I wish he would have used and I&#x27;m sure there was a good reason why he didn&#x27;t but I haven&#x27;t quite seen it yet uh actually when he first came out with his postulates this is another important point is that Larson revised his postulate several times over those last 30 years of his life and so it&#x27;s difficult to quote the postulates because you&#x27;re you need to specify which time period you&#x27;re talking about when lson first proposed the postulates he didn&#x27;t call it motion he called it SpaceTime and then toward the end of his life he began to think of it more in terms of change in three dimensions so um but um I just wish he would have used an adjective with motion uh that would be scalar motion or Progressive motion or uh um non-local motion uh because he&#x27;s not really referring to motion the way that most scientists might think about it in terms of velocity that is a motion that has a direction uh he&#x27;s thinking about it as a scalar motion which is a motion that has no direction or no specific Direction has a magnitude but no direction and um you uh Envision this using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other all the locations in fact are moving away from each other not just the dots but every every location on that surface of the balloon is moving away from every other every other location of that surface the further away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other and this is uh you know more characteristic of a scalar motion the scientists know about this kind of motion but they don&#x27;t recognize its significance they&#x27;ve never given it any significance um even though uh they have looked through their telescopes and have discovered that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other so they know that it is a real physical phenomenon but have not really attached any importance to it Larson puts it at the center of his theory and um you know uh one significant part of this is that it turns out that you know the way that we think of fields kind of goes away um if you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other and that&#x27;s uh analogous to something that Larsson uh called gravitation but there&#x27;s no gravitational field uh all of the uh dots all the locations are moving toward each other but like one isn&#x27;t being attracted by another there&#x27;s no field uh there&#x27;s no medium necessary there&#x27;s no field necessary to for one to go toward another the only way that that happens is when you arbitrarily deci decide that one of the points one of the locations is stationary then when you decide when you when you assign a reference point then you can start identifying the directions and that&#x27;s when the concept of a field comes in so um that&#x27;s one aspect of it the other uh is the three-dimensionality okay so that is what Larson calls clock time and clock space the clock is always getting later and later and later but in no specific direction space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no specific Direction clock time and clock space that refers to that uh that progression or that scalar motion and then he say he says that they are in uh in three dimensions he refers to this as coordinate space and coordinate time and this is uh coming from his observation of coordinate space we see space as more or less being three-dimensional with XYZ coordinates we see volume um and um because space and time are reciprocals of each other generally we think of reciprocals as having the same qualities so he is more or less extrapolating that okay if space has three dimensions that means that time also has three dimensions because they have the same qualities as being reciprocals of each other so he calls that coordinate time and then um he also uh has the concept of discret units space and time and motion as the relationship between space and time come only only in discrete units they have there has to be a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time before you have either one of those qualities quantities and really that space and time do not exist in and of themselves they only exist together in motion and when you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light and for Larson the speed of light is what he calls unit speed that is the background motion of this universe so if you have a state of rest in this uh Universe of motion you have motion outward at the speed of light in all directions that is uh what Neu one of uh Larson&#x27;s other followers calls a featuress uniformity so uh we see the progression of the natural references system moving outward in all directions at the speed of light as absolute nothingness uh which makes sense in a universe of motion if you have a universe of motion there is a prevenient motion that exists before everything else and uh so this uh this progression of the natural reference system this outward Mo motion uh at the speed of light is the background or the zero point or the null point or the reference point measurements are made from that uh from that datum not from zero which is what the Legacy scientists measure from okay I just um like to get into this article here this is the uh fourth installment uh so if you want to get go back to the start you want to go back to three videos and this is is from Dr Bruce paret uh and it&#x27;s one of his rs2 articles introducing his re-evaluation of the reciprocal system and this is an article called dimensional thinking now just wanted to preface this uh in the in the reciprocal system there uh there are scalar dimensions and then there are spatial dimensions and I guess temporal Dimensions it re it takes three dimensions of space to describe one scalar Dimension um there are three scalar Dimensions um the the the other two are can only be partially described and now what paret is trying to do here he&#x27;s trying to use complex numbers in particular uh querian uh which is a combination of uh a scalar one which is like the progression and then i j n k which are your imaginary operators which are basically 90° rotations and this is how what he&#x27;s using to try to attempt to describe especially uh atoms um but other phenomena as well photons okay this querian structure also provides a more accurate definition of the photon in querian math 2D rotation of one of I do J is equivalent to 1D rotation of k i doj equals K if i. J is paired with a negative K rotation you end up with a K negative K uh which equals pos1 two counter rotating systems uh which is one of n&#x27;s conventions or or or revisions of Larson uh called the bir rotation Larson thought of the photon as being a combination of a translational motion and a vibrational motion uh that creates a sine wave n is creating his sine wave using a bir rotation two counter rotating systems uh Larson didn&#x27;t conceive of that because Larsson felt that rotation was not a primary motion that you needed to have something to rotate before you could could start rotating but Neu and pet are both claiming that you can have a that rotation is every bit as primary as translation or you know a straight line motion and that vibration is actually only the result of a an interference between um uh rotating motions so two counter rotating systems producing a cosine wave that has a net outward unit speed in space a wave traveling at the speed of light n&#x27;s by rotation has two one-dimensional electric rotations that reduce to a cosine wave in Space the qu querian model has a two-dimensional magnetic so now you know pet is actually revising neu&#x27;s work on the rotating Photon or he&#x27;s tweaking it he&#x27;s wanting to use a quitan rather than two one-dimensional uh electric rotations normally in the reciprocal system uh elect whatever is electric is onedimensional and whatever is two-dimensional is magnetic and then gravitation would be the three-dimensional the quitan model has a two-dimensional magnetic rotation coupled to a one-dimensional electric rotation making the querian photon electromagnetic radiation solely from its structure as such it would also have various orientations resulting in the various transverse photons uh modes um um which are not a consequence of larsson&#x27;s or n&#x27;s models thinking in three dimensions has produced an improved model of larsson&#x27;s units of motion and of nus by rotating Photon but division algebra supports 1 2 four or eight Dimensions so what happens if we start to think in multiple Dimensions like the aliens and aden&#x27;s comment uh starting this paper we can still hardcode a three-dimensional universe but by applying a variable number of units of motion per Dimension a mathematical system evolves that accurately represents all of the known motions in the reciprocal system which is unique in that it includes Life as a natur natural consequence of motion the one-dimensional real numbers represent the outward expansion of the universe at unit speed the speed of light this unit of motion though used in the reciprocal system frequently was never defined as a unit of motion so that is the first number in a querian the scaler uh the number that uh has no um i j or k component the two-dimensional complex numbers represent a single electric rotating system electrons and positrons the four dimensional querian represents larsson&#x27;s double rotating system that forms the basis of particles and atoms and electromagnetic in nature querian model the photon and neutrinos and then I would also guess matter too the eight dimensional octonian represents an interl structure of double rotating systems that are mathematical the mathematical model of a screw Vortex or Helix these structures are basic to life units such as the uh Helix of the protein I think that&#x27;s a not can&#x27;t remember what Greek letter that is the octonian can be considered the particle version of a living cell cell each of these dimensional algebras can exist in either a single or dual form such as a pair of crans that are joined with the Epsilon function that keeps them separate yet interlocked this Duality creates the remaining rotational structures of the reciprocal system as they work cooperatively dual complex forms the by rotation necessary for the vibrational motion of charge dual uh he means dual complex numbers dual complex numbers form the by rotation necessary for the vibrational motion of change and then um dual Quan are the two double rotating systems that form atomic structure starting with the proton okay so the quitan models the photon and the neutrinos but the Dual querian models atoms whereas the Dual um complex number model uh electrons and positrons and the no the single the single complex number mod models uh electrons and positrons but the Dual complex number models charge dual octonian Express the life unit the biological cell linking the material and Cosmic structures together combining the linear motion of space with the rotational motion of time so how does that differ from the octonian the E dimensional octonian represents an Interlink structure of double rotating systems that are the mathematical model of the screw Vortex or Helix these structures are basic to life units they so the octonian can be considered the particle version of the living cell but the Dual octonian Express the life unit the biological cell linking the material and Cosmic structures together I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the difference is that he says the biological cell up here he says the particle version of a living cell um not sure okay um by using a combination of division algebras Dimensions to express Larson&#x27;s units of motion concept all the rotational structures both material and Cosmic can be mathematically represented with real numbers complex quantities querian and octonian this solves many of the problems with trying to use fixed dimensions and units creating a very concise mathematical progression of complexification from the unit speed motion of the progression of the natural reference system all the way way up to the biological cell of the life unit okay that is the end of this paper and uh this is something that uh I&#x27;m going to need to go over and uh try to try to understand what he&#x27;s talking about I&#x27;m uh currently trying to read an article about division algebras uh I don&#x27;t have a firm grasp of that but it is an interest way to do it uh Larson&#x27;s way of kind of doing matter um and charge and life is a bit cumbersome and so uh if if Pet&#x27;s model is usable it would be a big advance I would say um because it&#x27;s not that I I again it&#x27;s not really that Larsson is wrong it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of just that his methods need to be tweaked weaked a little bit um and for good reason you know I mean he&#x27;s one dude that&#x27;s trying to come up with a a whole Theory of Everything it&#x27;s uh more a bigger job than one person can do in one Lifetime and he did a fantastic job with what he did but he definitely left some um you know some things undone and he admitted that at in his life he said I believe that the theory itself is correct you know whether I have applied the theory correctly in all cases is a different question and that my mistakes will eventually kind of come out in the wash and other people will hopefully be there to uh you know to um resuscitate these um these Concepts and put them into a you know a better format okay so I don&#x27;t know exactly where we&#x27;re going to go tomorrow this is the end of uh Bruce Pet&#x27;s nine uh articles on um a reciprocal system 2 I might try to dig into some of uh Pet&#x27;s other stuff and see if I can find any uh things that might shed more light on the reciprocal system too because I think that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re that&#x27;s kind of what we&#x27;re going with um I moving forward now there are a few people out there including Dr Ron satz um who I believe is still alive um [Music] who uh are more Orthodox lonians they think that Larson you know got it right and we need to uh work from where he was and then there are some people that are I would say more wildly speculative which who are like we need to just you know revise this and I&#x27;m lary of those people because I don&#x27;t feel like they really know Larson in the first place and so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard for me to accept their Corrections of Larson because they don&#x27;t know lson well enough to know uh whether he got something wrong or not I feel like Dr pet and Dr Neu are on really firm ground with understanding Larson in fact I feel like they are the two people who understand Larson the best and they are when so when they make changes I listen more intently okay um but then again I know pretty much Jack about this I&#x27;ve been studying it for a while but I&#x27;m a slow learner um and uh you know I know it&#x27;s important but I&#x27;m not exactly sure how it all fits together so this is an important paper for me at least and hopefully I can pass some of that on to you hopefully some of it some of you can pass it on to me if you understand it better than I do okay well uh thanks for tuning in today and uh we&#x27;ll be starting up something new tomorrow have a great day</p>
