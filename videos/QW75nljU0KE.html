Yet, whenever the topic of UAP arises, those who wish to explore the phenomena are often confronted with resistance and ridicule. Our best tool for unlocking the mystery of UAP is science. But we cannot conduct a proper inquiry if the stigma is so overwhelming that just daring to be part of a NASA research team elicits such a vitriolic response.
