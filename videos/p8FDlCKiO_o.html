            <p>What if we told you gravity can be manipulated? In the 1950s, a physicist named Thomas Townson Brown claimed to discover a way to bend gravity using nothing but electricity, two metal plates, a strong electric field, no fuel, no moving parts. Yet, the device lifted into the air. Brown believed electricity and gravity were deeply connected. That voltage could counteract gravity itself. The US military took notice.</p>
<p>Black budgets, secret experiments, then suddenly silence. Some believe this was the real propulsion behind unidentified flying objects. Not aliens, but electrogravity crafts. Today, mainstream science says it&#x27;s just ion wind, a trick of charged particles pushing air. But if that&#x27;s all it was, why the secrecy? Was this forgotten technology a dead end or the key to controlling gravity itself? The truth might already be flying just above us.</p>
