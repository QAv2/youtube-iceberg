            <p>business model well you know what&#x27;s funny is I&#x27;m watching Fallout right now and uh the whole thing is based on um like a a a big company um basically uh uh marketizing marketing the end of the world right and having a vested interest to their shareholders in the end of the world as a product and that&#x27;s a huge problem uh because then you know that company has a vested interest to make sure that you know International conflicts uh don&#x27;t get resolved and that&#x27;s kind of the basis of the storyline so I won&#x27;t I won&#x27;t go further than that but uh for anyone in the UFO uh Community uh I just wanted to throw out that um Fallout is a show um that you need to watch um absolutely uh it&#x27;s up there right now with the three body problem and uh the signal which is uh two shows on Netflix uh this one being on Amazon Prime but yeah I after our last after our last show I did start watching the three body problem because of your ringing endorsement for that and it&#x27;s it is really good it&#x27;s really good but you know again it kind of goes back to what we were just talking about with sort of this Consciousness manipulation and this Consciousness Warfare and I don&#x27;t want to get too into it and spoil it I think you said spoilers uh you gave me a time frame on that so I would be spoiling it and I don&#x27;t want to but they do you know Consciousness and uh uh is definitely a part of that and it um and it also involves extraterrestrials or others you know so it&#x27;s very interesting so I think um and I really think that understanding Consciousness not not only is it fundamental to science because we don&#x27;t even know you know we don&#x27;t even know what Consciousness is I mean we literally don&#x27;t even know what the you know the so the software is that we&#x27;re interpreting the world through um but it&#x27;s also you know it&#x27;s so important to understanding the Extraterrestrial or the you know David gush call it the interdimensional presence because they they seem to operate off of Consciousness you know they they communicate through telepathy they communicate through dreams you know the craft have telepathy I this is very bib I mean this is in every great historical uh you know every great ancient book uh every great religious book that there is so you it uh they&#x27;ve been they have mind I&#x27;ll leave it at this for for for three body problem have you ever looked up at the universe and had the universe wink back at you yeah very very oh my God gave me gave me shivers yeah at that I think that happened and this is a very good example of how Consciousness is so important because I don&#x27;t think that really happened I think they manipulated the brains and perceptions of people and that&#x27;s where it occurred now you&#x27;re getting it Teresa yeah that&#x27;s now you&#x27;re getting it now now you&#x27;re getting it and uh so again this brings us back to this project now this project um there is a page uh and I am sorry I&#x27;m just I have it big on my my side so what is the research need now this is a big part now this is early in the slide this slide four this would be crucial right at when presenting um this would be a crucial slide uh because what is the need of this program um so they list the need as this research is a congressional interest item and this is remember 2012 is was the initial proposed year of start so we have to assume that it took place before then um so This research addresses the critical need for the United States Science and Technology Community to identify Global emerging Andor potentially disruptive technologies that could have a significant impact on Homeland Security I&#x27;ll repeat that Homeland Security not National Security not Global Security like in our backyard security yeah you know I really wonder if this was um if if this was in response to the Havana syndrome cases I AB I&#x27;m convinced it is yeah I really am uh so the focus collabor ations uh on the knowledge based deliverable ensures that the uh departmental requirements and those of the inter agency partners are addressed and provided opportunities uh for followon efforts and additional collaboration on scientific investigation and Technology exploitation the Department&#x27;s interest area with this project Target is the certif scientific and Technical investigation threat analysis and assessment of materials and data of unique origin let&#x27;s say that again and assessments of materials and data of unique origin engineering and purpose so what do you think they mean by that what is unique origin mean I mean if it was created in China or Russia that would be foreign origin I don&#x27;t know that we would necessarily term that unique well back then back then that&#x27;s how you hide this right because back then the the you the subject wasn&#x27;t so transparent right and you hide this from being foyble by saying things like that not nowadays they might include the word um uh you know non-human origin or uh yada yada yada uh who knows what you know what interdimensional who knows what word they&#x27;re using these days but um that&#x27;s what&#x27;s that that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s it makes it so impossible and what that&#x27;s what I respect about John Greenwall Jr is he he&#x27;s like like a dog with a bone with this stuff um you know because it takes words uh if you don&#x27;t get the exact wording right in a Foy request well he said extraterrestrial this says interdimensional well nope we don&#x27;t have what he&#x27;s looking for it makes all the difference so it it literally makes all the difference in so word salid so here what I that that that to me that would be um just an early uh way of of saying um so uh unique in origin equals probably can&#x27;t say definitively but unique offworld technology and materials and Engineering because they go on to say that too um uh Ju uh disruptive materials um technologies that could potentially impact National Power and security um y yada y oh no no here it is materials data of unique origin engineering and purpose so uh things that they quite they don&#x27;t understand the engineering the purpose and uh uh purpose of that&#x27;s what does that sound like to you that it sounds like UFOs and I I this this Arrow arrow is very contradictory so they&#x27;re saying this is a proposed plan in 200 whatever right before 2012 uh this is them admitting that they&#x27;re having these conversations that they&#x27;re proposing plans for for projects like it this we thousands of these things are submitted a year so we know just by this existing and the government at the same time publicly saying we have no studies like such we have no plans to study things like that we have no skin in that game anymore clearly when having skin in that game still right they&#x27;re taking on proposals uh ER briefs and contract bids for programs this did not get that far but it seems others did so you know really the the goal with this slide was to say if this didn&#x27;t get through what did what did and and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the real question because if if this is what they&#x27;re showing us what got through is three times as weird that is a very good point if this is what&#x27;s public just imagine what&#x27;s classified like you just now you know it&#x27;s three times as weird yeah so um yeah that&#x27;s fascinating I mean we know that they&#x27;ve been interested in Consciousness studies you know since the 50s and 60s when the the Russians were showing uh the Russians were showing people with telekinetic abilities and certainly the Nazis did a lot of research in um remote viewing and things of that nature and and telepathy and you there&#x27;s psychic uh ESP abilities and uh so we you know this has been an ongoing thing for a very long time so it&#x27;s not surprising to me it&#x27;s uh you know it&#x27;s interesting it&#x27;ll be a while before any of this technology really comes down to you know really improve our lives and is just for you know used as military applications but I think it&#x27;s exciting I think it&#x27;s exciting for Science and um you know I do hope that the uh civilian realm will continue to push further um and tackle tackle these really important subjects that um I mean they mean so much this is just as important as the Extraterrestrial question uh because it truly answers it it goes right to the heart of you know what does it mean to be human right I mean what is consciousness it does it exist brain outside brain uh if Consciousness is outside of the brain then does it go with us after death I mean a lot of near-death experiences would say that that is the case so I mean we can&#x27;t even say if the brain is more of like a radio and an antenna uh uh or if it is um actually where is so um these are cool Jeffrey M thank you thank you so Jeffrey mlove won the Bigalow prize um yeah Institute yeah so thank you uh so Rockstar uh intuition um uh thank you thank you for that but um so dude it&#x27;s h YouTube is really killing so we&#x27;re again we&#x27;re at over a hundred people and over like and and then there&#x27;s only 15 on like YouTube it drives me so insane because the like the podcast does so well Twitter does so well X does I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t with this Twitter X thing X does so well um X needs to to to rival YouTube I think um but that&#x27;s not not not here nor there um but it just drives me a little insane to like look at it and and see it no but I would just like to thank everybody for being here and all of our Twitter Community is hard our ex our ex people who are here thank you being here and you know I I certainly enjoy interacting with a lot of the ex uh community in spaces um so thanks for being here guys and you know what we did have um I should have started the show by saying this but um we had some weird stuff happen this week and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to do a UFOs we&#x27;ll get back there we&#x27;re gonna get back there trust me but we have two stories that you have and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re very interesting and um so one of the things I want to talk about um with with with real real quick is uh you and I text obviously and uh Israel got attacked by Iran um four or five days ago and um they destroyed a Muslim temple and you know they were able to shoot 99%</p>
