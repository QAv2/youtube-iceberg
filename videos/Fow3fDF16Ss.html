            <p>well you so You&#x27; in your thinking though have been through many um levels of openness right I you came to remote viewing very you know thinking that it wasn&#x27;t possible and you expanded not only did I come to remote viewing thinking it wasn&#x27;t possible uh 13 years in the program every time I went in to do a session with a remote viewer I would ask myself how can I be doing this why am I here this can&#x27;t possibly work I have all the same resistances uh bubbling up and then there would be some spectacular result and I say I got to face it and uh so I mean we do have to re-evaluate our whole understanding of Consciousness physics but there is something to I mean I&#x27;ve tried and you do get images flooding into your mind and it&#x27;s coming from somewhere that&#x27;s yeah well I mean certainly as we saw even when you&#x27;ve got a remote viewer you&#x27;ve got an interviewer and you have some Target you don&#x27;t know what it is and the person comes up with something that he knows just can&#x27;t be right the interviewer is sitting there really disgusted he knows what the person is saying can&#x27;t be right they both try to get rid of this image start from scratch still keeps coming in so finally they give up and put it down and it turns out to be correct so obviously the information is there and it has a certain robustness that you can&#x27;t just discount so taking us all together you know the quantum fluctuations the remote viewing I mean there probably will be a place where they converge in the sense that Consciousness is somehow a key element in all these phenomena you know yeah I as I say as as a physics chauvinist okay I&#x27;ve got physics I know I&#x27;ve got some Advanced physics we&#x27;re pushing I&#x27;ve got this island of remote viewing I&#x27;ve got this island of Consciousness I know they all go together because they&#x27;re all pieces of they&#x27;re all pieces of of the universe certainly what we saw in the remote viewing was people could do things that as physicists we couldn&#x27;t explain um especially the future viewing viewing of future events I mean that uh really wipes out most theoretical modeling um even even models that involve um the possibility of forward and backward propagation of light waves uh still can&#x27;t handle somebody describing an event that takes place in a week or something how would you let&#x27;s say if you were a hypothesize how would you in physics terms or maybe some far out physics explain it I mean well one depressing way to explain it is that it&#x27;s all cast in concrete from here to INF or whatever and we&#x27;re just marching through the slideshow frame by frame everything there is no such thing is Free Will it&#x27;s all cast and U so somehow somebody finds some tricky way to Jump Ahead a few frames and see what&#x27;s happening that might imply that you know we we don&#x27;t have free will so that&#x27;s actually you can get into sophisticated arguments where you can actually make all those things kind of work out but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s tough way to hold well what about the but they weren&#x27;t always right about you know forecasting the future whole idea about parallel universes or or each moment there&#x27;s a split in the possible Futures that can happen from this moment on depends which path we take in fact to show how sci-fi physics has become there is a serious Theory by serious I mean it&#x27;s published and no one can hit holes in it called the multi- worlds interpretation the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory which says that at every instant of all the quantum possibilities everything that could happen does happen and so there&#x27;s a you that uh just said this to me yeah but at some Quantum level there was a you that decided not to say that to say something else and he&#x27;s going off and right and so but it it&#x27;s just so seemingly absurd from the usual Viewpoint I don&#x27;t think any phys physicist really believes that all possibilities are in fact unwinding into the future but they&#x27;ve been able to mathematically prove that that&#x27;s possible well they&#x27;ve been able to mathematically prove that if you have that uh physics set up with that understanding uh it doesn&#x27;t violate anything we observe because it just turns out we&#x27;re following one of the tracks so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like a theory you can&#x27;t disprove right I don&#x27;t think anybody no no one&#x27;s thought of a way of approving it unless you get actually get access to alternate realities but um I&#x27;d have to say no physicist really buys it but it&#x27;s in the book says when anyone lists various uh approaches to quantum theory that gets listed because it can&#x27;t be disproven well but you have an open mind which is the best thing about you TR to keep an open mind uh but hope my brains don&#x27;t fall out it&#x27;s too open no but I mean you your work is connecting these dots in particular yeah that seems to be my uh Destiny in life uh on the physics stuff I&#x27;m on the edge of it obviously in the remote viewing we&#x27;re on the edge of Consciousness things and U some people just sort of have a makeup that uh if it isn&#x27;t out in the edge it&#x27;s boring and so I Happ to be one of those people thank you for all your hard work</p>
