            <p>[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what are they I don&#x27;t know just keep watching it&#x27;s unbelievable that&#x27;s unreal I&#x27;ve never seen anything like they&#x27;ve been going at it like that for almost half an hour but it can&#x27;t be aircraft aircraft can&#x27;t maneuver like that what else could they be I don&#x27;t know lasers maybe being shot from the ground reflecting up off the cloud [Music] ning Le who was a physicist born in China immigrated to the US in Huntsville Alabama which led to her unfortunate mysterious disappearance apparently Huntsville Alabama is a HubSpot for the Aerospace and defense industry this includes northr groomman locking Martin Boeing aerojet rocket dine she was hired at the University of Alabama in Huntsville at the center for space plasma and aeronomic research and now I&#x27;m going to read a part of a research paper called Static test for a gravitational force coupled to type 2 ybco superconductors and a part of it states here recent experiments have reported anomalous weight loss for a test Mass suspended above a rotating type 2 ybco superconductor with a percentage change independent of the test Mass chemical composition and diamagnetic properties this result puts new limits on the strength and range of the proposed coupling between static superconductors and gravity so she theorized that a superconductor could produce anti-gravitational effects and the concept of anti-gravity is essentially supposed to be theoretical that is until the existence of UFOs and uips were confirmed but remember people were going to storm um Area 51 and it apparently wasn&#x27;t all about the aliens but it was also the fact that this advanced technology truly existed people believed anti-gravity technology already existed and if it does the world would not have to suffer in the way that it currently does both humans and our planet would ultimately benefit from this technology now I&#x27;m going to read a part of an article on popular on Popular Mechanics titled taming Gravity by Jim Wilson prospects for the Alabama htsd are attracting serious attention because this particular disc was fabricated by ning Lee one of the world&#x27;s leading scientists in the 1980s Lee predicted that if a Time varying magnetic field were applied to superconductor ions trapped in a lattice structure the ions would absorb enormous amounts of energy confined in the lattice the ions would begin to rapidly spin causing each to create a minuscule gravitational field to understand how an htsd is critical to the construction of a force filled machine it&#x27;s useful to know something about an unusual state of matter called a Bose Einstein condensate it&#x27;s our day-to-day lives we encounter three states of matter solid liquid and gas in the laboratory it is possible to create another state of matter in which all the atoms are aligned in a way that makes them behave as if they were one single atom she eventually left the university and started the company AC gravity l LC to further her research then the US Department of Defense gave ningle a $450,000 grant for her research in 2001 and then after that she eerily disappeared a reporter eventually contacted her son and ning Lee was unfortunately hit by a vehicle in 2014 so apparently she worked for the Department of Defense until she was killed when she was hit by this vehicle her husband was supposedly with her and it was stated that he had a heart attack because of the trauma with seeing ningle being killed in the 1970s an inventor named Stanley Meyer claimed to have created a car that runs on water he claimed using electrolysis process to split the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen which would then be combusted to power the engine now I&#x27;m going to read an article about his death titled the mysterious death of Stanley Meyer and his waterp powerered car it&#x27;s the 21st March 1998 the first day of spring and four men are having lunch in a restaurant a waiter serves one of them some cranberry juice perhaps but we will never know for sure chosen for dessert this man immediately after the first sip suddenly gets up as if he&#x27;s gone crazy he holds his hands around his neck he loses his breath runs out into the parking lot collapses to the ground and pronounces his last words they poisoned me Steve robinet the lead detective on the case collected the testimonies of everyone in the parking lot including the final disturbing words of a man immediately identified as Stanley Meer a citizen of Grove City his brother Steven was one of the four at the table and he heard the words spoken at the end of his life in just 3 months he closed the case File seed it with a colored elastic band and wrote on the cover death by natural causes forly the case was now resolved but we can all rest assured that in all these years he never forgot the case of Stanley Meyer the ventor of the waterp powerered car who in 1998 got up from a table at a restaurant to run into a car park some say just to leave a message they poison me and it&#x27;s because of what I&#x27;m doing to revolutionize the car world but remember when Hyde on that 70 show said in a smoke session hey there&#x27;s a guy who can make a car that runs on water a car that runs on water man remember yeah that was in That 70s Show ironic that this happened in the&#x27; 70s and they said it on That 70s Show we&#x27;re going to need some serious gas money cuz the Cruiser&#x27;s a boat I know it&#x27;s a boat this whole gas shortage bites who&#x27;s getting a boat there is no gas shortage man it&#x27;s all fake the oil companies control everything like there&#x27;s this guy who invented this car that runs on water man it&#x27;s got a fiberglass air cooled engine and it runs on water so it is a b no it&#x27;s a car only you put water in the gas tank instead of gas and it runs all water man the the just all the connections is crazy so I came across an interesting real on Instagram that had over 389,000 likes with Grant and it said bro was never seen again and here&#x27;s that hi my name is Grant and this is a 1998 Ford Explorer Sports now I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re familiar with Ford&#x27;s Explorer line but they have a reput ation of being horrible gas guzzlers and I can actually attest to that I did the mileage test on my truck and found out that I was getting 13.6 m per gallon highway which as far as I&#x27;m concerned is absolutely unacceptable last year alone I spent 114 bajillion Dollar on gasoline okay I made that number up but it sure felt like it well I did something about it and now I&#x27;m getting 56% better gas mileage which translates to 56% Savings in my pocket at the gas pump how did I do it my truck is now a water hybrid check this out well technically it&#x27;s a hydrogen on demand hybrid what we have here is distilled water with one teaspoon of baking soda used as a catalyst we tickle that water with 12 volts of electricity and what it does is it separates the hydrogen from the oxygen that gas is then sent into the combustion chamber where I was formerly getting a 30% burn that&#x27;s right in all of your gas vehicles you only get a 30% fuel burn which translates to 7 % of your fuel of your gas comes out of your tail pipe now however I&#x27;m getting a 100% burn in my combustion chamber which means a few benefits number one after a couple hours of running hydrogen it had blown years of deposits out of my engine my engine actually idle so quietly in city traffic I can&#x27;t even hear it my torque increased my horsepower he [Music]</p>
