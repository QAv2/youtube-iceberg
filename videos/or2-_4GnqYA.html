            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[Music] Watching Age of Disclosures, I saw how people could come together to create a I&#x27;m going to say a narrative that was easily digestible by the public. &gt;&gt; Great recap of what we&#x27;ve all kind of lived through um since 2017. &gt;&gt; But anybody that knows the true history of of how these UFO programs that George and I have reported on, and George has reported on this before anybody, um we have a problem. I think once people start, if people are new to this and they go, &quot;Oh, this is really interesting interesting. I&#x27;m going to start digging deeper and then they discover Skinwalkers at the Pentagon and they discover OAP, they&#x27;re going to say, &quot;This movie isn&#x27;t accurate.&quot; And I think Danny, you brought it up.</p>
<p>Something we know about, we know this isn&#x27;t accurate. What else do we not know about that they&#x27;re talking about is also not accurate. So, it&#x27;s going to, you know, it&#x27;s going to put that out there. And it&#x27;s We want this. We want transparency and truthfulness.</p>
<p>And I understand not wanting to go there because it gets really messy with orbs and you know the biological effects and what Jay Stratton and his family experienced. And you&#x27;re calling for disclosure and honesty and we want to know the truth. Tell us the truth. We can handle the truth. We want transparency.</p>
<p>You got to live up to that standard too. And uh OAP got the 22 million. That&#x27;s the money that that Reed got for it. ATIP came later. It grew out of it.</p>
<p>It did not have a budget that we know of. Lou Alzando and Jay Stratton were involved in it, but they have had very vigorous, I&#x27;ll put it that way, vigorous uh disagreements about what program did what. And the people who were involved directly with ALSAP, who were here in Las Vegas, are not likely to come forward and raise a stink about it. They&#x27;re just not. But I can tell you they&#x27;re they watched this and they were they were pretty upset about it.</p>
<p>Um, it was it was Jay Stratton who who&#x27;s he has been so straightforward about this and I really respect the way he talks about it, but he I think he was dancing around something. He says, &quot;We bumped into the legacy program.&quot; I&#x27;m I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m not buying that for one second. I don&#x27;t think he bumped into it. I I think that Jay Stratton uh, you know, had direct knowledge of the legacy program.</p>
<p>I think Lou Alzando probably has a large history with the UFO thing that that is not public yet. And I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s dying to tell people and just maybe like can&#x27;t legally. [Music]</p>
