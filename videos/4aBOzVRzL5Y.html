            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>so I understand that you were a senior adviser and contractor for the pentagon&#x27;s highly classified UAP program whose existence was revealed in a December 2017 New York Times article written by someone we all know um so exactly what was your role in that program well it turned out that back in 2008 um the defense intelligence agency got really concerned about the fact that there so many observations of of craft in the skies that uh seem to have these unusual characteristics and so on and they also had access to uh Russian work behind the scenes that indicated that the Russians were also had a very large program to try to get to grips with all this kind of stuff so anyway they put out a u request for uh analyses to be done by anyone who wanted to respond and Bigalow Aerospace turned out to be uh the one that responded and was awarded the contract well I had been working with uh Robert Bigalow on other projects earlier on so he contacted me and said uh would you and earthtech be willing to be a subcontractor and help us get to the the root of of these kind of phenomena so I said sure glad glad to do that and so the original idea was that okay well let&#x27;s get contact with uh Aerospace corporations who are claimed to have access to materials from Crash retrievals of UAP as we call them unidentified anomalous phenomena uh and then we&#x27;ll uh distribute them out to subject matter experts and see uh what they can tell us about these materials and so on so so we triy to negotiate something like that but it we were told this you know this this area stay away from it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just too classified so basically uh what I decided to do at earthtech was okay had we been able to get access to materials what would we have done with them well we would have put them out to subject matter experts and had them uh give us their analyses without letting them know where the materials came from well that was off the table so I went to plan B and that was okay I&#x27;ll contact all these same subject matter experts from around the world who are are experts in their various fields of uh uh of advanced Aerospace uh issues and I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m just doing a um kind of a general investigation uh that might be useful to Bigalow Aerospace so where will your field be in the year 2050 so we figure by doing that we&#x27;re going to get analyses that were the best that these kind of people would have to offer about where their Fields would be and so it generated uh some 38 I commissioned 38 papers from people all around the world there unclassified study at that point so I had uh inputs from people from different countries and so they describe where their field would be and uh we then took those series of uh reports that were provided to us and we put them up on a on a highly classified at that time uh site uh in the Pentagon and they could be distributed out to Aerospace contractors and the intelligence community and the dod and so uh all these 38 were distributed that way we were told that probably they would never see you know the time of day in open publication but since then through uh Freedom of Information Act uh requests most of them have been uh have have come out and they cover very exotic subjects like SpaceTime metric engineering or effects uh due to injuries from encountering Craft at too close range and so on so anyway uh the these are now available so I think that was the the the final output from at least my part of my participation um in that role did you have the opportunity to brief congressional committees or Arrow uh yes uh as part of uh having collected the information that we collected I brief the Senate select committee and intelligence I briefed the Senate armed services committee I did brief Arrow the Alain anomaly uh research organization so they have the information including classified information that we obtained behind the scenes and so that&#x27;s all out there in various uh various uh kinds of reports</p>
