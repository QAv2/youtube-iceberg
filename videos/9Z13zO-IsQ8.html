            <p>hello I&#x27;m Doug this is a measurement 101 page cast three minutes talking about a particular webpage on this site in this case I&#x27;m talking about the measuring while up or down or equivalently the quaternion gravity page so there there are these two supernova and the reference observer that&#x27;s me goes and set measures the time and says the time between those two events is five and the distance between the two is three so we do the square to find that the interval is 16 and the space x time is 30 and that&#x27;s our starting point hello I&#x27;m quaternion gravity dug in yellow everything kelly green on this page is about quaternion gravity so it says a quaternion squared equals the interval and space x time and invariant space x time is quaternion gravity but what does that mean well let&#x27;s focus on that girl floating up above there with those balloons she&#x27;s not slowed down by gravity so her clock is going to tick a little faster and if she measures the time between those two events with our faster clock it&#x27;s going to end up with a larger number on the other hand that ruler he&#x27;s you she&#x27;s using expands in space and gets larger and so if she uses that to measure the distance between those two events it will end up with a smaller number one number is getting larger the other is getting smaller now changes in our very precise in the standard approach to gravity known as Einstein&#x27;s general relativity the bigger DT almost cancels out the smaller dr but not exactly in my quaternion gravity proposal in fact it&#x27;s all about the larger DT exactly canceling out the smaller space dr and the result is an invariant space x time of 30 for the person floating above the clouds exactly equal to what the reference observer gotten but what about the interval well that&#x27;s made up of a larger number minus a smaller number so minus times a minus is ok so so the result is an interval that is actually larger than the reference observer but what about that guy lying down pointing up at the the to supernovae well he feels the weight of gravity and so that means his clock is going to tick a little slower and with that slow clock he&#x27;s going to think the dis time between the two explosions is less his meter stick is also a little smaller ok so his spatial measurement is going to say hey that distance is actually a little larger ok but in the quaternion gravity proposal those exactly cancel out and so the result is an invariant space x time of 30 exactly equal to what the reference observer gets and exactly equal to the balloon girl floating up above there is but what about his interval ok his interval is made up of a positive number that&#x27;s smaller minus a bigger negative number and that means that the interval is in fact smaller than the reference of interval and of course smaller than that girl floating above and that&#x27;s it for this page cast thank you</p>
