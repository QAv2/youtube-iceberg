it&#x27;s referred to involved efforts by the united states government to conduct covert surveillance of countries and targeted individuals by means of the advanced promise software journalist danny casalaro who deeply researched the case died under mysterious circumstances when he was about to reveal his bombshell findings on the trail of global government corruption that he called the octopus many of his informants ended up dead or missing as well the compelling revelations by someone who had two chance encounters with cassolaro at events in virginia shortly before his death open up a new trail of discovery during these encounters castellero indicated something was wrong with the intense reaction by the u.s justice department in the inslah affair case these revelations dovetail with information dr joseph farrell came across that strongly suggests someone had already built a back door into the promise software before it was stolen by the justice department and seeded throughout the financial legal and national security apparatus of allies and enemies across the globe meaning that some other group an unseen actor has been conducting a worldwide blackmail campaign the source for today&#x27;s castle hour revelations regarding his meeting with the doomed reporter is marty farrell dr farrell&#x27;s cousin we&#x27;ll meet marty today and he&#x27;ll put on the record for the first time the fascinating comments cassolaro made in their brief encounters we&#x27;ll go deep with dr farrell on the blockbuster break in the 30 year old promise software case that may have staggering implications for what the deep state is attempting for global control please join us now [Music] well marty it&#x27;s great to have you here i&#x27;m going to have you introduce yourself to our viewers now just to give us an idea we know that you&#x27;re dr farrell&#x27;s cousin uh is there anything else you want to put on the record in your bio well uh i&#x27;ve had multiple jobs in my career so don&#x27;t forget to don&#x27;t forget to throw in your dad&#x27;s job oh yeah yeah my dad&#x27;s job of 25 plus years was smithsonian institution in the uh red castle building right off jefferson davis oh yeah yeah so it kind of led me down some rabbit holes very early in my age um needless to say you know uh he had a lot to do with uh my inquisitive mind i think uh and put a lot of questions in my life early early only in his connection was with uh the international educational agency or something like that yeah very early in his career so interesting so many mysteries around the smithsonian of course he sounds like a very interesting guy i remember him daniel when when i was a boy we went out to dc to visit uh uncle bob and marty and you know he and i were we&#x27;re just months apart in terms of our birthday so we&#x27;re the same age okay and we went out there and uncle bob i remember he had just started working in the red castle and i remember him taking us into that building through through these weird doors that nobody ever used you know he was opening his you know keys and everything so we got to see some passageways in the smithsonian that that most people don&#x27;t get to see it was kind of fun you know it was kind of cool yes it was anyway somewhere uh along the line marty you got to meet uh he had a chance encounter at first with the journalist danny casallaro of octopus fame and all the interesting fascinating things that he brought forward about promise software and other pieces of the puzzle there around the deep state uh how did you meet him well i was at a uh ski chalet sale in arlington virginia ski chalet puts on these promotions every single year and they&#x27;re usually pretty big shindigs you know to the point where cars are going out into the street and things like that um and he he just happened to be in the the sale he was there walking through the crowd and talking to people because you know he was an outgoing kind of guy that was his kind of demeanor um and it it just so happens on the ski wall where i was selling skis he was talking to somebody about bcci oh wow my ear went like that because i was like you know i wasn&#x27;t i didn&#x27;t really know about that banking institution back then but i had heard rumors about it and it caught my interest especially since i was looking into western goals and stuff like that during that time and uh you know he said somebody said something about going to get some beers and i said i would love a budweiser or something like that about that time and he goes well let&#x27;s go get some budweisers and lo and behold that&#x27;s what we did we went to uh sir walter raleigh&#x27;s steakhouse uh which is right around the corner and uh had a beer and i had a uh he he i can&#x27;t remember what he had but i will tell you that he had something with him which is this brown accordion file oh there we go okay and it had vanilla envelopes in it with names and dates and addresses you know all right wait a minute here number one how long did you talk and number two you actually got to look at sort of he had he had him with him it&#x27;s fascinating he actually looked inside that thing no i didn&#x27;t get to see you know he he he delegated out a couple of files and i didn&#x27;t get to see any of the stuff but and like i said it was like a 25-30 minute dinner yeah quick uh he was more interested in looking at stuff before himself looked like and paying attention to me but i was interested in him definitely and um you know he he he kept saying that this something isn&#x27;t right with this ordeal that i&#x27;m going at i&#x27;m looking at and i and i kept asking what is it what&#x27;s this ordeal and you know he said promise holy remember promise [Music] and he said prosecutors management information systems and that&#x27;s stuck in my mind and and uh he goes it&#x27;s not making sense that you know this is such a big deal for the doj right it&#x27;s not making sense he in other words did he did he review the story with you at that time or was that the subsequent meeting well that was the subsequent meeting in in when we had beers the first meeting was 1989. okay and he didn&#x27;t have very much then just had a a bunch of you know conglomeration of stuff and it didn&#x27;t look like he was really interested in talking to me he&#x27;s more interested in drinking his beers and going through the stuff and then the next year in 1990 is when we sat down and had beers and we kind of discussed a lot of the stuff okay so it&#x27;s far along his way at that point so at that second at that second meeting and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s saying that something is not adding up but he was he was genuinely mystified yes yes mystified did he have the case with him the second time around no he did not he did not have his case with him but i&#x27;m assuming that the case was in his car because everybody tells me he didn&#x27;t go anywhere without that cake without that case right this is very interesting marty if you had to go and think of this time wise you&#x27;re saying 89 90 would you say it was the fall of 89 the summer of 89 i know exactly the month uh or the two months august september okay because that&#x27;s when ski chalet used to have their sales august and september now 80 i can&#x27;t remember what&#x27;s hit eight you know august or september in 89 and 90 i can&#x27;t remember so that first meeting is a chance meeting at this skiing [Music] uh encounter and then you get together you&#x27;re talking he mentions a few things he has the case with him he&#x27;s he&#x27;s moving around files and he&#x27;s talking a little bit about something doesn&#x27;t add up with what i&#x27;m working on and he mentions promise how do you get to a second meeting what happened what leads you to before we before we exited that restaurant i said listen my friend i need to speak with you again we need to talk again because i am very interested in what you&#x27;re pulling down and we need to speak and i said i don&#x27;t care when where or what we need to speak and you know lo and behold it wasn&#x27;t until the next year 1990 august september somewhere that ski chalet has their sale again and i i don&#x27;t remember if this was in chantilly at that time or arlington at that time but we went out for beers okay and you go out a second time you&#x27;re reconnecting and what&#x27;s the conversation like serious yeah dead serious i mean he&#x27;s he&#x27;s he&#x27;s he&#x27;s wandered into a place that he doesn&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s going to lead other than well he did say i&#x27;m not i&#x27;m not the kind of guy that will ever kill himself holy cow oh boy how long how long did you guys talk 25 minutes again 25 30. he he you know what what i recognized he didn&#x27;t really talk too much too long with anybody it was you know short interactions at least with me that&#x27;s what it was and he didn&#x27;t really know me that well other than i had same interests as him and we were diving down similar rabbit holes at that time right and he probably was like you know there&#x27;s so few people that were dealing with these things he was probably relieved to be talking to someone who knew who was interested yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where it kind of got serious the second round was that he was amazed what i knew about you know a lot of that stuff and it was only on my own behalf that i knew it um when you talked with him and he said that this is not adding up in reference to promise did he give any indication to you or give any hints or suggestions or or anything that you can read between the lines as to what in his mind was not adding up about the research he&#x27;d gathered at the time one of the what it kind of appeared to me was is that he couldn&#x27;t figure out why doj was so concerned that this disappeared he figured that out because because uh they were using this software long before all of this took place holy cow all these agencies were using this software irs fbi doj all of them and so why why would they other than nefarious purposes okay you remember when we talked um i think it&#x27;s about two weeks ago now yeah whenever it was that you and i talked i mentioned to you and i mentioned to daniel uh short literally within a few minutes after you and i got done talking marty i i got on the um horn with daniel let him know about all of this that you&#x27;d met castellero and what i told daniel is something that that i told you in our private discussion that i want to mention now that everybody&#x27;s listening and mention it on the record yeah back in the early 1990s i read a book a a fictional novel and i don&#x27;t folks i don&#x27;t remember the author&#x27;s name and i don&#x27;t remember the title all i remember was it was an octavo sized paperback book with a white cover and if i recall correctly it had had the title new world order you know that phrase somewhere in the title but it wasn&#x27;t we&#x27;re hunting it down yeah we&#x27;re hunting it down you know something like you know but it had that that phrase in the title and part of the book was about the promise software and this is where the story when you mentioned that you had met casalero and that he was disturbed about something regarding the promised story that that he couldn&#x27;t figure out it it it rang it it rang the alarm bell because this book maintains that a programmer and this is where it gets really weird because i&#x27;m sure daniel&#x27;s going to leap in here a programmer who had been working for inslaw by the name of barry cumnick had had supposedly programmed a back door into the promised software before it ever left inslaw and was stolen by the justice department so in other words after after the software was stolen and then allegedly farmed around by the doj to you know whacking hut and the cia and all the stuff that danny uncovered and right hand was uncovering right about the time he met you about you know them adding back doors to the software this book this fictional book is maintaining that a back door had been added unbeknownst to the owners of innslaw before the the software was even stolen and i&#x27;ll tell you marty what really gets me when i first mentioned that story i think it was on george ann hughes in the old byte show i don&#x27;t even remember where i first mentioned it lo and behold out of the clear blue sky i get an email from bill hamilton the president of innslaw wow yeah yeah asking me you know what do i know about this where you know where did you and blah blah blah blah uh you know and i told them you know it was it was in this book that&#x27;s all i know and at the time i still had a copy of the book and if i remember correctly i i gave him the title of this thing but uh it it really floored me that he took it seriously enough to email me right about it so that&#x27;s this kind of this is really fascinating there&#x27;s two things i want to mention here so so based on what you just heard uh marty was it your impression when you talked to cassalaro that he thought that somebody had got to this software and put a back door or uh interfered with it and changed it before the doj stole it did that come up at all not directly it didn&#x27;t come up directly but it it was he gave me the impression that something funky was going on beforehand and and here&#x27;s another interesting thing and i did not know dude what is crypt cryptic a g or crypto a g what what is that okay so let&#x27;s pause and say this is a cia nsa front company dealing with advanced steganography and spying it&#x27;s disbanded as of 2018. what did he say he mentioned that term no this is something that i just came across um bdn or the this involves bdn and a lot of the other intelligence agencies because there was another guy at nsa who ended up gone who worked at vince mill virginia oh holy cow okay and it was in january of 1991 that he showed up at national airport in a car all beat up right i um [Music] what just popped into my mind is that you may be talking about something having to do with blockchains and cryptocurrencies um well that&#x27;s what if that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what this guy stand or if alan yeah i know what you&#x27;re talking about so there may be in other words there may be back doors and all that stuff that have not uh apparently he worked there&#x27;s there&#x27;s our there&#x27;s our dark pools and our algorithmic training yes yeah very fascinating uh i&#x27;m going to take you back to the not tolaro meeting sorry gus no that&#x27;s okay i do i think this is going to expand out into what you just mentioned but uh i just want to for the record get that you sat down he mentions he&#x27;s uneasy about promise software and he wonders why the justice department is so hell-bent to cover it up or press this case or whatever it happens to be give me a little more of anything you remember just of being there even if it seems insignificant well uh he he apparently made a bunch of copies with some some guy you know and he didn&#x27;t tell me who the guy was but if i go back into stories um it&#x27;s this guy michael and standorf michael reconnaischuto yeah and standor oh yeah that are making that are making [Laughter] whoa marty marty just let me get this let me get this very clear and anybody out there who&#x27;s listening and knows the insaw story knows why i&#x27;m going apoplectic here what you&#x27;re suggesting is that casolero has somehow made a connection or knew or there was a connection directly between michael reconnaischudo and alan standorf of the nsa something like that that&#x27;s the impression i got oh wow holy cow no he was getting copies about this well no he just said they i didn&#x27;t i didn&#x27;t know who they were right you know who he says yeah we just made a bunch of you know copies uh and i didn&#x27;t you know what am i supposed to think copy cop wait a minute copies of what his file folder yeah phone number interesting uh i&#x27;m [Music] so in other words casolero has this big vanilla folder with all these what i saw was a dark brown accordion that&#x27;s all i saw i don&#x27;t know what he had by the time and you&#x27;re implying that that they somebody that castellero was in connect connected with that he and castellero made copies of this this accordion folder no that was his personal file he they they were just making copies of whatever these two guys were giving him i you know oh okay i got you yeah right right so let&#x27;s go back to that he&#x27;s saying we&#x27;re making copies with michael and this other guy um what else does he say about it he says you know this stuff that&#x27;s coming out of this is not making this is where he&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s not making sense to him you know these these these these files are pretty pretty extensive in other words they they have to do with uh he he said highly classified information right and he&#x27;s nervous at that point oh very nervous very nervous very serious completely different from the first time i met him interesting uh did you notice anything like has his appearance had it deteriorated did he seem like he lost weight or anything no no and more so adamant about getting to the bottom of this thing i see yeah uh he gives you a hint that he isn&#x27;t going to commit suicide [Laughter] no no no that did that never entered my mind what did he what did he say to you about it though i&#x27;m not the kind of person that will ever commit suicide but that&#x27;s an interesting thing to just slip into a conversation how did how did that come out like were you talking mentioned something about copies he&#x27;s uneasy about the case he&#x27;s i&#x27;m telling you whatever you&#x27;re into you&#x27;re kidding you&#x27;re you may be getting in over your head this is this is this is if you&#x27;re telling me this is how and you&#x27;re not you know you&#x27;re getting in over your head and he can and you know that&#x27;s when he said i will never kill myself holy cow unbelievable um were there any other names that came up whatever the guy&#x27;s name he wasn&#x27;t he wasn&#x27;t confident that the guy was on the up and up no he was yeah [Laughter] for good reason wow wait a minute marty let me make let me let i gotta get this straight in my head because i&#x27;m hearing a lot of this the first time too we don&#x27;t talk about that no we didn&#x27;t talk about this the other night i&#x27;m kind of breathless here okay so you&#x27;re meeting with casolero he just happens blindly to mention michael reconnaisciutto and you got to understand i don&#x27;t know this guy i i understand i understand a rabbit hole i got that i got that but anyway he&#x27;s mentioning michael reconnaisse shooter allen stand or peter vitinix okay and then on top of this this is where i&#x27;m confused hey cuz cuz he didn&#x27;t mention standor oh okay okay he didn&#x27;t mention him he mentioned michael but he didn&#x27;t mention standor okay all right so he&#x27;s mentioned michael or conochuto and that they he and somebody else were making copies the copies that he mentioned were you had the impression that they were of the promise software program or were they copies of actual other classified files i think they&#x27;re probably classified other files that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m that&#x27;s yeah okay and they were communications okay ah if they were communications were they using the promised software to to access those files and make the copies that&#x27;s you don&#x27;t know i don&#x27;t know i don&#x27;t know how they got him he just said they were there you know we made them i could speculate but i hear you i hear you no that&#x27;s good that&#x27;s good what&#x27;s great is when you go back to the meeting uh even if you remember little things about him you know uh his the way he was presenting himself if like he said he was nervous um and he was talking a little bit just anything else that you remember about the meeting that it drastic his demeanor drastically changed from one year to the next that&#x27;s a certainty yeah and and and it wasn&#x27;t defeatism he wasn&#x27;t defeated by any stretch of the imagination he was on to something couldn&#x27;t figure it out but was on to something that was my impression now the last name you mentioned it&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a tricky name too but he brought it up you remembered something about it and he didn&#x27;t trust this person right he he apparently had been going through something of this guy&#x27;s testimony he&#x27;d been going through it and it wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t adding up and and it didn&#x27;t make sense to him and like i said this was only 25 30 minutes again so it was like not very much but enough for me to go what&#x27;s going on here yeah yeah absolutely well it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an incredible chance meeting round two right boy uh now just so you&#x27;re remembering a few things from being around him uh he doesn&#x27;t have a file with him the second time around but how does he leave it with you the second time around what does he say i i came back at him again okay i came back at him again and said listen we must continue this you seem very very uptight this time i want to see you again we need to do this again you know and didn&#x27;t happen did you ever get the impression that he thought he was being followed uh yeah yeah he he he mentioned something about his his uh housemaid you know uh his housekeeper uh getting phone calls oh wow right okay just out of the blue either hanging up stuff like that but you know he didn&#x27;t he just mentioned it in in passing it wasn&#x27;t like that was a part of his conversation with him he said you know it&#x27;s weird that i get something like that it&#x27;s weird that phone call keep not getting much sleep let me go back to this guy that you say that he had been going that danny casalero had been going through this other guy&#x27;s testimony um [Music] presumably in connection with the promise case i imagine i i don&#x27;t know well i&#x27;m what did he mention peter vittinek&#x27;s name in connection with that testimony or is that is vitinek&#x27;s name not the name the name to me but then when i go back and i look at it after ends up dead i go geez oh okay i got you that&#x27;s one of the names he mentioned yeah so we know he&#x27;s talking about somebody named michael and he&#x27;s talking about this peter character and he says about the justice department that&#x27;s interesting that he brings it up and it&#x27;s like i don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re so hot on this in other words yeah that&#x27;s an interesting point daniel because this is the first time i&#x27;ve ever heard this the idea that cassolaro himself is wondering what&#x27;s the big deal why is all you know why is the justice department making such a big deal out of this software that&#x27;s the very first time i&#x27;ve ever heard this yeah in connection with castellero and his investigation yeah that is really interesting that he himself is mystified at the reaction well that&#x27;s what makes me think that there&#x27;s something to this story that there was a back door added before anybody else knew about it and before anybody else had done so the if that&#x27;s the case if you&#x27;re selling if you&#x27;re selling software if you&#x27;re the cia and you&#x27;ve had michael reconnaisciutto and whack and hut modify and and add all these back doors to the software that you then uh allow to be stolen in some cases by the soviet union or you sell cheap to the west german intelligence service and so on and then you discover that someone else besides you has a back door and it&#x27;s out there and they&#x27;ve got access to all this stuff then the justice department hits the panic but these are the indications because what&#x27;s fascinating is the fundamentalist christian novel yeah suggesting it right uh that there&#x27;s this fictional in the book but nonetheless we know referring possibly to a real person to a real person and uh the name on that barry cumnick there&#x27;s a lot of confusion online about this person as an actual person versus a character in that book which i also find interesting yeah um but in any case cumnick is supposedly the person who places the back door in the promise software before the justice department steals it right and if that k if that&#x27;s the case then what you&#x27;re suggesting joseph and what this kind of confusion around casolaro&#x27;s mind when he meets marty uh if those kind of answer each other because if the justice department figures out after it&#x27;s spread this software to these different countries intentionally and even allies then it realizes oh somebody&#x27;s watching us right because there&#x27;s already a back door inside of it um that is you know that makes so much sense with what we&#x27;re looking at if you look at right after the fact you go into 9 11 you go into the financial coup and you go into this massive worldwide hacking going along even to the arrest of assange you&#x27;re looking at a whole field that they&#x27;re trying to get their hands back on and put the genie back in the ball in the bottle right well you know who&#x27;s an interesting player in all of these events who william key bar oh yeah oh yeah he&#x27;s the guy that closed the case down on this thing right yep right that&#x27;s right excellent point and and he&#x27;s the guy uh that&#x27;s connected to the whole mena business and you know courtesy of terry reid in his book compromised the new covenant cuz yeah the new covenant yeah yeah exactly do you um marty when you when you left uh cassolaro going back again 1990 now we&#x27;re in that same period of time august september is the last time you see him uh do you have his phone number at that point how do you end it how do you end the conversation we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna see each other at the next ski chalet sale okay that&#x27;s just that&#x27;s where we met the medic the sales and uh he met me at the sale the second year we went out and had beers and that&#x27;s where we were going to meet again i don&#x27;t know where the sale was going to be at that time but wherever it was we were going to meet there but you know never made it to the end of august right exactly um do you um if you can go back to the first meeting for me again because we were talking a little bit before i even started recording about that first meeting and larry mcdonald and you hear him talking about bcci and these interesting things so i&#x27;m just going to re-ask that so forgive me for doing this um but marty can you remember that first encounter with cassolaro uh he not directly other than the fact that i turned to the ski wall and there was this guy that was about my high blonde hair outspoken talking to another person about that bank and that immediately drew me to him and i kind of just hung off to the side of the shoulder and when he got done i just said i can&#x27;t help overhear what you were talking about i work here as a rep and but i that&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not who i am but you&#x27;re talking about my business and i&#x27;d love to talk to you that&#x27;s how it was started interesting absolutely fascinating and somewhere in that conversation he was talking about bcci and that perked up your ears a little bit yeah and frankly i didn&#x27;t ever get back to that i didn&#x27;t ever get back to that uh other until we got to dinner that was right about the time that that the whole bcci story had had broken in the news i guess yeah yeah it would have been right about that period yeah um marty do you remember him making any predictions about this is gonna blow things sky high or anything like that oh he was he was adamant that this is uh this is a a uh thriller beyond manila i mean this was this was something very very big and had a lot of big names and a lot of uh big business involved so yeah i mean he said he was saying that this was going to take him to a different level did he ever mention any government officials names other other than hamilton you know other than hamilton that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the only official he he said because that&#x27;s wha what did he say about hamilton [Music] i assume you&#x27;re talking about bill hamill bill hamilton he said that these are the people that actually started the software program right when when promise went in my ear i wanted to know more about it and that&#x27;s what he said did he ever indicate that he had that he was contacted by the hamiltons directly to look into all of this and that part of the reason why he was doing all did he ever intimate any of that i can&#x27;t because for the life of me i can&#x27;t figure out if it was him that went after bill or bill that went after him i can&#x27;t i i can&#x27;t remember nor do i think that he ever said anything that&#x27;s an interesting way of putting it because usually the way that that the story is presented by people who&#x27;ve researched castellero and his association with the promise story is that he was contacted by the hamiltons see i didn&#x27;t i needed that interesting yeah i wasn&#x27;t privy did he mention uh military anything about the military or anything about intelligence services like the nsa well when he mentioned bill he said bill used to work for these guys for him um that&#x27;s it but not no no military ever got involved i did the word did the name whack-and-hut come up no no but that that what that name did come up after the fact for me because that&#x27;s i went to work for dhs back in 2002 and black nut was a name that i kind of ran into oh yeah that&#x27;s what the yeah that&#x27;s one heck of a job i can imagine um that&#x27;s absolutely fascinating and joseph do you want to spin around now and talk about how the crypto part of that caught yeah well the crypto part catches my attention uh danny daniel danny castle you&#x27;re right i&#x27;m talking about danny yeah you&#x27;re not that one um the reason why is that we know that shortly after 9 11 the west german bnd the german intelligence service got rid of all of their promise software now why they chose to wait that long and and choose a post 911 date for it but here here&#x27;s what i&#x27;m thinking as i mentioned to you before we started the recording it looks to me daniel and marty as if the promise software which is a multi-lingual computer software in other words it can read in other computer languages and tabulate and assemble databases regardless of what the language that the database is written in okay it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an immensely sophisticated program especially for back then yes so what that tells me is is if we&#x27;re and and let&#x27;s remember that the recent case i think it was 2005 or 2006 they arrested that chinese spy in arizona for trying to to steal secrets from sandia laboratories well the guy went on to admit that he had been using the promise software to do all of this oh right so so here that tells me that you&#x27;re dealing with the software that&#x27;s spread all over the world it&#x27;s in use in all these classified installations and it&#x27;s gone through several iterations and if it allows you to to pull databases from a variety of languages it&#x27;s also the perfect software to use in banks and for things like algorithmic trading and here comes the big one it&#x27;s a perfect software to use in crypto currencies oh yeah and run mining operations that yeah that makes so much sense yeah that would be the modern 2022 iteration that would be the 2022 iteration of a software program that&#x27;s been out there since the 19th late 1970s early 1980s so in other words the problem here is that what i&#x27;m seeing is we know the castellero story cassolaro basically a law and michael reconnaischudo you know god bless him gave his affidavits as part of the court record that yes he was part of a team hired by the cia through the wagon hut corporation to go in and add back doors to this software right and the software in turn was seeded by the reagan administration and in some cases they allowed the soviets to steal copies of it right you know so that they can shut down the soviet union at the press of a button right um they they do all of this but unfortunately they go on to learn that before it ever gets into their hands before they steal it from inslaw somebody unbeknownst to inslaw itself has put in a back door that&#x27;s it yeah this is the key point that&#x27;s to me that&#x27;s the key point and what i get from marty from your recollection of meeting cassalaro is he has that same wondering about this like why are they freaking out to this level yeah and uh reconnaissauto provided that to the house intelligence committee yeah he certainly did yeah and shortly after that he got arrested for running a meth lab he gets stuck in prison for 17 years and by the way by the way reconnaissance the guy that helps work on things like fuel air bombs and adapting nuclear triggers for nuclear weapons to the use of fuel air boxes and it&#x27;s michael reconnaischuto by the way that ted gunderson interviews after the oklahoma city bombing and it&#x27;s reconnaissauto that says no that&#x27;s a fuel air bomb [Laughter] um marty i&#x27;m just going to take you back to the time period one last time okay yeah and it&#x27;s after you hear the news that castle arrow is dead and they they&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s suicide and you&#x27;re thinking back to the conversations and these chance meetings with him uh what are you hearing and and what are you feeling at that point uh i&#x27;m i&#x27;m immediately red pill okay i&#x27;m immediately that that red pilled me for life that whole thing i i was i was going down rabbit holes before that just in college you know but they weren&#x27;t they weren&#x27;t big it was you know meena and that kind of stuff when i was in college but this red tilled me for life i mean i i couldn&#x27;t get out of my head i knew he didn&#x27;t commit suicide i knew that something fishy had gone on um well his file i mean that big file accordion file that you saw him carrying it&#x27;s never it&#x27;s gone yeah and he&#x27;s reputed to have carried that with him everywhere everywhere do you guys know that the freedom of information act has been applied to the martinsburg police department every single year every year over and over again probably three or four times a year for the information on this case and it is yet to be released i can believe it it&#x27;s unbelievable uh they skipped the autopsy and buried the body without the family&#x27;s permission i mean they had it cremated one of the detectives on the cases was the chief of police ended up as being the chief of police of martinsburg for a while uh-huh and i believe that the medical examiner was no other than uh what was his name again i can&#x27;t thank you oh i know who you&#x27;re talking about baden yeah right dr michael baden who became very famous after all that oh yes yes right this guy goes all the way back to the house assassination committees in the seventh grade and he&#x27;s like oh no you&#x27;re the magic bullet&#x27;s the real thing and yeah yeah you&#x27;re a guy and then he gets his own hbo special well that&#x27;s pretty good joseph if you play ball with the establishment not bad huh i i have to ask you another question marty okay because i&#x27;m hearing stuff way beyond what we were talking about the other night when we were talking about all this um when you were talking with casolero did he ever give you the impression or just come right out and say where he had been traveling no no he didn&#x27;t he didn&#x27;t give me any indications of his schedule or his you know his his operations other than the fact that he needed to interview a bunch of people right now he needed to find out you know what these people had to do with this what these guys had to do with that right okay so in other words he he was he indicated that he traveled a lot but he was very cautious about giving out any specific details of where and when he was going to be yeah he he wasn&#x27;t giving me very much you know even though i was prodding him it wasn&#x27;t like uh he was willing to give me everything he knew and that&#x27;s why i was so interested in him and i wanted to keep coming back i knew that this guy was on to something and you know i was i was more persistent with him than he was with me right you had these one-on-one conversations were there other people just from the event and stuff who are with you and was he mixing it up generally when you have these conversations well he had mixed it up all during the ski sale probably for about an hour or so i reckon i&#x27;m pretty good with faces and i i saw him make his way around for about an hour before i introduced myself um when he was mixing and mingling was he talking with a lot of people yeah it looked like it i mean you know he&#x27;s talking with like he he it even looked like he knew a couple of them so i don&#x27;t know and i only participated i i didn&#x27;t you know i didn&#x27;t really get to know very many of the schizolay staff i don&#x27;t know if any of them ever knew danny you know danny frequented arlington area quite a bit you know that&#x27;s fairfax was his rolling ground um that&#x27;s very interesting the comments about his uh you know housemaid taking weird calls is interesting as well so that seemed to kind of unnerve him a little bit yeah yeah he was there at this was it your impression that he was there at the at the ski chalet show because a lot of the washington elite attended that show that&#x27;s kind of what i got that&#x27;s kind of what i got yeah he was more there to see who was there i think that&#x27;s right the impression i got right interesting yeah and perhaps also to meet a contact or somebody in in a setting that would not be all that suspicious very very possible because you know so so many of these questions ran through my head after yeah yeah right but it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re not thinking of him so much as a ski enthusiast is this is a good way for him to know for him to yeah to operate wow this is absolutely fascinating because when we look at the trail of uh hamilton making that software after having a career at the nsa already we know that the stuff is is very advanced probably based on the fact that he was working at the nsa all the way back to the 60s right when he reaches out to you joseph uh it&#x27;s in relation to the fact that you&#x27;re blogging about this uh christian fundamentalist book that mentions yeah i i wouldn&#x27;t say blogging but somehow i was i was putting out that information publicly right and you know i don&#x27;t remember where it was if it was a blog it was on george anne hughes&#x27;s show but i do remember putting it out there and he contacted me because apparently he had heard or read what i said and conte somehow tracked me down because i get this email directly from him and in fact when when he told me who he was i asked for you know i emailed back and basically says how do i know you are who you say you are right yeah right and how do i even know that you&#x27;re bill hamilton yeah he assured me that that he was he gave me some information and so on so that&#x27;s when i responded that you know i&#x27;m getting this information from a book if this is the author&#x27;s name the title the isbn number i remember it being white i remember it being about an inch thick uh octavo size you know six by nine paper back size um but that&#x27;s all i you know that&#x27;s all the information i i had and he was clearly interested if in knowing if i had more information about that about that guy and if so where was he and i had to tell him no i don&#x27;t know anything about him i&#x27;ve never had any contact with him uh and after it was after that that i you know just like you i started looking online and yeah there does appear to have been a barry cumnick uh it&#x27;s an odd name yes um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not a it&#x27;s not as far as i can tell a name that&#x27;s associated with programming in all of its iterations but you never know you know um [Music] so it&#x27;s a strange story and that that was not the last time that mr hamilton contacted me he contacted me again a few years later uh if i remember correctly my mind is kind of like marty&#x27;s i&#x27;m going on memories of things well you know when you know you&#x27;re both doing a good job with that well these things happen to you you don&#x27;t realize that you have no idea yeah you&#x27;re that you&#x27;re on the periphery of something you know huge right um but he did contact me later and i forget what it was for i think it was to relay some information and see if i&#x27;d heard anything in addition to that and again i i had to say no but uh this is certainly new yeah you know uh hearing all of this that castle what what&#x27;s new here and that really grabs me daniel is okay marty met castellero and castellero is looking at this whole promise story and it&#x27;s not making sense to him and this is all new yeah because it&#x27;s cassolaro that basically uncovered this whole mess we wouldn&#x27;t be talking about it to this day if it wasn&#x27;t for what he did and if it&#x27;s not making sense to casalero then there&#x27;s an aspect of the story that cassolaro himself who uncovered all these details there&#x27;s an aspect in all these details not making sense to him and the only thing that i can think of is yeah maybe maybe the back door was added the original one long before the department of justice stole it and if that&#x27;s the case yeah somebody has everybody over a pickle barrel exactly um well let&#x27;s go into that a little bit because i get the impression when hamilton writes to you and what you&#x27;ve put out there rings a bell with him and again you&#x27;re reading this christian fundamentalist novel and in the middle of it there&#x27;s all this information about innslaw that&#x27;s inserted in there and this character uh barry cumnick now i&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll go let me interrupt you yes in the novel who whoever it was that wrote this dang thing in the novel barry cumnick basically disappears after inserting the back door right he just drops off the grid and is using this back door to cloak his movements and so on basically in other words he is set for what he&#x27;s he&#x27;s become the robert vesco of the programming hanging out in the hot zones yeah hanging out in the hot zone you know talking to fidel who knows [Laughter] but yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a bizarre novel you know he goes to all this trouble just to drop out you know yeah um but anyway it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a weird novel i i didn&#x27;t mean to interrupt you but i had i had to absolutely absolutely here&#x27;s what i&#x27;m thinking about this um i get the impression hamilton when i&#x27;ve read hamilton&#x27;s statements about this he is also a little bit bewildered by the extent to which he&#x27;s prosecuted for trying to sue the government after all for stealing his software for stealing his software right absolutely and uh elliot richardson i know is attorney general yeah but he&#x27;s also hamilton&#x27;s lawyer right right exactly and this is fascinating because he&#x27;s involved in uh the special intel committee looking into this and what he says is if i get this right this is makes watergate look like a walk in the park and of course he was the attorney general who resigned under watergate he would know um that&#x27;s a huge statement on the record by a very hefty government official so he was convinced just but what by what he saw in the committee so he&#x27;s convinced hamilton also as i&#x27;ve said in his public statements didn&#x27;t realize you know what he was getting himself into dealing with this but it seems to me they all had a question mark casolaro richardson and hamilton is right at the heart of it they&#x27;re wondering and you&#x27;re him reaching out to you and what you found there in that novel about the idea that somebody had placed a back door in it before it had been stolen it explains a lot and would answer a lot of those questions and that&#x27;s why it rang a bell for him right now let&#x27;s go further let&#x27;s talk about some other software right let&#x27;s talk about hamilton securities and catherine austin fitz brian and her placed based software that she developed for hamilton&#x27;s securities could that kind of sought would that kind of software be of interest to the government yes yeah would you would you attempt if you were the government to put a back door in said software yes who&#x27;s the judge that handled her case why it was judge nicholas bua oh the same judge the same guy that handled the promise case that is unbelievable appointed by bar appointed by barr absolutely remarkable information stay right there gentlemen and we&#x27;ll do another hour bringing out the deep implications surrounding this break in the promise software case and how it reverberates today in the efforts to enact emergency powers through the continuity of government cog program we&#x27;ll also take a deep look at casolaro&#x27;s investigation into the ufo file and how the key source for castle laurel genius software programmer michael reconnichuto also was connected to ufo investigations through his father&#x27;s business partner fred crisman involved in the maury island ufo case now part 2 will be available at darkjournalist.com in the next 24 hours of course you can find dr farrell&#x27;s work at gizadethstar.com please join us on friday nights at 8 pm live
