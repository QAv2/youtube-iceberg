            <p>foreign Anderson today we&#x27;re going to go down the list of the least expensive to the most expensive antivirus program packages that are out there on the market today [Music] the necessary evil that is antivirus program protection plans are just one of those costs you&#x27;re just gonna have to eat the cost of not having that PC protected by an antivirus program far outpaces what it would cost to buy any one of these programs we&#x27;re going over five and we&#x27;re going to break them down by cost one at a time the first is going to be Bit Defender Bit Defender comes in and two or actually three different um programs or platforms you have the Plus which is nineteen dollars and 99 Cents so it&#x27;s regularly priced at 59 and you can protect the free PCS the Internet Security package um that it has this is a second tier is around 32.99 it&#x27;s regular is 84.99 and you can protect up to three devices Total Security is their pretty much their Cadillac plan at 35.99 per year regularly up to a hundred dollars which is 99.99 and you can protect up to five devices there are other more advanced programs that have been around a lot longer one of them is Norton used to be Samantha but Norton 360 is another program more than any virus is a well-producted name the AV plus comes in at 19.99 usually 59.99 and you only get one device to be protected by that um program then you have your Norton 360 plan Norton 360 standard comes in at 39 a year regularly 94.99 but you can protect up to three devices with that said we come in at the Thornton 360 Deluxe 360 Deluxe is 49.99 so uh Savings of the 114.99 dollars out it five devices and finally you have Norton 360 with its Life Lock select this is a new feature um that not too many of the other platforms are offering this is one differentiator the thing LifeLock is one of those things that unlocks your credit report it comes in at a hundred dollars a year usually 179.99 and you get 10 devices protected that is the different factor with that program next up getting up there in price we&#x27;re talking about Trend Micro Trend Micro has an Internet Security um protection plan that starts at 39.99 regularly at 79.99 and protects up to three devices maximum security by Trend Mac micro is this middleware there&#x27;s about 49.99 regularly 89.99 five devices and it&#x27;s premium security 59.99 a year regularly a hundred and fifty dollars nine and uh up to 10 devices alrighty McAfee you guys have heard this a lot now my biggest complaint about McAfee is it&#x27;s incompatibility with so many programs I&#x27;ve run into it both professionally and personally where it is installed how it&#x27;s run where it eats up a lot of resources especially on boot time is one of the ways I make a whole lot of money doing PC repair um that said is it one of the best programs out there it&#x27;s been around long enough but there&#x27;s been enough headaches to go with this particular program it&#x27;s not going anywhere again necessary evil it&#x27;s premium packages it&#x27;s lowest tier it&#x27;s at 54.99 it&#x27;s regularly 150 dollars but you also have this advanced 89.99 regular 110 and the 200 ultimate saving you about 79 from its usual at 279.99 these are all individual pricing plans for one PC it is one of the costliest out there if not the cost is but they have a family plan that is truly unlimited unlimited number of devices for two adults and four children within the household premium family plan is 64.99 a year regularly 169 dollars this is talking about things like your tablets your cell phones your game consoles that kind of thing you also have um the 99 dollar Advanced platform um usually 269 dollars for unlimited devices and finally 219 dollars per year for the ultimate protection plan while from McAfee regularly 424.99 by far the most expensive protection plan out there think carefully before you install this particular one but again it&#x27;s one of those names that says been out there for a while people recognize it finally Malwarebytes it made its name primarily by uh preventing and protecting malicious software spyware and malware before this whole protection plan package thing came to be there was a differentiating factor between a virus and some potentially dangerous malware that would include cyber attacks ransomware that kind of thing things that would affect the user financially things that you couldn&#x27;t remove unless you paid money to some weirdo with a telephone number um they&#x27;re now getting into Total Protection the price plans on these things their premium is at 59.99 for three devices you have your Premium Plus privacy VPN 79.99 for three devices and finally the premium privacy VPN for five devices at a hundred dollars those are my um most expensive uh least expensive to the most expensive protection plans out there make sure you pick one don&#x27;t skip when it comes to your security again the cost of getting this PC reperto replacing that day data is a drop in the bucket when you uh compared to what you&#x27;re going to lose the cost of having these things protected with the software is a drop in the bucket to what you would lose if you lost that PC again thank you for uh joining us remember that time is money not all money is good money watch how you spend it I will talk to you very very</p>
