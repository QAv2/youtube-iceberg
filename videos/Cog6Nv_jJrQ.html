            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>an interview I did in December last year where I talked about my understanding that a large number of the scientists that are working on What&#x27;s euphemistically called the program based in and around Huntsville Alabama and that rightly or wrongly that city has become the focus of a very intense Espionage effort by overseas spy services and that it had been reported to me by not one but two sources that they&#x27;ve been deliberate attempts to cause injury to people who are working on the periphery of that program and there was concern that some of the people that are working in the program are not being adequately protected and this is one of the reasons why I was being contacted and other friends of mine have been contacted as well that there&#x27;s a concern that basically scientists working in essentially research related to ongoing anti-gravitics research are suffering harassment from overseas Espionage intelligence services um as regards ning Lee she&#x27;s now passed away she was a chinese-american scientist of great repute who told my good friend Nick cook back in 2003 the chap who wrote The Hunt for zero point she told Nick um well she left Nick was the impression that she was a lot closer to a breakthrough in anti-drivitics uh then I think publicly has been acknowledged by the US government and certainly uh I&#x27;m not suggesting that the research which is ongoing at the moment is definitively linked to ning Lee&#x27;s research but I&#x27;m told that anti-gravidics research continues in the United States at the moment and indeed you know any diligent researcher can find reference to programs that such as grasp um which are still functioning and referred to in the black world I don&#x27;t know how advanced they are and neither should I frankly I mean I&#x27;m cheering them on frankly if America can get a breakthrough in anti-gravidics before the Russians or the Chinese I bloody will hope they do because frankly I wouldn&#x27;t want authoritarian dictatorships like the Russians or the Chinese controlling the technology that is represented by the propulsion systems that we&#x27;re seeing in our skies and that&#x27;s implicit in the conversations that I&#x27;m having with people from all over the world there&#x27;s a genuine concern at the moment that there&#x27;s essentially a a cold war there&#x27;s an arms race going on between um uh the good guys the five eyes Alliance and and people in uh Russia and China who are determined to try and get an advance in this technology ahead of the Americans and they&#x27;ll do that at any cost they&#x27;ll do that with Espionage if necessary and so to that extent I&#x27;m actually sympathetic and understanding of why there may be a reluctance inside the intelligence Community to make any kind of official admission and it&#x27;s why I&#x27;m skeptical that we&#x27;re going to see any kind of rollover before the Congress where some official actually admits rolls over Supine and lets them tickle his tummy and basically says yeah okay it&#x27;s true we&#x27;ve been lying to you guys all along for the last 70 years I just don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to see that</p>
