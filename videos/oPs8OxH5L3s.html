            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>about a month ago I was asked to do a public service announcement regarding something that&#x27;s very important that&#x27;s going on right now and I was trying to consider what would the best timing of this be as well as the message but you know the future of the future is the present and the present is right this moment when you&#x27;re seeing this so this is a present for you because it is good news it&#x27;s very good news but it&#x27;s going to require a lot of public support for the public not only in the United States but all over the world to get behind so I&#x27;ll do my best to encapsulate in a short amount of time what is currently underway in 1989 there was two scientists by the name of Stanley ponds and Bob Fleischmann who made an announcement at the University of Utah regarding the new form of discovered energy that was Fusion at room temperature using water and a triggering mechanism to make cold fusion a lot of you have heard of that but a lot of you have not kept up with what&#x27;s really going on with that it&#x27;s been over 30 years since that was first developed and announced and we are in a completely new position right now because of the developments that have been going on behind the scenes by many different companies all over the world now one of the most important things to remember and look up for yourself because this will do nothing for you if you do not research this yourself so my first suggestion would be if you go into YouTube and go to Cold Fusion 60 minutes and watch that news program still today this day this is the go-to piece for most people that are unaware of this particular energy source in this news announcement that took place many years ago when they made that it&#x27;s well over 10 years ago and also I would suggest that you go to coldfusionnow.org and then you can research the subject that I&#x27;m talking about this is been all over the news as of late in radio and you&#x27;re going to see in the next couple of months major news articles coming out regarding this and it&#x27;s going to be one of the most important discussions in the world because of the effects of what this is going to do a lot of people say well why James are you involved with this well I&#x27;ve been involved with it since the very beginning but in a completely totally different form I was involved discussing the actual effects of what this would do prior to the actual deployment of it in the development of it because when you have this type of Technology available it changes the actual relationship between everybody each other other countries everything would change within culture regarding this but it would also do the most important thing the most important thing for Humanity right now is to reframe and reset its relationship with the planet there is a component to this particular thing it&#x27;s not just technology ones and zeros money greed monopolies military weaponization and all those things those indeed are things on the table but there&#x27;s one thing on the table that&#x27;s the most important thing of all this is the first time in history where technology like this has had a spiritual component to it by the presence of The Real Americans in the United States that is the Lakota Sioux Tribe that was first on the spot to make public support of this technology many many years ago this came through the American Indian who most of you may have heard of by the name of Russell means he was a famous actor and one of the important people that start up the American Indian movement this month is the 50th anniversary of Wounded Knee so if you want to learn a little bit more about Russell means that&#x27;s what made him famous initially other people remember him from Last of the Mohicans and all of the speeches he did and whatnot fighting for freedom and civil rights for not only his people but for the entire world but what people do not know and they don&#x27;t realize is prior to his death he asked me that and requested that I bring this technique to the Lakota Sioux Indians so Lakota Sioux Indians did their own research following his footsteps and realized that this is probably one of the most important discoveries ever in the history of History because of the energy source it comes from water the energy source hydrogen in the water and our relationship to water because we&#x27;re a water planet and most of our bodies are made of water so this is a completely totally new fusion and marriage between our spiritual selves and Technology a first of its kind now what you&#x27;re going to see in the next couple of months is an American Indian presence regarding the subject matter that has happened but most of the time it&#x27;s been covered up and a lot of people don&#x27;t realize that at all however there is video footage of America&#x27;s most famous American Indian right now who&#x27;s the name Phyllis young Phyllis young is the Secretary of Russell Means and took over all of his work upon his passing she made a speech in Washington DC a long time ago in front of congressional people and scientists which frankly probably was one of the most important speeches ever regarding the relationship between technology humanity and our future so this is a great moment we&#x27;re at right now however we need the entire world including the public that includes every one of you that sees this to stand behind this do your own research and start talking about it with your elected employees who work for you because they are not going to do anything it&#x27;s going to be up to you to see this thing through so one of the things that I was asked to do in putting this</p>
