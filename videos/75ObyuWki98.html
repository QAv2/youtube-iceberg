            <p>all right everybody how you doing out there I&#x27;m Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos on mostly obscure matters that I don&#x27;t think should be obscure uh but uh as of right now people are not don&#x27;t know about them so I&#x27;m trying to uh shed some light um now we just last episode we just got finished going through uh Dewey B Larson&#x27;s outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system of theory and um you know that&#x27;s kind of like laying the groundwork for understanding how his thought process works and how the system works itself today we&#x27;re going to be uh going through starting to go through his final book uh which is called the beyond space and time now as you know Larson&#x27;s uh basic theory is that the universe is made out of motion it&#x27;s not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it&#x27;s made out of motion and motion uh other people have said that before including Thomas Hobbs I think Renee Descartes and um uh somebody else as well but um Larson made it stick a little bit better because he defined motion as the relationship between space and time okay so space and time are these two entities that come together in motion and they have a reciprocal relationship with each other meaning that they are basically identical to each other but they are the numerator and denominator of a fraction and that that whole fraction is the motion and um really every kind of scientific phenomena that you can think of is some type of relationship between space and time and space and time have uh the identical qualities space we know to be three-dimensional or more and time therefore is three-dimensional or more and time we know to progress things are always getting later and later and later and therefore space Also progresses things are moving farther and farther apart and we see that in the progression uh recession of the distant galaxies now uh Larson&#x27;s uh early work uh he is a uh was a mining engineer and um most of his early experimental work was on um chemical matters uh he&#x27;s trying to figure out an equation for the inter-atomic distance and then once he started writing books his first uh his first book was called the case against the nuclear atom uh really saying that there is no nucleus an atom does not have a nucleus an atom is a kind is a motion It&#x27;s a combination of motions and um that wasn&#x27;t directly related to his theory then after that he came this is about 1959 and after that he came out with his structure of the physical universe which is primarily on um chemical relations uh also some um you know Atomic relations and astronomical relations but then he expanded the theory because it is a system of theory it&#x27;s something that you can uh take these original uh uh postulates and you can apply them once you learn kind of you have to kind of learn how to apply them once you learn how to apply them then you can apply them to any subject so it&#x27;s a system um and so he in the 60s he began to apply his um his his uh postulates or his system to economics and he did a couple books on economics one is called the road to permanent prosperity and the other one is called the road to full employment uh we will go over those books at some point um I&#x27;m still uh trying to parse out the uh the one on the permanent Prosperity uh which is the more important one I think um but then you know he he wrote a lot of books on astronomy quasars and pulsars he had this book called The neglected facts of Science in the early 80s um and then in the 80s he kind of revamped his structure of the physical Universe to put it out in three volumes first volume uh was called Nothing But motion and that introduced a lot of the physical relations um uh reference systems and atoms and um you know kind of just the the basic nuts and bolts then uh the second book in the series even though it came out third uh was called basic properties of matter that&#x27;s on uh chemical relations you know inter-atomic distance melting and boiling points heat specific heat compressibility um and also the charges electro magnetic charges um Isotopes all kinds of things related to chemistry and then [Music] is the last book in the series that came out in 1984 is uh the universe of motion which is a um astronomical um work but then uh he died in 1990 and uh posthumously this last book came up that&#x27;s called beyond space and time and this is where he goes beyond space and time and he applies the reciprocal system of theory to metaphysics and um philosophy and religion and um you know I just kind of read some of the chapter titles that he has the nature of science uh reaching outward levels of existence um and uh communication revelation uh information Miracles emotions memory and thinking [Music] um the stuff of Dreams uh dream interpretation free will um right and wrong good and evil moral values the moral objective personal aspect of ethics uh humanism religion re-examined east and west and outlook for communication and that&#x27;s communication with uh extraterrestrials more or less the road ahead and uh survival and uh that&#x27;s really survival of uh the soul and human Destiny so where we&#x27;re going so those are most of the chapters in this book uh beyond space and time uh we&#x27;ll kind of uh try to go through each one of these chapters um in brief you know not today but uh gradually we&#x27;ll try to get through them maybe today we&#x27;ll just try to get through the first couple chapters okay first uh in the preface um he says I am examining some of the fundamentals of biology for inter instance not as a specialist in biology but as a specialist in fundamentals a fundamentalists and this is the Pioneer expedition in to this hitherto scientifically Uncharted region and um you know as a fundamentalist he&#x27;s he&#x27;s basically starting with the fundamentals those relations having to do with space and time and then he&#x27;s constructing his whole universe from that so he&#x27;s he&#x27;s you know breaking it down starting at the um at the most basic level in building up his universe and you know as I said in uh previous episodes uh you know the first that Larson first came up with his this idea he&#x27;s working on this equation for the inter-atomic distance and he eventually uh kind of had this Epiphany uh back in about 1930 that said why don&#x27;t you know take that equation that you&#x27;re working on and just assume that space and time are reciprocals of each other and so he plugged that into the equation and it was like the answer popped out uh you know or unanswer popped out and uh you know he&#x27;s like wow you know that was very unexpected and so months later he was working on another equation that had to do with a similar matter and he had the same idea why don&#x27;t you try plugging space just assuming that space and time are reciprocals of each other and plug it into the equation and he did that and another fruitful result occurred uh you know he got another answer and um he started doing it more systematically and he realized that he was getting answer after answer after answer to problems that he was having then he started plugging taking that same assumption and plugging it into uh conundrums that the Legacy scientists had about specific problems long-standing problems in science things that scientific that scientists have been stumped by and that haven&#x27;t been able to kind of make any advancement over a period of years he started plugging into those and he started getting answers about those and then he was kind of finally like I think I&#x27;m onto something you know I&#x27;m gonna try to make uh you know us um systematic study of this and to to you know figure this out um he had to go back and you know go back in the history see the history of all all of this and and uh figure things out so from the from the period of about 1930 until up to about 1950 he was working with what he called the inductive phase of the reciprocal system and so the inductive phase the inductive reasoning is really where you are working from the specific to the general so you&#x27;re trying to take specific um observations specific results empirical results that you&#x27;re getting that you&#x27;ve gotten from uh doing experiments or other people doing experiments and taking these specific results and applying it to General um General you know laws or generals uh ramifications of these specific instances so he says you know inductive reasoning is essentially a recourse to probability so when you&#x27;re using inductive reasoning you you not know not only need to be able to uh apply it to the general uh principle but then you have to verify it through um other means um so the the uh inductive reasoning is like a a probability what are the what are the probabilities that um you know if this applies to the specific thing that it would also apply to this other thing and this is you know similar uh for anybody who&#x27;s watched any of my videos on Tree of Life uh similar to the um side of the uh the pillar uh on the tree that has to do with intuition and um imagination um and um uh really like even anticipation [Music] um Revelation and insight these things um you know they kind of they come to you and it&#x27;s really being uh uh where you&#x27;re taking kind of a specific instance and you&#x27;re hypothesizing well what if this applies to everything um now that is not valid in and of itself it requires verification as well you can make a kind of a hypothesis about this but it needs to be verified um the the opposite isn&#x27;t true for in for deductive reasoning which is more on the other side of the of the Tree of Life where um when you go from the general to the specific um you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t necessarily need to uh verify that so here he says an independent verification of the conclusions thus reached is essential okay now um so once he got to a certain point about 1950 with this reciprocal system going through this uh you know having the J having the specific result and then trying to see if it applies in the general case uh once he was satisfied that he had that he was on to something then he switched to a deductive development and that&#x27;s where we you know just left off yesterday where we&#x27;re going through the deductive development of the reciprocal system and it&#x27;s just like if this then this if this then this we&#x27;ve got the general you know the general idea and those are the postulates of the theory here here&#x27;s the general and now we see does it apply in this specific you know how to apply it to this specific instance how to apply it to this specific thing and so um you know he through this in deductive process you know he eventually arrives at okay this is what an atom is this is what a photon is this is what an electron is um you know so that is that is what we went through for the past 15 episodes of this was his deductive development and that you know he did that for the rest of his life from 1950 until about 1990 when he died now this book came out in 1995 this book here the beyond space and time uh it was published posthumously by his his widow and uh Dorothy and she uh took some heat because uh a lot of the kind of a hard-headed scientists that were involved with Larson uh through Isis the international Society for a unified science um and people that followed him in the journal and and contributed to the journal reciprocity um that was active in the 70s and 80s and 90s um they were in almost embarrassed by this beyond space and time because they looked at Larson as really like a hard-headed cold-blooded scientist and here he is coming out with all this fluffy stuff um of liberal arts stuff about Free Will and right and wrong and and uh you know dream interpretation and uh Revelation and religion and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re like this is not science you know this is like social science at best um and you know this isn&#x27;t Larson Larson was writing this stuff for his own edification he never wanted this to be published um and so a lot of the people were very angry about the release of this beyond space and time volume uh and you know I mean it&#x27;s hard to say I don&#x27;t know if this is a complete work it seems to be pretty complete you know it seems to be that all 28 chapters or whatever are you know his pretty much his full thoughts on the matter but you never know you never know whether he actually wanted this to go out or not because he he died before he had the personal chance to publish it so anyway um uh we&#x27;re just gonna in the last couple minutes here we&#x27;ll just look at the third chapter uh the um the uh it&#x27;s called the reciprocal system and you&#x27;re just saying the common denominator of matter and non-matter is motion now again he&#x27;s he&#x27;s looking at the two different halves of the universe that he constructed and this is his difference you know one of his breaks with Einstein you know Einstein is really saying that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe nothing can move faster than the speed of light Larson is saying that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light and then the other half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light and those two halves are reciprocals of each other May they&#x27;re inverses of each other meaning that they are identical except they have space and time inverted at you know on the slow side of the universe the relationships are all space over time and in the fast side of the universe the relationships are time over space um and so he calls this half of the universe the material sector and he calls this half of the universe the cosmic sector and so the cosmic sector is where we get all of these metaphysical relations you know the first dozen books or whatever 15 books that he wrote were mainly having to do with the material sector even though he he dabbled into the cut into the cosmic sector but this here this last book is a full uh expose so to speak on the cosmic sector okay we&#x27;ll stop there and we&#x27;ll start up uh again with uh chapter three here uh next time all right have a great day see you later</p>
