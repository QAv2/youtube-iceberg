            <p>so did you know how big the oil and gas industry was in 2022 like dollar-wise is it $500 billion a trillion 2 trillion what if I told you it&#x27;s $5 trillion and what if I told you these people that are in that industry found out about a guy named Stanley Meyer many years ago who built a car that ran on water and in an interview he believes it can go Coast to Coast on 22 gallons of water and then all of a sudden according to this documentary during dinner he&#x27;s saying he&#x27;s getting poison and he drops and he dies and there&#x27;s a bunch of other guys that had these types of Technology but they didn&#x27;t want it to come out and you&#x27;re getting reports from Bloomberg coming out saying the fact that green Energy Research team estimates a new report this week that it could cost $196 trillion in Investments to reach zero out of the world&#x27;s carbon emissions by 2050 McKenzie says 275 another Swiss fre organization says 23 trillion a year a bunch of these guys are saying $2 to $300 trillion for us to go to Net Zero but what if we already have that technology which as some people don&#x27;t want the public to know about it because they want you to keep going to the gas station cuz God forbid if we solve that problem that may get rid of a $5 trillion industry is that a fair question to ask I don&#x27;t know but we&#x27;re going down the rabbit hole again okay so if you get value out of this video give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel but you may be watching the same pad why should I care about this honestly I got so many other things to care about here&#x27;s why and in 2021 the US spent $1.3 trillion on energy 5.7% of our gross domestic product GDP on a per capita basis the annual energy cost was 3,967 per person per person you the average American household pays 6,888 in utility bills per year and Americans spend roughly 3.2% of their budget on gas every year give or take $2100 and by the way this is happening while the average salary in America according to Bureau of Labor Statistics is roughly little over $59,000 so that&#x27;s a lot of money for somebody making 59k a year so now remember earlier I told you that Bloomberg&#x27;s said 196 trillion how much we going to be spending by 2050 the question may be how what does that look like this is what it looks like if you break it down and by the way from 22 to 23 to 24 to 25 26 the biggest jump in annual investment required is this decade they want to raise investment into this this decade you and I have to pay for it and that increase will be to Blue is electric vehicles green is low carb and power grids hydrogen carbon capture and storage heat pumps sustainable materials fossil fuel processes and fossil fuel power President Biden said himself the global temperature rising more than 1 and a half degrees Celsius in the next two decades is scarier than nuclear war AOC said the world is going to end in 12 years if we don&#x27;t address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it and Al Gore famous Al Gore became famous like this if we don&#x27;t take action there could be as many as 1 billion climate refugees Crossing International borders in the next several decades sounds scary when you read this is this fear porn are they really concerned about you and I who knows but let&#x27;s take a look so you maybe watch and say is there a political message here are you defending Republicans or not Democrats are you defending who are you defending in this message listen Republicans are trying to protect oil and gas Democrats are all about climate change both of them are getting money from these guys they don&#x27;t want those guys to stop making money cuz then they&#x27;re not going to give money and what if there is a solution to actually get rid of this $4 trillion investment every year and not have to say we need to spend $196 trillion where does that money come from you and I that&#x27;s where they get the money from you&#x27;re like I don&#x27;t have $196 trillion but they&#x27;re going to get it from us over the next 30 years that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to do collectively not just you it&#x27;s not about taxing the rich the rich can&#x27;t afford to pay $196 trillion we don&#x27;t have even have a trillionaire right now think about 196 of them to be out there right if they tax them at 100% they&#x27;re coming after you they need your money as well they&#x27;ll tax you through other places so what is the solution here because when you&#x27;re dealing with a problem like this people out there and said man I I&#x27;m stubborn people like this guy I just want you to watch this guy&#x27;s interview by the way and see what he says this is an old old video probably from the 80s if not the &#x27;90s this is Stanley Meyer look at his determination saying I&#x27;m sick of this and his own words watch this I don&#x27;t care if you use rain water well water City Water ocean water if you don&#x27;t have any fresh water go ahead and use snow if you don&#x27;t have any snow available to you they use salt water because there&#x27;s no adverse effect through the fuel cell Myer started working on this project four years ago he&#x27;s not a scientist he isn&#x27;t even a chemist in fact he never graduated from college Myers was determined he says to design something to protect this country from oil embargos and we have calculated that if we take the dune buggy from Los Angeles to New York we would roughly use 22 gallons of water so do you hear his voice like how much fire he&#x27;s got this is not do you understand it like True Believers are going to be like I&#x27;m going to fix this problem right this is not cool what they&#x27;re doing now watch this Stanley Meyer he builds this engine that uses a process called electrolysis to split water into oxygen hydrogen gas powering the vehicle so obviously imagine you&#x27;re the oil and gas industry like who is this guy why are they giving him TV time get him off and this is not social media time he gets all this publicity and attention and in 1998 during a celebration with Belgian investors about to close a multi-million dollar deal Meyer became violently ill and claimed he was poisoned before dying official report stated he died of a brain aneurysm now by the way this is being said in a documentary Phil with many interviews called The Lost entry on Amazon if somebody says come on now this is a such and such Why is Jeff Bezos allowing this to be on his Amazon why why are they letting that happen but watch this that was an only invention he had he had another device that ran on nothing yes you know how much money you can make off on nothing you can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll sell you nothing for $5 a gallon what do you mean there&#x27;s no profit margin on nothing right he built a device that broke the second law of Thermodynamics do you and I even know what that means broke the second law thermodynamics whatever it is he was able to figure it out to run on nothing you can&#x27;t monetize when you run on nothing right Stanley Meer had a donut shaped electromagnetic device in his garage slap with a national security order due to its groundbreaking nature paranoid from past experiences of having patent sees Meyer deliberately falsified the voltage and frequency numbers in his patent to prevent theft or classification Skeptics argue that Meers technology violated thermodynamics law specifically the Second Law thermodynamics energy transfers inefficiencies because Meyers engine created energy without waste now watch this I&#x27;m going to read this to you it&#x27;s going to sound very weird but hang tight and then I&#x27;m going to validate it with a quote that was given by Tesla back in the days Zero Energy devices are said not to create energy but to channel existing keyword omnipresent energy challenging conventional views on energy conservation is what we&#x27;re talking about with Stanley and you know what Nicola Tesla said if you want to find the secret of the universe think in terms of energy frequency and vibration what the hell happened to the Stanley guy was he up to something big and why did he disappear all of a sudden it&#x27;s a good question to ask so now that&#x27;s 1990 how how far back can we go where somebody thought of this in 1898 this man named Stubblefield was issued the US Patent of 6,457 for something called the Earth battery Earth battery what is an earth battery it&#x27;s an electronic coil of iron insul at ated copper wire that was immersed in liquid or buried in the ground Stubblefield claimed that combined with normal battery operation his device also Drew additional power from the earth however it did successfully serve as both a power source and a Ground Terminal for wireless telephones this is getting crazier and crazier right like you may be watching this right now saying I&#x27;m going to come up with this idea there&#x27;s no money in this idea you get what I&#x27;m saying like there is no money it&#x27;s just you&#x27;re solving a massive problem you&#x27;re going to create so many enemies the oil and gas industry employs millions of of people this isn&#x27;t just about the people that are making the money but watch this one here Nica Tesla&#x27;s Pierce Aero Electric car from 1921 running on pure aetheric electricity what does that mean this is a self-recharging car it does not run on batteries oil and gas again recharging how do you keep making money if somebody sells a battery that&#x27;s recharging you shave and you use your razor it gets bad boom you go to whatever store you buy buy another one okay you put batteries in something you change you go back right you&#x27;re constantly having to go back to buy it there is more money being made if it&#x27;s self-recharging car what do I need to go buy cuz it&#x27;s already recharging itself there&#x27;s no profit in it and by the what&#x27;s Wild as many of these stories were also in the paper here&#x27;s one from August 28th 1921 in the Phoenix paper electricity taken from air drives automobile taken from air drives automobile and by the way I got a bunch of these stories but I want to tell you with Tesla let&#x27;s go through what happened with Tesla so check this out in 1900 Nicola Tesla convinced JP Morgan to fund a Global Wireless communication system later expanding the project to include Wireless power transmission after demonstrating the technology so now JP Morgan&#x27;s like a great idea what could this turn into then on July 10th 1932 this is 32 years later Tesla announced the development of a principle to harness cosmic rays for power generation he described a process where cosmic rays ionized the air against again going back to the Phoenix guy talking about air this is in 1921 this is a 1932 so cosmic ray ionizes the air releasing energy that can be captured and used to operate a motor the system could provide continuous power without the need for storing energy unlike other renewable sources such as wind or solar which we have a lot of solar right now that we need to replace every 30 years but this is saying no wind no solar so now watch this I&#x27;m about to read this next part you but in 1900 he convinces JP Morgan right 1932 he announces the development of this Cosmic harness Ray for power generation watch this the new energy source described as everywhere present in unlimited quantities could potentially ready for the powerful W that scared the crap out of everybody eliminate the need for conventional fuel such as what coal oil or gas Boom the moment he said this it scared the hell out of everybody so now Tesla requested more funding for this expansion but now JP Morgan withdrew support citing a breach of contract possibly influenced by his investment in Industries threatened by Tesla Innovations GE AT&amp;T copper mines of course he&#x27;s going to sit there and protect his investment saying hey what you&#x27;re doing you&#x27;re going to pull my guys out of business I&#x27;m not interested allegedly that&#x27;s what happened here did I just use the word allegedly I think I did right if I use the word allegedly by the way we have a new shirt that came out called allegedly value T in future looks right if you haven&#x27;t ordered you click a link below go order your allegedly shirt let&#x27;s get back to the episode so now watch this not only did JP Morgan Chase say no we&#x27;re not going to give you more funding but what they also did is discourage other investors isolating Tesla financially so this led to Tesla having significant debt which eventually led to the foreclosure and eventual demolition of the warden Cliff Tower which is where he was doing all his testing obviously his vision of free unlimited energy had a lot of enemies such as Morgans Rockefellers Vanderbilts who controlled American and energy production and distribution that&#x27;s a problem and by the way according to this documentary the last century you ready for this it&#x27;s kind of weird here watch this upon his death many of his documents disappeared and only 60 of his 80 organized boxes were recovered FBI documents show that the Department of Defense ordered Tesla&#x27;s belongings to be turned over to them after his death kind of weird I&#x27;m going to go through the rest of these guys very quick this is a guy named Charles POG in the 30s he figured out a way to create a machine ready for this Breen Motor Company tested a carburetor on a Ford V8 CP in 1936 achieving 26.2 mil on one pint of gasoline approximately it would have been 220 m per gallon 220 Mi by the way we&#x27;re talking in 1936 with Ford Ford knew about this and even after Ford and Canadian Automotive magazine reported around 200 to 218 m per gallon excitement from the test resulted to a drop in Oil Company stock prices on the Toronto exchange but following the media Buzz pogs Workshop was burgal rized and all rat materials were stolen eventually he ceased further development and the discussion of carburetor later taking a high pain managerial position where at an oil company NeXT guy Thomas Mor 1940s this guy invented a device capable of generating 50 Kow with no energy input tapping into the zero point field based on what he did here Russians try to kidnap him after public demonstrations in 1940 his lab was attacked he faced multiple assassination attempts and ultimately his assistant sabotaged his work Moray died impoverished with his groundbreaking technology lost to secrecy and sabotage this next one&#x27;s going to be a little bit weird it&#x27;s you may even pause the video to want to Google this to say this can&#x27;t be right in 1951 the US enacted The Invention secrecy act what is that allows the government to legally classify and keep certain inventions secret if deemed a threat to National economy or security huh what could be a threat to National economy if you&#x27;re able to figure something out that&#x27;s 220 m per gallon you think it affects the oil industry a little bit maybe inventions under a secrecy order cannot be discussed exported or sold outside of military channels violations of secrecy order can result in imprisonment for the inventor over 6,000 patents today are kept by the US government in secret they didn&#x27;t allow the people to go out there and sell it I wonder what those 6,000 patents are a lot of people want to be like when you become a president I want to go to Area 51 a lot of us capitalists want to find out what these 6,000 patn are if you want to go a little bit deeper let me give it to you 1971 the list indicated that patents for solar photovoltaic generators were subject to reviewing possible restrictions if they were more than 20% efficient meaning energy conversion systems were likewise subject to review and possible restriction if they offered conversion efficiencies in excess of 70 to 80% what does that really mean that means if we can save your electricity by over 70 to 80% pump the brakes 20% we&#x27;re okay with that 7080 little too much we can&#x27;t save people that much money because if we do that a couple other Industries may be out of business that&#x27;s exactly what it means I&#x27;ll do a couple of these and we&#x27;ll wrap up cuz got a lot of stories for you just go watch the documentary so Tom Ole in 1970s Tom Ole accidentally created an engine that ran on its own fumes using a modified lawnmower what in April 1977 he drove the car 205 miles on just two gallons of gas Engineers found no hidden fuel reserves in the car confirming the technology Effectiveness Olga invention attracted significant attention including a $25 million buyout you know from who ready for this from Shell oil company which he declined to prevent the technology from being suppressed how weird is that despite securing a patent an investor support Ogle face legal troubles from the SEC and the IRS and personal challenges including his wife leaving him Ogle was shot in 1978 but survived however later he died under suspicious circumstances involving painkillers and alcohol which was ruled an accidental overdose his death was speculated by some to be a coverup and his revolutionary invention was largely forgotten next one I like his name a lot I had a friend named little Sparky but here we go Floyd sweet Sparky 1980s Sparky developed a machine capable of converting 3 m into 224,000 watts of continuous ond demand power without limitations on attached equipment he followed a patent for his invention soon after A well-dressed man approached Sparky at a grocery store shown him a photograph taken secretly of him and his wife at home threatening him to seize his research now imagine you&#x27;re at a Market you&#x27;re at a gas station guy comes and shows you this grocery store what are you going to be doing wait a minute who are you guys can&#x27;t tell you here&#x27;s you and your wife what yes you got to stop what you&#x27;re doing with this man app it&#x27;s revolutionizing the industry cannot do that this is freaking people out just because of a QR code I can download the app and I can ask other people questions and I can get my question answer now we can&#x27;t do that we can&#x27;t get people getting answers to the questions now you can do it by the way if you download the app on the man QR code right here let me get back to the story here with you so he walked me he tells Floyd sweet Sparky all the way to my building telling me what would happen to me if I didn&#x27;t stop my research despite reporting the incident to the FBI harassment intensified Sparky and his wife received numerous threatening calls Sparky was getting telephone calls and death threats from strangers he said there were people calling at all hours the police put a tap on my line and over a 6-month period over 480 calls came in from all parts of the US but they were from pay stations thus the police could never find the callers his lab was eventually burglarized result ing in theft of his notes later two men visited Sparky&#x27;s home shortly after they left Sparky collapsed and subsequently died from a perpetrated heart attack after being taken away in an ambulance which his wife was not allowed to enter within 24 hours of his death the FBI ceased all of Sparky&#x27;s equipment and research besides his power generation Sparky&#x27;s device known as the VT also demonstrated anti-gravity capabilities during experiments with retired army officers and nuclear physicist Tom Bearden who observed a 90% reduction in the VTA weight supporting bearden&#x27;s theory of gravity as a pushing force so final thoughts right now if you&#x27;re watching this as a capitalist entrepreneur somebody who respects a lot of business owners out there we run a consulting firm called bavid Consulting you can go to bid.com to learn this is my concern here if you&#x27;re watching and okay Pat what should I do with this information one go watch the documentary the law Century just for yourself to get educated but two you know everybody becomes president like if you become president are you willing to release the John F Kennedy assassination an Area 51 information and every time a president goes in there and they&#x27;re like ah man I can&#x27;t do it even Trump if I told you you wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I this if I that obviously the fear is hey we&#x27;re going to kind of compromise our own institutions that we have but what if you&#x27;re able to go and look up this 1951 The Invention secrecy act and you encourage the president to not necessarily just do jnf K assassination or Area 51 what if you ask him can we get rid of this what happens if we get rid of this what are these 6,000 pattern we&#x27;re talking about I want to know don&#x27;t you want to know maybe share this video with other people go watch the document and start asking politicians why do we have that in place just start asking your Congressman your Senator I just watched this video I looked at this maybe tagged the Wikipedia tagged the Articles tag it from the US Government website why do we have this why can&#x27;t we get rid of this and see what they tell you let&#x27;s get some answers because I&#x27;m curious I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re also curious if you&#x27;re still watching this video I&#x27;d want to get to the bottom is if you do as well go on Twitter and tweet this and see what they tell you and do some research for yourself anyways if you got value out of this video give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel and if you enjoyed this video there&#x27;s another video I did that&#x27;s relatively close to this ESG video if you&#x27;ve never seen this whole thing on ESG click here to watch the video take care everybody bye-bye bye-bye [Music]</p>
