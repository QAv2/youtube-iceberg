            <p>cold fusion could save the world it would be a basically unlimited clean source of energy it sounds great there just one problem it&#x27;s not working indeed most physicists think it can&#x27;t work even in theory and yet the research is making a comeback so what&#x27;s going on what do we know about code Fusion is it the real deal or is it pseudoscience what&#x27;s code Fusion to begin with that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll talk about today if you push two small atomic nuclei together they will form a heavier one this nuclear fusion releases an enormous amount of energy that&#x27;s just one problem Atomic nuclei all have a positive electric charge so they repel each other and they do so very strongly the closer they are the stronger the repulsion it&#x27;s called the kolum barrier and it prevents Fusion until you get the nuclei so close together that the strong nuclear force takes over then the nuclear emerge and boom the sun does nuclear fusion with its enormous gravitational pressure on Earth we can do it by heating a soup of nuclei to enormous temperatures or by slamming the nuclei into each other with lasers this is called hot nuclear fusion and that indeed works there&#x27;s just one problem at least so far hot Fusion eats up far more energy than it releases we talked about the problems with hot nuclear fusion in this earlier video but nuclear fusion is possible at far lower energy and then it&#x27;s called cold fusion the reason this works is that Atomic nuclei don&#x27;t normally float around alone but have electrons sitting in shells around the nucleus these electrons Shield the positive charges of the nuclei from each other and that makes it easier for the nuclei to approach each other there&#x27;s just one problem if the atoms float around freely the electron shells are really large compared to the size of the nucleus if you bring these nuclei close together then their electron shells will be much farther apart than the nuclei so the electron shells don&#x27;t help with the fusion if the nuclei just float around one thing you can do is strip off the electrons and replace them with muons muons are basically heavier versions of electrons and since they are heavier their shells are closer to the nucleus this Shields the electric fields of the nuclei better from each other and makes nuclear fusion easier it&#x27;s called muon catalyzed fusion muon catalyzed fusion was theoretically predicted already in the 1940s and successfully done in experiments in the 1950s it&#x27;s called Fusion that actually works there&#x27;s just one problem muons are unstable they must be produced with particle accelerators and those take up a lot of energy the Mion then get mostly lost in the first fusion reaction so you can&#x27;t reuse them there&#x27;s a lot more to say about muon catalyzed Fusion but we&#x27;ll save this for another time there&#x27;s another type of cold fusion that we know Works which is actually a method for Neutron production for this you send a beam of dyum ions into a metal for example titanium deuterium is a heavy isotope of hydrogen its nucleus is a proton with one Neutron at first the beam just deposits a lot of dyum into the metal but when the metal is full of dyum some of those nuclei fuse these devices can be pretty small the piece of metal where the fusion happens may just be a few millimeters in size here&#x27;s an example of such a device from zandi alabs which they call the new chist the major reason scientists do this is because the fusion releases neutrons and they want the neutrons it&#x27;s not just because lab life is lonely and neutrons are better than no company neutrons can also be used for treating material materials to make them more durable or for making radioactive waste Decay faster but the production of the neutrons is quite an amazing process because the beam of derium ions which you send into this metal typically has an energy of only 5 to 20 kilo electron volts but the neutrons you get out have almost a thousand times more energy in the range of a few Mega electron volts it&#x27;s often called beam Target Fusion or solid state Fusion it&#x27;s a type of cold fusion and again we know it works there&#x27;s just one problem the yield of this method is really really low it&#x27;s only about one in a million dyum nuclei that fuse and the total energy you get out is far less than what you put in with the beam so it&#x27;s a good method to produce neutrons but it won&#x27;t save the world however when physicists studied this process of neutron production they made a surprising discovery when you lower the energy of the incoming particles the fusion rates are higher than theoretically expected why is that the currently accepted explanation is that the lce of the metal helps Shar the charges of the dyum nuclei from each other so it lowers the culum barrier and that makes it more likely that the nuclei fuse when they&#x27;re inside the metal this isn&#x27;t news physicists have known about this since the 1980s but if putting the dyum into metal reduces the coolon barrier maybe we can find some material in which it&#x27;s lowered even further maybe we can lower it so far that we create energy with it this idea had been brought up already in the 1920s by researchers in the US and Germany and it&#x27;s what Pon and Flashman claimed to have achieved in their experiment that made headlines in 1989 Pon and Flashman used a metal called Palladium the metal was inside a tank of heavy water so that&#x27;s water where the normal hydrogen is replaced with dyum ponon fman then applied a current going through the Palladium and the heavy water they claimed this created excess heat so more than what you&#x27;d get from the current alone they also said they&#x27;d seen some Decay products of fusion reactions notably neutrons and tritium everyone was very excited there was just one problem other Laboratories were unable to reproduce the claims it probably didn&#x27;t help that pwns and Flashman were both chemists but nuclear fusion has traditionally been territory of physicists and physicists largely think that chemical reaction simply cannot cause nuclear fusion because the typical energies that are involved in chemical processes are far too low a few groups said they&#x27;d seen something similar to Pon and Flashman but the findings were Inon consistent and it remained unclear why it would sometimes work and sometimes not by the early &#x27;90s the pwns and Flashman claim was largely considered debunked soon enough no scientist wanted to touch cold fusion because they were afraid it would damage their reputation the philosopher Hugh price calls it the reputation trap in fact what I was working on this video I&#x27;ve been warned that I too would be damaging my reputation of course not everyone one just stopped working on Cold Fusion after all it might save the world some carried on and a few tried to capitalize on the hope one such case is that of Andrea Rossi who already in the 1970s said he knew how to build a code Fusion device in 1998 the Italian government shut down his company on charges of tax fraud and dumping toxic waste into the environment in the mid 1990s Rossi moved to the United States and by 201 he claimed to have a working cold fusion device that produced excess heat he tried to patent it but the international patent office rejected the application arguing that the device goes against the generally accepted laws of physics and established theories a rich Australian guy offered $1 million to rossie if he could prove that the device produces net power rossie didn&#x27;t take up the offer and that&#x27;s the last we heard from him there&#x27;s more than one problem with that in 2019 Google did a research project on cold fusion and they found that the observed Fusion rate was 100 times higher than theoretically expected but it wasn&#x27;t enough to create excess heat the Allure of cold fusion hasn&#x27;t entirely gone away for example there are two companies in Japan technova Inc and clean Planet Inc which claim to have produced excess heat clean planet in has a very impressive road map on their website According to which they&#x27;ll complete a model reactor for commercial application next year there&#x27;s just one problem no one has seen the world saving machine and no one has reproduced the results the people who still work on Cold Fusion have renamed it to low energy nuclear reactions Lena for short part of the reason is that cold isn&#x27;t particularly descriptive I mean these devices may be cold compared to the interior of the Sun but they can heat up to some 100° C and maybe that&#x27;s not everybody&#x27;s idea of cold but no doubt the major reason for the rebranding is to get out of the reputation trap so make no mistake Lena is Cold Fusion Reborn I admit that this doesn&#x27;t sound particularly convincing but I think it&#x27;s worth looking a little closer at the details first of all there are two separate measurements that code Fusion folks usually look at that&#x27;s the production of Decay products from the nuclear fusion and the production of excess heat an experiment that tried to shed light on what might be going on comes from a 2010 paper by a group in the United States they used a setup very similar to that from Flashman and Pon but in addition they directed a puls laser at the Palladium with specific frequencies they claimed to see Excess power generation for specific pulse frequencies which suggests that phonon excitations have something to do with it the there&#x27;s just one problem a follow-up experiment failed to replicate the results Edmund storms who has been working on this for decades published a paper in 2016 claiming to have measured excess heat in a device that&#x27;s very similar to the original pwns and Flashman setup in this figure you see how the dyum builds up in the padium that&#x27;s the red dots and the amount of power that storm says he measured he claims that the reason that these experiments are difficult to reproduce is that the nuclear reactions happen at appreciable rates only in some regions of the Palladium which have specific defects that he calls nanocracks these could be caused by the treatment of the metal so some samples have them and others not and this is why the experiments sometimes seem to work and sometimes not at least according to storms that&#x27;s just one problem no one has been able to replicate his findings there&#x27;s also a 2020 paper from the Japanese company clean Planet Inc which I already mentioned they use a somewhat different setup with nanoparticles of certain metals that are surrounded by a gas that contains dyum the whole thing is put under pressure and heated they claim that the resulting temperature increase is higher than you&#x27;d expect and that the device generates net power in this figure you see the measured temperature increase in their experiment with helium gas and with a gas that contains duum the helium gas serves as a control as you see there&#x27;s more heating with the dyum there&#x27;s just one problem no one&#x27;s been able to replicate this finding the issue with these heat measurements is that they&#x27;re incredibly difficult to verify for this reason it&#x27;s much better to look at the Decay products those are in and by themselves mysterious in a typical nuclear fusion reaction there is a very specific amount of energy that&#x27;s released and so the energy distribution of the Decay products is very sharply peaked in duum Fusion the neutrons in particular should have an energy of 2.45 me in those Cod Fusion reactions however they see a fairly broad distribution of neutron energies and at higher energy than expected here&#x27;s an example the red bars show the number of dyum ions as a function of energy the black ones are the background as you can see the Spectrum looks nowhere like the expected Peak at about 2.5 me something is going on and we don&#x27;t know what forget saving the world for a moment it&#x27;s much simpler there&#x27;s an observation that we don&#x27;t understand in a recent paper a group from MIT has put forward two different hypotheses that could explain why nuclear fusion happens more readily in certain Metals than you&#x27;d navely assume one is that there are some unknown nuclear resonances which can become excited and make fusion easier the other one is that the lettuce of the metal facilitates an energy transfer from the deuterium to some of the Palladium nuclei so then you have excited Palladium nuclei and those Decay since the Palladium nuclei has more Decay channels than are typical for Fusion outputs this can explain why the energy distribution looks so weird there&#x27;s just one problem we don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s actually correct what are we to make of this the major reason cold fusion has been discarded as pseudoscience is that most physicists think it can&#x27;t possibly be that chemical processes cause nuclear reactions but I think they overestimate how much we know about nuclear physics and chemistry Nuclear Physics is dominated by the strong nuclear force which holds quarks and gluin together so that they can form neutrons and protons the strong nuclear force has the peculiar property that it becomes weaker at high energies this is called ASM totic Freedom Arvin Ash recently did a great video about the strong nuclear force so check this out for more detail the lar hen collider pumps a lot of energy into to proton collisions this is why understanding the strong nuclear force in LHC collisions is quite simple by which I mean a PhD in particle physics will do the difficult part comes after the collisions when the quarks and gluons recombine to protons neutrons and other bound states such as pons and rows and so on it&#x27;s called hadronization and physicists don&#x27;t know how to calculate this they just extract the properties of these processes from data and parameterize it I&#x27;m telling you this to illustrate that just because we understand the properties of the constituents of atomic nuclei doesn&#x27;t mean we understand atoms we can&#x27;t even calculate how quar and Glu ons hold together another big gap in our understanding are material properties because we often can&#x27;t calculate electron bands that&#x27;s especially true for materials with irregularities that according to stor forms are relevant for cold fusion indeed if you remember calculating material properties is one of those questions that physicists want to put on a quantum computer exactly because we can&#x27;t currently do the calculation so is it possible that there is something going on with the nuclei or electron bands and those metals that we haven&#x27;t yet figured out I think that&#x27;s totally possible but let me be honest I find it somewhat suspicious that the power production in Cold Fusion experiments always just so happens to be very close to the power that goes in I mean there isn&#x27;t a priority any reason why this should be the case if there&#x27;s nuclear fusion going on efficiently why doesn&#x27;t it just blow up the lab and settle the case once and for all so well I&#x27;m extremely skeptical that we&#x27;ll see a working cold fusion device in the next couple of years but it seems to me that quite convincing evidence that something odd is going on in these devices that deserves further study I&#x27;m not the only one who thinks so in the past couple of years Research into cold fusion has received a big funding boost and that&#x27;s already showing results for example in 1991 a small group of researchers proposed a method to produce Palladium samples that generate excess heat more reliably and I hope you&#x27;re sitting research groups NASA and the US Navy have recently been able to reproduce those results a project at the University of Michigan is trying to reproduce the findings by the Japanese companies the department of energy in the United States just put out a CT for research projects on low energy nuclear reactions and also the European research Council has been caught in the act of supporting some cold fusion projects I think this is a good development cold Fusion experiments are small and relatively inexpensive and given the enormous potential it&#x27;s worth the investment it&#x27;s a topic that we&#x27;ll certainly talk
