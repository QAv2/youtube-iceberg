            <p>how did Tesla do it Tesla I think was actually capturing resonant magnetic field energy of the earth that&#x27;s almost boundless so there are a lot of quote free energy approaches I think the ones that use these very high voltage systems that create a sort of a vector a tap into this Quantum vacuum energy and Zero Point Energy field those began to be stumbled across but sort of episodically as a phenomenon back in the late 1800s because that was the Heyday when they were first discovering electromagnetism and I think Maxwell and some of these guys stumbled across this so they didn&#x27;t know what it was you&#x27;re getting more energy out than you had to put in so I think you can have a rotational coil based device Floyd suede who we feature in the movie had a solid-state device that was about this big that could run a 300 horsepower electric engine for your car</p>
