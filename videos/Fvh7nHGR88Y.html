            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel and we try to shed light on some great theories of everything and other uh information that you may not know about because it&#x27;s been suppressed and today is our 448th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson and Mr Larsson was an engineer born in 1898 died in 1990 born in North Dakota moved out to Portland um and I think lived the rest of his days out there and I think around 1930 he had some epiphanies uh as he was just trying to work on some uh chemistry uh research and he took them to heart and he developed his ideas to the point where in 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how he thought that the Universe operated and then uh while he was doing that he took those postulates and put them through a process of deduction kind of an if this then that approach and he arrived at a theoretical Universe kind of like if my two postulates are correct this is what my universe would look like and then he uh wrote some books where he compared his theoretical Universe with the measured Universe from the uh Legacy scientists the uh results of their laboratory and Observatory experiments and uh compiling them in scientific tables and so on we&#x27;re looking at one of his books called basic properties of matter and this is on chemistry so he uh drives equations for many of the basic properties of matter such as the specific heat and the melting point and the compressibility of different uh substances different elements and compounds and then he comp Compares them to the scientific tables um and uh unless he&#x27;s fudging the numbers which you know is possible in this world of Deceit um he&#x27;s able to really uh recreate practically recreate the scientific tables at U very little expense uh took those those guys um thousands of them hundreds of thousands of them maybe over centuries uh with trillions of dollars of research uh to compile those tables and Larsson was able to do them uh with a slide rule from his living room uh that&#x27;s uh you know that&#x27;s the power of having a theory of everything you are able to uh investigate areas that you not able to necessarily um uh penetrate uh with your senses uh you can do it in your head and uh we are looking here at uh chapter five which is on heat and uh just it kind of goes over um the heat uh relations and the specific heat and then uh kind of the um melting point uh the various um minations that different uh compounds different substances undertake to avoid uh reaching that melting point and uh before we get into that let me just give you a quick once over on the reciprocal system uh reciprocal system is also known as the universe of motion because Larson proposed um motion as the fundamental of the universe not matter uh as the ancient Greeks did all the way up until the late 19th early 20th century or energy as Einstein and maybe Heisenberg would have uh uh advised but motion and um larsson&#x27;s first postulate sums it up um the second postulate is mainly axiomatic having to do with uh math and geometry but the first postulate states that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so that&#x27;s where you get the reciprocal system from is that motion is the world is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of one another and um they uh you can you can see that in if you look at uh the most basic kind of motion speed speed is uh the car is going 15 mil hour 15 miles of space in one hour of time space over time that that is a relationship between space and time that is just speed but um Larson applies that to all uh of our scientific phenomena and says that they are all forms of motion that they all fractions uh with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator now if you want to double the speed you can say now the car is moving 30 mph or equivalently you can say now the car is moving 15 m per half hour you can double the space or you can have the time and you get the same result because they are reciprocals of one another so at least in speed um space and time are in fact reciprocals of one another uh but Larson again extrapolates this to all the other forms such as matter and energy and force and acceleration and they all have their uh signature time space um configuration uh so uh enlargement system energy is time over space matter is time to the third power over space to the thir power pressure is time to time over space to the fourth power uh force is time over space to the second power and then you can kind of check uh your basic equations um for validity um say you&#x27;ve got um uh Force equals mass time is acceleration uh force is time over space to the second power mass is time to the thir power over space to the third power acceleration is space over time to the second power the rock fell out the window at 10 uh 32 feet per second per second you know uh space over time to the second power and then you multiply that out and they the units work out or if you have um uh pressure equals force per area pressure is time over space to the fourth power uh force is time over space to the second power and area is space to the second power so uh E equals mc² you can do that or any other equation um and uh it&#x27;s very useful to do it that way and it&#x27;s also it&#x27;s more useful than the MKS system because um MKS has matter involved and in this system you just uh convert matter into T3 to the 3 over S 3 and then you&#x27;re only dealing with two variables instead of three um okay now uh when LaRon is making his Universe out of motion the first thing that you have to keep in mind is that motion precedes everything else the universe is made out of motion so you have to be able to to to conceive of a universe with motion um without anything moving there is motion before there is a thing moving motion precedes everything else and if you can&#x27;t get with that then you can&#x27;t get with the system at all you might as well just give up right there you have to be able to conceive of that before you can embark on studying the universe of motion or you you can just accept it or you can uh concede it uh you know for further verification but that&#x27;s a conceptual step that you have to be able to take another is that you know for 3,000 years we&#x27;ve thought of the uh space and time as being the background setting of the universe that we are you know um that space and time are basically the stage upon which we uh go through our Paces our daily drama and that you know we are U moving through a um a still frame of space and things are unfolding in time but in larsson&#x27;s universe space and time are the contents of the universe not the container but the contents and so those are kind of conceptual hurdles that uh need to be uh jumped over before you uh can get into the reciprocal system uh now when Larsson is referring ing to motion he&#x27;s also referring to what you would call a scalar motion which is a more generalized kind of motion that&#x27;s not terribly recognized by scientists although they do concede its existence because they have to um because it&#x27;s it it does exist a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction you can Envision a scalar motion if you take a balloon and you put dots on it you blow up the balloon all of the dots will be moving away from each other every dot will be moving away from every other Dot and uh in fact the locations between the dots will also be moving away from one another and that is uh a outward scalar motion um and Larson refers to that as the progression now if you suck in the balloon all of the dots will be moving toward each other and that is what Larson calls gravitation and when they do move toward each other or away from each other it appears as if there is a force connecting those different dots that there&#x27;s a force field or some kind of force of repulsion Andor attraction or or attraction that is pulling those things together um but that&#x27;s not the case each one of the dots is actually pursuing its own course moving toward every other dot but if you uh decide arbitrarily that you&#x27;re going to pick one of the dots and that&#x27;s going to be your reference point and you&#x27;re going to say this dot is motionless um then you can start measuring the directions and you can attribute force fields to those uh other dots they&#x27;re all they&#x27;re all attracted by your stationary Dot and that&#x27;s uh really what Larson calls the uh the U spatial and temporal reference points okay so if you have a uh spatial reference uh point this is basically what we normally perceive of in the in the universe in our environment of the universe three dimensions of space XYZ coordinates in a still frame and uh clock time the clock is still moving in a scalar manner but the uh space is vectorial three dimensions of vectorial motion moving uh time is always getting later and later and later and later in a scaler manner in no specific Direction so um and then uh reciprocal to that would be the temporal reference system where we have three dimensions of time in a still frame and uh space is still scalar uh that would be if we abstracted something in time or if we took that reference point in time and said this is we&#x27;re stopping this in time and now we&#x27;re making the measurements in time that we would only be able to do in a different environment of the universe okay now also there&#x27;s this uh scalar aspect now when you have those three dimensions of space um it that&#x27;s only one dimension of motion okay you have three dimensions of space three dimensions of time but you also have three dimensions of motion it takes three dimensions of space or time just to describe one dimension of a scalar motion so each one of those would represent one the scalar and temporal reference system which would each occupy one um uh scalar dimension of motion and then you also have the discrete unit postulate that is um that everything is quantized everything comes in units you don&#x27;t have a a third of a something or 24 parts of something you either have a whole unit or you don&#x27;t have anything you need to have a whole unit of space to have a unit of space a whole unit of time and a whole unit of motion one unit of space in one unit of time is a unit of motion um and uh if you have that one unit of space in one unit of time Larson calls that unit speed space over time is speed unit speed is also known as the speed of light so the speed of light is one unit of space in one unit of time and that is the progression the progression is this outward movement um similar to the movement of an expanding balloon the dots on the expanding balloon and um it is at one unit of space per one unit of time or the speed of light Larson refers to this as the progression of the natural reference system this also means that half of and so lson also refers to this says the null point or the zero point the uh neutral point so this is the neutral point meaning that half the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light and half is moving slower Larson refers to these as the cosmic sector and the material sector respectively in the material sector we have uh this is where we reside in the slow region and we observe coordinat space and clock time but if we were in The Cosmic sector and we were moving faster than the speed of light we would observe coordinate time and clock space so when we cross that speed of light boundary we move from this temp um spatial reference system to the temporal reference system uh the uh the roles of space and time reverse now Within in the material sector and within the uh Cosmic sector there are also many uh boundaries um many regions uh where you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space in the material sector uh atoms and particles can interact in areas less than one unit of space which is approximately two millions of an inch and if they do that that occurrence does not happen in space it happens in time and and uh because there is no space because you don&#x27;t have a full unit and if it&#x27;s not space it&#x27;s time because the universe is made out of space and time only and um so Larson calls that the time region that&#x27;s the region of interaction of atoms and and molecules and uh when you cross that boundary the unit space boundary the rules invert again and now the progression is moving inward in space really outward in time but uh we see it as inward in space uh but there is no space so we&#x27;re not really seeing what&#x27;s happening but we are anchored to the spatial reference system and so we only see space and U so we see it as an inward in space and then gravitation is outward in space in the time region uh so the uh the relation reverse there and the same is true in the in the cosmic sector except there you have Cosmic atoms and Cosmic molecules and you have the progression going now um is inward in time and gravitation is outward in time okay now these uh uh are relevant here when we&#x27;re talking about uh um heat in this chapter of larsson&#x27;s BAS Bic properties of matter uh but there&#x27;s a lot of other details involved and you may not be able to follow this especially since the chapter is almost over but we&#x27;re going to try to read the rest of this chapter and uh I will try to tie up any Loose Ends but there&#x27;s probably going to be loose ends on every sentence but I I like to read this into the record so that if somebody is really uh studious that they can pick this up uh you have you have to dig and it&#x27;s a detective uh job Larson did a great job of uh of putting this putting this down but he&#x27;s just one person and so he was set with a gargantuan task and he did the best he could for the resources and the Manpower that he had and he um you know he uses a lot of terms that you might not understand but I just uh but you will be able to pick up a few things and uh I think it&#x27;s all very profound but the the important part is that it&#x27;s an interconnected system it&#x27;s a system of theory so what you can pick up about temperature or about anything having to do with chemistry it also applies in other fields this is unlike Legacy science where you know you might go to graduate school or medical school or whatever for years and study a subject but you will never learn anything else about any other subject but what you learn in Larson system is applicable to every subject so um so let&#x27;s listen to a little bit of Larson on chemistry here okay these values uh he just uh showed some values of the specific heat the specific heat is the amount of um heat that you have to add to something in order to increase the temperature by a specific amount it&#x27;s basically the U if you uh take the derivative of the um of um it&#x27;s basically the rate of temperature increase these values and the maximum specific Heats previously calculated for the successive curves enabl us to determine the relative temperatures of the various transition points these transition points are the um points that the uh atoms or molecules use to avoid uh Crossing that melting point because um you know as Larson says in his second postulate the universe conforms to the relations of basic uh communative mathematics and so he uses a lot of probability to determine what can occur and um generally the lower the temperature the more probable uh it&#x27;s going to be also the lower the number the more probable and um so the elements will do everything that they can to avoid Crossing into the you know liquid as opposed to the solid state uh and so they undergo various transitions uh which have to do with the structure of matter uh which I get into in a lot of episodes but not not today we&#x27;re going to try to keep moving here in the uh rotation 3 curve for example the temperatures of the first and second transition points are proportional to the differences between their respective specific Heats and the um 3.89 initial level of the rotation to segment of the curve as both of these points lie on this line the relative temp of any other pair of points located on the same straight line section of any of the curves can be determined in a similar manner uh so he&#x27;s basically saying that all these these curves he&#x27;s basically establishing a specific heat curve and it has inflection points because whenever the atom or molecule takes a um hits a transition where it goes through the transition to avoid Crossing this a melting point line the curve uh takes a an inflection it goes on to a different angle it&#x27;s and the the ultimate the the total curve uh is basically a connection of a bunch of line segments but if you extend the curves all the way back to the zero uh ordinate then um they all meet at the same point and so basically all of the atoms are on the same set of curves so this temperature system is basically Universal um the relative temperatures on of any other pair of points located on the same straight line section of any of the curves can be determined in a similar manner by this means the following relative temperatures have been calculated based on the temperature of the first trans transition Point as Unity and so um he talks about the various vibrating units relative temperature um and so [Music] um I&#x27;m not totally familiar with these numbers but at at transition um one or unit one uh the relative temperature is uh one exactly and the um end point is 1.8 the F the first uh the second curve or the second line begins at 2556 and goes to 4.56 at the end point and the third curve is starts at 3.08 6 and goes to 9.32 and the fourth curve uh starts at 3391 and goes all the way up to 1767 and these um are the end points and so uh depending on what kind of atom or what kind of particle you have and how many kind of resources it has available to change uh to make transitions these are going to be the end points and so certain of the elements or or U molecules compounds have uh higher or lower melting points but they all are going to fall on one of these one or another of these curves uh depending on how many rotational aspects they have in their atoms now an an atom is basically based on uh rotations uh there are there are rotations of that original progression the outward movement of the balloon is the source but in order to harness that source it has to be rotated back in three dimensions and so Larson uses a three number system and is periodic table every element contains three numbers one is the primary two-dimensional rotation the next is the secondary two-dimensional rotation and the third is the oppositely directed one-dimensional rotation which is optional and can be negative and so um he uses those values in order to um kind of ascertain these curves and the more of those rotational values that you have the more flexibility you have in order to overcome the um uh the increase in heat and and stay inside the solid state uh the curves of figure three figures three and four portray what may be called the regular specific patterns of the elements these are subject to modifications in certain cases for instance all of the electr negative elements uh those that are basically on the right side of the periodic table with displacements below seven uh less than um seven units away from the noble gases thus are their veent thus far studied substitute an initial level of a. 66 or -23 for the normal uh 1.32 uh it&#x27;s actually a little bit less than those 2/3 because you&#x27;re multiplying it by a number that is uh just under two okay uh another common deviation from the regular pattern involves a change in the temperature scale of the curve at one of the transition points usually the first for reasons that will be developed later the change is normally downward in as much as the initial level of each segment uh of the curve Remains the Same the change in the temperature scale results in an increase in the slope of the higher curve segment the actual intersection of the two curv segments involved then takes place at a level above the normal transition Point these are some deviations of a different nature in the upper portions of the curves where the temperatures are approaching the melting points these will not be given any consideration at this time because they are connected with the transition to the liquid State and can be more conveniently examined in connection with the discussion of liquid properties as mentioned earlier the quantity with which this and the next two chapters are primarily concerned is the specific heat at zero external pressure in chapter um chapter six the next chapter uh the calculated values of this quantity will be compared with the measured values of the specific heat at constant pressure as the differences between the specific heat at zero pressure and that at pressures of observation is negligible uh and that is because the um pressures of observation are very very low on the natural scale standard uh that Larson uses where the um unit of pressure is something on the order of uh 15 million atmospheres okay most conventional Theory so then the pressure that we normally encounter in the environment is uh basically negligible or it&#x27;s basically zero unless you were you know doing extremely accurate you know experimenting but these are just you know initial forays into the subject so uh most conventional Theory deals with this specific heat at constant volume rather than at constant pressure but our analysis indicates that the measurement under constant pressure corresponds to the fundamental qu quantity and I don&#x27;t understand that at all but uh again it&#x27;s detective work so uh if you don&#x27;t understand something you don&#x27;t get discouraged you just um chalk it up in your mind and you move on and a lot of times Larson will clear up the uh confusion pretty soon thereafter um sometimes not sometimes you might have to um read it in a different book of his um that&#x27;s what makes this so hard and I guess that&#x27;s kind of what I&#x27;m trying to do um you know with not with these videos cuz with these videos I&#x27;m just trying to introduce people to the system but my my work uh at least at this point uh at least part of my work is to try to take larsson&#x27;s work um and put it on a silver platter for people basically like putting together a textbook or something like that where all of the key points are there and you don&#x27;t have to every time you see a term you don&#x27;t have to look it up it&#x27;s right there and stuff like that so anyway um good things are in store for the reciprocal system thanks for</p>
