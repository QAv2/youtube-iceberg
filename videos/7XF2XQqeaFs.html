            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald W South&#x27;s founder and share international society unified science and president trans power corporation a commercial and custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company I work as a theoretical physicist and as a systems and mechanical engineer today&#x27;s with most of my screencasts will be discussing reciprocal system in particular the reciprocal system micro cosmos database we&#x27;re now in this panel on the left side here liquid neighbor gas matter poverty so it has to become environment down City today we&#x27;re going to come specific heat so here we go click on that a lot of data here I&#x27;m taking water as the example this part here liquid is the section here this part here is the vapor properties and then the gas properties or gas properties are here now let&#x27;s go through each field I&#x27;ll explain each month as we go along by the way there&#x27;s nothing comparable to this and con mechanics keep getting interrupted here and hopefully that won&#x27;t happen again alright first field of course is the element or the compound in the max in this case h2o description ice water steam of course from number one if you wanted to put an alternative properties you could duplicate the record and then up the form number and then change whatever you want to change atomic molecular weight is here melting temperature here vapor gas and was the same in this case atomic molecular weight is here&#x27;s some sense in some cases they forgot some that will be different okay the Delta V helpfully used the tooltips for this but in this case at zero it&#x27;s usually zero no long time for sure in California is here and that&#x27;s calculated as opposed to observed and you have the option using vapor pressure is the external pressure I&#x27;m gonna say no in this case alright let&#x27;s go through the liquid properties now just as with the previous getting volume intensity we have this whole list of parameters you need to figure this out for each element compound this is the number of different elements of the molecule so in this case to the gestation are the number of atoms is three this is the number of close-packed groups per molecule in the solid state that&#x27;s what the S 1 is closed packed groups per molecule no liquid say that&#x27;s s 2 and then this n initial is the number of initial units six shopping factors here okay for specific heats of the liquid an internal this is the number of structural groups having internal motion so like vibration per molecule okay and LTG this is the number of liquid thermal good sperm knowledge is 1.5 the number of liquid structural groups per molecule that&#x27;s the same 1.5 in this case it&#x27;s a number of liquid volumetric units in both liquid temperature units the number of units and NP is a number of units atoms or molecules resisting external pressure so this is 9 so it&#x27;s like 9 group together to oppose external pressure and then here we have the average CP the specific heat pressure per structural group and that&#x27;s in cal per mole per K now this is an overall average for the different levels of structural groups in the molecule so it&#x27;s 300 these are the choices here by the penny so there there are just a limited number of choices of course R is the gas constant so it&#x27;s 3 R in this case okay so this takes a little bit of an effort to figure these out but these are small numbers you know everything&#x27;s quantized now in some cases we have fractions it&#x27;s very rare it will have half integers sometimes but it&#x27;s a little rare but this is because of hydrogen bonding anyway critical temperature K calculated observed is calculated 654 observed 647 critical pressure and atmospheres again it&#x27;s calculated vs. observed external pressure now this is an input this is an important input for the example calculations here we&#x27;re gonna use five hundred atmospheres which is pretty high and we&#x27;re going to use six hundred K for the temperature to compare with theoretical calculations we&#x27;re gonna use Karla&#x27;s values from his excellent were chemical properties handbook where he gives all the empirical regression equations for the properties of matter that&#x27;s because of quantum mechanics is completely useless but engineers need to have something so the best that we could do before it was to use empirical regression equations so right here we have the ABCD regression coefficients alright so now we get to calculate the specific heat again this is at temperature K 600 can pressure five nine atmosphere so comfortable per cage will promote 4k account for gram for candy okay everything&#x27;s here cause here we have a specific pair going on he&#x27;s based I mean by I am expensive it II okay and here we have the odds calculations I mean they&#x27;re not quite as close as we would like but that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re gonna get you know these high pressures I&#x27;d be willing to bet that the reciprocal system is more accurate okay so now we have a situation where we have a heat sink an aid source and you know we can press this button to cite TK didn&#x27;t meaning the sinking the source doesn&#x27;t matter and again we calculate specific heat here constant pressures with the P is of course Cal promote 4k Joule criminal for kcal per gram per K and here we have the CV values with the key and you know you know obviously the usual that I use here and this is for the heat source of course okay so heat sink all these guys here and heat source here and then we have down here versus Aviva I use I&#x27;m saying these are our CCP guys for these sort of you guys for the heatsink and then we have this CCD but dying is down here again reciprocal system calculation versus the Oz calculation and then here&#x27;s the approximate calculation for the boiling temperature the tooltip you know the boiling point is temperature which the vapor pressure goes one atmosphere alright so that does it for the liquid state properties now we go on to the vapor properties the yas regression equation coefficients are here temperature K now you can you can you can change the temperature here if you want let&#x27;s go see some thing and then I calculate Lisa piece was indicate in the space above the liquid and this was heat on the surface of the liquid and this part here&#x27;s the child promote through K again Dennis you have all these choices right it&#x27;s four on three or in this case okay above the space that&#x27;s really the neighbor and then I calculate the Joule per mole per kcal per gram per K corresponding exclusively knives here again you won&#x27;t find anything like this in quantum mechanics now the real gas we have these parameters and you don&#x27;t pay attention here this does take an effort to get these guys but this is theoretical physics and so I tea is the initial level in terms of natural temperature you know for 3d and 3d and 3d gas temperature for 2d and 3d guys I&#x27;m sure normally this will be two months if nine and two decimal fractions this parameter is the number of thermal gates in the gas at the 2d gas emission coming okay ng TG 1 is the number of thermal gates of gas just before going to 0 3d gas initial point or beyond TL 0 K this is the temperature of the liquid at the very beginning of the transition to gas T sub G to D 0 K this is the temperature of 2d gas at the initial point T G 2.5 g this is temperature intermediate between 2d and 3d and gasses this is temperature of 3d gas at initial point K when in turn motion is just through these state so there&#x27;s quite a bit of a transition between 2d motion and 3d motion here and the calculator method for specific e TG 2 d 0 d TG 3ds you know that&#x27;s generally but you have a choice if you want okay so let&#x27;s see the real gas is at 1,000 chain and of course we have the Earth&#x27;s regression coefficients again it&#x27;s important that you get Carlos or chemical properties handbook so you have a way to compare the theoretical calculations and I&#x27;m given here with the empirical regression equation so here are its coefficients a B C D and E and then the initial values you have little series of choices here should I choose that and then finally that this was the key Kalem okay joule per mole kcal per gram k and you can see it&#x27;s very close here yaws and reciprocal system calculation in this case and then we have see some v specific heat it seems to be on specific T again very close and I may have our usual heatsink and heat source calculation where we calculate the ccp&#x27;s was a gate of analytical system from yas and then c simply again is the same like just calm is cal per gram k and you can imagine that&#x27;s the same thing though the clocks it&#x27;s gonna be comfortable k and then Jill promote a counter gravity and in this particular the case the calculations are very very close for the real gas calculations and which is nice to know now for the here we have an ideal gas the ideal gas equations so you can see them here and obviously there another not too bad but you know they work there there&#x27;s somewhat different from the real gas calculations and here again and then the calculation of the dissociation temperature that&#x27;s when the h2o mop the brakes are 2729 63 course you can add whatever notes you want read this note that the real gas volume at the critical temperature and pressure is two-thirds of the ideal gas line that they&#x27;re saying interest at their same conditions it&#x27;s a 2d gas also note that in the reciprocal system liquid specific heat is constant whereas it is not for the oscillation crazy estimated saturations on using empirical patients taking had six or seven point one concave and teaching american arresting the simple rape of line kappa volume calculated by the reciprocal system for water the critical tension pressure is equal to this actually point but this is not the case with other vapors hence periodic italki cannot be given presently the oscillation creation is not good infinity as it should at the increasing point reciprocal system viscosity value so get to viscosity and presentation all right so again this is very complete once you figured out these values up here and i&#x27;ve worked them out for a number of liquids and gases then all i have to do is enter in the temperature K and the pressure that you want to use see pressure here external pressure then all the rest of this all the specific calculations will be calculated for you and of course once you put in the yard specific heat regression coefficients which are here you get through you know you did the calculations okay I&#x27;ve wanted to put all these infant waters so this should be very accurate extremely accurate through all the specific eights but it&#x27;s refreshing for volume for liquid vapour and real gas states of water all right well that was some pretty much in depth there that&#x27;s it for today please study the reciprocal system improve for yourself not closing the simplest possible treatment of the reciprocal system theories my work that mysterious universe published many decades has all the concepts and still in trend but not for a long time it&#x27;s gotten very nice reviews on my underside covers all the concepts of it&#x27;s very very little in the way of mad I just have all the diagrams it&#x27;s the easiest way to understand theory but if you do want all the mathematics is obtained my magnum opus existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything sudden air eleven pages in the PDF 1711 slides in the PowerPoint file thousands and thousands of equations numerous diagrams tables figures doesn&#x27;t even take you months to go through it and then once you&#x27;re through with that then you can get these two database modules the Mayan cosmos database and the map and cosmos database Agra cosmos database has four covers hot solid matter properties that could they prove as meta properties cosmic elements and subatomic particles and certain properties so in solid matter properties and I&#x27;ve already covered each of these in a previous screencast so that was in air atomic distance Velen specific heat energy and entropy thermal expansion compressibility electrical magnetic properties isotopes and spectra the liquid vapor gas matter properties covers volume and density specific heat that&#x27;s we&#x27;ll cover today energy and entropy viscosity and surface tension and electrical and thermal connectivity cosmic elements down here and material cosmic subatomic particles in the voice for technologies and includes the great graphics program I&#x27;ve although I&#x27;ve already covered the macrocosmos database in previous screencasts just to review I covered the universe as a whole galaxy clusters and groups galaxies star clusters stars planets moons minor bodies maybe they gas and dust and voids if you want to jump right to various videos and pictures I would just click on events there the sauce includes some great graphics now my theoretical physics manner debut Larson was also an excellent theoretical economist and I&#x27;ve made his work and theoretical economics also fully computational that&#x27;s my work called optimal economists and implementation of our Sounion econo physics it covers the microeconomics of individuals businesses and business sectors and macroeconomics of entire regions and countries completely supersedes Keynesian economics from these for the hat especially in times of a recession and depression ok again i wraps it up for the day please please please study the reciprocal system and prove it for yourself thanks for your attention</p>
