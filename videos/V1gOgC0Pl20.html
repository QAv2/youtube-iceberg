            <p>software to die for the proma software Scandal and how the US justice department became software pirates in the name of National Security with Ted St rain or teed if you prefer brought to you by T camp and TC con.org check them out www media archives.com proudly presents this material thank you for watching also check out www promis scandal.com you know really I mean with the the because that&#x27;s how people got in their computer information at the time they got a daily newspaper mailed to them every day about you know what was going on in the computer field you know this was like you know darp andet was still like you know I used to run a computer bolon board in the 80s that would darpet would call in every night and download my feeds you know um the cosmic connection I started you know basically downloading just normal text files like episode guides to the Twilight Zone or Kung Fu or something and then I started downloading all these other files and then I got demented from there so you know then you got real information there yeah and then then it all started it all started for me Kung Fu important to know what&#x27;s going on next yeah uh yeah and you know speaking of kung fu you know I just filmed David kerine like three or four months ago at the conscious life Expo and I I have that posted online kedin tribute.com if anybody wants to check data and it&#x27;s funny he&#x27;s talking all about the same stuff secret societies and the Fibonacci spiral and and there&#x27;s conspiracies on whether you know he whether he was killed because uh and as we&#x27;ll talk about here oh you know I think I took it out actually I was going to show the uh part of the U the red skirt on the dress um bed thing but we&#x27;ll see if that&#x27;s still in here or not red skirt what&#x27;s this name the red skirt on the we&#x27;ll talk about it in a minute when we get to that point because there&#x27;s other the the auto asphixiation autoerotic asphixiation is a classic way for this organization the octopus to kill operatives uh especially British operatives like MI5 MI6 P2 oh the P2 Lodge went bad uh yeah something like that um and it&#x27;s been you know several people in fact some people in this story out of the 40 people have been murdered uh a couple of them have have been died that way so it&#x27;s an interesting connection that he was interested in these kinds of subjects secret societies he was back in China you know so yeah so we got this octopus that basically you know tries to control everything um not a bad thing you know once again people need some level of control I can&#x27;t argue with what they&#x27;ve been doing um seems like a good good idea um you know as long as uh you know we&#x27;re all allowed to be out here on the missile base every so often and and of course go to Burning Man in 6 and A2 weeks um so so just back to Casto for a second this is a place called Martinsburg West Virginia and so U cast was going going to Martinsburg to meet a big big lead on this story he was involved with all these people were kanudo and he was getting all these leads on this software because he was into software and things and so he headed over to uh Martinsburg and um to meet with these uh this his source and U the next morning he turned up dead in the bathtub with slip marks down each wrist and the and deep down to the bone in fact the paramedics noted you know made note of it How Deep The the cuts were on on both wrists and the theory being that once you do one wrist you&#x27;re not going to have control of that wrisk to do the other and there&#x27;s all sorts of inconsistencies and like the death scene or were supposedly somebody had gone in there and mopped up the blood with towels and left them under there the police never saw them or never did anything with them um the body was in bolm that night because the chief investigating officer didn&#x27;t want to come back on Saturday to this was a Friday afternoon or evening or something or Friday and the body was in Bal that day without the notification of the family against like state law in Virginia or something they all sorts of things and and so there was all sorts of you know all sorts of inconsistencies with this and so they buried him and this is basically where the story you know started to take off um and um a lot of people started taking note hey you know people are being murdered over this thing we should probably start writing articles on you know or at least letting people know you know that it&#x27;s not safe to be researching things like this um and so we got this octopus and of course they&#x27;ve killed other people um this guy here Fred Alvarez um he was the uh chief of security at the cabison Indian reservation and so uh he ended up dead with two or three of his friends uh in his in his house there on the reservation uh and he was murdered just flat out murdered along with a couple of his friends and nobody has ever solved the well actually I think somebody did solved the guy did a couple years in prison or something and and so and he was starting to complain about the kinds of activities that were going on there cuz not only they dealing with fuel air explosives they were dealing with once again these biological specific weapons they had you know clean Labs there probably a bio6 lab there and they had all sorts of things going on there and this guy was starting to complain about hey you know we should be we shouldn&#x27;t be doing this stuff and so you know a week later he turns up dead of course all the main players of course were conveniently out of town at the time but still you know he ends up dead and so uh here&#x27;s a very interesting document down there at the bottom I&#x27;ll just read it that Richard Armitage will broker the trans transaction of promise to the Chic for resale and General Distribution as gifts in his region contingent upon the three conditions we spoke of Promise must have a soft arrival no paperwork or customs and it must be equipped with a special data retrieval unit that we&#x27;ll talk about in a minute in it um and so basically what happened and here&#x27;s you know cold heart evidence right here you know they basically you know don&#x27;t have the bankruptcy proceedings and things that you know show that the the government acted in a willful wanting you know UND deceitful act to steal this software from this company and nearly drive them out of business and then of course the judge actually hadn&#x27;t wasn&#x27;t transferred to Alaska he was uh ended up being reassigned or whatever and then the new judge you know basically railroaded it through and it was all over must have a soft arrival you know no paperwork no nothing and so it&#x27;s interesting because today what happened is that you know and this wrangled through the court systems and this and that and inslaw won and they were like doe you know another $3 million or something from the the licensing of this product that the government had stole and started repackaging and so but today and then eventually what happened is the court US court system even though the contract the government had no contract to be able to modify the software the US Appel judge of the Supreme Court I forget which one uh basically said that um promis was in the public domain and that there was no copyright infringement and the whole RCMP was doing a big investigation about all you know whether they had pirate software and the big thing was that promis had a back door in it I forgot to mention that huh yeah promis had this backd door piece of software built into it that rudo had programmed into at the cabison reservation and that basically what this back door allowed them to do and that&#x27;s what this special retrieval device that they were just talking about here um and that allowed them to retrieve the data and be able to um be you know be able to get that data out of there you know and use it uh but little did they tell them that you know they also installed a back door the the NSA could dial in uh from low-flying satellites that would you know fly overhead you know they and I don&#x27;t know if everybody has heard of the elbit chip Google this term lbit e lbit t the lbit chip we&#x27;re going to talk about it here in a minute but it basically it can store up a up to 6 months or a Year&#x27;s worth of keystrokes and then burst transmit them in like 45 seconds to a satellite that flies overhead on every laptop that&#x27;s made today is probably is in there definitely every PC you know I don&#x27;t know if you know this but the NSA only use MacIntosh and have only since like 1984 I think they threw out all their PCS bought only Mac you know God bless it mac.com no it&#x27;s apple.com McIntosh okay so uh so we got this promis software and so now you can get it anywhere remember that screenshot I saw you know you can buy it everywhere everybody&#x27;s selling it but at the time uh you know they were selling it and what was very interesting is the reason that the payoff the the reason that these people um stole this software in the first place wasn&#x27;t actually the justice department was just people that were working on behalf of the justice department and so the reason they were able to steal this software in the first place is because they needed to pay off the people who had basically um prated the um October surprise does anybody remember what the October surprise is so here&#x27;s just another couple examples of of different you know here&#x27;s the pork producers management information system oh this is a good one but it&#x27;s also promis the pork producers you know oh no PPR whatever and so uh and of course here&#x27;s the uh you know project management Engineering Systems oh I like how they had the World Trade Center there and I don&#x27;t know if anybody know who uh uh Jacob and Boaz is the two pillars of the Illuminati and uh yeah research that back from Babylonian days uh Boaz just Google Boaz and you&#x27;ll find all about the Twin Towers and and and what they represent in society and the the they stand at the front of the temple I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re all familiar with the temple designs and stuff but it&#x27;s all very fascinating a lecture for another day um so anyway so they brokered this software uh and this is one of the guys Carlos K cardion uh he&#x27;s one of the guys that actually turned up dead um after he got to know too much um and so here he is with Saddam uh you know and so you wonder how and so I should also mention that promis wasn&#x27;t also just great at at tracking like how many you know exhibits are in a case and the witnesses and prosecutors would also track it good at anything you it&#x27;s like Excel you could put anything into it you know and so this is how many how how we knew how many bullets Saddam had and how many patches on the envelopes and how many sidearm it&#x27;s all in the software NSA can just dial in with a satellite and grab it you bet could do that with well you know that&#x27;s another the weapons of mass distraction that&#x27;s a whole another uh thing and so um does anyone go know this guy Tim Osman anyway Tim Osman was the CIA the name that the CIA gave Osama when he was here um when he was here on the behalf of alada does anyone know what ala means I the data database it&#x27;s basically it&#x27;s it translates as the database which is the CIA database on the mahaj mahaj from Afghanistan the drug war and so um and of course um so so Tim osman&#x27;s an interesting story because Saddam U because the CIA had flown him in here on on under this name to meet with actually somebody I know Ted gunin and rudo to buy some of these fuel air explosives they were interested in fuel air explosives but also like Sam seven missiles and they wanted because they were fighting the you know the Russians you know is what it was all or whoever they were fighting right yeah back in the 80s and so it&#x27;s all very interesting because um because they also got a copy of promis and supposedly um uh Bin Laden and um um Saddam they all had promise and they were actually had modified it on their own because they had Source copies and they modified it on their own and so the theory is is that while they were you know running the 911 attacks out of their caves in Afghanistan they were also using the software on their laptops to stay one ahead one step ahead of the authorities using the same software that the authorities were using to basically track them uh so it was all very free flowing soft you know how software is you know everybody&#x27;s a software pirate at some point in their life um and so uh so this opened up all sorts of problems uh and they opened up federal investigations and Congressional meetings and uh investigative reports on the uh uh descending and separating descending views on the insw affair you know 198th Congress or some crap and so um so this is where it kind of gets thrilling um because what&#x27;s happened is that uh as the story has progressed all the main players involved and all the people that had the money and this and that they all turned up dead and everybody who knew anything except me and like Ken Thomas they all died um and so one of the this is an interesting thing because this is actually a uh album cover something off from a band called the nanan bank believe it or not and their album&#x27;s called the thrilling and um very interesting because uh so go check them out on MySpace but because it&#x27;s very interesting because a lot of people don&#x27;t know who Nan hand is and here they are um Michael hand and Frank Nan um ironically both turned up dead um in one way or another um and it&#x27;s interesting cuz a lot of times when these and of course these were this was the bank where like BCCI if anybody are familiar with the bank of international credit and commerce U remember that story um these were like sister Banks all that these same kind of Bank you know you don&#x27;t hear about BCCI anymore just like you don&#x27;t hear about HUD anymore an interesting story about HUD I don&#x27;t know if I have a a photo about this but in HUD um HUD had mysteriously lost like a year and a half&#x27;s worth of their budget 4.3 tril trillion dollar notice how you don&#x27;t hear about HUD anymore you know used to oh buy a HUD home HUD HUD this not anymore what happened is that they had quote unquote had a software accounting problem after they installed some new software and they failed to take uh take any accounting procedures for a year and a half or whatever and they supposedly lost like 4.3 trillion out of their budget and supposedly uh anyone heard of finen the financial crime enforcement Network Google that one finsen um this is once again 1980s technology and so but basically what happened was that they installed proma software and Not only was it good case tracking software it could track bullets and cases and all this different stuff but it also could do like artificial manipulation of stock markets and it could see where patterns were developing just like I was showing you earlier with the touring machine you know it could basically figure out where the patterns were going</p>
