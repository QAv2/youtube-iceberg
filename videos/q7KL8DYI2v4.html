            <p>[Music] did that Cannonball just levitate so this was called the Hutcheson effect which was discovered by the Canadian inventor John Hutchison this phenomena was described as a highly anomalous electromagnetic effect caused by the use of Tesla coils and a Van de Graaff generator which generates static electricity Hutchinson claimed this technology could tap into the supposed Zero Point Energy field he claimed that this could make objects defy gravity with limitation and also metals to fracture or jellify there was also an effect where dissimilar materials like metals and wood would fuse together allegedly and other strange effects too in the end it was said that the results of his experiments were largely unable to be reproduced which many now consider him to be fraud but what if there was something to this and perhaps there was something covered up let me know what you think in the comments [Music]</p>
