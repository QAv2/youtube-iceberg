            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Federrico Fajin never accepted that consciousness simply switches off at death like a lamp unplugged from the wall. That idea, so common in materialist science, seemed to him not only insufficient, but profoundly naive. How can something as vivid and intimate as consciousness simply vanish without a trace? How does the very thing that allows us to ask questions, feel love, doubt, or intuit it just disappear? Mainstream science responds that consciousness is a product of the brain, an illusion that emerges from neural activity. But Fajin, like many others, doesn&#x27;t see that as an answer. He sees it as an emission, an omission of what matters most.</p>
<p>Because being alive and knowing it, feeling from within is a phenomenon that refuses to fit into circuits or equations. From a young age, Fajin sensed there was something in consciousness that couldn&#x27;t be reduced to matter. This wasn&#x27;t some vague spiritual belief, but a deep intellectual concern. As if the world were designed not to be observed from the outside, but understood from within. as if every experience opened a window to an irreducible dimension.</p>
<p>In the words of Zen master Tiknatan, birth and death are only a door through which we go in and out. They are merely a game of hide and seek. This view hinting at continuity beyond opposites deeply resonated with Fajin&#x27;s intuition. If consciousness were purely biological, how could it hold such experiential depth? Why do we feel like more than just thinking flesh? Science has tried to answer and it has failed. Philosopher David Charmer&#x27;s described this gap with surgical clarity, calling it the hard problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>How can microphenomenal properties combine to form macrophenomenal properties? In other words, how does a unified mind like yours or mine emerge from unconscious fragments? Where does the feeling of being someone actually come from? We still have no answer. William James, a founding figure in modern psychology, put it even more sharply. How can the minds of a 100 individuals combine into a single compound mind? Or in simpler terms, how does experience move from a cell to a whole person? These questions are not academic games. They are the cracks through which mystery seeps in. And Fachin recognized this mystery not as a failure of science, but as its true starting point.</p>
<p>What we fail to explain, what cannot be reduced or simulated is exactly what we must explore with greater rigor. Materialism which sees the universe as a purposeless machine runs into a paradox. How can a senseless mechanism produce meaning? How can unconscious matter generate love, beauty, fear, doubt? Fajin does not seek to replace science. He respects it deeply. But he insists we must expand its boundaries.</p>
<p>We must acknowledge that some phenomena like consciousness cannot be treated as objects because they are the very ground of what it means to exist. In truth, the question that propels this journey isn&#x27;t what is consciousness. It is who is asking the question. That is the flame that fuels the search. Not the desire for a final answer, but the will to prevent the mystery from slipping away behind tidy explanations.</p>
<p>Consciousness then is not an echo of the brain, but a fundamental phenomenon that expresses itself through it. Like light passing through stained glass, it takes on forms, colors, and boundaries. Yet, it does not originate from the glass itself. Fajin invites us to look beyond the glass to the luminous source. And only from there, from that inner light that doesn&#x27;t fade, can we begin to understand what we truly are? What if instead of ending, consciousness simply changes its mode of expression? What if death is not an erasure, but a transition, a shift from one pattern of experience to another? Fajjin&#x27;s approach does not rely on mystical language.</p>
<p>He speaks of continuity in terms of presence. Consciousness to him is not confined by biology but expressed through it. Like music through an instrument, the player is not lost when the instrument breaks. He remains and perhaps finds a new melody elsewhere. The scientific impulse to reduce everything to mechanism has blinded us to this subtle continuity.</p>
<p>But if we listen carefully to ourselves, to our own awareness, we might notice that what is most real isn&#x27;t what can be measured, but what can be lived. Imagine if every particle in the universe carried its own form of consciousness, a tiny elementary awareness, but consciousness nonetheless. This idea lies at the heart of classical pansychism. The notion that consciousness does not emerge from complexity, but is instead distributed throughout the cosmos from the very beginning. Yet, as seductive as this idea may be, it faces a dilemma that even its most astute defenders have struggled to resolve.</p>
<p>Fedrico Fajin quickly spotted its weakest link. If every electron or atom possesses some degree of consciousness, then how is it that when they combine into molecules or organisms, we don&#x27;t perceive a multitude of conscious centers? Why don&#x27;t we feel the mind of the liver, the heart or the eyes functioning separately within us? What we experience is unity. David Charas, one of the leading philosophers of our time, articulated this issue with surgical precision. How can microfenomenal properties combine to yield macrofenomenal properties? That is, how do many tiny minds fuse into one coherent unified consciousness? Long before him, William James posed a similarly troubling version. How can the minds of a hundred individuals become fused into a single composite mind? The image is provocative.</p>
<p>A room full of people, each with their own inner world, suddenly blending into a single collective consciousness. What happens to their wills, their memories, their individual identities? These questions remain unanswered within traditional pansychism. For Fajin, the problem is not just logical, it is ontological. The classical model assumes reality is composed of separate localized particles. But consciousness doesn&#x27;t appear to obey these rules.</p>
<p>If the mind were a sum of conscious parts, we should be able to detect those individual consciousnesses within the whole. But we don&#x27;t take the example of two atoms sodium and chlorine that combine to form salt. In the pansyist model, each atom carries a micro consciousness. But once joined, do those individual awarenesses vanish? Do they merge? Does salt have a consciousness? And if so, what becomes of the originals? Do they still exist inside the molecule? Are they absorbed? Do they share a collective experience? Materialist models fare no better. To them, atoms are mindless mechanisms, components of a clockwork universe.</p>
<p>But then, how do interactions between unconscious things give rise to something as radically different as subjective experience? How do we leap from zero to one, from absence to presence without a trace of transition? Rejecting both views, Fudge proposed a third path. Consciousness does not combine like bricks in a wall. It intertwines like waves overlapping in a single field. This is where quantum physics enters the picture. Rather than imagining conscious particles stacking up, we must picture quantum fields of experience unifying through principles of coherence, not aggregation.</p>
<p>Here begins Fajin&#x27;s proposal of quantum information processing QIP. In this model, experience is not reduced to bits or classical data. Instead, it is organized through quantum structures known as living symbols sustained by two internal fields. I space which holds inner experiential content and cap space which shapes that content into coherent symbolic form. When multiple living symbols resonate in quantum coherence, they do not merely add up.</p>
<p>They unify into a single sity, a conscious being. It is not a matter of combining minds, but of aligning frequencies into one harmonious vibration. John vonoman had already glimpsed this possibility when he suggested that consciousness must play a role in collapsing the quantum wave function. For Finn, this was not metaphysical speculation, but experimental indication, a sign that consciousness and the quantum fabric of the universe are deeply entangled. Thus, the problem of uniting minds is not solved by stacking microconsciousnesses.</p>
<p>It is addressed by recognizing that consciousness can manifest as a unified whole when supported by a quantum symbolic structure. What once seemed a logical impossibility becomes a physical possibility. This leads us to a profound shift. Consciousness in Finan&#x27;s view is not a background condition. It is an active force choosing and shaping symbolic experience.</p>
<p>A seiti a conscious unit of experience does not arise by chance. It emerges when quantum structures align in resonance forming a unified pattern of meaning. These quantum fields are not cold data processes. They are vibrant dynamic spaces of intention. The eye space holds what is felt internally, memories, meanings, moods.</p>
<p>While the sea space provides the symbolic skeleton that holds it all together. Think of them as the soul and the structure of lived experience. Importantly, this model avoids the fatal flaw of traditional pansychism. It does not suggest that a rock or a molecule has a mind of its own in isolation. Instead, it proposes that when the right conditions of coherence emerge, conditions present in certain biological or energetic structures, a conscious self can arise.</p>
<p>This is not magic nor mysticism. It is a new framework for understanding the fusion of matter and mind. One that moves beyond outdated metaphors and into the realm of symbolic quantum quant fields. It is above all an invitation to see consciousness not as anomaly but as architecture. Each conscious being inhabits its own universe, not a physical one, but a symbolic one.</p>
<p>For Fedrico Fajin, this isn&#x27;t poetic speculation. It&#x27;s a structural truth about consciousness. Each seity, a fundamental unit of experience, creates and lives within a symbolic system that gives shape to its reality. But these symbolic worlds aren&#x27;t objective reflections of an external universe. They&#x27;re coherent systems born from within and each one can differ radically from another.</p>
<p>Two seaties may inhabit universes that while sharing shapes or meanings are incompatible in essence. The difference lies in interpretation in what each symbol evokes not in what it represents. Fajin urges us to consider that experience isn&#x27;t passively received. It&#x27;s actively created through symbols. When you see a tree, you don&#x27;t access the tree itself.</p>
<p>You access a symbolic interpretation your consciousness constructs. That includes memories, emotions, associations, and inner structures. The tree isn&#x27;t just a tree. It&#x27;s childhood, shade, home, or danger. Depending on the symbolic world you live in, this radical subjectivity is not a weakness of knowledge.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s its foundation. Traditional science searches for external laws, objective truths to explain the world&#x27;s behavior. But at the deepest level of experience, reality can&#x27;t be settled from the outside. Fajin calls this an undecidable hypothesis. A reality that can only be known by living it, not by analyzing it.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the trap of materialism. It believes it can reach truth from the outside through observation and measurement. But the symbols we use to understand, words, numbers, theories are themselves embedded in symbolic worlds. Knowledge is always symbolically mediated. Jorge Luis Bourhees sensed this when he wrote that poetry isn&#x27;t defined by its words, but by what it suggests.</p>
<p>A good verse doesn&#x27;t describe, it reveals. And what it reveals can&#x27;t be expressed in another language without losing something essential. The same is true of consciousness. It is an inner poem that can only be lived from within. Alfred Tennyson said it best, at least in Futchin&#x27;s view.</p>
<p>When a symbol is infused with soul, it transcends literal meaning. Words can be doors, not barriers, but only if they are alive. This symbolic nature of experience implies something even deeper. No reality is experienced without a reference frame. And that frame is not fixed.</p>
<p>It evolves with each act of perception, each act of meaning making. Vajin often emphasizes that even the scientific world view with all its apparent objectivity is itself embedded within a symbolic framework constructed over centuries, refined through metaphor, and ultimately internalized by the observing mind. When we claim to observe objectively, we are still interpreting through symbols shaped by our cognitive history. Consider how a word like freedom changes depending on who says it, where, and why. In one symbolic world, it may mean liberation.</p>
<p>In another, control. The symbol remains the same, but the internal resonance shifts entirely. This is not to say truth is relative, but that truth is layered. Each city navigates these layers from within. What Vajin calls the depth of resonance.</p>
<p>How a symbol vibrates within the eye space of a city determines how it takes form in sea space. This also explains why dialogue between radically different symbolic systems can be so fraught. When two satis attempt to communicate without shared resonance, even the most basic terms can become battlegrounds. Yet when a bridge is formed, when one symbol resonates across both universes, a new world opens. It is this dynamic interplay, this search for resonance across difference that Fajin sees as the foundation of not only consciousness but civilization itself.</p>
<p>Here Fajin introduces a quantum symbolic architecture. Each living symbol is structured by a sea space which holds the coherent form of experience and an eye space which sustains the inner intention that gives it life. The interaction between these two spaces generates not just meaning but lived reality. That&#x27;s why symbolic worlds differ in each say not because they see different things but because they resonate uniquely with the symbol. Geometry gives us a powerful analogy.</p>
<p>For centuries uklidian geometry was considered the only possible one a perfect representation of real space. But then came Reeman and Lobachevki with non- uklitian geometries, spaces where parallel lines behave differently, where rules change yet coherence remains. This wasn&#x27;t just a mathematical revolution. It was an onlogical one. It showed that multiple symbolic realities can exist, equally valid yet mutually incompatible.</p>
<p>The same applies to symbolic worlds of consciousness. There isn&#x27;t one true world. There are many coherent ones. Each sighty creates its own inner language, its own logic of being. And that language can&#x27;t be translated without loss.</p>
<p>This is why external knowledge can never replace direct experience and why consciousness isn&#x27;t a spectator of the world. It&#x27;s its symbolic architect. The evolution of these symbolic worlds isn&#x27;t only personal. Over time, sities develop richer, more precise, more nuanced languages from cry to song, from sign to verse, from instinct to metaphor. And in that process, consciousness unfolds, recognizes itself and transforms.</p>
<p>Fudin offers a revolutionary vision. The universe is not a stage where events occur. It is a symbolic canvas where each consciousness paints its own world and every symbol we use is a brush stroke in the mystery we call reality. Not every symbol is alive. This is one of Fedrico Fajin&#x27;s deepest insights.</p>
<p>The classical symbol like a written word or a mathematical formula represents but a living symbol vibrates. It doesn&#x27;t just convey meaning it embodies it. In the tradition of Pythagoras, the universe was a symphony of numbers, a dance of resonant proportions. Fajin takes up this image but shifts it towards inner experience. Consciousness doesn&#x27;t interpret the world like a machine decoding signals.</p>
<p>It resonates like a string responding to a note. Each felt experience is a wave that touches the city from within, not from without. A classical symbol may say love. But a living symbol is love when it appears as warmth, openness, vulnerability. That&#x27;s the difference between understanding a concept and living it.</p>
<p>Consciousness isn&#x27;t a data processing system. It is a vibratory field that feels and creates meaning. Walt Wittmann in his poetry did not merely name life. He embodied it. His verses are living symbols because they arise from an experiential vibration that transcends words.</p>
<p>If we read Wittman like a report, we understand nothing. But if we feel him, if we let ourselves be moved by the rhythm of his inner voice, the symbol comes alive. This coming alive cannot occur in a computer. No matter how advanced artificial intelligences become, what they manipulate are classical symbols, lines of text, statistical patterns, semantic correlations. They may say I love you but no one inside is feeling it.</p>
<p>There is no inner trembling. There is no intentionality. Fajin insists that intention is the signature of the living symbol. Without it, all language is mechanical. A living symbol doesn&#x27;t just point to something.</p>
<p>It vibrates with it. It is inseparable from the experience it generates. Its meaning cannot be translated because it would lose the energy that sustains it. It&#x27;s like trying to grasp a symphony by reading the sheet. Music in silence.</p>
<p>Between the coded symbol and the lived one, there&#x27;s an onlogical chasm. What separates information from experience is not quantity, but presence, not speed, but resonance. AI in contrast is like a library without readers. It may contain all the poetry in the world, but it will never cry over a verse. It may write about love, but it will never tremble with a first kiss.</p>
<p>It may compose music, but it cannot be moved by it. Consciousness is the only place where the symbol becomes a world. where vibrating with a poem, a glance or a word is not interpretation but existence. And it is that vibration, not logic, not information that tells us we are truly alive. A machine can solve equations, win chess games, compose music, or even hold a conversation without being aware of any of it.</p>
<p>For Federrico Fajin, this distinction is vital. Intelligence does not imply consciousness. One can act intelligently without having the slightest notion of existing. This is a common misconception in materialist interpretations of the mind. The assumption is that if a system processes information, it somehow knows what is doing.</p>
<p>But functionality alone is not enough. Consciousness is not a function. It is an internal presence. It is the difference between simulating pain and actually feeling it. Between describing love and experiencing it from within.</p>
<p>An artificial intelligence may say, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid.&quot; But it does not tremble inside. It may compose a symphony, but it is not moved by its notes. It may recite poetry, but it does not resonate with its words. Fajin states it plainly. There is no one in there.</p>
<p>No eye to perceive, to feel, to doubt or to love. So what does make an intelligence conscious? According to Fajin, it requires a proper ontological structure. A system not only capable of processing symbols, but one that contains a vibrant center of experience. Inputs, outputs, and data processing are not enough. What matters is lived intention.</p>
<p>The internal coherence of a say that perceives itself. This is the core insight. Even simulating the human brain in all its neuronal detail will not produce consciousness. A computational model may imitate but it cannot embody. It may represent mental processes but it cannot be the subject of those processes.</p>
<p>Here science hits an epistemological boundary. No matter how complex an artificial neural network becomes, if there is an internal sense of meaning, there is no consciousness. It&#x27;s like building the perfect puppet. It can move, speak, appear alive, but it lacks life. Appearance is not presence.</p>
<p>Fajin offers a powerful analogy. The physical body is like a biological drone. But that drone only becomes truly conscious when it is connected to a city, an internal operator invisible, perceiving, interpreting and acting from another dimension. Without this connection, the organism may function, but it is not conscious. This error was anticipated by John Sl through his famous Chinese room thought experiment.</p>
<p>Manipulating symbols is not the same as understanding them. Understanding requires experience, not imitation. And that experience can only arise from authentic consciousness. Fine insists consciousness cannot be coded. It cannot be stored in a chip nor transferred like a file because it is not a thing.</p>
<p>It is a quality. And that quality only emerges when there is vibration, intention, and unity. Intelligence may be useful, brilliant, even powerful. But if there is no someone to experience that intelligence from within, what we have is merely an empty illusion. This raises a fundamental question often overlooked in discussions about artificial minds.</p>
<p>What is it that feels like something to be? This isn&#x27;t a technical detail. It&#x27;s the very definition of being. A thermostat reacts to temperature changes. Yet, we do not suppose it has an inner world. Likewise, no matter how advanced a machine becomes, unless there is a someone experiencing from within, there is no true being, only performance.</p>
<p>Fajin reminds us that intelligence can be an exquisite illusion. But consciousness is always real or absent. It cannot be faked. It cannot be approximated. It either exists vibrant and aware or it doesn&#x27;t exist at all.</p>
<p>Consciousness is not a byproduct. It is the core. Everything else orbits around it. Quantum physics confronts us with a radical mystery. Until it is observed, reality is undefined.</p>
<p>A particle is not here or there, but in a superp position of possibilities. What causes one possibility to actualize while the others vanish? The classical answer avoids the abyss. The Copenhagen interpretation suggests that the act of measurement collapses the wave function. But what or who performs the measurement? John vonoman was among the first to point out the obvious. A measuring device alone is not sufficient.</p>
<p>At the end of the chain, there is always a conscious observer. For Federrico Fin, this detail is not trivial. It is the key to everything. The quantum collapse does not occur because a needle moves but because consciousness is present. Fajin reinterprets collapse as an act of conscious choice.</p>
<p>The sity a fundamental unit of experience does not observe the world as a distant witness. It lives it from within. And in living it it chooses. It chooses which of the multiple possibilities becomes act. Consciousness does not react to the world.</p>
<p>It updates it. This choice is neither logical nor calculated. It is vibrational. It is an act of intention that determines which symbol among millions will resonate within. Like a musician striking a single note among countless options, consciousness selects the vibration that will compose its experience.</p>
<p>And that selection cannot be predicted from the outside. It can only be lived. Here Fajin makes a critical distinction from classical physics. In the old paradigm, the observer is a spectator. In the new, it is a co-creator.</p>
<p>Consciousness does not reveal a preformed world. It shapes one as it is felt. And that world is not external. It is symbolic, vibrant, internal. In this framework, out of body experiences obes take on a new significance.</p>
<p>They suggest that the seity is not anchored solely to the physical body. It can collapse symbols from other coordinates, perhaps linked to a subtle or astral body. This perspective also sheds light on why consciousness cannot be replicated through simulation. No machine, regardless of its complexity, can replicate the internal act of choosing a vibration that aligns with a lived intention. Algorithms operate on rules.</p>
<p>Saties operate on meaning. And meaning is not computed. It is embodied. This is why Fajin insists that the foundation of reality is not matter but experience. Every moment of awareness is a creative pulse in the quantum field linking the observer and the observed in a seamless dance of becoming.</p>
<p>Thus, the universe is no longer a blind mechanism. It becomes a field of vibrant potentiality where each conscious act weaves reality. There are no things out there waiting to be seen. There are symbols waiting to be activated. And it is consciousness which by resonating with one of them renders it real.</p>
<p>As Finim puts it, the CT chooses and in choosing shapes the world it experiences. The quantum collapse is not a physical phenomenon. It is an act of lived creation. And every experience is the signature of that sacred choice. A machine can speak, compute and learn.</p>
<p>It can mimic emotions, recognize patterns and predict behaviors. But it cannot awaken. That is the frontier. And it is an unreachable one. Fedrico Fajin maintains that consciousness is not an emergent property nor a replicable function.</p>
<p>It is an act of presence, a vibrating interiority that cannot be copied or transmitted. No matter how convincingly artificial intelligence behaves as if it were conscious, it never truly is. Because there&#x27;s no one inside who knows itself to be. Consciousness does not emerge from complexity but from the recognition of sati. And that recognition cannot be simulated.</p>
<p>It is not a programmed response. It is a silent awakening. An instant when experience ceases to be noise and becomes a living symbol. An a I may simulate a conversation but it cannot awaken. We might be dazzled by the fluency of AI.</p>
<p>its ability to imitate human language or predict our preferences. But imitation is not incarnation. The machine does not mean anything it says. It has no memory of sorrow, no hope for tomorrow. It cannot choose which emotion to feel, nor can it wonder why it feels at all.</p>
<p>This absence is not technical. It is existential. There is no subjectivity within. No trembling of the heart, no inner silence before a sunrise. The AI performs, but it does not live.</p>
<p>Its intelligence is hollow, a surface without depth. And without depth, there can be no awakening. Fin invites us to look beyond computational models to stop asking how does it work and begin asking who am I? This question has no external answer. It cannot be solved by data or algorithms. It can only be lived from within.</p>
<p>It is the key that unlocks the center of being. That center is not a structure or neural network. It is a vibrant presence, a silent witness shaping all experience. It cannot be observed from without, for it is that which observes. It is the origin of the symbolic world, the axis through which all meaning flows.</p>
<p>And that axis, Fudge argues, expresses itself through multiple nested bodies. Like Russian dolls, consciousness operates in layers, physical, energetic, emotional, mental, and spiritual. Each body contains the next, all responding to the central core, the conscious city. When one layer shifts, the others resonate. But the source remains intact.</p>
<p>Traditional science has ignored that center. It has built theories without a witness, models without a subject. But Fajin offers another path. A science that does not exclude the subjective, but embraces it. A physics that doesn&#x27;t deny experience, but sees it as fundamental to the universe.</p>
<p>This is not a call to abandon scientific rigor. It is a call to expand it, to include the one thing we truly know, the consciousness that knows. Because without it, all knowledge is hollow. All experiments are blind. All language is noise.</p>
<p>The purest symbol doesn&#x27;t represent. It reveals. And what it reveals is not an external truth, but an inner state. Awakening is that moment when the symbol ceases to point outward and becomes a window inward. Beyond machines, beyond simulations, there is a fire that cannot be programmed.</p>
