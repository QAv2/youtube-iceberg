            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>and if you listen to what basically uh people with globalist agendas have been speaking about yeah for probably longer than we&#x27;ve been alive actually um they basically need to completely change the world yeah they need to get rid of fossil fuels they need to get rid of um capitalism basically they have to change the entire nature of our reality to what they&#x27;re envisioning as this kind of green future yeah and even you know mr uh club schwab yeah there will be pain yeah people will be very angry because and even our government and this is what blows my mind people don&#x27;t know this is their stated intentions is to shut down the oil and gas yeah industry which hey you know i would say fantastic get rid of pollution man get you know green it up but the alternative they&#x27;re offering is just as bad yeah and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just as bad for the environment but it&#x27;s more control for them which which alternatives you talking about i would say mining lithium for batteries you know and trying to because there are technologies out there that are better they just completely ignore it yeah because it has to when it really comes down to this it has to do with global control yeah how do we control the markets how do we control the population right now the world is controlled through oil we have the petro dollar every thing is determined with energy yeah our money is determined with energy every technology is determined so we have a cap on resources because of how much energy we can use so if someone says oh man i can&#x27;t wait for free energy to come around well the moment that you get free energy is the moment we start raping the earth even more because you will have unlimited energy to take what you want now yeah so you&#x27;re kind of bringing that up in the sense of like if energy was super available um but then it were to be offered to our current culture what would happen would be just a consumption that is beyond what we even are seeing today as opposed to what people want is how this could free up society yes yes and like right now we have alternatives to fuel yeah remember that car from germany um in switzerland called the quant e vehicle it&#x27;s a vehicle that runs on salt water oh yes yes yeah i remember about 2015 2016 and technology&#x27;s there yeah it works it works it works um you know i just read an article the other day where they&#x27;re putting solar panels on a car and this electric vehicle um could run seven months without being plugged in yeah but then again you have to mine the batteries you know how yeah disgusting yeah the mining it&#x27;s yeah it&#x27;s like what&#x27;s worse mining for coal or mining for lithium yeah i would say the same level i would say that lithium&#x27;s far worse because it&#x27;s extremely toxic to the environment especially batteries afterwards yeah you know the windmills nonsense how much energy has to be put into actually creating that resource to get the metals to build those things they&#x27;re massive yeah massive so um and they break down constantly and so you know back to the the globalist idea is that the pain that we&#x27;re going to see is they&#x27;re going to be removing oil and gas from our society which means the prices of everything are going to skyrocket it&#x27;s going to limit our mobility food is going to be very scarce and it&#x27;s going to be a scary future but they haven&#x27;t offered an alternative right and if they said oh you know we&#x27;re gonna get batteries and solar panels and all that that is not an alternative that&#x27;s saying we&#x27;re gonna have years of rolling blackouts yeah you know we need to first be willing to look at technologies um and there&#x27;s there&#x27;s technologies right now that you know are even based off of tesla&#x27;s technology yeah they work companies use and they&#x27;re just not talked about where&#x27;s the company close to here actually actually i think it might actually be in the city where we&#x27;re talking right now um they have it&#x27;s a wastewater site or wastewater management plant and they have a technology in there where they use an electrical oscillation from like a tesla coil so it&#x27;s a frequency of electricity that goes into the waste water and when the electricity goes into the wastewater it separates it separates the nitrogen hydrogen oxygen and it actually separates the wastewater so it purifies the water yeah right but the gas that it&#x27;s producing can be used for energy is not only used for energy it&#x27;s powering the plant okay so this machine that&#x27;s that&#x27;s cleaning the wastewater is powering the plant and it&#x27;s creating so much electricity that it&#x27;s sending electricity out to the grid and the company is getting paid for producing electricity yeah and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the kind of stuff that like i&#x27;ve heard i&#x27;ve heard of examples of technologies like that it&#x27;s almost like an electrolysis essentially and uh it i think it&#x27;s these stories i mean most people let&#x27;s say that that have their belief in their faith within the system they hear that and they go well no if that was really happening right we would have heard it on cbc or ctv and if that was really happening justin trudeau would be you know bringing this forth and if that was really happening and this is i think this is where you know i&#x27;ve always kind of taken the position that you might suggest that the consciousness of our culture is not quote unquote ready if you will for these technologies um what i mean by that is if for example there&#x27;s a technology down in you know we&#x27;ll say the toronto greater toronto area and uh i&#x27;ve signed the nda gone and seen it with multiple people i was there with with um a number of south american investors uh hope matt like owners of massive hotel chains massive resort chains massive casino chains down there they came with their engineers we go we&#x27;re looking at this device i&#x27;m watching it i&#x27;m seeing the latency i&#x27;m seeing the load testing we&#x27;re seeing everything and it&#x27;s nothing more than utilizing a a system of of magnets combined with temporarily utilizing um almost like an opposing force something i don&#x27;t want to give it away because i signed an nda so but it&#x27;s like something creates an opposing force it&#x27;s very clever it works it can be uh set up in series so that you can essentially have tons and tons of power i was looking at a two kilowatt device so easily run a person&#x27;s house no problem um and you know you&#x27;re looking at this and you&#x27;re going vert like i went back to the car you cry because you&#x27;re like this is insane right you&#x27;re seeing the scientists you&#x27;re seeing that the inventors like once they wrap their head around the scientists particularly around how it worked it was like they became children they were so excited they were like oh my god i can&#x27;t believe this but what was happening in that container which was that company and that energy product was they wanted to sell it to like powerstream and some of these you know these majors so that now they would they would major power distributors now wouldn&#x27;t have to utilize say millions of dollars every month to generate the nuclear power or to generate the power from you know natural gas and so on and so forth and then sell it to people now their generation costs would be zero because of these of these devices and i asked you know the guy responsible for setting up a lot of the agreements and they were trying to get this going and i&#x27;m like so what what are you going to do as the person offering the contract to these companies to make sure that those savings are passed on to the customer and he said well it&#x27;s not my that&#x27;s not my job i don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t matter i&#x27;m like so wait they&#x27;re literally gonna have their energy costs production costs reduced to zero so now the only cost that company has is you know the maintaining the grid maintaining the network and doing that so you&#x27;re gonna have a massive amount of their costs and people are going to save nothing and it turned into this money billions of dollars and i said this is exactly the problem right as people still want to do even what you suggested earlier which is utilize this same thinking the same way of being within this system but with these new technologies so it gives us more power to do more bad things as opposed to utilizing it to free us which then leads to the question how do we get there thanks so much for watching this clip you can listen to this
