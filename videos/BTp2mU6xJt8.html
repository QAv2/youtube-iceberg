            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Remember that series we started last year? Well, I remember it all too well already. &gt;&gt; Welcome back to the Kieran Show. This week, we&#x27;re checking in on armies. We started &gt;&gt; over a year ago. &gt;&gt; I want to say 10 months now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It was It was January. &gt;&gt; 11 months. &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; No, 13 is February. I was like, &quot;How are you getting this so wrong?&quot; &gt;&gt; No, children came out in February.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Craig Craig was January, &gt;&gt; but you started painting them in January. &gt;&gt; So, January. Yeah. We&#x27;ll roll with January. So, a year ago, we started the Taylor two heretics series where I was very motivated.</p>
<p>Kieran was very motivated. We had just come off the back of Elar and we&#x27;re like, &quot;No, no, Kieran, you&#x27;re excited about chaos. Dare I say you&#x27;re excited about chaos.&quot; He started paying Empress Children. He was loving it. then my god he was hating it.</p>
<p>Um I&#x27;ve carried on painting a thousand sons the entire year. I haven&#x27;t stopped. Um so I&#x27;m doing pretty well. Um but I have taken a little bit of a backseat so that Kieran can catch up to some degree. &gt;&gt; I mean I did I did paint 2,000 points of another army instead.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s not the challenge. It&#x27;s also not the uh &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s my handicap. &gt;&gt; No, that&#x27;s not a handicap. That&#x27;s just you. That&#x27;s just you.</p>
<p>Speaking of handicap, why are you wearing a hat? &gt;&gt; Oh, it&#x27;s just cold outside. Oh, okay. Good. Um, but yeah, the emperor children are are ready are ready to rock and roll. You&#x27;ve got 500 points in a year.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing? Um, but yeah, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s technically a thousand. &gt;&gt; I painted I paint I painted 500 and then I paint another 500 now. &gt;&gt; No, you just don&#x27;t have the other 500 to show. &gt;&gt; Well, then you don&#x27;t have you don&#x27;t have 500. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; No, but I have I have painted a thousand.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But you haven&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; But I have. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve repainted minis. &gt;&gt; Credits will do fine. No, they won&#x27;t.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Before we get any further into this video though, we do need to say a special thank you to the guys over at Pocreate. Uh they recently sent us our first ever 3D printer in the form of the Hara X1. Now, neither of us have ever owned a 3D printer before. However, we&#x27;ve both been like, I would really like to print some 3D basing bits or like kit bashing bits in Kieran&#x27;s case. But the first thing I did when I uh when they were like, hey, do you want this this Harley X1? I was like, &quot;Yes, that means I can go to like places like Epic Basing and buy god knows what and print it off.&quot; So, small spoilers, that&#x27;s exactly what I did.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll see from the B-roll later on, I uh printed some spiky stuff on the 3D printer and stuck it to the bases. Um, but yeah, thank you very much to Poor Create for sending us the Harley X1. Uh, be sure to go and check it out. I said this stupid thing, didn&#x27;t I? I was like, if I don&#x27;t have 500 points painted by &gt;&gt; 9th of February. &gt;&gt; 9th of February.</p>
<p>So yesterday at the time of recording, I would shave my head off. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; and I&#x27;ve got 500 points of painted. &gt;&gt; And you still And you still got a wife, so that&#x27;s reassuring. &gt;&gt; And I&#x27;m not getting a divorce. Amazing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Saturday was was a good day. &gt;&gt; A double congratulations are in order. &gt;&gt; It was like It was three Was it three weeks? No, I think it might have been four weeks when I picked the date. It&#x27;s been 4 weeks of uh a hard whole old hard old hard old hard old hard old hard old hard old hard old hard old hard old hard slog. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, &gt;&gt; I painted 9:00 a.m. Saturday just gone to 900 p.m. Saturday. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; To finish uh the last unit for 500 points.</p>
<p>Um &gt;&gt; great. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve got less points to talk about. So, let&#x27;s start talking about yours. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, I&#x27;ve got 1,400 points. 1,400 points.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; If you could just talk about 500 of them, that&#x27; be great. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. Because I brought them all here with me. The the nice thing is now while Kieran is setting himself absolutely insane deadlines are like I&#x27;ll shave my head. I&#x27;m like well I have to worry about any of this.</p>
<p>So I&#x27;m just gonna bring my stuff that I&#x27;ve done. Um I&#x27;m by the time we finish I will be way over 2,000. &gt;&gt; I to be fair I think um I was going to check not move the gold post. I think landing on two and a half thousand points finished include including a prime mark is a good place to be for both of us. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll be further than that.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to say. Well, you&#x27;ve got to do you&#x27;ve got to do another Muslim vortex beast because people in the Discord have no self-control. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they bought me one. Why? Why would you do that? Why would you do this to me? I&#x27;m also not making another one. That&#x27;s a whole diarama.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s going to take me a long long time to it. &gt;&gt; I mean, one of them is an Ocliff crown and that&#x27;s like what? Twice as big as the Nest Chaotica. &gt;&gt; The The crown is just a sick terrain piece. I think I&#x27;d just like to paint that period. But I mean, &gt;&gt; stickers all over.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a different That&#x27;s a different thing. &gt;&gt; Six sorcerers coming out of it. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t want any. No, I haven&#x27;t got I haven&#x27;t got enough sorcerers. I&#x27;ve got three left.</p>
<p>We can buy more. &gt;&gt; No, no. Got so many. Um, but yeah. No, &gt;&gt; you you&#x27;d hate it if if if a package arrived and there was another six in there for you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t hate any package that arrives for me, but if if I&#x27;ve got to make more stuff for this channel that I&#x27;ve I&#x27;VE DONE MY BIT. I&#x27;M &gt;&gt; YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE 2,000 points. &gt;&gt; No, I&#x27;VE GOT 1,400 POINTS. YOU&#x27;RE YOU&#x27;VE finally left. We&#x27;re already arguing.</p>
<p>Um, thousand sons. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What have you actually made? So, there&#x27;s quite a lot that&#x27;s changed since the last time. &gt;&gt; What did we What did we show off a year ago? &gt;&gt; Last time it was four of those SEAR robots that nobody bought. Um, I got five Rubrics with shields.</p>
<p>Um, I had a sorcerer in terminator armor, which was sort of like a wild card. Um, just cuz I made it as a kit bash and I was like, let&#x27;s paint it up, see how it goes. Um, I I mentioned at the beginning two heretics, this would definitely be a heresy and 40k crossover army. It definitely is that. So, I&#x27;ve used some of the bits that are left over from Saturnine.</p>
<p>Um, and I&#x27;ve painted them up real good and real nice. So, that&#x27;s sweet. Um, so we&#x27;ve got obviously all of those bits that we&#x27;ve already mentioned. I&#x27;ve reinforced it with another five rubrics with shields. Those will act as my breacher unit um for heresy.</p>
<p>Um, I&#x27;ve also painted the 10 legionaries, which would also count as rubrics in a game of 40k, which is done. So, that&#x27;s fine. Um, I added a a unit of six satin terminators. Um, so I will be using those as uh what they called scarab cults. To anybody in at any table I put these on, they go, &quot;They&#x27;re actually too big.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re too they&#x27;re bigger than scarab terminate.&quot; You&#x27;re a loser. You&#x27;re a loser. And I&#x27;ll tell you that to your damn face. Um, so they would be scar Terminators. &gt;&gt; They could probably varnish them without it going orange.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, so I had to take the shot pads off. I had to do them all again. I I had to re I had effectively restart all of the minis that I did in Saturn 9. And I was like, &quot;Well, this is bad. This is very bad.</p>
<p>We should start this again.&quot; Um, and the Saturnine Praer I did for that challenge I actually just got rid of in a I think when when was that? It was a giveaway before Christmas. So, I did a new one and he&#x27;s so cool. Um, so he&#x27;s very very sweet. I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve enjoyed painting him immensely. &gt;&gt; So, how many points is that now then? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not done.</p>
<p>Oh, there is more. Um, so uh I &gt;&gt; Let me talk about my five minis. &gt;&gt; No, I&#x27;ve been waiting for a long long time. Um, I also did a &gt;&gt; This like therapy now. &gt;&gt; Huh? No.</p>
<p>Oh my god. No. I would not come here for therapy. Oh my goodness. No.</p>
<p>I go away for therapy. Um, I kit bashed a hell drake using the bone dragon from the tomb king set. Um, that was a lot of fun. He&#x27;s just very much like Beybladen on the top. &gt;&gt; You need to put air quotes around some of these things.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not a hell drake car. &gt;&gt; IT&#x27;S A HELL DRAKE. I AIN&#x27;T painting that much trim on a chicken. Absolutely not. I made a cool looking thingamajiggy hell drake and it&#x27;s cool and it and it&#x27;s fly and any and again if I come to that table and you&#x27;re like that&#x27;s not no stop it loser.</p>
<p>Um and then I think to round off I don&#x27;t think there was anything else. I think to round off I did two Predators. God I love Predators so much. What a cool kit. And Damos pattern.</p>
<p>Lovely. Absolutely lovely. The Damos pattern predators are phenomenal to build. They&#x27;re phenomenal to paint. So much so, um, I built my Spartan.</p>
<p>Um, the Spartan is ready for some paint as well. Uh, so that &gt;&gt; in mine. &gt;&gt; Is yours built? &gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s in the cellophane. &gt;&gt; All right, fair enough.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not even in the final 2K list. &gt;&gt; All right. Oh, you didn&#x27;t even add it in the end. &gt;&gt; All right, fair enough. if you got all this all this spare time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But yeah, in the next checkin, I&#x27;ll probably have the Spartan done along with any of the other ones you saw in the the thousand thousands episode a few few weeks ago. Um &gt;&gt; few years back. It feels like a few years for you. &gt;&gt; Where I mean I I keep building and painting stuff all the time. So I was just like &gt;&gt; So in your next check in in theory, you&#x27;ll have painted a mut vortex beast.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh no, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s last. &gt;&gt; Another M vortex beast. &gt;&gt; Huh? No, I I was always ever doing one. &gt;&gt; Demon Prince. Oh, the the demon prince will be next for sure.</p>
<p>So, in the next check-in, I&#x27;d like to have the Landy done, the demon prince done. I&#x27;ll decide anything else alongside that. But, um, you know, we&#x27;re walking tall. Everything&#x27;s everything feels very good. I&#x27;m ready to do Magnus last, I think, because Magnus is it&#x27;s he&#x27;s just too close.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re supposed to finish this series on two Primark, so it has to be last. &gt;&gt; No, that makes sense. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think you can paint him until I&#x27;m ready to paint Foggum, cuz then we can do a video on both of them. Oh, that would be cool. What is in like a little Dear diary? Is that what you mean? &gt;&gt; Kind of.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, like we have like one final video with the two Primarks in cuz otherwise &gt;&gt; And then they fight and then they kiss. &gt;&gt; I might win cuz it&#x27;s not a 10-year-old mini. &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
<p>And what are you talking about? &gt;&gt; It just It&#x27;s a better Primark. &gt;&gt; What the hell&#x27;s going on? Mine has nipple horns. You can&#x27;t out You can&#x27;t OUT SMASH THAT. &gt;&gt; WAIT, MINE INVENTED nipple horns. &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>Well, I&#x27;m glad they did. Um but yeah, they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll be finished at the end. Then they&#x27;ll kiss. still be cute. Um, anyway, should we talk about some empress children? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Should we talk about the thing they&#x27;ve actually wanted to talk about over the past year and there&#x27;s been no progress on they&#x27;ve seen all your progress for thousand sons? &gt;&gt; Well, what&#x27;s remarkable as well is that you painted 500 points last year and now you&#x27;ve just started again and done 500 points now. So, yeah. So, you&#x27;re at the same point you were last year. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s called stons. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s not called stons.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s called mid. &gt;&gt; Midtos mid sts. There it is. &gt;&gt; Um, yeah. So, for anyone that hasn&#x27;t been keeping up, um, a year ago I had just over 500 points painted.</p>
<p>I had a Lucius the Eternal painted, 10 Infractors, &gt;&gt; six noise marines &gt;&gt; and six noise marines and there was 500 and something points. That was the first check in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I then didn&#x27;t minis. I had Oh, and a Lord Exultter.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Ah, that was it. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I had 18 minis painted. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Come Christmas 2025s just gone. I had 18 painted minis. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So &gt;&gt; 7 months later or whatever it was.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So you did nothing in seven months Empress Children wise. &gt;&gt; I did 2,000 points of Space Wolves. &gt;&gt; That No, you took what I said and you threw that away. &gt;&gt; And then over Christmas I had the really cool guy brainwave of what if I start again? So I stripped everything. Even stuff I hadn&#x27;t finished yet.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve &gt;&gt; Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause. Does the cool guy brainwave include the badass minis I made for you? That&#x27;s your cool guy wave, not mine.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t strip them. So I was when when we came back when I took the space wolves to no tree and came back and had a great time. I was like, cool. I actually did get back on board with Emperor Children again, started to paint the scheme again. Went, I don&#x27;t like this scheme anymore.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve also forgotten how to paint it. I&#x27;ve also made it ridiculously complicated. This is really hard. I&#x27;m not having fun. Let&#x27;s change the scheme up.</p>
<p>Oh no, I&#x27;ve made it really complicated again. I&#x27;m not having fun anymore. Why is this taking so long? We then arrive at like the 3 days before Christmas. Nice. &gt;&gt; Me and a tub of bio strip stripping every single bit of paint off Empress Children.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s probably a photo over the screen. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not very festive. &gt;&gt; All come the come the 2025 is supposed to be the year of Chit Heretics. We started the year with 18 miniatures. We finished the year with one.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh. And you didn&#x27;t even like it and you haven&#x27;t included it now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It&#x27;s not It&#x27;s not even in Miami anymore. &gt;&gt; Nice.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean that that got that that guy is the reason the whole thing fell apart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Crazy. So yeah, we landed into 2026 with one painted Lucius and a whole heap of stripped Empress children. Um, and then we went again.</p>
<p>So after seeing some tryards paint it in 24 hours and go, you can paint 800 points in 24 hours. I went, &gt;&gt; well, you can. I showed you and you did it. &gt;&gt; In typical me fashion, I&#x27;d made it far too complicated. So I was like, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do some learning.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Just wow. What a way to look into &gt;&gt; look outside the window what other people are doing. Well, I was going to say look inwards rather than look outwards, but &gt;&gt; Well, if I look inwards, then it gets really complicated. &gt;&gt; That says more about you than it does the challenge. &gt;&gt; Um, yeah.</p>
<p>So, I really liked the tone of pink that Fletch did for the studio army there. So, I was like, let&#x27;s work smarter, not harder. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Because the tone of pink I really like. Let&#x27;s &gt;&gt; How&#x27;s that worked out for you? Like, cuz you&#x27;ve obviously put a massive shift in to get it back up to 500 points with the scheme that you&#x27;re chuffed with.</p>
<p>Is is it the same output workwise? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s faster. &gt;&gt; It is faster. &gt;&gt; Uh it&#x27;s um almost like when all these people online say that you can cut corners and you don&#x27;t have to paint the pouches with three highlights. They&#x27;re probably right. &gt;&gt; Who&#x27;s doing that? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; I I edge highlighted the pouches on my space wall.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The pouches of the mini. &gt;&gt; I DON&#x27;T PUT THEM ON. Absolutely not. What? I&#x27;m painting armies. I&#x27;m not It&#x27;s like a prison.</p>
<p>Yeah. So I &gt;&gt; Jeez, &gt;&gt; I uh took Fletch&#x27;s uh scheme was like &gt;&gt; and you rocked it. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ll use this as a base. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; make a couple of changes. &gt;&gt; What changes did you make? &gt;&gt; I changed the bases.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. Okay. So, the scheme is the same is what I was saying. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um Yeah.</p>
<p>And we uh we went again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And what was really funny, in two weeks, I managed to paint more Empress Children than I did in 9 months. I painted 10 infraras and 10 tormentors in two weeks. &gt;&gt; Hey, well, we&#x27;ll take those odds.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll take those odds for sure. &gt;&gt; Two over where we were at. &gt;&gt; I suppose the follow-up question is, are you inspired to paint more &gt;&gt; after my weekend? I&#x27;ve just had painting to keep my marriage and my hair. No, &gt;&gt; you set that president. None of these people did.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It worked. We&#x27;ve long established on this channel I paint better under pressure and with a deadline. This one &gt;&gt; maybe with extreme pressure and &gt;&gt; I think this I think this one was stupid. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Like painting 20 blood claws to go to no retreat was probably the max where we should go like in terms of pressure. Like I&#x27;ve got to go to this tournament on this day. &gt;&gt; Not I&#x27;m going to I&#x27;m not going to I&#x27;m going to end this with less painted miniatures than I should have have and I&#x27;m also going to lose my hair. &gt;&gt; Yeah. See I don&#x27;t like painting with pressure at all.</p>
<p>Like I I don&#x27;t like it. Um so see &gt;&gt; I v with it. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re &gt;&gt; Was it used to say what was it used to say? Pressure makes diamonds. Is that what you should say to me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then Alan Sheer said pressure pressures for tires and that kind of stuck with me for a while.</p>
<p>Um Alan Sheer man. Um but yeah, I I suppose Okay. Well, if you&#x27;re not inspired, do you want to like play games with with them at least? &gt;&gt; Um I&#x27;d like to play with them. I&#x27;m not inspired is probably not the right word. I think &gt;&gt; I did wake up on Sunday and go, well, I could do some more painting and I was like, no, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s have a break because it&#x27;s been ridiculous.</p>
<p>M &gt;&gt; um so I think it was two weeks ago I had six flawless blades to finish to get to 500 point 550 points total. So uh two sets of three. That was the goal for this video and to not have to shave my head. &gt;&gt; And how&#x27;s that looking now? &gt;&gt; Well, we got 550 points. I painted I finished them on Saturday.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll have seen in the B-roll. They I do I do quite like them. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ll take that. We will take that. We&#x27;ve now got 26 painted miniatures.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s great. And if your logic of the Primark&#x27;s rounding off the two and a half thousand, um, that means you&#x27;ve got 2K to go. &gt;&gt; How you feel about that? &gt;&gt; Here we are. &gt;&gt; Choosing to ignore that. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>Words and logic, of course. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, my ne my plan next is potentially to do the noise marines again. &gt;&gt; How many? &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a lot.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But then I haven&#x27;t got to do any more chaff at all. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s enough to break you, isn&#x27;t it? &gt;&gt; Haven&#x27;t been broken yet. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m genuinely scared for the the moment that you are. &gt;&gt; I think you&#x27;re more just curious what&#x27;s going to the straw that&#x27;s going to break the camel&#x27;s back. I mean, you&#x27;ve lasted three years as far as this channel is concerned.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what is enough to push you over the edge. I mean, I even recommended a um a Teletics challenge to to push you along a bit and get us some more painting time and we can record it and make a fun video out of it and stuff. And then you went absolutely not. And I was like, okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but sure has been stressful enough, let alone trying to do it all in a day.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would that not all of it to do all of it. You just give yourself a limit and then you paint that in a day. &gt;&gt; I think if I do 12 noise marines next, that&#x27;s 32 chaff. &gt;&gt; How many points is that? &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re 145 per per &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so call it 300.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um, so that still leaves you with 200 points to paint &gt;&gt; and it might And then it&#x27;s two rhinos. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a lot. &gt;&gt; But it&#x27;s also the bulk of the army. Everything after that is just straight fun.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s double demon prince Molof fiend &gt;&gt; I suppose. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I do really want to paint one of Well, do I really want to paint one and I really don&#x27;t want to paint one of the demon princes you made. &gt;&gt; Which one don&#x27;t you want to paint? &gt;&gt; Either of them cuz they scare me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I see what you mean. &gt;&gt; Not because I don&#x27;t like them and I&#x27;m the ungrateful horrible person.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, you are an ungrateful horrible person cuz other anybody with a brain would have painted them by now. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; You were given beautiful minis that &gt;&gt; and I&#x27;m going to paint them. Out of the goodness of my heart, I b my cold black heart. &gt;&gt; They are Don&#x27;t do me like that.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re ready to go. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve did I&#x27;ve done the bases. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve fixed the base on the spider one. Well, I say fixed it. Covered it in a mountain of PVA glue and go that&#x27;ll hold.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That was like I don&#x27;t know every day in the life of me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, they&#x27;re sprayed. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re ready to go. It&#x27;s just &gt;&gt; I want to divert as much time to them as I can.</p>
<p>and trying to paint one for a deadline for a video probably won&#x27;t do them justice. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m telling you they won&#x27;t. But the problem you&#x27;ve got is you&#x27;ve got Full Grim and two demon princes, which all three of them are pretty mental miniatures. Full Grim uh you actually gave a crazier base, so it&#x27;s going to take you longer. So I suppose as far as deadlines are concerned, what are we calling this for the end? Is it the end of 10th edition? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want to be carry I don&#x27;t want to be carrying this into the 11th edition launch box. So, we&#x27;ve probably got until about June, July. &gt;&gt; You trying to hurt me? &gt;&gt; Okay, we&#x27;re halfway down Feb Feb now. Like, let&#x27;s say you put some pink on some minis between Feb and March, right? March, April, May. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve done worse things.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not even we I&#x27;ve got like what 600 points in a Primark to go. And will you get that done in three months or? &gt;&gt; Yes. I&#x27;ve got all the easy stuff left. Like all the big stuff. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve got the reverse.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve done all the easy stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, no. No. Hold on.</p>
<p>Pause. No. You&#x27;ve still got to finish the easy stuff. &gt;&gt; Well, no. The the only easy stuff I&#x27;ve got left to do is Well, I&#x27;m putting it easy in aircraft.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s nothing easy about noise marines. &gt;&gt; No. No, there&#x27;s not. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s nothing easy about tormentors and infractors. &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>Well, to be fair, you really peaked with the flawless blades. I think they look phenomenal. So, I think anything sort of similar to that in that scheme, I think is going to look great either way. I think rhinos are really nice and easy, but still only like what 180 190 points. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re 80 points each.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; 80 160 points for two. Oh god. Wow. Yeah. Well, &gt;&gt; what we could do is we I could buy four more and we could I could run rapid evation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Four more. &gt;&gt; Six rhinos. &gt;&gt; But how many points is that? &gt;&gt; Six times eight. 400. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, wrong. 480. &gt;&gt; 500 points are right. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I also feel like I should stop buying things for this army.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think you should stop buying things. Full stop. But that&#x27;s just me. That&#x27;s just me. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And then there&#x27;s there&#x27;s to be fair there&#x27;s more for the 2K army. There&#x27;s two Lord Cacophonists, a Lord Exultant &gt;&gt; as well. I want to They&#x27;re all going to be fun. That&#x27;s why I want to get the bulk done and then I can just be like, &gt;&gt; &quot;So, when &gt;&gt; straight funds, &gt;&gt; I suppose what&#x27;s the next check in for you then? Is it going to be a,000 points?&quot; &gt;&gt; I think it has to be. But the trouble is your next check in will be 2,000 points and mine will be a,000.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s your fault. That&#x27;s got nothing to do with me. Like, I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re part of this whole nonsense. &gt;&gt; I have been waiting for a year. &gt;&gt; You have not had 1400 points ready to go for a year.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What was the last thing I did? the Predators. &gt;&gt; No, I don&#x27;t think it was. I think it was the Saturnine Predator and even that was a doing it for funsies. Um, yeah, I&#x27;ve been waiting for I&#x27;ve been waiting for a very long time. Um, &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to I&#x27;ll put it live on the internet.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not going to not paint the miniatures you made because that&#x27;s just that&#x27;s just mean. &gt;&gt; Well, I wouldn&#x27;t consider it as you being mean. I would just never ever talk to you again. &gt;&gt; Just put a wall up here and go, &quot;Welcome to the Kieran Show.&quot; Oh, no. I would You&#x27;d never see my face again.</p>
<p>Goodbye, internet. Um, but yeah. Um, well, I look forward to the next um check-in, but I suppose the next question is when that will be because it&#x27;s either in March or April. It&#x27;s up to you. See how we go because the um the end of the edition is a vibe, should we say.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen, &gt;&gt; but I mean, if it&#x27;s going to be a defiler, that&#x27;s going to get you some a few points. &gt;&gt; A pink defiler would look really cool in my army. &gt;&gt; I think two defilers as in like one for you, one for me. &gt;&gt; I thought two for me. I was like, &gt;&gt; what you want, brother? &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>No. I think as sort of like a high five with defilers. Um, I think that could be quite fun. &gt;&gt; Record the video to file this. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s I&#x27;m not sure that will land.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Two two defiler for each army would look cool. I think a defiler like I like I said in the previously the defile will look really cool in pink and it looks like you can actually take it Empress Children. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve already been planning my kit bash &gt;&gt; north. &gt;&gt; Very excited. &gt;&gt; Anyway, if you uh if you want to buy your own Empress Children and finish them before I do um &gt;&gt; not that side, it&#x27;s down there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Down there. &gt;&gt; Now it&#x27;s these people. &gt;&gt; Go join these guys. Um yeah, welcome to the cult of Kieran. &gt;&gt; Kieran&#x27;s children &gt;&gt; be very our sweet sweet babies.</p>
<p>Um but yeah, there any of those things that you will do help us massively. Um and we&#x27;re planning on growing the show a little bit bigger this year at least. &gt;&gt; Grow another shower. &gt;&gt; There it is. Uh maybe 40k by the end of the year.</p>
<p>That&#x27;ll be quite cool. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not going to happen. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re not going to happen. Anyway, thanks so much for joining. I don&#x27;t even know what the video is next week.</p>
<p>So, peace and love. Guess we&#x27;ll find out together.</p>
