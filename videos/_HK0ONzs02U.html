            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel and we&#x27;re uh on our 481 video of uh covering the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson a lot a lot of lot of videos on um the reciprocal system of theory U Mr Larson was an engineer who lived in the US uh in the 20th century in 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how the universe operated and then he uh took his fundamental principles uh fundamental postulates and elab elaborated them into a theoretical universe and then uh in books like the book we&#x27;re looking at today basic properties of matter Larson Compares his theoretical Universe with the uh empirical measured universe of the uh mainstream Legacy scientists that they compiled in their scientific tables and so we&#x27;re looking at um chapter 10 right now of this book that is called um uh electrical resistance uh earlier chapters covered like melting point boiling point and the specific heat compressibility interatomic distance um and so now we&#x27;re looking at electrical properties uh we just got done with the chapter on electric current and this is on electrical resistance now if you want the rundown of the details of larsson&#x27;s reciprocal system you&#x27;re going to have to go to one of my earlier videos I did 474 videos where I explain the reciprocal system in at least some detail uh enough for you to be able to follow along I think uh but uh you can try following along right here and hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to explain some things uh the main point that you just need to really get is that the reciprocal system is a theory of everything so it has Universal application so even though we&#x27;re just talking about electrical resistance today electrical resistance has analoges in other fields and so the results of this study can be applied into other fields and they it can be applied generally and broadly so we&#x27;re not really just looking at this for the sake of understanding electrical resistance we&#x27;re looking at this for understanding how Larson goes about uh a formulating a theory of everything and how it can uh you can use it in your own life because Larson does have books also not only on chemistry but on Atomic physics and astrophysics and astronomy and economics and uh philosophy and um uh PS psychology um there&#x27;s some stuff on biology there&#x27;s some stuff on uh religion and uh some of his other uh Associates have written in uh further uh further Fields so now when we left off last time so anyway one of my first 474 videos on the reciprocal system will give you the once over on the reciprocal system and then uh you&#x27;ll be able to uh you know follow along with these subsequent videos now uh we&#x27;re going to go back half a paragraph here um Larson is about to present this table and it&#x27;s on uh zero temperature at zero resistance so what Larson does is he arrives at an equation for the zero resistance of an of atoms and then he um applies uh his equation to every atom uh you know um and some molecules and then he compares the results with the scientific tables and now what he was doing earlier is he was kind of complaining that uh it&#x27;s pretty hard to do this particular thing thing with resistance because the experimental results from the Legacy scientists are notoriously inacurate and um they haven&#x27;t worked out all the Kinks in particular having to do with uh P the purity of the sample uh if you you know uh the resistance of a conductor is thousands and thousands of times lower than like the resistance of a an insul and so if a sample of a conductor has even a tiny amount of an impurity uh an insulator within the conductor then it completely skews the experiment and so you have to do be very careful about um making sure that you have a very pure substance uh if you&#x27;re checking if you&#x27;re uh measuring the resistance in particular of conductors so so um and there are other other reasons too why the um uh the experimental data is uh kind of lacking and so Larsson was basically just saying well I think the agreement that I got with the scientific tables is pretty much as good as you can expect um given that the uncertainty is involved in the experimental process okay the existence of this this amount of agreement in spite of all the influences uh tending to generate discrepancies is about as good a confirmation of the validity of the theory uh as a general proposition as can be expected under the existing circumstances furthermore it is not unlikely that there are alternate resistance patterns that result in explainable deviations from the calculated values and some of the larger discrepancies may be thus accounted for when an invest tigation of broader scope is undertaken okay so Larson uh actually uses pretty much the same equation that he uses for um determining the uh uh the specific heat one of the temperature relations um I think for the uh initial uh the initial temperature the T sub one is what he called it I think uh he uses the same equation and he plugs it in here and in some cases like lithium he calculates that the this is the temperature of zero resistance now remembering that uh you know we got the phenomenon of super conductivity uh superconductivity is normally only for very very cold elements like if if it doesn&#x27;t have any heat because heat is related to space um and the electron is a unit of a rotating unit of space and so the relationship between space to space is not motion the relationship of space to time is motion the atom is made mostly out of time and so the electron passes through matter made out of time very easily but it does not pass through space and so um uh when an element is heated it starts to lose its resist uh it starts to gain resistance very quickly um and so most of these atoms that it has a temperature of zero resistance so kind of below this temperature the atom is super conductive but Above This temperature it starts to get resistance and like so for example here with lithium he calculates that the temperature of zero resistance would be 56° Kelvin and um it that is observed it is observed to be 56° Kelvin but then here he he uh has an equation here for sodium and he predicts that that would be 24° Kelvin and the actual observed result Again The observed result could be wrong it it could be inaccurate as well um it you know in fact it&#x27;s probably more likely that the theoretical value is accurate than the experimental value uh in this particular case according to what he said earlier anyway so he predicted that the uh temperature of zero resistance for sodium would be 24 degrees but it&#x27;s actually 30 degrees here with potassium he predicts that to be 16° and The observed value is 17° um but on the other hand uh for example he has um let&#x27;s see here he&#x27;s actually pretty close in most situations gallium he predicts this to be 16° and the observe value is 31° [Music] um other than that he&#x27;s at least you know he&#x27;s within a handful of degrees usually in most the cases um no no huge no huge discrepancies um you know especially given how inaccurate the results are supposed to be okay uh let&#x27;s go to the back to the text for the second defining value of the resistivity curves so the first value you know when you&#x27;re putting together curve is the temperature of zero resistance or I guess you would call that r subz or I think resistance is is usually R um for the second defining value of the resistivity curves we can use the temperature coefficient of resistivity the slope of the curve a magnitude that reflects the inherent resistivity of the conductor material the temperature coefficient as given in the public physical tables is not the required value this is merely a relative magnitude the incremental change in resistivity relative to the resistivity at a reference temperature usually 20° celsus which is 293 de Kelvin plus what is needed for present purposes is the absolute Coe efficient in micro ohm cm per degree or some similar unit so didn&#x27;t quite understand that but he&#x27;s looking for the absolute coefficient of resistivity as opposed to the relative which is what the um scientific tables provide is the relative resistivity at a reference temperature usually 20 ° he&#x27;s looking for a a actual a value that is um like on a per degree basis so that can be plugged in at any temperature value some Studies have been made in this area and as might be expected it has been found that the electric one-dimensional speed electric and one-dimensional are basically anous that the electrical speed displacement is the principal determinant of the re of the resistivity okay so now in Larson&#x27;s atom he&#x27;s got three numbers for his periodic table uh two two-dimensional rotations again Larson is the re the universe of motion so everything is made out of motion and your atom is made out of uh two two-dimensional rotations and one onedimensional rotation that the third so those are a b and c numbers the c number is the electric uh speed displacement or the electric rotation so he&#x27;s saying it has been found that the electric speed displacement is the principal determinant of the resistivity so this is the major factor that goes into that third number the c number in every atom is the major determinant for the resistivity in the sense that it is responsible for the greatest amount of variation however the effective quantity is not usually the normal electric displacement of the atoms of the element involved as this value is generally Modified by the way that the atom interacts with the electrons the conclusions that have been reached as to the nature and magnitude of these modifications are still rather tentative and there are major uncertainties in the empirical values against which the theoretical results would normally be checked to test their validity the results of these Studies have therefore been omitted from this volume in Conformity with the general policy of restricting the present publication to those results whose validity is firmly established the experimental difficulties that introduced uncertainties into the cor correlations between the theoretical and experimental values of the resistivity do not play as large a role in the relative resistance under compression the compression results therefore uh give us a more definite and unequivocal picture again however this initial exploration of the subject as it appears in the context of the reciprocal system of theory will have to be confined to the regular pattern the one followed by most of the metallic conductors because the movement of electrons units of space through matter which is time is the inverse of the movement of matter through space the inter Regional relations applicable to the effect of pressure on Resistance are the inverse of those that apply to the change in volume Under Pressure remembering again that the inter Regional relations have to do with moving across a sector boundary there are really four sectors of larsson&#x27;s universe the uh four regions two sectors four regions we got the material sector and the cosmic sector and they&#x27;re divided by the unit speed boundary and then within the material sector which is on the slow side of the unit speed boundary within the material sector we have another boundary that is related to the unit of space everything less than one unit of space is in what he calls the time region this is because of the discrete unit postulate you have to have a full unit of something before you have something and so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you don&#x27;t have space and so instead you only have time and so if two particles approach each other to one unit of space they can&#x27;t get any closer because there is no less than one unit of space so instead what they do is they move apart in time uh which is the equivalent of moving closer together in space because space is the reciprocal of time so if you move a part in spa in time you moving closer together in space or the equivalent thereof Larson refers to that is equivalent space and uh he refers to the whole thing as the time region but if you are peering into the time region from uh the rest of the material sector which he calls the time space region somewhat confusingly um there is a lot lost in the translation of looking across that unit space boundary first what you see in equivalent Space is really a two-dimensional projection of a one-dimensional motion and secondly um what you see is uh reduced by the inter Regional ratio and so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying the inter Regional relations applicable to the effect of pressure on Resistance are the inverse of those that apply to the change in volume Under Pressure we found in chapter 4 that the volume of a solid under compression conforms to the relations of uh P * uh V uh volume pressure times the square of the volume pv^ 2 equals k a constant by reason now this was from chapter 4 this is the pressure volume uh which is a uh an offshoot of Bo&#x27;s law which is eal PV energy equal pressure * volume uh but since we are in equivalent space in the time region the volume has to be squared and so instead we have PV ^2 equals a constant uh I guess that would be under constant temperature uh since the K energy was related to uh temperature by reason of the inverse nature of the electron movement the corresponding equation for electrical resistance is p^2 R equals K so now it&#x27;s the P part the pressure that is squared and resistance moves in as opposed to volume so pressure to the second power times resistance equals k equals a constant as in the compressibility equation the symbol p in this expression refers to the total effective pressure if we give there because there&#x27;s an internal pressure which has to do with the progression of the natural reference system and then there can be an external pressure that is related to you know external factors if we give the internal component of this total designation P Sub 0 as in the volume compressibility discussion and limit the term P to the externally applied pressure the equation becomes uh the quantity P plus P Sub 0 to the 2 power * r = k the general situation with respect to the values of the internal pressure applicable to resistance is essentially the same as that encountered in the study of compressibility some elements maintain the same internal pressure throughout Bridgeman&#x27;s entire pressure range some undergo second order transitions to higher um pressure uh P Sub Zero values and others are subject to first order transitions just as in the volume relations uh a second order transition is when you change the um rotations that are involved in the uh again the A and B and C rotations that are involved in the in the U phenomena under consideration and a first order transition is when you change the geometrical package of the um you know of the array of atoms you know how far they are apart and if they are in a you know hexagonal close packing pattern or tetrahedral P packing pattern these things uh also change the geometry so these are two transitions that the atoms can undergo that uh will usually subtly change uh at least in terms of the first order transitions not so much in the second order transitions will subtly change the um values of the um in this case the um resistivity okay so uh some undergo second order transitions to higher P Subzero values others are subject to first order transition I just as in the volume relations however the internal pressure applicable to resistance is not necessarily the same as that applicable to volume in some substances tungsten and platinum for example these internal pressures actually are identical at every point in the pressure range of Bridgeman&#x27;s experiments in another and larger class the applicable values of P Sub 0 are the same as in compression but the transition from the the lower to the higher pressure takes place at a different temperature the values for nickel and iron illustrate this common pattern the initial reduction of the volume of nickel took place on the basis of an internal pressure of 9113 um megak kilog per square cm somewhere between an external pressure of 30 million kg per square cm Vin&#x27;s pressure limit on this element and 100 m uh Mega kilogram per square cimer the initial point of later experiments at very high pressure the internal pressure increased to uh 1370 megga kilog per square cm from AZ ay factors are basically a BC factors with a small variation um 481 to 481 and2 in the resistance measurements the same transition occurred but it took place at a lower external pressure between 10 and 20 megga kilog per square cm iron has the same internal pressures in resistance as nickel with the transition position at a somewhat higher external pressure between 40 and 50 um I guess that would be Milla I mean Mega kilograms even though the M isn&#x27;t there but in compression the transition did not appear at all in Bridgeman&#x27;s pressure range and was evident only in the shock wave experiments uh carried out at much higher pressure all right let&#x27;s see uh sorry I just got lost there um don&#x27;t know where I am okay table 25 is a comparison of the internal pressures in resistance and compression for the elements included in the study the symbol X following or preceding some of the values indicates that there is evidence of a transition to or from a different internal pressure but the available data are not sufficient to Def uh to define the alternate pressure level okay so this uh table table 25 the internal pressures in resistance and compression now remember Bridgeman is the original investigator in this field and he was doing his investigations in the early 20th century I believe um but since then there have arrived these shock wave techniques which are able to uh get to a much higher pressure level and be able to measure um compressibility and um uh what you call uh th uh not thermal expansion but uh I guess it is compressibility what the volume you know how how much you can compress the volume um you know depending on the amount of pressure you&#x27;re putting on it and so we will take a look at some of the ins and outs of this table um tomorrow as we move through this chapter I think we&#x27;ll probably finish the chapter tomorrow but we will um conclude today at uh at this place now just keep in mind that you know we may have covered a lot of ground here that you know you&#x27;re not familiar with but again the main point is to recognize that we&#x27;re dealing with the theory of everything so Larson is going to use the same techniques and the same thought process when he applies this to any subject and so we&#x27;re just kind of trying to glean um you know some breadcrumbs uh of how does he go about doing this you know what&#x27;s the what&#x27;s the process of formulating a theory of everything and then applying it uh broadly and he&#x27;s applying it narrowly here to this concept of compression or of really resistivity uh and comparing it with compression but how does this apply to other areas and I brought up earlier this week you know he was talking about the pressure the pressure and temperature relations you know and these are very applicable to you know what you would call Alchemy when we&#x27;re talking about her air fire and water now we are talking about you know solid gas vapor and liquid and so Larson has a whole process of heating up an atom and all the pro all the all the different stages an atom goes through when it is heated from zero temperature zero absolute temperature um where there aren&#x27;t any atoms really and the atoms get formed at very very very low temperatures um on the absolute scale and then gradually they&#x27;re heated up and they go through various transitions before they get to the melting point and so this is you know a a very good tool to really understand the solid state and this would be the Earth element you know and then he&#x27;s got Larson has a set of papers on the liquid state and you know you study if you study the liquid state then you could really understand that water element of alchemy so um these these do have broad applications but you just have to be somewhat creative and um open-minded when you look at the different uh the different areas and you know with when you do study Larson and that&#x27;s why we spent so much time with him you really need to go into all the different fields that Larson that Larson wrote on and kind of see how he does it in these fields and see that he&#x27;s applying his principles consistently depending regardless of whether it&#x27;s astronomy or chemist or atomic physics you know whether you&#x27;re talking about an atom or you&#x27;re talking about a solar system uh the rules are pretty much the same um they&#x27;re applied slightly differently you know but but you know we&#x27;re talking about a universe of motion and you know there&#x27;s certain rules that are involved but the main thing is that if you got a universe of motion motion exists before anything else does and so motion is always in the background there&#x27;s always this progression uh the progression of the natural reference system and it occurs at all times in all places and it&#x27;s occurring at a certain speed and that is the source of everything and then everything all manifestation comes from kind of modific of that source and so um you know that is kind of the major Paradigm shifter that you get okay well we will be back tomorrow to finish this chapter on electrical resistance and uh look into table 25 and I think there&#x27;s another table here after that and uh thanks for tuning in today have</p>
