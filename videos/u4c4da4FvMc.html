            <p>you know, but the the spiritual side of the experience is overwhelming. And what I&#x27;m afraid of is that we&#x27;re going to go too fast all of a sudden and not prepare people to what&#x27;s involved. Because once you say the phenomenon is real then people will inject their own you know their own beliefs uh their their own uh emotions into it and we know what happens when people do that. People fragment into different things. Um the the idea of uh UFOs is universal and you find it of course in the Bible.</p>
<p>You find it in you know the free religions of the book. you find it uh you know going going back to Ezekiel and to to ideas that that has been present in the the consciousness of of many people for many years and then it&#x27;s broken up into different belief systems around it because we we need to project you know what&#x27;s going to happen to us when we die you know where do we come from what does all this mean? How should we behave here, you know, in society? And all of that is at stake. It&#x27;s not just that we&#x27;re going to shake the hand or the the tentacle of a venuion. You know, this is not this is not the problem. The problem is much deeper.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s us. And what we imagine as being the universe that is at stake and that&#x27;s why there is so much we think of it as resistance from the scientific community. It&#x27;s not resistance. It&#x27;s that well it is resistance but it comes from the feeling of that that it it takes you too far too quickly and we have not built the u you know that the scale of discoveries that we need to build to get there when uh and of course I I studied physics I have a degree in physics but I I have not I&#x27;m not current on on modern physics, but I have friends who do and I talk to them and they tell me what is involved here is that we need to let go of the idea of time and space as dimensions. But when the air force sends somebody to interview a witness, they say, &quot;What time was it when you saw that? You know, where were you? Where did you go? How long did it last? Well, all those questions have to do with time and space.</p>
<p>If time and space are disposable, which is what this is not what UFOs say, that&#x27;s what what modern physics teaches, but it doesn&#x27;t teach it at the, you know, at the ordinary student level. It&#x27;s at the research level that when you look at the contradictions between relativity, general relativity and quantum mechanics that you hit that problem that you need to go, you need to let go of the idea of time and space because those were secondary concepts built on top of something much deeper. And with UFOs, you have to go deeper. I mean, talk about that large object that uh disappeared into nothing that just vanished from the universe. It vanished from our universe.</p>
<p>Well, is there another universe where it&#x27;s going? You know, how can it without noise, without acceleration, how can it just move along and fade into</p>
