            <p>when direct current with high volage and this is anywhere between up to 300 KS is applied to the gravitator it swings up the ark until its propulsive Force balances the force of the Earth&#x27;s gravity result at that point then it stops but it does not remain there the pendulum then gradually returns to the vertical for the starting position even while the potential is maintained and so I&#x27;ll repeat that afterwards because I know it&#x27;s a lot to absorb but to me this was a very interesting confession because all of this research that I&#x27;m showing you now implies that static high volage is all you need whereas Brown tells you it&#x27;s more of pulse High bage okay so here&#x27;s the uh diagram that Paul have I let I need to give him lots of credit because he made the first book possible um by actually adding his interpretation and diagnosis of what the B2 had done to implement the um electroic designs and I&#x27;m happy to say at a conference just recently I had a fellow from the dod come up to my booth point to the subtitle reports on a new propulsion methodology get his wife&#x27;s attention and then said I want to buy your book and essentially as we started talking he says well I want to see how much you know I know all about the B2 and so he was very surprised that I put all this into a book but the nice thing is hopefully we&#x27;ll have dialogue and the more I can display how much I know the more possible I&#x27;ll say possible declassification is because it all is based on how much you know and if you if you know enough about a classified project it&#x27;s very likely that you can push it out into the Declassified area such as the global positioning satellites thank God they Declassified that scrambling method otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t even know where we are and there was a military scrambling project that was classified so there is hope for classification</p>
