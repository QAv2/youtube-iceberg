            <p>the Intel agencies are not allowed to play in American politics to influence election outcomes and they&#x27;re absolutely doing that how do you stop that well I think you need to have people that are there who are fearless and obviously Tulsi and RFK Matt being at doj those are the types of people that you need to get under the hood you&#x27;ve got to shut their funding off until they can prove to your satisfaction that things are but wait we&#x27;re not even allowed to know what their funding is we don&#x27;t know what the cia&#x27;s budget is when you&#x27;re within government you can know those those answers know the size of the black budgets so um I have never been in government but I&#x27;ve certainly been around this a lot they&#x27;re huge so why do we have black budgets it&#x27;s a great question Tucker I mean there dramatically more transparency needed and I would say it&#x27;s one of those areas where not unlike the over classification there are things we need to know a lot more about</p>
