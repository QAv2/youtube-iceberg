            <p>hello out there and welcome to my channel this uh channel is for educational purposes and uh we like to take really deep dives into um things that I believe are great theories of everything or all-encompassing theories theories that you can hang your hat on and that you can uh build your uh alternative Paradigm or your holistic worldview um upon them and today is our 415th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and this is a system of theory that was arrived at by one dwey B Larson back in the 20th century in about 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how the universe operates uh then through a process of deduction he um deduced a theoretical Universe uh basically you know through a process of if then if this than that um he constructed a theoretical Universe about what the universe would look like if his two postulates were correct and then uh he wrote a number of books over the um remaining 30 years of his life and he uh you know on physics and chemistry and astronomy also on economics and uh a book on metaphysics which includes stuff on philosophy and religion and psychology and biology and I&#x27;m sure if he would have lived long enough he would have branched out into other theories as well and some of his followers have uh but uh in his books he basically compares his theoretical Universe with the uh empirical universe of the Legacy scientists what they have measured in their Laboratories and compiled in their tables and uh we are looking at uh one of his books today called the basic properties of matter and uh this is on chemistry and so he takes his theoretical universe and deres equations for are the basic properties of matter such as uh today we&#x27;re going to be starting a chapter on interatomic distances he&#x27;s also got uh sections on uh temperature relations like the boiling point and the melting point the critical point um the uh compressibility um and uh we will be going through those I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;re going to go through this whole book cuz we&#x27;re moving very slowly but uh we definitely uh get into the meat of it anyway um now the uh Larson&#x27;s uh two fundamental postulates are dominated by the first postulate and the first postulate says that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions Indiscreet units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so more or less uh the universe is not made out of matter not made out of energy it&#x27;s made out of motion specifically it&#x27;s made out of kind of motion he calls scalar motion which is a directionless motion does not have a a specific Direction um but it does have a magnitude and you can uh visualize this using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other and in fact even the points between the dots the locations between the dots are moving away from each other also every location is moving away from every other location but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction they&#x27;re just all moving away from each other if you suck in the balloon they will all be moving toward each other and it will actually look like they&#x27;re gravitating if you take one dot and uh call it the reference point and assume that it is motionless uh all of the other dots will be moving toward that one dot and it will look like there is a gravitational field around um and it you will me uh mathematically it will look that way as well so Larson calls that an AS if Force the outward motion Larson calls the progression and the inward Force Larson calls gravitation and um motion is the relationship between space and time uh that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time space and time are basically identical but they are um reciprocals of one another just like 3 over 1 and 1 over 3 are reciprocals of one another they have the same qualities but they have them in a different order and um uh space and time motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator and uh motion comes in many many different varieties all of our basic scientific quantities are forms of motion such as matter and energy speed acceleration force pressure viscosity fluidity uh electric charge electric current magnetic flux electrical capacitance these are all power these are all forms of motion and they all have their um individual signatures in terms of space and time such as speed is space over time energy is time over space pressure is time over space to the fourth power matter is time to the thir power over space to the thir power acceleration is space over time to the second power these are all different kinds of motion and they&#x27;re represented by fractions of space and time but space and time can have three dimensions that&#x27;s what Larsson calls coordinate space and coordinate time these are really our uh reference systems spatial reference systems this is a um three dimensions of space in a still frame uh that is our spatial reference system but uh and that we notice uh you know in our environment we can see XYZ coordinates in space or volume um but since space and time are reciprocals Larson also um extrapolates and arrives at a temporal or time reference system that is three dimensions of time in a still frame and um then also time and space have uh only come only in discrete units you have to have a full unit of space in order to have space you have to have a full unit of time in order to have time and um if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have that um entity and uh if you have one unit of space in one unit of time space over time being speed one unit of space and one unit of time is what lson calls unit speed 1 over 1 equal 1 and this unit speed is also the speed of life and this is the background uh motion of the universe uh the speed of light outward in all directions is omnipresent it&#x27;s always existing okay so that is what you have when you have a universe of motion when you have a universe of motion even in an empty universe that has nothing in it you still have motion motion precedes the thing that&#x27;s moving so you have to be able to conceive of motion without anything moving that is your empty Universal lson calls that the progression of the natural reference system Motion in outward in all directions at the speed of light and that is the basic motion that the universe is constructed out of um and you basically construct the universe by superimposing other motions on that Mo on that uh progression uh other motions also include rotation VI vibration and rotational vibration uh rotational vibration would be like that vibration is like that rotation and then rotational vibration and these different kinds of motion can be superimposed on this um outward progression and uh you end up creating first subatomic particles and then then U atoms and then molecules and then Aggregates of molecules all the way up to the largest galaxies now um if you have this background uh progression of the natural reference system as your neutral point or your null Point your zero point then that means that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light Larsson refers to these as the cosmic sector and the material sector respectively the material sector is really the only sector that the Legacy scientists know about Einstein said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larsson says that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe so there&#x27;s an entire half of the universe that Einstein and his followers are unaware of it&#x27;s called The Cosmic sector and that is uh where you have Cosmic matter uh which they call antimatter or msons and um those two sectors are reciprocals of one another meaning that they have identical qualities except they are in Reverse uh role reverted roles uh reverse roles of space and time so in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space in a still frame or the the spatial reference system uh moving through clock time um the scalar Motion in time uh the clock is always getting well I say I used to say the clock is always getting later and later and later I&#x27;m not quite sure of that anymore so I&#x27;m instead going to substitute the clock is always getting F time is always getting farther and farther and farther apart like on the surface of an expanding balloon in space so so in the cosmic sector then we have a three dimensions of time in a still frame a a temporal reference system moving through space uh clock space a scalar motion through space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart so they&#x27;re the same except they they are in um the roles of space and time are reversed so too within the material sector you have um what he calls the time region and the time region is a region where um you the interactions uh of atoms and molecules for example are occurring in such a small space that they there is no space because uh of the discrete unit postulate you have to have a full unit of space before you have space and so if particles are interacting in less than that amount of space there is no space and there is only time because the universe is made out of space and time motion space and time so if it&#x27;s not space then it has to be time um and uh so this time region is the region of interaction of atoms and and molecules and um when you cross the boundary into this time region the rules invert again and now like in the normal outside region you have the progression is moving particles away from each other and gravitation is moving particles toward each other but in in the time region the progression is actually moving particles toward each other uh and gravitation is moving particles away from each other gravitation moves particles toward uh unit distance and the progression moves particles away from unit distance and the same thing is happening in the cosmic sector uh except with space and time interchange so you have what Larson calls the space region that is within one unit of time and uh Cosmic gravit and Cosmic progression move in the opposite directions once you cross those boundaries um all of this forms kind of a yin-yang uh uh Arrangement that you can uh you&#x27;ll be able to see that if you look at my thumbnail uh that I&#x27;ve started putting up um that is a kind of a map gives you the uh all the the four sectors of the universe and the three boundaries that are involved so now Larson takes this and he moves into uh discussion here chapter 2 interatomic distances um now we left off with the end of chapter one where Larsson proposed his uh equation for the specific rotation and was connecting it to the meaning of um the interatomic distance uh hopefully he will sum some of this up I&#x27;ll try to fill in the gaps uh again I just have to mention that I do not understand this stuff uh to the best of my ability like I said yesterday I think I&#x27;m getting about 60 to 70% of this um after having gone through it several times um you know maybe my Acumen uh for science isn&#x27;t really that good because I&#x27;m a liberal arts person but I think actually I&#x27;m pretty well positioned to understand this stuff because uh I&#x27;m kind of a bulldog U but also because I don&#x27;t have a an extensive science background and so I don&#x27;t have all kinds of stuff to unlearn uh that is a characteristic of Paradigm shifts so um but I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not a master of this and I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s a person on Earth who is um including even Larson when he was alive lson made a lot of mistakes I believe his theory is correct whether he applied it correctly all the time I I don&#x27;t agree I don&#x27;t think so and I think that there are some people that have come along and have made some revisions to Larson that were on point as well Dr Bruce pet unfortunately Dr pet died in 2020 and Dr KV keru and uh nuu I believe is still uh still with us here um but um you know I don&#x27;t agree 100% with his interpretation either so uh that&#x27;s kind of what we&#x27;re doing is we&#x27;re trying to kind of construct a little bit of a consensus here or just kind of get an understanding of where larsson&#x27;s coming from okay so let&#x27;s start this interatomic distance chapter as equation 110 indicates the distance between any two atoms in a solid aggregate is a function of the specific rotations of the atoms okay uh now again an atom is a combination of rotations first you have uh two uh either well depending on who you who you follow Larson or peret and Neu uh you have uh two photons at the core of every atom now for Larson these are vibrational U motions simple they are simple harmonic motions for either one of them wav like motions um a particle uh wave or a a particle a photon um but uh the photon at the core of the atom is either a vibration for Larson or double rotation uh counter rotation uh or by rotation for nuu and and pet but that Photon then is rotated it must be rotated in three Dimensions um again remembering that the universe is threedimensional in Larson&#x27;s postulates and so it has to be rotated in three dimensions um to get it to basically to gravitate okay so every atom has a three number grouping uh not like uh so like the periodic table uh is just one number but for Larson it&#x27;s three numbers the uh primary two-dimensional rotation secondary two-dimensional rotation and then the optional onedimensional rotation uh that&#x27;s opposite and the first two rotations alternate uh in general as a statistical principle okay so two atoms in a solid aggregate is a function of the specific rotations of the atoms since each atom is capable of assuming any one of several different relative orientations of its rotational motion it follows that there are a number of possible specific rotations for each combination of atoms just to complicate things further this number of possible Alternatives is still further increased by two two additional factors that were discussed earlier the atom has the option as we noted in chapter 10 volume one uh the book called Nothing But motion of rotating with the normal magnetic displacement and a positive electric displacement when Larsson uses the word dis placement he basically means motion um he&#x27;s talking about the difference between the progression of the natural reference system and this motion so it&#x27;s not a motion per se it&#x27;s a displacement of an already existing motion okay so chapter 10 volume 1 of rotating with the normal magnetic displacement and a positive electric displacement or with the next higher magnetic displacement and a negative uh electric increment okay so for example um you can have the oxygen oxygen you can think of it as neon minus 2 you know oxygen is number eight on the periodic table uh it you could you could think of it as a neon rotation a neon is a I believe 32 um and then you could think of it as 32 minus 2 um or actually I guess it would be 22 minus 2 or if you&#x27;re taking it uh from Helium element number two which is 2 one0 you could also think of oxygen as 216 so there are two different orientations of oxygen uh and uh statistically normally it would be 2 2 -2 but there might be certain circumstances where is 216 and if it&#x27;s closer to the middle such as carbon carbon could be either 214 or 2 2 -4 and both of them are statistically about the same so you would be able to see carbon in um two different forms of carbon um commonly uh now that&#x27;s again making this a little bit more complicated but I just have to mention that even with all of the complication involved in all this it&#x27;s still a million times simpler than the the crap that they teach you in school okay it makes it it seems like what you&#x27;re learning in chemistry class is simpler because you learned it so long ago and you know you were uh open to it and you needed to learn it in order to get a passing grade or whatever um this system is way simpler than that but but there&#x27;s a lot of baggage that you have to brush off before you get to that point okay so um and in either case the effective the effective quantity the specific rotation may be modified by extension of the motion in a second vibrating unit as brought out in chapter one I&#x27;m still not completely clear uh even though at one point I think I used to be clear about this but I don&#x27;t quite understand what he means what he&#x27;s saying the extension of the motion to a second vibrating unit he discussed this in chapter one at the end and uh it left me behind I have to say but I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s completely necessary to understand that right now and I also believe that it will be explained further as we go along in this book so just put that in the back of your mind and we&#x27;ll get it uh we&#x27;ll get it resolved eventually it is possible that each of these many variations of the magnitude of this specific rotation and the corresponding values of the interatomic distances may actually be realized under appropriate conditions but in any particular set of circumstances certain combinations of rotations are more probable than the others and in ordinary practice the number of different values of the distance between the two the same two atoms is relatively small except in certain special cases as matters now stand therefore we are able to calculate from theoretical premises a small set of possible in interatomic distances for each element or compound ultimately it will no doubt be advisable to evaluate the probability relations in detail so that the results of the calculations will be as specific as possible but it has not been feasible to undertake this full treatment of the probability relationships in this present work in an investigation of so large field as the structure of the physical Universe there must not only be some selection of the subjects that are to be covered but also some decisions as to the extent to which that coverage will be carried a comprehensive treatment of the probability relations wherever they enter into physical situations could be quite helpful but the amount of time and effort required to carry out such a project will undoubtedly be be enormous and its contribution to the major objectives of the of this present undertaking is not sufficient to justify allocating so much of the available resources to it and again when Larson is saying the available resources he&#x27;s basically just referring to himself because he is the only person working on this and so you have to cut him some slack uh you know when you&#x27;re you&#x27;re comparing what he&#x27;s doing with the uh Army of Legacy scientists that are out there with billion dooll grants and so on um coming up with uh their various um you know um mainstream theories about this stuff uh Larson is just one guy uh with uh you know this enormous task uh and maybe he got a Little Help from some other people once in a while but it was pretty much you know he had one lifetime to get this done and so he had to make difficult choices about what to focus on similar decisions as to how far to carry the investigation in certain areas have had to be made from time to time throughout the course of the work in order to limit it to a finite size it might be well to point out in this connection that it will never be possible to calculate a unique interatomic distance for every element or combination of elements even when the probability relations have been definitely established as in many cases the choice from among the Alternatives is not only a matter of relative probability but also of the history of the particular specimen where two or more Alternative forms are stable within the range of physical conditions under which which the empirical examination is being made the treatment to which the specimen has previously been subjected subjected plays an important part in the determination of its of the structure okay so I believe that has to do with uh more uh Cosmic conditions um the ionization level and uh things like that that are really more in the purview of U astronomy it does not follow however that we are totally precluded from arriving at definite values for the interatomic distances even though no quantitative evaluation of the relative probabilities of the various Alternatives is yet available the nature of the major factors involved in their determination can be deduced theoretically and this qualitative information is sufficient in most cases to exclude all but a very few of the total number of possible variations of the specific rotations furthermore there are some series relations by means of which the range of pro uh variability the range of variability can be still further narrowed these series patterns will be more evident when we examine the distances in comp compounds in the next chapter and they will be given more detailed consideration at that point the first thing that needs to be emphasized as we begin our analysis of the factors that determine the interatomic distance is that we are not dealing with the sizes of atoms what we are undertaking is to evaluate the distance between the equilibrium positions that atoms occupy under specified conditions in chapter 1 we examine the general nature of the atomic equilibrium and again that equilibrium is established at the place where the progression of the natural reference system which is pulling all atoms toward each other in the time region and the force of gravitation which is pulling all atoms away from each other in the time region where those two forces or as if forces are equal that is where you have the equilibrium the forces are equal and so you have to and the um progression is constant and gravitation is variable so you have to have to find the spot where gravitation is equal to that constant value of the progression okay in this and the following chapter we will see how the various factors involved in the relations between the rotations of the Apparently interacting atoms the as if Force the Apparently interacting atoms affect the point of equilibrium and we will arrive at values of the interatomic distances under static conditions then in chapter 5 and six we will develop the quantitative relations that will enable us to determine just what changes take place in these equilibrium distance distances when external forces in the form of pressure and temperature are applied okay so first we&#x27;re going to determine the interatomic distances under static conditions that will he will do that in this chapter and the next chapter the next chapter will be on compounds this chapters just on atoms and then uh in the later chapters five and six uh we&#x27;re going to explore well what happens to these interatomic distances under the forces of pressure and temperature you know when you compress them that&#x27;s moving them closer together when you uh heat them that&#x27;s going to expand them so those those two forces are also relevant to the interatomic distance But first you got to figure out what the interatomic distance is like under kind of an abstract um standard temperature and pressure and then you add in that stuff later okay we&#x27;re going to stop there and um we will probably read the same paragraph This last paragraph over um again tomorrow but we will move into the meat of this chapter uh then tomorrow um don&#x27;t get discouraged this will all add up I I believe you stay with it uh thanks for tuning</p>
