            <p>People really struggle with the idea of not having reaction mass. They&#x27;re like, &quot;Okay, I know there&#x27;s no propellant, but what is it throwing out the back?&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and I think that&#x27;s where we, you know, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the major thing that we&#x27;ve uncovered here. That concept that what you&#x27;re actually throwing throwing out the back is you&#x27;re actually throwing out momentum. Quantum momentum.</p>
<p>You are actually conserving quantum momentum. Now quantum momentum is not something you can touch. Uh electric field momentum is not something that you can hold in your hand. It would be like, you know, if I had a, you know, as, you know, say my glasses here was a charge and it had a field off of it. It would be like pulling the field off of the glasses and say, &quot;Haha, I&#x27;ve got you now.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got the field. Um, that&#x27;s not how nature works. But that field has momentum.&quot; Okay? And that&#x27;s the trick. So what we&#x27;ve done is use second order perturbation theory to show you to show folks that there is something escaping this system that has momentum. In order to conserve that momentum, the whole system has to move.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the only way to get around it. Um when you have a source of an electric field coming out of the vacuum, the textbooks are like, well, here comes the electric field out of the vacuum and the vacuum recoils. But we&#x27;re going to ignore that and move on. So even when they draw the diagrams, they know they&#x27;re conserving momentum, but they have no they do not mention at all what are the effects of actually just recoiling the vacuum. They just it&#x27;s not necessary.</p>
<p>They just say it&#x27;s conserved and be and go on go on your day. But you can also conserve momentum with the actual field hitting the charges &gt;&gt; and vice versa. So, get this. A top NASA scientist believes he&#x27;s discovered a new fundamental force. One that could let us build engines that generate thrust without any propellant.</p>
<p>This could change absolutely everything about how we travel. Not just in space, but right here on Earth. Let&#x27;s dig into how this could even be possible. Okay, so let&#x27;s start with the big one. The question that really kicks this whole thing off.</p>
<p>For well over a century, our entire concept of propulsion, of flight, has been built on one single core idea. You know, every rocket we launch, every jet engine that flies, it all works by throwing stuff, mass out the back to push itself forward. It&#x27;s Newton&#x27;s third law, plain and simple. Action, reaction. And yet we keep seeing these things, these anomalies like the famous tic-tac UAP that seem to pull off impossible acceleration without any visible means of propulsion.</p>
<p>No smoke, no fire, no propellers, just silence. And that has been a huge nagging mystery for a long time. Right? So this really is a physicsdefying mystery. For decades, the whole idea of moving something without shooting propellant out the back was basically seen as crazy talk. You know, it was fringe science, something that violates the conservation of momentum.</p>
<p>It was considered impossible. But what happens when a true expert, someone who has dedicated their entire career to the very physics involved, decides to take a fresh look? And that&#x27;s where this comes in. The Exodus Propulsion Drive. And we&#x27;re not talking about some guy tinkering in his garage here. Meet Dr.</p>
<p>Charles Bueller. He&#x27;s a PhD physicist and he was NASA&#x27;s go-to guy, their subject matter expert on electrostatics. We&#x27;re talking space shuttle, the International Space Station. So, Dr. Buer through his private company, Exodus Propulsion Technologies, has developed and patented a system that he claims does the impossible.</p>
<p>It generates a real measurable propulsive force using only electric fields. No mass is ejected. Nothing is thrown out the back. And here&#x27;s the part that is just mindblowing. After years of work and refining their designs, their device has reportedly produced a force greater than one Earth gravity.</p>
<p>Let that sink in. That means it generated enough thrust to actually lift its own weight off the ground. If that&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s not just an improvement, it&#x27;s a revolution. Okay, so how in the world does this work? Well, the secret sauce apparently is something called asymmetrical force. The core idea is actually pretty straightforward in principle.</p>
<p>You use these specially shaped electric fields to create an imbalance. You make the electrostatic pressure greater on one side of an object than on the other. And when you do that, you get a net force. The whole thing gets a push in one direction. Now, for a long time, the forces they were getting were super super small, barely there.</p>
<p>But then they had this huge aha moment. It came from understanding the difference between two types of electric charge. There&#x27;s free charge. That&#x27;s like electrons moving in a wire. But then there&#x27;s bound charge.</p>
<p>These are charges that are basically locked in place inside an insulator like a piece of plastic. They discovered that using these bound charges produced way more force than anyone thought possible. And check this out. This graph shows you exactly what happened. This is real data from their lab.</p>
<p>You can see as they crank up the voltage, the force generated by the device just shoots up. This is the direct result of them figuring out how to harness those powerful bound charges. It&#x27;s the proof right there on the paper. All right, but all of this leads to the biggest question of all, a real head scratcher. I mean, if you&#x27;re not shooting anything out the back, what are you pushing against? Right? Newton&#x27;s third law says for every action there&#x27;s an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>So where is the reaction? This is where the theory takes a swan dive into the really deep end of physics. &gt;&gt; Okay, Dr. Charles, go ahead and switch it on. It was at negative. It was at positive 2 mg.</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s at -4 milligram. So it made the 6 mg shift that it was going to do. Go ahead and turn it off. And it takes about a minute to fully drain the capacitance from the system. There it is.</p>
<p>right back down to zero. And then it&#x27;ll probably drift positive because that&#x27;s what it was before. So, go ahead and turn it on again. See, there&#x27;s the positive. So, we&#x27;re applying 10,000 volts to the plates, and we just lost 4.8 8 4.95 5 mg of weight.</p>
<p>Okay, turn it off. Again, it&#x27;s going to take some period of time because the charge really doesn&#x27;t have anywhere to go. So it has to dissipate out through the styrofoam and basically but there it is. And then it should go. Yeah.</p>
<p>Any little motion of wind in the room is enough to send it into crankiness. &gt;&gt; There we go. Shutting down. This is where things get really wild. Dr.</p>
<p>Buller believes the drive isn&#x27;t pushing against anything in the normal sense. He thinks it&#x27;s interacting with the very fabric of spaceime itself, the quantum vacuum. And believe it or not, this isn&#x27;t some madeup sci-fi thing. The quantum vacuum is a real, if very strange, part of modern physics. It&#x27;s this sea of energy that&#x27;s everywhere, even in empty space.</p>
<p>So, here&#x27;s the theory in a nutshell. The drive&#x27;s special asymmetrical electric field messes with the energy state of the vacuum right around it. That change in energy creates a net force. It&#x27;s like the device is getting a little recoil or a push off of the vacuum itself, conserving momentum on a weird quantum level. Think about it like this.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got two ice skaters. One throws a ball to the other. They both push apart. Simple. But what if one skater could just throw that ball into the nothingness of the ice itself and still move backwards? That&#x27;s kind of what they&#x27;re saying is happening here.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a new kind of interaction, a third order effect where you can push off the vacuum to get the whole system to move. So if this pans out, if this is real, we&#x27;re talking about what they call a thousand-year technology. And the progress they&#x27;ve made is just staggering. Seriously, look at this. In 2016, they were measuring forces so tiny you could barely even detect them.</p>
<p>Then in 2021, they have that breakthrough with bound charges, and the force jumps way up. And by 2023, boom, they&#x27;re generating over 1g of thrust, enough to beat gravity. And this quote from Dr. Buer really says it all. He&#x27;s not just talking about a better engine.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s talking about a fundamental paradigm shift, a new force that will power human exploration and technology for the next millennium. So, what does this all mean for you? For us, the possibilities are just immense. We could be looking at trips to Mars that take days, not months. Aircraft that fly silently with incredible efficiency and no moving parts. A total revolution in how we get around here on Earth.</p>
<p>And maybe the biggest thing of all, a completely new tool to actually experiment on and understand the nature of the vacuum, the very fabric of our reality. Now, look, let&#x27;s be clear. This is still a huge if. It absolutely needs to be tested, replicated, and verified by other scientists around the world. But if what Dr.</p>
<p>Buer&#x27;s team has measured is real, then it&#x27;s not just a new engine. It&#x27;s discovery of a new fundamental force of nature. It&#x27;s the first step on a journey that could completely change our future. And the biggest question is what happens next?</p>
