            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Age of Disclosure. It came out. People are seeing it. We&#x27;ve got a question on X from Guitar and Jits. Please ask him about Marco Rubio&#x27;s latest comments on the Age of Disclosure from the Fox Hannity interview with Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>His comments don&#x27;t inspire any confidence. &gt;&gt; I agree. I mean, I think frankly, uh, [sighs] it&#x27;s clear Marco Rubio in his interview with Sean Hannity has acknowledged that the interview was done, he said three or four years ago. That&#x27;s not true. It was about two years ago.</p>
<p>My understanding is it was the winter of 2023. Um he knew full well what he was saying and I&#x27;m told by people close to the project that um uh he was fully aware of the edits and how his views were being represented. It&#x27;s perhaps unfortunate that now that he&#x27;s the acting national security adviser as well as the secretary of state. I would find it very hard to believe that Marco Rubio has not been briefed, read in, i.e. security briefed into the legacy program.</p>
<p>If he hasn&#x27;t been, then that&#x27;s another reason why the Trump administration needs to take the so-called deep state very very seriously. Indeed. I I was I was actually frustrated, I&#x27;ll be honest, with Sean Hennity&#x27;s interview because I was waiting for him to ask Marco Rubio as acting national security adviser, have you been briefed? Have you been read in or told anything about the UAP legacy</p>
