            <p>I&#x27;m Tim Ventura from American anti-gravity and I&#x27;m speaking today with Frank zidaric a Pioneer in gravity modification research and one of the early investigators of pogl off&#x27;s rotating disc experiment in the 1990s well Frank I&#x27;d like to start out by asking a bit about your background and how that led you into the experiments with polenov and NASA in the 1990s well well thank you Tim for inviting me on your show and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a pleasure to be be here with you and I appreciate your efforts in this area how I got interested in this work originally is I was a I&#x27;m an electrical engineer and I worked in the energy Fields I worked in Coal I worked in power generation and I saw the the environmental damage that was done by these resources and The Limited finite nature of these fossil fuels and I realize is our population increases and our population has become increasingly dependent on uh energy for transportation for food for making ammonia for fertilizers and I felt there must be a better way to produce energy and possibly get us off the planet to harvest natural resources from Beyond the bounds of the earth that&#x27;s was my motivation oh okay now this has led you to a new book that you&#x27;ve just published entitled energy cold fusion and anti-gravity and so that really describes your current research I&#x27;m wondering if you could tell me a little bit about that book and what led you down the path towards writing it what I was interested in is control of the other forces Beyond electromagnetism control of the electric and the magnetic field produced this marvelous age that we Liv in and the reason we can use the electromagnetic force it has a convenient range and strength for instance if you hold a magnet in your hand it&#x27;ll pick up some metal fragments that magnet also has a gravitational field but it won&#x27;t pick up anything because the gravitational force produced by something you can hold in your hand is far too weak and there did not appear a way to harness that and that&#x27;s what I studied is there a way to increase the strength of the local gravitational field and that&#x27;s basically what I got in my book some of my ideas on that subject you&#x27;re just referring to the fact that gravity is so many orders of magnitude weaker that the electromagnetic force is right yes gravity has the same effect as electromagnetism in some ways it radiates outwards it&#x27;s called a field that diverges outward and it affects uh material things and and electromagnetism reaches out and only affects charge particles but the gravitational field is 10 to the 39th power weaker than the electromagnetic field so we know what to do with the electromagnetic field we can spin it in the generator to make electricity put it in the speaker you&#x27;re hearing my voice through a speaker there&#x27;s a magnet in there we know what to do with that electromagnetism as a matter of fact the phone lines that are connecting us up enable this conversation there&#x27;s electromagnetism in there we can control it we can Vector it but gravity is so weak that we can&#x27;t even detect you know changes of it unless it involves a mass the of the entire Earth now imagine a magnet as strong as the entire Earth big as the Earth we&#x27;d be like stuck pulled down with a tremendous Force so gravity has been weak and current theory holds that it will remain weak at all times now it sounds like there are a couple of challenges there that one of the big ones is amplifying it but the other one is coupling to it in the first place and one of the things that you&#x27;ve really gone towards his graffito magnetism as a method of coupling to gravity can you tell me a little bit about what that is how it potentially couples and and what led you to that as a mechanism yes okay religion has laws Ten Commandments and you can violate these laws and you you will pay the consequences well science has a similar set of laws they&#x27;re called the conservation laws conservation of energy conservation of momentum and these laws cannot be violate it you can&#x27;t violate and pay the consequences later they&#x27;re like impenetrable and so we have to we have to look within the conservation laws to see what&#x27;s possible with electromagnetism the electric field is very weak too you can rub a balloon on your head and stick it on a wall but the force is feeble or you rub a cloth in Amber and it&#x27;ll pick up some dust but you can&#x27;t do much with it when you move an electric field it produces a magnetic field and that&#x27;s sort of weak too if you got a balloon rubbed it on your head then moved it pass something you wouldn&#x27;t get much magnetism but magnetism is not a conserved property of the universe you can get more of it and so when you have an electromagnet it&#x27;s a coil it&#x27;s very weak but you put some soft iron in that coil and it magnifies the electromagnetism the magnetic component of it by a factor of 10,000 or more so that shows us that it is possible to amplify the magnetic component of the electromagnetic field and the Magnetic component of all of the forces fields are not conserved and so if we had the right material would necessarily be soft iron there should be something out there that may be able to amplify the magnetic component of the gravito magnetic field and then we would have a very strong gravito magnet it would have the same structure as an electromagnet it would curl around from one in and out from one pole to another but it would affect everything not just charge particles it would it would have an effect on all of matter and just as Faraday with his original experiments using uh amber and making a static charge could not predict that the control of electromagnetism and lead us to Modern computers I cannot Envision where the control of gravito magnetism will take us but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be equally as as astounding yeah and and that that explains both the coupling that the choice gravito magnetism as well as the amplification because you&#x27;re saying that since magnetism isn&#x27;t a conserved Force you can make these incredibly large large Fields but they also couple to gravity and this is an area where I believe there&#x27;s a lot of ongoing research yes can have a gravitational Shield because if you had a gravitational Shield everything above that Shield would fly away so the moon would be above it it would fly away and the whole galaxy and a billion stars so obviously you made a gravitational Shield it better have enough energy in that Shield to move about half the universe and that&#x27;s clearly impossible gravitational shielding is impossible and that&#x27;s what prob ketov said he had but I think he misinterpreted I think he had a grav magnetic field and a magnetic field is a local field a magnet will you know pull on stuff for a certain range and it doesn&#x27;t pull anymore so you only have to put enough energy in a gravitomagnetic field to infect the local environment so it&#x27;s possible I I think I think he did it oh okay well now speaking of pinof I understand that NASA had difficulty replicating his original disc experiment and I think that was something that you were part of in some small way but I understand that they only were able to achieve a small percentage of the rotational speed that he originally claimed to see the effect at well they didn&#x27;t really replicate his experiment I I was down there uh they invited me to witness their experiments that would be uh lot Brantley I met David noever down there and had some discussions with him and and uh Glenn Robertson he and I followed through on that and recently published a paper peer-reviewed paper on this but what pintoff did was rotated a superc conduced disc it had multiple layers I&#x27;m not sure what the layers had to do with it and he exposed it to a radio frequency wave they never completed the experiment with exposing the disc to the radio frequency wave now what I found amazing what interested me was that the frequency of the radio wave and it was about 3 megahertz and the uh diameter the disc was 1/3 of a meter so I took the 3 megahertz radio wave multiplied it by 1/3 of a meter and I got a velocity of about 1 million m/ second I didn&#x27;t know what it was thought I thought that was something interesting it should be important I had that intuition that was important but at that time I didn&#x27;t know what it was and their funding was cut before they could duplicate that portion of the experiment now were you able to find out what that was in the meantime well what what happened about the same time as I went to Anaheim and I saw uh James Patterson in his clean energy technology cell and they were producing energy and this cold fusion experiment had a positive temperature coefficient that means the hotter that it gets the more energy produced and thermal heat has a uh a vibration to it or frequency to it in the infrared band about 10 to the 13 Hertz and also these things were occurring in the domain of about 50 nanometers so I multiplied the thermal frequency times the domain side and I got the same velocity 1 million meters per second that I saw in pod Clos experiment so now we have two vastly different experiments one involving gravitational modification with the superconductive disc and one involving low-level nuclear reactions that exhibited the same velocity and when I saw that I said there&#x27;s something going on here felt it was of fundamental importance yeah well what did it end up becoming are you able to talk about that at all oh yes absolutely that&#x27;s what I did in my book and uh that has to do with one of the greatest Mysteries Ever and and that has to do with the Quantum lumpiness of the world uh for instance if you&#x27;re going in your car and you want to go a little fast you push your speedometer you can go 10 mph faster 1 M hour faster tenth of a mile hour faster F if you go to your faucet you could turn it on full you could tweak it tweak it tweak it tweak it any flow you want but in this Quantum world it&#x27;s lumpy you can only have certain speeds the electrons orbit the atom in certain speeds it&#x27;s like if you&#x27;re going down in the down the road in your car and you push your accelerator and you&#x27;re going 10 you want to go 15 and you jump to 20 you can&#x27;t get the 15 why why does this Quantum world have this jump to it and nobody really knew U plank wondered about this and uh from the very beginning uh why is it jumpy and and the current Chain of Thought is that the quantum world is the true world and this classical world that we live is only like an illusion and our brain that&#x27;s wired to understand the classical world we really can&#x27;t understand the quantum because it&#x27;s it&#x27;ll always be mystical and I never really beli that and what I saw in these experiments led me to a solution to that problem it it sounds like from what you&#x27;ve described you&#x27;re really a supporter of the idea I guess that P ketov saw something unique and that it wasn&#x27;t just a a measurement error would that be fair to say yes that is definitely fair to say that I believe he saw something unique but some of his claims have been extreme that he&#x27;s doing things faster than the speed of light and he&#x27;s smashing bricks and these extreme claims that he&#x27;s made recently puts a shadow on his credibility yeah that makes sense but that original experiment I think that that&#x27;s kind of the one that you lean towards yes well what I found out is velocity of 1 million meters per second that is the velocity of sound in the nucleus and what I did was I set the velocity of sound in the nucleus equal to the velocity of light in the electronic structure of the atom and that means a mechanical wave equals the speed of an electrical wave and I got all these Quantum jumps I got the spectrum of the hydrogen atom from that analysis from a classical analysis when I set them to equal that that equal sign says that the sound of a mechanical wave equals the sound of an electrical wave and so for those waves to propagate at the same velocity of the forces that mediate them has has to equalize so during that Quantum jump the gravitomagnetic force acts strongly in it range and the electromagnetic force acts normally and the nuclear forces act at a longer range that it reduced strength so I was able to understand the quantum jump and what he&#x27;s doing when he&#x27;s spinning this disc he&#x27;s putting the whole thing into a state of quantum transition but it&#x27;s very very difficult because he has to induce this velocity of of 1 million met m per second in the nuclear structure and sound only propagates at 2,000 m/s so to get that vibration going at 1 million meters per second is is quite a trick and and and I think what they do in Cold Fusion is they have dissolved hydrogen atoms that they stimulate can drive them and in poly cletus&#x27;s experiment he had the Light Elements like hydrogen it&#x27;s called an optical Photon sit there and vibrate and by the radio wave stimulating they get them all to vibrate together and the wave appeared to move at that frequency that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking happened oh okay yeah see I was going to ask about that next I was wondering if he was able to stimulate those radio frequencies further if he might be able to get a more pronounced effect absolutely and and you hit up on something see not everybody uh uses radio Wes uh it&#x27;s possible to get that stimulation going with shock and and I worked with Yuri poop we brought him a group of us into Los Alamos and he was using cavitation and cavitation is like hitting with the sledgehammer and so for that very brief instant you get a very strong impulse that tends to send that wave motion through the solid and so uh that&#x27;s another way of doing it P ketov Al also followed through with his latest experiments with an Impulse device where he hit the superconductor with a giant impulse of electromagnetic radiation and induced the wave motion by shock not just by a radio wave but there there&#x27;s other ways to do this yeah and it&#x27;s possible also that maybe it was the combination of the radio waves and the rotation and all of that that set up a resonance yeah that&#x27;s the key you have to be able to get the atomic structure moving at the same velocity as the Velocity assound in the nucleus and you have to set a resonance up and you have to get the material just right and you got to put the external stimulation and and when you do that then some remarkable things start to happen it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a a situation of impedance matching if I can explain it uh when an electron jumps from state to state it emits a single photon not a one Photon then a less another one of less intensity another one another one if you bounce a ball on the floor it bounces and bounces you get several bursts of sound until it finally diminishes to nothing but when one Q ball one billiard ball hits another the first one stops and the second one flies away all the energy is transferred in one step so you get one Spike of sound and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening in the quantum transition you get that one Spike it&#x27;s an impedance match system and that&#x27;s why you got to match the velocity of the vibrations in the superconductive structure to the speed of sound in the nucleus when those two speed matches it allows a smooth transfer of energy between systems and the energy flows from the gravitational system to the electromagnetic system produces nuclear transmutations and induces under the right conditions a strong avom magnetic field oh okay it sounds like you might be able to actually make this work without any rotation at all then if you were just just able to find what those ultimate resonant frequencies are yes hopefully you you could but there there is a lot a lot I don&#x27;t know uh I&#x27;m at the very fundamental mentals of it looking at the mathematics for instance I have a 1925 radial radio and I have a Kindle Fire HD if you look at both of them they&#x27;re completely different technology one has great big triodes and the other one has little Parts you can&#x27;t even see but the mathematics that that describes that motion is the same you know and I&#x27;m trying to look at the these systems and describe them mathematically but I don&#x27;t have the technology quite yet it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s another step it&#x27;s a lot more to do and the technology could emerge into a new computer someday but I&#x27;m trying to get it into that first step like that very first radio just just to demonstrate something yeah well the reason I asked about that was um I&#x27;d spoken to Tony Robertson quite a while ago and he had talked about doing his own research into finding reli methods to create those the crystal structure in those large diameter ybco discs that P clof was using and from what I understand those are really difficult to replicate it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a 12-in disc but um Robertson had claimed that there was a crystal structure on the inside of it and then the outside of it had a it was structurally a little bit different because of the centering process and he&#x27; said that the first few of these that he made and these aren&#x27;t cheap to press by any means the first few of them broke coming out of the press and then he finally started getting results but he was having trouble with it you know even so yes to get one and spin it at that high velocity is quite an accomplishment because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s ceramic it&#x27;s like a flower pot try try spin it in a flower ft at 1,000 RPM it&#x27;ll be in pieces before you know it and also he has layers in there there&#x27;s one layer then another layer it&#x27;s not really understood what the layers do I suspect that it opens up the structure to the stimulation so it can respond mechanically to the applied electromagnetic radiation but I don&#x27;t really understand that part of it there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a a lot more work to be done yeah now in terms of superconductors behaving like kind of macroscale quantum particles or going through that Quantum transition as you&#x27;ve describ I&#x27;ve read that this Behavior or similar behavior is also observed in gas plasmas under certain conditions and I was wondering do you think that a gas plasma device might be possibly replacement for the superconductors that were experimented with in the past I tried that and I suspect that there is something going on with gas plasmas and the manifestation of it is ball lightning my father told me when he was a small child lightning hit the chimney at that time they had a cook stove in the kitchen and a ball of lightning came out looked like a 25 watt bulb came out of the cook stove and rolled across the floor and rolled out in the yard went out in the garden and exploded so there&#x27;s something really really really strange about these balls of lightning where do they get the energy from I know from an electrical engineer Once you turn the power off and you have a high-speed camera that that Arc is extinguished within tenth of a second or less there&#x27;s not much thermal storage in in the in the air so how does that ball of lightning continue to supply energy for seconds or minutes it might be related but I don&#x27;t have enough information and we don&#x27;t always see balls of lightning they&#x27;re hard to find they don&#x27;t appear naturally in any circuits that we have that we have now yeah that&#x27;s an excellent point that the reason I&#x27;d asked about the gas plasmas is just because um it seems like that technology might cost less and be easier to manufacture on a large scale yes when I&#x27;m presenting my way many people have different ways ning Lee said that uh we&#x27;d spin the nucleons up uh like a centrifuge to many more get spinning really fast the nucleus in each each atom and that would produce the uh gravitomagnetic anomally I&#x27;m saying that if you put the whole state in the state of quantum transition by making the speed sound in the nucleus equal the speed of sound in the uh the structure that produces the the gravito magnetic anomaly so so so many people have have many ideas and I think from an outside perspective the verdict is still out I believe I&#x27;m right but I&#x27;m sure ning Lee believes she&#x27;s right too but how this is going to shake out I don&#x27;t really know okay I haven&#x27;t heard anything mentioned about ning Lee in several years now do you know if she&#x27;s still actively doing research I haven&#x27;t heard anything either but I&#x27;m quite sure if she would have been do if something would have materialized from her work that would have reached the Press so things like an old Soldier slowly fade away yeah if there if there is no result well you know there was another result um by uh Dr Martin Timar and he had done a rotation experiment and I believe that they used a marker almost like you you use a chalk Mark and a flywheel and they they showed a very very very minute uh what they believe to be kind of a warping of time space that came from that have you heard about this experiment at all yes matter of fact I met Martin tyar at the space if and he was there at my presentation matter of fact I have my lecture on the web and Martin&#x27;s introducing me he&#x27;s a very nice man and he was uh had a cryogenic helium in this uh device and spinning it and looking for anomalies with this uh Optical gyroscope and he detected some very small anomalies but much much larger than would be expected from general relativity with too small to do anything with and I I asked him did he apply radio waves and try to vibrate this material and he said no and uh he was at my lecture there and I don&#x27;t think that uh he followed my path he&#x27;s on his own path and he got so far and I think he&#x27;s sort of stuck now he&#x27;s getting small anomalies but he hasn&#x27;t done anything useful okay so the radio waves might have an application there as well and potentially maybe his experiment in a in a negative sense is almost kind of like a proof of concept for the the radio stimulation his uh gravitational anomaly is way larger than anything predicted by conventional Theory so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an astounding accomplishment but it&#x27;s way too small to do anything useful we can&#x27;t Propel the spacecraft off of it you we can barely detect it so so uh he he&#x27;s demonstrating a proof of concept but I I&#x27;m not familiar with the latest that he does but I suspect he hasn&#x27;t moved beyond that stage oh okay okay well I you one thing I should ask is do you know if uh the way that you&#x27;re looking at harnessing gravito magnetism is this a polarized phenomena like ning Lee had talked about an AC gravity where you could you know you could do push or pull with it and I I guess one thing I&#x27;m wondering is you know with with potentially future experiments do you know if this is something where you would only be able to create an anti-gravity effect or potentially you know create a stronger gravitational field as well I suspect what it&#x27;s going to do is is sort of like an electromagnetic force it&#x27;s going to tend to rotate things like a compass but it&#x27;s also going to tend to be expelled so it&#x27;ll be a repulsive Force that generates also a twisting motion uh uh electromagnetism has two positive and negative charge gravity only occurs in one charge so the gravitomagnetic field uh would sort of resemble the electromagnetic field of a neutron it has no charge but it comes out of one and circulates back into the other uh and I suspect that that it&#x27;s generally going to be repulsive so that we could rep repel off the atmosphere to get into space with the gravitomagnetic field that&#x27;s the kind of thing I&#x27;m looking at yeah yeah yeah well you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of how I envisioned it as well I mean what I&#x27;ve wrot about superconductors Shield quote unquote shielding magnetic field is obviously there there&#x27;s no way to Shield a magnetic field in the true sense but what they do is create an equal and opposite field because it induces a current inside and that that has the effect of negating that magnetic field it it constrains it do do you think that this might do something similar with a gravitational field well well see you&#x27;re getting into dialectric you put a dialectric between two plates it only reduces the strength of the original field it it can&#x27;t make any more make any less but you put iron in the magnetic field and it actually increases the magnetic field and so if we could if we could find the this superconductor is The Right Stuff the soft iron equivalent for gravitomagnetism then it would increase the gravitomagnetic field and and that field will will look like uh electromagnetic field it&#x27;ll curl around but it&#x27;ll have different properties uh I you&#x27;ve done experiments with u your lifter but the the the thing about the lifter is it has to repel off a Charged surface it can&#x27;t repel off a neutral air so once it gets away from the charged surface it&#x27;s sort of done with lifting but if you made a gravitomagnetic field it could repel off neutral air molecules and so it could repel off the atmosphere in general and take us into space and also Einstein said there&#x27;s this principle of equivalent so the inertial mass is equivalent to gravitational mass and once we start modifying gravitational Mass we may able we may be able to reduce the inertial mass of a spacecraft and uh Propel it promptly to the next star with conventional propulsion oh okay okay now that&#x27;s a little more speculative we have to get the gravitomagnetic field before we can do that but that that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s in the line of possibility yeah yeah now the the other aspect of this is the low energy nuclear reactions or or the cold fusion and one of the things that You&#x27; indicated was that these same forces that allow you to couple uh gravity magnetism may allow you to couple into the strong and weak nuclear forces right to be able to create these these what I suspect&#x27;s happening is this uh this material is is the soft iron equivalent for gravito magnetism but it&#x27;s also this soft iron equivalent for the strong nuclear force so it it&#x27;s this vibrating superconductor is is like soft iron for all the forces and and one of the one of the reasons I suspect this is in Cold Fusion you get uh nuclear transmutations without producing any radiation and that&#x27;s it&#x27;s like a no no everybody that&#x27;s in the field said this can&#x27;t possibly happen and it&#x27;s sort of like you&#x27;re driving your car over a speed bump when you hit that colic ball potential wall they call it you hit the bump you get a bang and that&#x27;s the sound wave would be equivalent to the gamma ray coming off but if you were running blindly and taking big steps and you stepped over the speed bump you would never know you passed over it and so if this gravito magnetic force can be Amplified and have a longer range than the strong nuclear force energy could be exchanged without producing radiation so that&#x27;s why I expect that the the magnetic component of the strong nuclear force that&#x27;s called the spin orbit Force it&#x27;s similar in structure again to the gravitational force and the electromagnetic force but it&#x27;s of nuclear origin but also because it&#x27;s a magnetic force it is not conserved and I think it&#x27;s Amplified and reaches beyond the colic and produces uh new nulear transmutations by a long range Force wasn&#x27;t there before oh okay so this could be something harness to produce so essentially you&#x27;d be producing Fusion types of energy except without the radiation yes yes what it would do would be sort of like a compass it&#x27;s a magnetic force you know magnetic force makes your compass flip tend to make nucleus nucleons flip when you flip them that&#x27;s a beta Decay and it would tend to make things progress on in in in a course of action called beta Decay then when you get so many beta decays then you&#x27;d get an alpha it would uh allow A New Path for nuclear reactions to occur just like and when you&#x27;re hearing the sound from your speaker if somebody would have built a speaker and not put the soft iron magnet in it it wouldn&#x27;t have been any sound they put the speaker magnet in that increased the gravitational field I mean the magnetic force in that speaker by 10,000 and we we vibrate these superconductive disc that increases the gravitational the excuse me the magnetic component component of the strong nuclear force the spin orbit Force by a factor of maybe 10 to the 39th power and allows these transmutations to progress smoothly without emitting radiation okay okay so that that&#x27;s yeah I mean these now what you&#x27;re see if you look at what we&#x27;re doing now we&#x27;re learning how to control all the Natural Forces everything that we have today is based solely on the control of the electromagnetic force we have no idea on how to control the gravitational force and the nuclear force we can what we do we let things fall down that that&#x27;s about our limit and the nuclear force we bang things together but we have no way to control them but now that we&#x27;re understanding the mechanism to control them classically it opens up tremendous possibilities for new technology yeah absolutely well does this bring any experiments that come to mind for you I do you have any experiments that that you&#x27;ve proposed to validate these Concepts I&#x27;ve been doing experiments but I have limited budget vibrating with radio ws and uh I really I haven&#x27;t gotten any anomalous energy or anomalous gravitational effects but when I was done at the this the spa conference uh this is on the web I I said that we need to use nanometer sizes and Professor Miley then you can hear it on the lecture was using crystals as large as he can get it and then uh it&#x27;s becoming more and more apparent that small sizes 50 nmet to 10 ners are the the range that has to do with cold fusion experiments and and uh as more researchers are discovering this uh they&#x27;re getting uh they&#x27;re getting energy Miley&#x27;s is now using small small nanometer siiz uh crystals uh Edward storms he started using small nanometer siiz crystals and that seems to facilitate the reaction now storm says it just it just increases the amount of hydrogen that&#x27;s absorbed there&#x27;s more surface to absorb it so you we get more of an effect oh sure and I I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s just the conventional thought I think we have new physics here and the physics requires that size to get velocity of sound because yeah the resonant frequencies that would produce right right um well now in terms of gravity modification do do you have any experimental ideas there or well one thing we have to do is is uh if we wanted to follow my path is is really figure out how to construct a superconductor that we could get a soundwave going through it at a million m/ second and that would it call something called Optical phonons that that&#x27;s a like a light hydrogen atom it&#x27;s sort of stuck in there hanging loose so to speak and then have another one hanging loose at a distance away and then put radio waves on them to get them moving in concert so even though those atoms aren&#x27;t moving at a million meters per seconds like the water doesn&#x27;t move at a million doesn&#x27;t move at the velocity of the wave but the wave motion can be at that frequency and and nobody&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s following that leader trying to do that that&#x27;s a material science kind of thing and it&#x27;s very complex oh yeah requires spe specialized people that may have expertise Beyond mine yeah yeah well and and this is all stuff that you&#x27;re covering in your book right yes what I what I do in my book is I take this velocity that I&#x27;ve observed in the uh cold fusion and the gravitational anomaly this million meters per second and I produce the energy levels of the hydrogen atom the energy and the frequency of the photon and this thing called the amplitude of harmonic motion which is the intensity of the spectral line some lines are dim some lines are bright and I do it from a classical analysis that&#x27;s a start and it says now we understand why atams jump and they jump at points where the impedance matches and they jump at that means they jump at points where the gravitomagnetism equals the electromagnetism they jump they have to jump all at once so so if you&#x27;re let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a rabbit and you&#x27;re going to jump and you had you were a slinky rabbit and your head was attached by a spring that spring would be like gravity it&#x27;s weak so you jumped to the next line then you jumped and about 10 seconds later Here Comes Your Head along the flinky rattling back and forth so then you have another impact so if if if electrons jump like that they would have a a one Photon and then when the second part came they&#x27;d have another Photon of weaker intensity but everything moves together and there&#x27;s mechanical waves there&#x27;s electrical waves and that implies that the G Grom magnetism equals electromagnetism during the quantum jump and and now that we understand that can we put entire system in into a state of quantum jump and as you&#x27;ve mentioned this the superconductor is a macroscopic Quantum system and uh can we put that macroscopic Quantum system into a state of transition and that&#x27;s what I say yes we can by vibrating it wow see this is amazing amazing stuff I&#x27;d like to uh thank you for joining us today we&#x27;re out of time for today but I would definitely like to revisit this more with you in the future yes and keep an eye on the recent advances in Cold Fusion I think the cold fusion is going to hit before the uh anti-gravity wheel but the one and the same technology there&#x27;s not a hundred new laws of physics there&#x27;s one new law underlying physics underlying both of these processes and when we understand one it&#x27;ll it&#x27;ll facilitate the development in a second awesome well thank you again okay thank you</p>
