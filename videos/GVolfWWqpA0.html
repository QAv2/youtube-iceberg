            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I do think that David Gush&#x27;s claims need to be examined because it&#x27;s plausible. But I wonder if there is an advanced civilization, why would they be crashing as often as is as is alleged? And I also think if there is a crash retrieval program, I doubt we would make any progress because if there is some sort of intelligence greater than humans, they could be thousands, millions, they could be billions of years more advanced than us, we might not make any progress with that.</p>
