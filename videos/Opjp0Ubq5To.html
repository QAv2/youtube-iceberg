            <p>where quantum mechanics really becomes weird and different is that there&#x27;s a whole nother set of rules in our textbook formulation of quantum mechanics in addition to saying that there&#x27;s a Quantum State and it evolves in time and all these new rules have to do with what happens when you look at the system When You observe it when you measure it in classical mechanics there were no rules about observing you just look at it and you see what&#x27;s going on that that was it right in quantum mechanics the way we teach it there&#x27;s something profoundly fundamental about the act of measurement or observation and the system dramatically changes its state even though it has a wave function like the electron in an atom is not orbiting in a circle is sort of spread out in a cloud when you look at it you don&#x27;t see that cloud when you look at it it looks like a particle with a location so it dramatically changes its state right away</p>
