            <p>hey everyone it&#x27;s defend your base here um first vide video I put I&#x27;m putting out since I&#x27;ve uh been out put one out just a second ago and it&#x27;s all messed up so I start with this one so basically um you know a lot of things are going on um a lot of our grievances haven&#x27;t been addressed you know we ran this whole thing this whole protest you know our government has uh basically just stifled our attempt to get anything done um the Hammond are still imprisoned now we got bundies in prison and and all these other people in jail or whatever and our government hasn&#x27;t addressed any of the issues that we&#x27;ve had with the way they&#x27;ve been operating um their agencies and here&#x27;s something I wanted to really point out um this whole invention secrecy thing it&#x27;s um it kind of it ties into all of the problems we&#x27;re having right now with the you know the ranchers you know they&#x27;re talking about how the government wants the uranium under the Hammond Ranch and I guess possibly the Bundy Ranch and and also this oil pipeline issue that have that&#x27;s going on over in North Dakota um it all ties into this invention secrecy Act of uh 1951 which basically it says it uh it subjects you know new inventions that the government deems a national sec security a threat so they will suppress those inventions so you can&#x27;t come out with them and um you know it says right here it says uh you know the atomic energy commission is part of the people who determine if a new invention is is a threat to National Security and this is this is a problem because you know over what&#x27;s been 50 years or now or more whatever and we still using nuclear energy and there&#x27;s actually other other sources that are better more safer such as solar panels um and and our government hasn&#x27;t been using those because it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a threat to National Security um in fact they state that you know anything that&#x27;s considered 20% or more efficient was subject to review and possible restriction according to the new well somewhat new the 1971 list that they have this is the guess the uh the list that that determines you know what inventions are considered you know a possible security issue um you know of course and then anything that converts energies or whatever in in excess of 70 to 80% they don&#x27;t want something that works very good so they want us to constantly be dependent on their power grid um they they they want to be able to shut off our power if if we do something wrong um and so another issue that we have here is is uh that our government uses the depleted uranium for for purposes of War and the only way to get that depleted urum uranium is to to have a nuclear company that&#x27;s that&#x27;s burning you know cooking it basically it&#x27;s uh reacting and and heating up and and so they&#x27;re saying that you know we need power but really they just want the uranium depleted uranium in fact we used them in in the Iraqi War just in 2001 2002 whatever um there our military was using the depleted uranium tip bullets and there&#x27;s been a lot of deformities happening over there it&#x27;s all radioactive um you know we made a deal with Russia saying we weren&#x27;t going to make any more we&#x27;re dismantling our nuclear warheads and all that stuff so the only reason reason to have a nuclear company if if we were using all solar and stuff would be because the government wants depleted uranium and and uh that&#x27;s kind of like the smoke screen that they&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s just for energy and it&#x27;s um it&#x27;s not true we can we can use something better we have something better in fact we saw what they did to Tesla Tesla&#x27;s all all his stuff has been you know hidden or destroyed or whatever and and a lot of his inventions would have put these big companies out of business and um you know this whole oil pipeline over there going on with with the North Dakota they you know we keep using oil our government&#x27;s P past president says you know we&#x27;re going to get off of oil and we haven&#x27;t haven&#x27;t done that yet we keep having these politicians or whatnot using agencies in our government to benefit themselves they they got money invested in in a lot of these companies and of course of course those companies put a lot of money into their pockets doing you know campaign cont contributions and so we&#x27;ve been using oil and nuclear energy uranium you know whatnot for a long time and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s unnecessary it&#x27;s just they&#x27;re milking milking the Earth till every drop is is gone and um so you can see how how this invention secrecy Act is is still it&#x27;s still going strong in fact in you know 2016 this one says 2010 but it goes over to just even in 2016 there was um like a TH or 5,000 6,000 inventions that were suppressed so it&#x27;s still going um you&#x27;d be amazed at the list of things that they&#x27;ve been suppressing you know down to fuel cells and certain batteries you know capacity um they they&#x27;ve been retarding our progress for a long time now guys and so this is I want everybody to to to see this to see the actual law they have and this is 35 us code chapter 17 this is a real law secrecy of inventions and I just don&#x27;t think this is beneficial to mankind because of how quick inventions uh progress once they&#x27;re released it&#x27;s like an exponential growth so technically you could say that because of the invention secrecy since going in 1951 you know we can we can say we&#x27;re a thousand years behind where we should be because of how quick technology grows you know progresses once it&#x27;s released and so people need to realize that a lot of the problems we&#x27;re having in this country is is is all about greed you know you see all these oil leaks and almost a lot of these nuclear companies in this country are are the the power plants are leaking you know into the water the groundw it&#x27;s radiation going in there um this whole Fukushima thing over there that&#x27;s happened our government&#x27;s completely ignored that in fact to an extent covered that up they shut down a lot of the radiation detectors along the west coast they J they jacked up the the exposure limit the safe level of exposure to the radiation um and so people people need to realize that our government isn&#x27;t protecting us right now they&#x27;re they&#x27;re protecting their own their own interests the the it&#x27;s been hijacked by Common criminals in there and just like the Flint Water Crisis you know how they the con government people in there not the Congress but the the government people involved in that you know were drinking fresh bottles of water while telling everybody else that their their their water tap water was safe to drink when it was contaminated with lead and appear appears that some of them are under prosecution for that because they been covering that up for a while and that&#x27;s the same thing with Fukushima our government had bought vials and vials lots of vials of iodine which protects you against you know some of the damage from radiation and that was shortly after Fukushima and what has happened they they they haven&#x27;t given any of that iodine to the people nor have they told the people that it&#x27;s not safe to eat any of the the the water the seafood coming from the Pacific in fact a lot of the wildlife is now dying in the paciic specific so they they&#x27;re it&#x27;s all cover up so and and it could have been avoided if we if we had switched to a better energy source other than uranium nuclear energy here and I guess there there&#x27;s all kinds of different types of nuclear energy there&#x27;s uranium and strum and trinium or something along those lines there&#x27;s just all kinds um but it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s all bad it&#x27;s all bad stuff we have better alter of solar solar energy is probably the best one anyo um I just wanted to show that and like and spread this because this is this is like I said ties into a lot of the problems we&#x27;re having right now the land issue problems so any who that&#x27;s that&#x27;s enough said thanks</p>
