            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is a channel that is dedicated toward educational empowerment through learning about uh mainly theories of everything all-encompassing theories that you can apply to every aspect of your life most of them have been um authored by people who you&#x27;ve never heard of before um people who spent their whole life working on something and never received any credit never got any money but they kept plugging away anyway and before their life ended they put together a magnum opus that inspired me to um you know improve my life through their work and I&#x27;m trying to pay them back a little bit by spreading the knowledge of their findings um to other people so that they don&#x27;t end up on the scrap heap of History and uh so other people can have uh some valuable perspectives in their life and a lot of times these people uh we&#x27;re trying to uh of you know we&#x27;re digging into a new language they had to come up with new words to describe what they were finding and so a lot of times it&#x27;s very difficult going a lot of times they&#x27;re very difficult to understand um you know they are not all great teachers in many cases they&#x27;re very good writers but the information is there but it needs to be dug out so in a certain sense I&#x27;m also trying to translate their work in a way that is more accessible to other people at least in some cases I think that may be true in this case uh today we&#x27;re going to do our 219th video on the reciprocal system of theory which is a theory that was first authored by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he wrote many books and uh quite a few articles I did a lot of talks on his reciprocal system the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it is made out of emotion matter and energy are merely two different kinds of motion and um as well as a whole lot of other scientific entities uh quantities such as pressure and capacitance and fluidity and viscosity and speed and acceleration and force and matter and energy and um electric current electric charge magnetic flux these are resistance these are all different kinds of motion and they&#x27;re identified generally by a fraction that is that has space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator that basically sets up a reciprocal relationship between space and time now it is a little bit more complicated than that that hence the reciprocal system of theory the title of Larson&#x27;s Theory uh it&#x27;s a little more complicated than that because space has um or time and space have their coordinate aspects both of them are multi-dimensional three or more Dimensions XYZ coordinates in space but there is also something that&#x27;s called coordinate time which would be you know the three different letters in accordance in time then there&#x27;s also the scalar or clock aspects of space and time we generally recognize that time is progressing time is always getting later and later and later that is the flow or the progression of time but there that Larson calls it clock time but there&#x27;s also clock space the clock is uh space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no particular Direction that&#x27;s What Larson calls a scalar motion a motion with a magnitude but no particular direction um and so there is also what you call the discrete unit postulate time and space both come in discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time and below that you don&#x27;t have space or time you only uh so these units are very small but they only come in chunks there is no continuity there is a minimum size of a unit of space and a unit of time and one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is really the midpoint of Larson&#x27;s Universe whereas in Einstein&#x27;s Universe the speed of light was the maximum speed of the universe but that&#x27;s because uh Einstein didn&#x27;t recognize an entire half of the universe in Larson&#x27;s system the speed of light is the midpoint between two separate halves of the universe what Larson calls sectors there is the material sector the sector that is moving slower than the speed of light that is what we are accustomed to and that we make our measurements and our observations from but then there is also the cosmic Universe this is the universe that is moving faster than the speed of light and this universe has a is also interpenetrating our reality but we can&#x27;t see it but maybe we can think it or um maybe we speak it but who knows what the true nature of the uh Cosmic Universe actually is at this point we&#x27;re just uh delving into it right now but what you can see is that you uh we can understand a lot of things about the cosmic Universe because of the reciprocal postulate so um what goes on in the material sector is exactly the same as what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector except that the roles of space and time are reversed for example in the cut in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later but in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time three or more dimensions of time and you have clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart um so uh the that shows that um one sector is really the inverse of the other with space or time inverted okay now we&#x27;re looking at Larson&#x27;s 1979 book here called Nothing But motion which is generally on Atomic physics for Larson an atom uh or matter is a combination of several different kinds of motion first you have a photon that&#x27;s at the core two photons that are at the core of atoms and those photons are simple harmonic motions or wave-like motions which are the result of a combination of two separate motions which we will get into uh very soon in future videos but we&#x27;ll just say photons are a wave and then uh you know a wave-like motion and then once you have those two photons you have to rotate them in two or three different ways and that is what makes up an atom and then obviously a cosmic atom is the same thing but with the space and time reversed so with a material atom you have a a wave in time that is rotated in space um in with the cosmic atom you have a wave in space that is rotated in time Cosmic atoms are what Legacy science calls anti-matter and a cosmic atom that comes into the material sector crosses that speed of light boundary into the material sector is what is uh usually called a mason um or cosmic ray and Larson went through all that in previous chapters we&#x27;re looking at chapter 18 of this book that&#x27;s called Simple compounds and so a compound is a combination of two or more different atoms so this is the next level of building up a universe is to figure out what&#x27;s going on with a compound a a molecule a combination of atoms okay uh here he&#x27;s talking about valence so uh we&#x27;re just going to read from here uh don&#x27;t be too um you know distressed if you don&#x27;t understand everything in here uh you probably would need to to listen to all the videos in this series uh but you can um pick up a few bits and pieces and kind of hear how Larson thinks and then uh you know that&#x27;s really how you build your understanding of the reciprocal system is you know one brick at a time one concept at a time things gradually make a little bit more and more sense you can see how Larson uses uh is consistent in the uh way way that he thinks in the way that he uh builds up his theoretical universe that is what Larson does is he starts with those initial postulate especially the initial postulate about the discrete units the um coordinate space and time and the clock space and time and then he uh basically goes through a process of deduction if this then that if this then that and he builds up a theoretical Universe which he had then eventually attempts to match with the the so-called actual universe or the universe that the scientists have observed and measured and you know to come up with correlations okay when I when when this certain thing popped out of my theoretical Universe what did the scientists call that um you know so uh when they when he comes up with uh Cosmic matter uh he recognizes that the material scientists are actually caught uh calling it anti-matter okay it should be theoretically it should theoretically be possible for valences to be diminished by orientation in the manner shown uh in figure two but it is doubtful that if any stable compounds are actually formed on the basis of diminished electric valences the reason for their absence is not yet understood the magnetic valences are both enhanced and diminished okay just for a little bit of background um in Larson&#x27;s notation every atom has a three three numbers a B and C A and B are the two magnetic two-dimensional rotations and C is the optional electric rotation one dimensional and uh those three numbers make up every atom has its unique every element has its unique three number set and uh valence basically is established uh to uh to balance so like two compounds will balance one of those three numbers out so there&#x27;s a magnetic valence and there is an electric valence okay um the magnetic valences are both enhanced and diminished that&#x27;s kind of a technicality so he went through that just earlier in this chapter either the primary or the secondary valence may be modified but since enhancement is in the direction of lower probability or higher numerical value the number of common compounds based on the enhanced magnetic valences is relatively small diminishing the valence improves the probability and the diminished valence compounds are therefore more plentiful in the rotational groups in which they are possible those with primary magnetic valence is above two although the list is still very modest compared to the immense number of compounds based on the first order valences as indicated earlier one component of any true chemical compound must have a negative displacement of four or less um I&#x27;m sorry something&#x27;s going on I&#x27;m trying to scroll here okay as indicated earlier one component of any true chemical compound must have a negative displacement of four or less as it is only through the establishment of an equilibrium between such a Negative displacement and an appropriate positive displacement that the compound comes into existence the elements with the required negative displacement are those which comprise division four and it follows that every compound must include at least one division four element or an element which has acquired division four status by valence enhancement so division four are the elements that are over on the far right side of the periodic table with a valence of four or less goes on division one are all the way on the left hand side of the periodic table with a valence of four or less and then division two is basically everything that&#x27;s uh on the left hand side that is not in division one and then division three is everything on the right hand side that is not in division two uh those with the valence of four are in both division uh one or two or division three or four so uh every compound must include at least one division four element or an element that has acquired division four status by valence enhancement if there is only one such component the positive negative orientation is fixed as the division four element is necessarily the negative component where both components are from division four however one normally negative element must reorient itself to act in a positive capacity and a question arises as to which retains its negative status the answer to this question hinges on the relative negativity of the elements concerned obviously a small displacement is more negative than a large one since it is farther away from the neutral point where positive and negative displacements of equal magnitude are equivalent within any one group the order of negativity is therefore the same as the displacement sequence in group 2B for instance the most negative element is chlorine followed by sulfur phosphorus and silicon in that order so that&#x27;s element 17 16 15 and 14. this means that the negative component in any division four chlorine sulfur combination is chlorine and the product is a compound such as scl2 as opposed to CLS or cl2s on the other hand the compound PS to p 2 S3 phosphorus 2 silicon 3 is in order as phosphorus is normally positive to sulfur where the electric displacements are equal the element with the smaller magnetic displacement is the more negative as the effect of a greater magnetic displacement is to dilute the negative electric Rotation by Distributing it over a larger total displacement we therefore find a chlorine floor chlorine trifluorine trifluoride clf3 and iodine die try bromine ibr3 but not uh fcl3 or bri2 the magnitude of the variation in negativity due to the difference in magnetic displacement is considerably less than that resulting from inequality of electric displacement and the latter is therefore the controlling Factor except where the electric displacements are the same in both components on the foregoing basis all elements of division one two and three are positive to division four elements the displacement four elements on the borderline between divisions three and four belong to the higher division when combined with elements of lower displacement and when elements lower in the negative series acquire valences of four or more through enhancement or orientation they also assume Division III properties and become positive to the other division four elements thus chlorine which is negative the oxygen in the purely division IV compound ocl2 is the positive component in cl207 similarly the normal relations of phosphorus and sulfur as they exist in p2s3 are reversed in S3 P4 where sulfur has the valence of four hydrogen like the displacement four members of the higher groups is a borderline element and because of its position is able to assume either positive or negative characteristics it is therefore positive to all purely negative elements division four below valence 4 but negative to all strictly positive elements division one and two and to the elements of division three because of its lower magnetic displacement it is also negative to the higher borderline elements such as carbon silicon Etc the fact that hydrogen is negative to carbon is particularly significant in view of the importance of the carbon hydrogen combination in the organic compounds and Larson is going to in the next chapter get into some of these organic compounds I think that we are are going to um forego that here at least for a little while and we&#x27;re just going to try to get through this chapter and then move on to some other stuff we might just discuss I think there are three or four more chapters to this book but uh I just see that we&#x27;re kind of getting into the weeds here um you really have to kind of have the periodic table in front of you as you look at these different things and you understand how chemical bonding occurs in Larson&#x27;s system and the next chapter is on complex compounds so we&#x27;re going to get even further into the weeds and I&#x27;d rather just go back and look at and and cover some stuff that is more basic maybe in other fields and so I think we&#x27;re just going to trudge through the rest of this chapter which is just a few more paragraphs and then move on to some other stuff or at least summarize the end of this book and then move on to some other stuff so stay tuned for that tomorrow and thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
