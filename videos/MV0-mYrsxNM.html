            <p>as we all know web design is a strange and archaic Craft only fully understood by an obscure group of chased monks that perform their dark rituals but once every full moon oh and I guess it&#x27;s also understood by anybody else who takes the time to learn some HTML last year we looked at the all-in-one conspiracy theory website in a bedia although it&#x27;s currently known as let th truth bn.com and the year before that we observed the Magnificent scientific Endeavor that is time Cube for this year&#x27;s look into the realm of conspiracy theory infringed science we he at in a handful of minutes have hit weighted through the swamps of the internet dampening our loins with faulty logic and uncomfortable font color choices in order to bring you this review of scalar Wars the Brave New World of scaler electromagnetics in a nutshell scal of electromagnetics is the latest and a long series of Perpetual Motion Notions perpetual motion being an almost universally agreed upon and possibility due to any version of it directly conflicting with at least one of the first two laws of thermodynamics simply put you can&#x27;t produce an infinite amount of energy for an infinite amount of time so reviewing the theory of scalar electromagnetics would be about as useful as reviewing the pros and cons of laminating your genitals but the website link in the info box is an entirely different story that can be a potentially magnificent source of entertainment so first off let&#x27;s work through my crazy website checklist ridiculously long narrow Pages check excessive use of bold and color text for emphasis check check borderline sarcastic use of quotation marks to convey the intellectual superiority of the author over mainstream Society check attempt to get some science up in our faces all the while maintaining the tone of a 12-year-old boy who just discovered a topless woman tanning in his next door neighbor&#x27;s backyard Chek claiming that Wy selling can provide infinite energy cure all diseases be used as an incredible weapon and control the minds of millions check check check check though I guess I can&#x27;t get too op about any of this given the emails I have a habit of sending Tesla howitzers the KGB leasing scaler death weapons to the Yakuza how to make a storm on the Sun a secret unnamed friendly little Nation this website has more interesting story elements and useful knowledge than the love child of Bill Nye and lost trust me while mind rippers might be a danger getting bored to death while reading about scaler Wars isn&#x27;t like any good long-running television series with a lot of plot threads going on it can be kind of fun to look at scaler Wars for inconsistencies and I guess we could call them plot holes for example why is it that Ted beard and the guy behind the whole thing who is clearly terrified of secret governments abusing scalar electromagnetics for weapon purposes and other such terrible things such as mind control why would that man then go and register as a patent his electromagnetic perpetual motion machine with the government it kind of makes about as much sense as the time that I foolishly gave hypnotic pornography to the monsters under my bed which frankly helped them out a lot and luring me into their gaping Ms so in the end I say that clearly scalar electromagnetics is a bubbling boiling barrel of into which you should invest not one Thin dime but as I said earlier scaler Wars the website is another matter entirely it&#x27;s a great source of entertainment that is a lot more readable than ube.com or let th truth bn.com but by that same Merit it&#x27;s also a smid less hilariously insane in essence Tom beardon is like the iron Rand to time cubes Glen Bank oh dear Oliver what are you doing we can&#x27;t have political overtones in the show it&#x27;ll lower our appeal to at least three key demographics come on man how we ever going to afford those solid gold child laborers Tesla howitzers Howers Purity so in the end I would definitely say that scaler electromagnetics is a bubbling boiling barrel of and you shouldn&#x27;t infest</p>
