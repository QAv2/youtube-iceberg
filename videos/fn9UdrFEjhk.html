            <p>hello i&#x27;m dr ronald w satz founder and chair of the international society of unified science this is my paper space time dimensions and natural unit values of physical quantities abstract this paper presents the deviate the derivation of the space-time dimensions and the natural unit values of physical quantities in the reciprocal system factors include space s and time t only with auxiliary units of cycles revolutions radians and stair the appropriate time space region macroscopic value and or time region microscopic value of space is used in the various mechanical electrical magnetic thermal photonic units the dimensional system of the reciprocal system is unique no previous system compares introduction and literature survey many dimensional systems exist reference 3 pages 146 through 166 and pages 3 86 to 418 provides the most detailed treatment of these included on the dynamical system the gravitational system the astrophysical system the electrophysical system the electro technical system the definitive system the practical system the energetical system the electrostatic system the electromagnetic system the thermo physical system the thermotechnical system the gaussian or cgs system and the mksrsi system none of these systems is natural in the sense of being based on the fundamental properties of space and time dude larson the originator of the reciprocal system of theory was the first theoretician to ground the dimensional system on the true physical realities of space and time we present his new dimensional system in reference one first edition pages 25 through 27 73 through 83 210 to 11 and reference one second edition of pages 157 through in reference to pages 102-111 pages 183-186 and pages 219-229 this paper extends the work to the calculation of the space-time units the cgs units and the si units of all mechanical electrical magnetic thermal and photonic physical quantities for the time space region and or the time region as appropriate a convenient table summarizing the results is presented at the end references four five six and seven provide conversion factors for going to and from the cgs nsi systems most of the factors provided were given to three decimal places only for more precise work one would have to use the conversion factors in reference 5 pages 1 hyphen 23 to 132 which are expressed to 5 or 6 decimal places james clerk mass maxwell and reference a volume 2 page 267 gives a table of electric and magnetic dimensions which are quite bizarre yet this physicist is considered to be the greatest event of the 19th century nonetheless he did provide one very useful suggestion volume one page five quote we adopt the units of length and time derived from the vibrations of light then the year the velocity is the velocity of light unfortunately maxwell didn&#x27;t follow up on his own suggestion but larson did the space-time dimensions given this paper applied to our half of the universe the materials sector the space-time dimensions of the other half of the universe the cosmic sector are just the inverse but space and time interchanged next in this paper is the nomenclature and i&#x27;m not going to read through these symbols here we&#x27;ll introduce them as we go along in this paper but i will go through the notes here note one a black square in the upper right of an equation means that the equation is disabled from running in mathcad this is done because not all of the variables in the equation have this yet been given numeric values at that point of the program note two we tend to use the same symbols here as in other papers and books on the reciprocal system that given a large number of symbols necessary there will be some differences please consult the nomenclature of each individual paper for the symbols used in that paper also in a few cases duplicate symbols for different properties have been used but no ambiguity should result always consider the context number three in the following equations the subscript u and the variables will apply to the natural space time units stay in centimeters second and auxiliary units offending for cgs values the subscript cgs will be used and for s i values the subscript s i refused if only centimeter is second on auxiliary units are used the cgs subscript will usually be left off the subscript t means the time region value and node four the calculated values of the national units are given to six decimal places because there&#x27;s some uncertainty in the speed of light and the river frequency of h1 there is uncertainty in the fifth and sixth decimal place for most scientific and engineering work four decimal places should suffice the slight differences in the knives given in the various books and papers of the reciprocal system are the minimus first of all discuss mechanical limits space time and translation and speed we cure natural units the reciprocal system time space region equation for velocity is of course natural unit speed equals natural unit space divided by natural light time or one equals one divided by one all naturally physical units in reciprocal system are one of course get anything useful out of the theory you must identify the corresponding physical quantities expressed in conventional units such as in cgs or si obviously the speed of light is the natural unit speed of the universe and so we have c equals one over one in many reciprocal system books and papers we use this cgs value for c 2.997925 times 10 to the 10 centimeters per second the physics chemistry establishment reference 5 page 191 has recently fixed the value at 2.99792458 times ten to the tenth century per second and reference one second edition page 160 largely used this value 2.997930 times 100 to the 10th centimeters per second depending on which particular value one chooses the values of the result naturally in space not remove time expressing dimensional units will be slightly different in order to get the natural unit of time we use the rydberg frequency of h1 this is the natural unit frequency in most reciprocal system books and papers we use this value for r with the auxiliary unit cycles r equals 2.288057 times 10 to the 15th cycles per second unfortunately the physics chemistry establishment has switched to the quote infinite mass definition for this constant rather than that based on the unit mass of h1 we think this is an error and so we will continue to use the above that in the unit linear vibration of the rydberg photon there are two units of space and two use of time one of each for up and one of each down the natural unit of time can therefore be calculated by taking one half the inverse of one so we get t sub u equals one point five two zero six five five since ten to the minus sixteenth second with c sub u and t sub you know an s of u can be found and that&#x27;s four point five five eight eight zero nine times seven or minus six centimeters but this guy is a bit lower than what we have commonly used in the reciprocal system which is four point five five eight eight eight one six times seven minus six centimeters this implies that the quote true speed of light is two point nine nine seven nine nine times 10 centimeters per second as you can see there&#x27;s some uncertainty in the last two digits for our purposes here mistaking system with previous work we will stick with using the value of s of u from equation four d and the value of c squared from equation one g all of the values of c rounds in the diagonal libraries and regardless the table below the value from equation 1d will be put below the value from equation 1g as an ultra the si values for the national union of space are four point five five eight eight one six times ten to the eighth meters and that gives the speed of light especially nine nine seven ninety nine times meters per second the above values are for all of the macroscopic time space region for the microscopic time region values and let&#x27;s divide by the introversion ratio 156.44 please see reference one second edition page 154 on page 162 for the derivation of this cost so that gives the time range and national union space calculated to be two point nine one four zero one seven times seven to the y is eight centimeters or 10 minus 10 meters a specialized lengthening is used for atomic diameter in your reciprocal system the atom is the same size as the supposed nucleus of the conventional atomic theory using the reciprocal system alpha particle scattering theory on a reflection angle of 156 degrees which is the standard angle used the natural unit value of atomic diameter can be shown to be 3.359 times 10 to the minus 13 centimeters or 10 to the minus 15 meters and the derivation of this is giving independence the time region unit velocity is obviously then 1.91629 one times seven eight centimeters per second or ten to the six meters per second now from here on out we will not always i will not always verbalize the numerical values you can see them on the screen and of course you can download a free copy of this paper from transpower.wordpress.com i&#x27;ll just point out the units involved in each case so here you see the time space reaching values of the area and foreign and then the times space region dies of the natural volume and then the time between balance rotational speed and frequency you know rotational speeds are the same as the new translational suites but the natural rotational vibration of frequency is different from the natural unit linear vibration frequency obviously we have to use pi here so we get two point zero nine three eight two four two times ten to the fifteenth row per second or terms of radians one point three one five two two three times ten to the sixteenth round per second acceleration and you can see here just by definitions i submitted by my t sub r squared i give you the natural values space and then time using values and then in terms of radians you have eight point six four nine out of five hundred times seven two three one after second square now mass is interesting mass is not fundamental in the reciprocal system it&#x27;s a space-time quantity so that&#x27;s what makes the reciprocal system unique we reduce everything down to space time in this case mass is t u cubed over sub cubed and that comes out to mean three eight 3.711383 times seven and the minus three the second second shape to divide by centimeter of juice there&#x27;s no time reason value here in atomic mass one amu which by the way is not the same as you can be identified as the conventional equivalent therefore we get the natural unit of mass it&#x27;s the mass expressed in conventional terms it&#x27;s one point six five nine seven nine zero times centimeter instrument with grams or 10 to the minus 27 kilograms density is just mass divided by volume so i can see these sides by inspection specific volume is simply the inverse density again i have the time space region values and the time region values your momentum is mass times velocity and then you can see time space region values here rotational momentum is mass times velocity times a distance obviously so you can see here the natural value and the time space region value and the time which is force is mass times acceleration or naturally you see something divided by some square so here we have values in the second percentage squared and also combines the newtons for both the time space region and retirement mechanical time region values are appropriate to use for the nanotechnology machines because they act inside of in the space but that is that it&#x27;s a live transmission here so here we go so uh mechanical timing is aggregate to use for nanotechnology machines but whereas gravitational force may usually be divided from time-space calculations reverse gravitational and progression forces must usually be considered by doing timeless calculations see panics too so we&#x27;ll cover that later pressure is force divided by area so here we have a natural directory then we have the time space reaching gravity uh this is the natural pressure for ideal gases because of the anatomic attraction and solves liquids and vapors and build gases the pressure is different for these states of matter for solids we use the time region expression for force but we keep the time space region expression for area because pressure is a macroscopic property curious but true so in this case we have 1.006421 times sigma to 11 dimes per centimeter squared or 10 to the 10th newtons squared for liquids which have two-thirds of the coefficient of solids we must multiply the solid body by two-thirds and divide by another intrusion ratio so here we have for liquids it&#x27;s nine point five eight nine eight three four seconds per second to the fourth power which translates to four point two eight eight seven two seven times ten to the eighth times square to return to the seventh newtons per meter squared for vapors which have one-third of the cohesion of solids we must multiply the side value by one-third and divide by still another i should say it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just one third sir two thirds for me about expression so there&#x27;s the pressure for vapors one point three seven zero six eight seven times seventy six times percentage squared or ten to the movements per meter square okay now back to something simpler we get to the torque which is simply force times distance and you can see the second percent of the value there dynamic centimeter newton meters like the time space and time the g values moment of the inertia is defined as the mass times distance squared i&#x27;ve been complicated here here we have dynamic and kinematic viscosity these are macroscopic properties of liquids and so only the time space region value is applied so any use is defined as t sub u squared divided by s sub d to the fourth power so there we get the natural value the hoist value and the second one the square root of that but we commonly use center points instead of poise so the natural unit of value for dynamic viscosity is two point three nine four two point five times seven minus one centipoles kinematic viscosity is dynamic viscosity divided by density you can see the values there it&#x27;s anaesthetics and sticks surface tension it&#x27;s one-third the natural unit of pressure times natural distance lined by the cube in a regional ratio it is a microscopic one-dimensional property only and it&#x27;s in calculations here energy it&#x27;s the inverse of velocity or force times distance so you see a second per centimeter value theoretics just value for both the time space ratio of the time region here&#x27;s einstein&#x27;s famous equation the natural linear value of eight is three point three three five six three six times seven minus eleven seconds per centimeter so let&#x27;s do the second per centimeter values of n times c squared guess what the same result amazing that works incidentally that verifies the space-time dimensions of mass power is energy putting in time pretty obvious here joints per second for example but at the time space and time reaching varieties okay now we come to electrical units get by the time space region time region that is here is appropriate as a vapor that&#x27;s important to understand electric quantity now here&#x27;s where we differ from theory electric quantity is simply one natural universal space whether using the time space region value or the time region from larson in reference to page number one quote you know space in the region inside unit distance the time you should engineer is inherently just as large as seeing the space in the reach and outside the distance but it&#x27;s measured was released by the interracial ratio 156.4 for the reasons previously explained we cannot legitimately regard this quantity as something less than a full unit since as we saw in one and one as it has the same status in the time reaching the full size natural motor space absolution outside that space the logical way of having the situation appears to be you take the same there are two different attributes of distance or dimensional space is simply you know the compound unit and applying to different circumstances so time space values will apply to quantities which are not per distance or per area of volume those which are per distance or per area provided can have either time space or transmission values so that&#x27;s key to understanding the electric units here in this case uh for the quantity we&#x27;re using the time space we should have four point five five eight eight inches and ten to 26 centimeters which comes out to be 1.60206 201 it&#x27;s 19 coulombs quantity like the national theory the reciprocal system distinguishes between electric quantum electric charge they have different dimensions hence the subscript so this is important to emphasize the inner quantity and conventional theory is the charge whereas it&#x27;s a space unit in the reciprocal system that&#x27;s your current ordinary electric current is the full of massless chargeless electrons so obviously c divided by t u in this case comes out to be one point zero five three five three four times seven minus three amps so you can see that actually for currents greater than milliamps approximately electrons in terms of space time are moving faster than the speed of light through matter which by the way is time structure and your current density is electric current per unit area here we have both time space region values and time engine values electric charge or flux now these are the units of charge and here we agree that the imagine union of charge is that on the electron proton that&#x27;s one point six zero two zero six two times minus 19 coulombs and notice that we use the subscript charger to distinguish the esu and form from quantity at your dipole moment is electric charge times distance i think charge volume density is charged per unit volume again we have time space region values and time integrals here measure with energy it&#x27;s the same as the natural unit mechanical energy has to be which is one point four nine one seven five zero times and minus ten joules electric power turns out it&#x27;s nine point eight zero nine nine one six times center fifth joules per second engine voltage tcp of rescue squared there&#x27;s only um the time space fusion values here for this quantity pretty high voltage 9.3 1 1 4 3 5 10 centimeters electric field intensity is electric voltage per meter distance the reflex density is like a charge per unit area as it resistance is electric voltage divided by electric current note that it&#x27;s also equal to mass per unit time so this is t sub u cubed divided by substitute divided by t sub q and we end up with 8.838284 times centimeters which is pretty high but obviously the using the natural linear resistance times the square natural log of current times natural time should equal the natural look of energy and force it does the conductance is the universe of electric resistance energy resistivity is resistance times distance crystal unit cell parameters determine the size of the time engineers space must be used so in this case we have to use the time agent values interestingly enough electric connectivity is the inverse electric resistivity of course i need this modes from there okay i think permittivity of free space simply has to be squared divided by t sub u by definition cgs it&#x27;s one and by definition that a sign is eight point five four one eight times minus twelve fahrenheit per meter magic susceptibility so by definition the relativity permittivity of free space is one so the electric susceptibility is one minus epsilon not r so the natural value of susceptibility would of course be two as you would expect the cts and si units are the same which is this year electric capacitance only the time space asian diet applies because unit capacity is equal to the unit of time divided by the numerator resistance so we get six point two three zero five three times in that centimeter cube per second now notice that that is sc tube durability so it&#x27;s the dimensions of the source are sync which makes sense a capacitor is a source or a single electrons to get the corresponding cgs and si units we know that the time constant receiving an rcdc circuit must be equal to you in time so we get this uh you know that is for stack ferritin one point seven zero five fifty times three minus twenty on fahrenheit side and i have a couple of checks here the uh various checkout in terms of energy incidentally this this is a modification from what was originally thought to be the case in 1959 and the subsequent of larson&#x27;s books capacitance was set into space over rather than space cube divided by t so this is a change that&#x27;s been made but it&#x27;s one of the very very few challenges that we&#x27;ve had to make over the decades by definition electric displacement is electric quantity per unit area by definition electric polarization is logic displacement minus the permittivity of free space times electric field intensity therefore the natural units are the same as those four electric displacement which you can see here unlike the national theory the sc uh the esu and coulombs here are electric quantity charges ordinary capacitors store masses charges electrons not charged electrons so it&#x27;s a major difference there between the reciprocal system and conventional food okay now we come to magnetic units we&#x27;ll start this and then one part one now magnetic quantities which are analogous to electric bonds have the dimensions of the corresponding quantities multiplied by 2s that makes for a major simplification within physical theory when magnetic charge or flexible magnetic charge is existing reciprocal system of likely quantum mechanics and here we have a amendment a natural union of magnetic charge is 4.82122863 times 70 minus 18 divided by and here&#x27;s the larson magneton this is like this is what the four magnitude quantum mechanics and you can see the calculation here it comes out to 9.317503 times 17 minus 37 micrometers any dipole moment is magnetic charge times distance that&#x27;s price here magnetic moment from the current again the center unit should be another second which is kind of interesting same as for capacitance magnetic flux density is magnetic charge period area this is a very important quantity notice it&#x27;s symbol b standard literature so in the time space region it&#x27;s two point three one zero nine seven nine times seven minus three grabbers per meter squared and the time region is 5.65 times is given here magnetic susceptibility is you know my definitions one minus mu sub zero r so kindness like u is what you see about please remember that the chi mu sub cgs is equal to so that side divided by 4 pi just keep that in mind magnetic field intensity is here that&#x27;s defined as magnetic flux density divided by magnetic permeability we generally prefer to use external magnetic flux density divided by mu zero rather than this so we tend not to use magnetic field intensity in our receiving system i need some load the force magnetic vector potential you can see the values here so we have the correct values it turns out so the conventional units are wrong the correct values for the magnitude of force are the emu percentage of the arrival kilometer not m terms this kind of based on the conventional physics if using magnetic vector potential instead of magnetometer four substitute basically for f sub n due to equations and for the time region we get these values and we&#x27;ll stop here that concludes part one we continue with this in part two</p>
