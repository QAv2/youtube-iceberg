            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel and uh we try to look at uh various theories of everything cosmologies um that purport to describe uh our universe that we live in and um everything about it and uh we look at usually at cosmologies that are not well known and uh maybe not the easiest to uh break down but some that are um things that you would benefit from if you were exposed to them and um today is I believe the 320 8th or 9th 328th uh video that we&#x27;ve done on dwey B larsson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory Dy b l Larson lived in the 20th century and uh he came up with what he called the universe of motion and this was um uh his idea that the Universe was made out of motion not matter not energy but motion and for Larson motion was the relationship between space and time and and in the late 1950s he came up with his two fundamental postulates that um outlined this universe of motion and from there he took those two postulates and through a process of deduction he um came up with his theoretical Universe what uh his Universe would look like if the postulates were true and then he compared his theoretical Universe uh with the obs oberved and measured universe of the Legacy scientists and described their uh Co coincidences and their uh oppositions and um I believe he made a great contribution um but nobody knows about it and uh there are very few people who have studied up on the reciprocal system Larsson didn&#x27;t make it easy it&#x27;s not an easy subject to start with um but Larson was generally trying to address a scientific audience uh and I don&#x27;t know he didn&#x27;t necessarily understand that uh the scientists are were actually the last people in the room who were going to get it because they were the most wedded to the Paradigm uh the the current Paradigm that um you know of this universe of matter or Universe of energy or whatever and so they were going to be kind of the least open to accepting his theory or even taking it seriously um whereas maybe other audiences had he written um in a way that would have been more accessible to other audiences he might have had better results but he put the information out there but it&#x27;s just uh kind of hard to um retrieve and uh so that&#x27;s uh hopefully where I come in uh I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not an expert on the reciprocal system but I have read uh pretty much all larsson&#x27;s work uh books anyway and most of the Articles and um you know I&#x27;m trying to um you know go through his work uh with the fine tooth comb and um you know just present it but also to a certain extent like you know be a guide or hold your hand and uh you know help you to access this information as well uh so that you can make a make an informed Choice as opposed to just you know rejecting it out of hand or not ever knowing about it or anything like that so what we&#x27;re doing today is we&#x27;re looking at uh uh Larson&#x27;s um article that is called the nature of motion and so he&#x27;s uh going through kind of explaining his Universe of motion uh by first pointing out that the Legacy science through throughout its history going all the way back to Newton has never really defined motion properly um Newton basically just assumed uh that everybody understood motion that being known to all I believe is what he said and um but Larson is pointing out that there&#x27;s a kind of motion that really differs from the normal motion that we&#x27;re accustomed to that H is a scientific fact um but it hasn&#x27;t really been uh investigated uh by by science uh and that&#x27;s what he calls scalar motion and a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction most of the motion that we Define is a vector it&#x27;s a motion in a direction it is a velocity or um something to that effect that it it has a a magnitude and a Direction but a scalar motion just has a magnitude and uh you can see scalar motions um in the real world uh the Hubble telescope has identified that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other um and unless you are as Larson pointed out unless you are prepared to say that our galaxy is at the center and it&#x27;s the only one that&#x27;s not moving then otherwise you would have to assume that our galaxy is participating in this same motion that our galaxy is also moving away from all the other galaxies uh you would represent this kind of motion using a balloon and dots on the balloon if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction and uh so that is a scalar motion um but that motion differs in kind to the general motions that are reckoned by SC scientific uh inquiry and nobody has investigated scalar motions to the point where they need to and he&#x27;s also identifying gravity as being a scalar motion really mve moving in the opposite direction just like uh spots on a balloon but you&#x27;re sucking in the balloon so all the spots are moving toward each other and uh normally science says that you know gravity is an attraction between two bodies and there&#x27;s some kind of force between those two bodies but Larson is saying that well no that&#x27;s only if you give one of those forces one of those points one of those locations uh and you call that the reference point and that&#x27;s the point that&#x27;s not moving if you do if you couple that balloon uh to a reference system then it does appear as if two bodies are attracting one another but um actually it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really that all points are moving toward all other points uh it&#x27;s just that you haven&#x27;t identified these other points and you&#x27;ve identified one as the motionless reference point so it&#x27;s really uh a misleading to view gravitation as being uh this kind of force object at at a distance um you know being attracted by some kind of so-called force field it&#x27;s really just the contraction of space itself so Larson is really saying the space itself is what is moving um and so all everything that is in space uh represented in this analogy by the surface of the balloon everything is moving toward everything else but we just see it uh as one toward another because we&#x27;ve identified a reference point okay now this is uh now Larson&#x27;s postulates get into uh various other things and uh we I&#x27;ve gone over those in really every video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system and he probably will go over those things in this article as well um this is the third installment of this article so if you want to go back to the beginning you want to go back to videos and watch those two videos two previous videos so I&#x27;m starting here in the middle of the article but he just got done talking about you know kind of what I&#x27;m saying that um I I&#x27;ll just read the last sentence here uh this obstacle is now removed by the finding that all gravitating objects are moving inward in all directions and that the apparent lack of motion in some cases is due to the inability of the reference system to represent scalar motion as it actually exists ordinarily motion of a mass is produced by the application of a force the observation that mass B in the vicinity of another Mass a acquires a motion toward a while Mass a acquires a motion toward B has therefore led to the conclusion that each mass is exerting a force on the other however our discussion thus far has dealt only with motions in order to clarify the role of force in the gravitational process we will need to consider the relation between force and motion for application in physics force is defined by Newton&#x27;s second law of motion it is the product of mass and acceleration FAL ma motion is measured on an individual Mass basis as a velocity that is each mass unit moves at this rate or also on a collective basis as momentum the product of mass and velocity momentum was forly called quantity of motion a term that more clearly expresses the nature of this quantity which is actually the sum of the Motions of the individual units the time rate of change of the motion is DV over DT acceleration a in the case of the individual unit and in uh DV over DT Force or ma when measured collectively thus force is a property of motion in exactly the same sense as acceleration it is the time rate of change of the total quantity of motion the quantity of acceleration we could appropriately call it the significance of this point in the present connection ction is that a force cannot be autonomous by definition it is a property of motion thus wherever we find that a force exists it follows that there must necessarily be an underlying motion of which the force is a property this is a positive requirement with no exceptions a force cannot originate in a motionless object either the object itself or one or more of its constituents must be moving in the direction of the force there cannot be any such thing as a fundamental Force the so-called fundamental forces are the force aspects of fundamental motions in the gravitational case we have found that that all members of any system of gravitating objects are moving toward each other even if one of them is represented as stationary in the reference system the gravitational force is the force aspect of this gravitational motion since scalar motion takes place coincidentally in all directions the magnet magnitude of the mutual gravitational motion of two masses is distributed over the area of a spherical surface with a radius equal to the distant distance between the masses the gravitational effect thus varies inversely as the second power of the distance where this distance is large in proportion to the amount of mass involved the effect is negligible but at the shorter distances each of the constituent units of mass a has an inward gravitational motion toward each of the constituent units of mass B if both masses are free to move the representation of the mutual Motion in the reference system is divided equally between motion of a and motion of B if the location of one of these masses is represented as fixed the entire motion is uh attributed to the other mass for reasons explained earlier it should be noted however that the reference system does not represent the total scalar motion the product of speed and the number of units involved it repres represents the speed only thus the motion measured as speed of mass B is represented in the reference system as proportional to the total motion a b divided by the mass B that is that is it is proportional to the mass a here then is the explanation of the gra gravitational field the question as to the nature of a field is a longstanding scientific problem a typical definition taken from a physics text says that an electric field is quote what is in the space around an electric charge that allows one charge to interact with another end quote as this definition indic indicates a field the field is a phantom there is no actual evidence that there is anything in this space that could be identified with the hypothetical field but the currently accepted physical theories require some kind of a medium to transmit gravitational and electromagnetic effects it is therefore assumed that there must be something in the space that serves this purpose for the modern physicist says Einstein the field is quote as real as the chair on which he sits in fact the only way in which any indication of a gravitational effect in the vicinity of a massive object can be obtained is to introduce a test Mass into this space this test Mass accelerates toward the massive object but as brought out in the foregoing discussion this is not due to anything that exists in the space each Mass has an inherent scaler motion that carries it toward the other carries it inward toward the other as has been explained the scalar speed of mass B toward Mass a is independent of the mass of B it is determined by the magnitude of the mass a and the distance between the masses thus each point in the space surrounding Mass a can can be characterized by a magnitude representing the gravitational speed that a mass would have if it were located at that point however the actual speed of such a mass always includes an additional component of a vectorial nature unless the mass has been in freefall all the way from a great distance it is therefore convenient to take a different property of the motion the force or the total acceleration rather than the speed as the acceleration is a result of the geometry of the scalar motion and is independent of the accompanying vectorial motion each of the spatial locations surrounding Mass a can be assigned a magnitude and and a direction representing the gravitational force that would be exert exerted on a unit Mass if one were present The Ensemble of all of those vectors is the gravitational field of mass a we thus see that the field is not a tangible physical entity it might be compared to a set of steam tables we can refer to these tables and determine the heat content of the steam in a boiler at a specific at at specific certain levels of temperature and pressure but this does not tell us anything about the conditions that actually exist in the boiler it may not even contain any Steam the tables merely tell us what the heat content would be if certain conditions did exist similarly the tabulations of field strength tell us only what forces would be experienced at specific locations if masses happen to occupy those locations the force field has no more physical existence than the steam cables the foregoing explanation of the origin of the forces that appear to be exerted on distant objects is also uh sorry um the foregoing explanation of the origin of the forces that appear to be exerted on distant objects also provides the answer to the long standing problem of action at a distance Newton&#x27;s gravitational law appears to call for direct action of one Mass on another regardless of their spatial separation but many scientists are strongly opposed to the idea that a force can be exerted without a physical contact of some kind the prevailing opinion has therefore been that the force must be transmitted through some kind of immediate not withstanding the total lack of evidence to support such an assumption the need for this hypothetical medium is now eliminated by the finding that each object in a gravitational system has an inherent negative or inward scalar motion and is therefore approaching all other objects in the system because they are moving inward in the same manner when the gravitational situation is thus clarified it becomes evident that the forces due to electric charges and the corresponding magnetostatic phenomena magnetic charges we may call them are likewise properties of hitherto unrecognized scalar motions observationally these motions differ from the gravitational motion only in those respect in which scalar Motion in general is variable that is the Motions May differ in magnitude they may be either positive or negative and the nature of the coupling to the reference system may vary here again the absence of observable motion at the point of origin of the force is due to the fact that the location of the charge is the reference point at which the representation of the motion in the reference system is Frozen by the coupling of the of the moving of the moving scaler system to the fixed reference system okay I think we&#x27;re going to stop right there and um we&#x27;ll do one more paragraph the existence of these different types of scalar motion raises the question as to why the apparent interactions are limited to motions of the same kind why electric charges interact or appear to interact only with electric charges and so on the answer can be found in the um Mutual nature of scalar motion since the motion of a relative to B and the motion of B relative to a are merely two ways of representing the same Motion in the reference system it follows that a scalar motion AB cannot take place unless the individual motions of A and B are of the same scalar type there is no interaction between a charge and a mass okay might revisit that last paragraph to start tomorrow but um otherwise we&#x27;re going to leave it there now um now I know that uh if you&#x27;re just tuning in here you maybe you&#x27;re a little bit confused about the reciprocal system in in general but let me just uh give you a quick once over here uh lson saying that the universe is made out of motion in specifically scalar motion and that motion in Larson system is the relationship between space and time and that time and space are uh basically non-existent except uh they do not exist separately they only exist together in motion motion is basically a fraction uh with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator this sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time hence the name the reciprocal system of theory and um so time and space are basically identical except that they are reciprocals of one another and um they both have the same qualities and Larsson lays this out in his first postulate space and time are both coordinate meaning that they both come in three dimensions or they both have aspects that are three-dimensional space and time are both progressing or what he calls clock time and clock space the clock is progressing time is always getting later and later and later and later but in no specific Direction like a scalar motion space to is progressing space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart uh like two dots on an expanding balloon but they&#x27;re not getting farther apart in any specific Direction a scalar motion and then space and time also are quantized meaning that they come only in discrete units there is a minimum unit of time and if you don&#x27;t have that full minimum unit you don&#x27;t have time and there is a minimum unit of space if you don&#x27;t have that full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space uh you have to have a full unit before you have any either of those qualities and if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light so in larsson&#x27;s system a universe of motion the speed of light is the fundamental speed the speed of light outward in all directions in a scalar Manner and um that contradicts the Legacy science which basically says that they make all their measurements from zero from zero speed lson makes his measurements from unit speed what he calls unit speed or the speed of light outward in all directions so in the universe of motion the the natural state of rest what Larsson calls the natural reference system or um you can think of it as An Origin or an ether or a zero point um uh state of rest is outward at the speed of light um and so that is really the main Paradigm Shift difference is that we have a a moving reference system and another Paradigm shifting change is just that for 3,000 years we have been accustomed to thinking of space and time as being the container of the universe it&#x27;s really like the stage upon which all of the actions of the universe take place but in Larson system space and time themselves are not the container of the universe they are the contents of the universe that is what the universe is made out of and um the a the uh the not only the stage but Al the characters on the stage are made out of space and time so um that maybe will just give you a a roundout of the U reciprocal system and we will get into this um the the fourth installment of this paper the nature of motion uh and the next time out um but just you know the main point is that um now that we understand scalar motion we can kind of throw away some of these assumed concepts of uh of modern science so-called modern science that there has to be action at a distance and that uh gravitation gravitational magnetic and electric forces are between two two specific objects uh it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not that the what we&#x27;re doing is we&#x27;re misplacing the origin of these motions the Motions themselves are because space itself is moving and everything that is in space is moving either away from or toward each other there&#x27;s not a force between them the the motion is coming from the space itself okay um um thanks for tuning in today and have a great day hope to see you tomorrow</p>
