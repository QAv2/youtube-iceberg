            <p>well I&#x27;m Dr Ronald W SATs founder and chair of the international Society of unified science this is the third part of my paper theory of unit space time and displacements from unit space time material and Cosmic Photon sub atoms and atoms on page 34 Section 8 origin of the 21.1 CM radio waves 21.1 cm radio waves are very useful for observing stars and galaxies because the radio waves are not absorbed by intervening dust conventional physicists say that this wave is generated by a quote forbidden transition the intrinsic spins of the alleged electron and proton in H1 neutral hydrogen flip of course this is nonsense from the standpoint of the reciprical system the cical system spectroscopic equations for an H transition are given by and please see reference 14 e sub H1 I = 13.61% [Music] 2 - 1 n1^ 2 - 1 n 2^ 2 - 1 n 2^ 2 black dot indicates that it&#x27;s not calculated at this point in this uh paper the cical system database has a feature which enables the user to input an emitted or absorbed wave length such that the program will search over the space of all values of sub1 M sub1 N Sub 2 m sub 2 usually from 1 to 99 to obtain that wave length or frequency result for the 21.1 CM line is n sub1 = 62 m sub 1 = 69 M sub 2 = 76 and M sub 2 = 90 and therefore the frequency is calculated to be 1.42 658 * 10 9 Herz or in terms of wavelength 21.87% 5 to1 cm QB this transition is not forbidden at all of course with conventional Theory the orbitals would be too large curiously reference 47 page a54 refers to such atoms as quote ridberg atoms quote highly excited hydrogen atoms or hydrogen like atoms principal quantium number n greater than 100 their radi uh range up to approximately P from is 10us 7th M this corresponds to the size of a virus but this is not a problem for the reciprocal system because the Spectra are due to changes in thermal motion of the atom itself and of course ionization changes of anying a neutral a neutral hydrogen atom with N Sub 1al 62 and M sub 1 = 69 is at a temperature of 2636 kelv a neutral H atom with N Sub 2 = 76 M sub2 was 90 is at a temperature of 2.61 3 Kelvin from the cical system database section F cosmic background radiation absolute velocity of the local group The Cosmic microwave background radiation cmbr has been measured to be at a temperature of 2.72 Kelvin reference 39 page 531 according to the reciprocal system this radiation comes from the cosmic sector therefore we can conclude that the cnbr constitutes contributes to the temperature of the interstellar Intergalactic H1 so a Starlight coming from the cosmic sector slightly heats the H1 of our sector by the reciprocal postulat STL from from the material sector appearing in the cosmic sector slightly heats the ch1 that sector mer C here means Cosmic Force the cmvr is not a relic of the alleged Big Bang lson says reference 3 page 387 because of the inversion of space and time at the unit level the frequencies of the cosmic radiation are the inverse of those of the radiation in the material sector Cosmic Stars emit radiation mainly in the infrared rather than mainly at Optical frequencies Cosmic pole SS emit x-rays rather than radio frequency radiation and so on but these individual types of radiation are not recognized as such in the material sector because as we found earlier the atoms of matter that are aggregated in time to form Cosmic Stars galaxies Etc are widely SE widely separated in Space the radiation from all types of cosmic Aggregates is received from these widely dispersed atoms as a uniform mixture of very low intensity that is isotropic in space given that this radiation is isotropic we can define a local reference frame at rest relative to the cmbr reference 59 shows that the cmbr is slightly blue shifted in One Direction and slightly red shifted in the other direction the net result is that the local group is moving at a speed of 600 km per second toward the Virgo cluster of course the relativists deny that there is any quote preferred coordinate system but this is a logical candidate for one section g astronomical sources of radiation based on reference three one radio waves for matter moving in intermediate or ultra high speeds from early white dwarf product type 1 Supernova from the remnant of type two Supernova two infrared waves from infrared Stars down to 1,000 Kelvin failed Stars down to 300 Kelvin Proto Stars newly formed variable Stars intense infrared radiation comes from matter ultra high speed such as quazars and low intensity is from matter normal speeds three Optical from normal stars on the main sequence from the low speed products of type one and type two Supernova four ultraviolet rays from central region of seford galaxies or any kind of quote active Galaxy for matter moving at intermediate or ultra high speeds five x-rays from Atomic isotopic adjustments due to explosions of stars or galaxies stage four of white dwarfs which involves a return to the speed range below Unity from cataclysmic variable ibles from no from poar which fail to escape the Galaxy and are coming back and reducing speed to below Unity from Class M scars x-ray is leaking out because there is less thickness of overlying matter and leakage from the sun&#x27;s core which hates the corona so incidentally that&#x27;s the source for the high temperature of Corona leakage of xas from the sun&#x27;s core six gamma R from Atomic isotopic adjustments when matter drops below unit speed from cosmic Stellar or Galactic explosion gamma ray Burse note X-rays and gamma rays are non thermal that is they come from automic isotopic adjustments section H stopler shift equations reference 40 pages 193 194 gives the usual EXP expressions for the Doppler shift for both low and quote relativistic velocities as follows but using our equation number quote when the radiation of frequency new sub L is emitted from an object traveling at a velocity V with respect to an observer at rest The observed uh frequency new sub OBS is and you can see the equation there 29a for V much less than see in beta much less than 90° The observed value of frequency is U mu sub L * 1 - V sub R over C where Theta is the angle between the velocity vector and radiation weight Vector the radial velocity V of Ral minus V * cosine Theta is positive when the radiating object is moving away from The Observer consequently when receding objects are observed at Optical frequencies lines are shifted toward the red meaning toward longer wavelengths the r shift Z is defined as Z equals Lambda observed minus Lambda selid Lambda SEL or new SEL minus new observed divided by new observed and approximately V subr over C where or Landa observed in Lambda L you know respectively the wavelengths of The observed in ided line radiation new observed on use of not respectively frequencies of The observed and emitted line radiation and of course the V of is the radio velocity for large velocities this reference says the special relativistic do effective is expressed by the equations 32 and 33 and you can see the equations there measured velocity is often correct for the orbital motion of the earth about the sign and the sun&#x27;s motion with respect to the group of stars however the reciprocal system rejects the use of special relativity in these equations because as equation 30 shows the measured value is used in the definition of Z so if Z is calculated to be greater than one by equation 30 that means that the speed is in fact greater than C Marson discusses this issue in reference to page 307 as follow quote extension of The Wretched range above one raised a question of interpretation on the basis of the previous understanding of the origin of the Doppler shift a recession red shift above one would indicate a relative speed greater than that of light a general acceptance of Einstein&#x27;s contention that the speed of light is an absolute limit made this interpretation unacceptable to the astronomers and the relativity mathematics were to resolve the problem our anal our analysis in volume one nothing but motion shows that this is a misapplication of these mathematical relations in the situations to which those relations actually do apply there are contradictions between D obtained by direct measurement and those obtained by indirect means such as for instance arriving at a speed measurement by dividing coordinate Distance by clock time in these instances the relativity mathematics I.E the fence equations are applied to the indirect measurements to bring them into Conformity with the direct measurements which are accepted as correct the Doppler ships are direct measurements of speeds and require no correction a reg of two indicates a relative outward motion with a scal of magnitude of twice the speed of light quote note the Z value for example of aaor is a combination of the galactic recep plus any explosive velocity away from the associated Galaxy the high Z values of quazar for example are not due to extreme distances section I Einstein pelski Rosen effect quantum entanglement suppose that two photons originate at the same event and move in opposite directions in the material sector the motion appears to be outward in space in the cosmic sector the motion appears to be outward in time in actuality we are moving inward in space away from the photons and the cosmic observers are moving inward in time away from the photons we have no independent motion and coordinate time at low vior speeds and since the photons do not either we were able to affect a change in both photons by a change in one of them likewise the cosmic observers have no independ tent Motion in coordinate space and low vectorial inverse speeds and since the photons do not either Cosmic observers are able to perect a change in both photons by means of a change in one of them existence which are contiguous in either space or time May both be affected by application of a suitable single Force because photons are stationary in the natural reference system they are not lost from either sector and are not disappearing over the time or space arising the universe is not quote running down toward a slow quote heat death the second law of Thermodynamics applies to kinetic energy only not to total energy unlike the first law section J PL polarization by definition if a stream of photons all have their linear vibrations in the same plane per IC to the direction of propagation the radiation is plain polarized astronomical sources of polarized radiation come from matter moving at upper range speeds intermediate pan Ultra quing lson reference 3 page 224 according to our theoretical findings one all radiation from objects with upper range speeds except that generated by indirect processes is non-thermal and two all such radiation is polarized as emitted where a lower polarization is observed this is due to depolarizing effects during travel with radiation the reason for this is of course that this radiation originates from a two-dimensional space time region white dwarfs poar quazars active Galactic cores and jets all emit polarized radiation section K elliptical polarization rotational basis so before we&#x27; covered uniform translational motion and linear vibrational motion the next type of motion is rotation a one unit rotational displacement of a photon creates a rotational base two types of rotational base exist the material rotational base which has the rotational displacement in time less than unit speed and the cosmic rotational base which has the rotational displacement in space greater than unit speed Penrose reference 33 Pages 546 547 shows a diagram of circular polarization which is actually in agreement the picture we get from the reciprocal system so for once the conventional Theory and the reciprocal system agree circular polarization results from spinning photons about the direction of motion in space-time progression however the spin is scalar in the recipal system whereas it is vectorial conventional Theory therefore helicity direction of the spin doesn&#x27;t matter in cical system only the speed and so H over 2 pi is not used as the UN angular momentum by inspection one can see that a photon imagined is vertical has three rotational axes two horizontal perpendicular axes through its midpoint and one vertical axis along the linear vibration the rotational spin can be represented in four different ways all equivalent the choice to use is a matter of convenience the four ways are rotational displacement effective rotational displacement rotational speed and rotational frequency for the material and Cosmic rotational bases we have table two and here you can see the columns are circular polarized light we have the material rotational base and the cosmic rotational base a photon frequency that is is the ground frequency is two R in the case for material particles and one half R for Cosmic particles rotational displacement simply one H zero hen zero interior rotational base or parentheses one H Zer Hy Zer for the cosmic rotation basee and naturally the effective rotation of displacement is zero for both particles and then you can see the rotational speed and rotational frequency there where um R is the r frequency again m equal material Cal Cosmic r equal the red bird frequency 3. 2881 * 10 15 cycles per second or revolutions per second rotational space displacements are enclosed by parentheses the photon frequencies given in the table are for the ground state obviously nonr State material photons would have higher vibrational frequencies in non-round state Cosmic photons would have lower vibrational frequencies rotation of the rotational bases around the first horizontal axis of the photon which is referred to as the principal Axis or sometimes the primary axis the rotational base does not have a rotation a rotational displacement around the other two axes which are term the subordinate or secondary and the electric however keep in mind that we start with unity not zero in the reciprocal system so the rotational speed is not considered zero around these two other axes when there&#x27;s no displacement as is indicated under the com rotational speed likewise rotational frequency is not considered zero on these two other axes when there&#x27;s no displacement but the speed or frequency in the two non- displace Dimensions have no physical effects the one displacement of rotational motion is not effective and stop in and reversing the space-time progression the two rotational bases still move at the speed of light hence they both have the designation zy Zer hyen Zer under the column effective rotational displacement this form of the spin representation is useful or expressing combinations of particles which we will see in the section of this paper devoted to sub atoms as the references 1 through 10 show the sequence of additions of display Ms alternate between space and time material particles are rotational displacements and time built on photons with space displacement Cosmic particles are rotational displacement in space built on photons with time displacement section three sub atoms a to bro defraction and wave functions probability function side in their cical system all sub atoms and atoms are rotating photons the spins of the atoms which will be discussed in the later section of this paper hide or Shield or screen their photons so that the wave aspects of photons and C atoms can usually be neglected this is not the case with electrons positrons or neutrons which do not hide or screen or Shield their Photon substrate these sub atoms therefore undergo defraction in crystals we therefore do accept a Ro&#x27;s hypothesis that these particles can act as waves however atoms such as alpha particles scatter here the scattering is a function of the rotational displacements of the alpha particles and the target such as gold atoms therefore the reciprocal system usually works with the spin numbers of atoms and sub atoms rather than with quote wave functions this contrasts with quantum mechanics in which reference 31 page 80 says quote a particle is described by associating it with it a wave packet formed from the super position of an infinite number of plane waves each plane wave moves with a phase velocity which may exceed the velocity of light the individual pH velocities are not observable the quantity that is observable is the velocity of the localized disturbance or group velocity which is equal to the velocity one normally Associates with a particle less than the speed of light metallics at but an Infinity in a physical theory is a red flag it&#x27;s a disproof of the theory furthermore conventional Theory says that the square of the way function s quote gives the probability of finding a particle to give in place in order to reconcile the wave and particle pictures of matter we must give up the idea that the location of a single material particle can be specified exactly instead we can talk only the probability of finding a particle at a particular location at a particular time referen on page 88 this is not so in the reciprocal system SpaceTime and all motions are ultimately absolute and so yes we can specify the exact location of a particle at an exact time there&#x27;s no highberg and certainty principle in the reciprocal system the Dey wave equation is simply Lambda h p where Lambda is the wavelength H is pl&#x27;s constant and P is the linear momentum of the particle reference 31 Pages 82 through 87 gives many examples of the use of this equation the reciprical system is in full agreement here with reference 33 page 499 gives a quote the shorting your equation for a single particle of mass m moving in an external field whose energy contribution is V equals V is a function of x y and z now you can see this ordinary equation where I is the imaginary this equation is very difficult to apply the textbooks and handbooks give only the most trivial solutions for for example see reference 47 pages a835 to a841 the quantum mechanics literature is full of approximate Solutions but these are still worthless for practical application my engineers and besides they all disagree with one another l in references page 8 quotes toia saying what seemed to me to be eminently desirable was Return to precise space-time representations which could give a clear picture of what they were supposed to portray in other words Tori himself did not accept scher&#x27;s wave equation and neither do we Penrose reference 33 page 528 discusses the puzzling feature of the quote lapse of the wave function wherein a jump is made to a state reduction whenever a measurement is deemed to take place the reciprocal system has no such issue the spin numbers in the cical system versus mechanics and the standard model the three spin numbers in the cical system represent displacements or speeds around three perpendicular axis of one Photon for sub atoms or two photons for atoms the one spin number of qu mechanics represents an angular momentum UNS of H over 2 pi about an IL defined axis of what one needs to specify a subnuclear theory to explain what is rotating in quantum mechanics now let&#x27;s get through a side note on the standard model of particle physics according to the so-called standard model of particle physics the quote Fons are matter constituents and have a spin equals 1 half three Hales five halves Etc there are two types of Fons leptons which are electrons and neutrinos and quarks and there are 18 types of those but quote gagee bosons are Force carriers and have spin 0 1 2 Etc these include the photon the W particle the Z particle the Hig boson the graviton and the gluon which they&#x27;re eight types which allegedly holds the cords together isn&#x27;t it curious that the standard model needs two bons to explain mass and gravitation the fermionic hadrons include the proton and antiproton and neutron Etc the bonic Hons include the p the Kon Etc which are supposedly compris of quarks and antiquarks see references 33 34 35 36 40 and 49 for the details the so-called quirks which are supposedly contained within many of the subatomic particles and meons do not have a fixed Mass see reference 34 page 389 for table cork masses for instance the supposed dcor has a mass which ranges from 3 to 7 me but this is nonsense would mean that particles built up from quirks do not have a fixed Mass which they certainly do have they are also said to be Point particles and have the speed close to that of light a complete table of sub atoms and misons is given reference 40 pages 1182 to 1202 quirks need the following quantum numbers it&#x27;s amazing you need to to specify quirks you need to have q i spin n s c b t and Y as an example the complexity of representing the properties of a particle in the so-called standard model consider the proton P this supposedly has three quirks u u d the uork has these properties Q = 2/3 I = 12 I3 = 1/2 spin = 12 n = 12 S = 0 C 0 B = 0 t = 0 y = 13 the mass of the ukar is 1.5 to 3 m the Dork has these properties Q = - 13 y = 12 I3 = - 12 spin = 12 n = 1/3 S = 0 C = 0 B = 0 t = 0 y = 13 the mass of the DOR is said to be between 3 and 7 m v the spin of the proton itself is supposedly one2 and J value is 1/2 the mass of the proton is 9282 me but the masses of the internal qus don&#x27;t sum to this at all besides the Quark particles are just points a half can they combine to make a particle with extent in contrast reciprocal system represents the spins of material and Cosmic pH Cosmic protons as follows and here you can see Table Three material proton proton and Cosmic proton where 2 R over Pi is the natural un of rotation frequency no that these are for charg as particles for the normally charged n proton the out a plus sign through the spin representation either before or after like two hyen one hyen parentheses 1 plus the normally charged C proton would be parentheses 2 parentheses one Hy one minus in working out the details of the rotational spin about each of the three axes of the photon of a subatom eccentricity must be minimized so for instance we know a particle with displacement is to high zero he zero the complete table for subatomic particles follows by inspection together with their identifications note intermediate particle like the compound neutr and H1 is one that has two rotational systems one of which is mass this trans power Corporation okay please study this table carefully table for subatomic and intermediate particles that completes part three of my paper</p>
