            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>let&#x27;s move into your new documentary The Lost Century sure it&#x27;s all about advanced technology how it&#x27;s been for hund how it&#x27;s been around for over 100 years but kept secret Zero Point Energy a lot of people call free energy is also called the quantum vacuum this would basically eliminate the need for fossil fuels utilities winds solar yeah yeah winds every every means to power that we have now would make it completely obsolete it would be unlimited clean and free energy and we&#x27;ve had it for 100 years how do we so let&#x27;s get into this how do how did you discover this stuff well it was an outgrowth of me looking into the the UFO UAP issue because once you realize these objects are real three-dimensional the very first question actually when I was when I go up uh to Capital Hill or someplace I&#x27;ll put up the footage the footage that the Pentagon said this is a real 3D object infrared sensors no heat no Jets no rockets and certainly no nuclear power plant on it because I mean those things are hot right mhm there are have been nuclear powered aircraft and satellites but I said how is that moving at those speeds and then straight up against gravity this is the alternative energy and compulsion systems so I always tell people forget all the mythology and everything it&#x27;s an Alternative Energy System now it&#x27;s a very Advanced one because it also flies now to be to be really clear I am not advocating not the release of the things that fly yet why it&#x27;s a missile delivery system so you don&#x27;t really want to open source an electrogravitic anti-gravity system that allows terrorists in Mogadishu to get a dirty bomb over downtown DC in two or 3 seconds mhm right no but the things that would sit at your house like your heat pump all right or in the hood of your car that would run your car or your factory or your business or your home those devices that are not things that fly those are just pulling energy from the fabric of SpaceTime around it and physicists have estimated that the volume of space in a coffee mug has enough potential energy to boil off all the oceans of the world is that much latent energy so tapping into it to run the entire United States the whole world be like taking a thimble of water out of the Great Lakes so it is what you know Tesla called it the infinite energy field and it began to be discovered if you look at it all the way back but it as soon as you step into the reality the three-dimensional reality of these uh uaps and UFOs you immediately begin talking to people and this is what happened to me in the early 90s to people who know the physics of the energy systems because these things are not using oil gas coal nuclear what have you so it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a natural extension of the problem and I point out to people one of the central reasons for the secrecy that got out of control under Eisenhower&#x27;s late last four years as president was because once they realized how this works they realized the big industrialist and financial and Global money to People Banking this would be the end of that entire sector of the macroeconomic system well that would have been great if it had been transitioned before I was born in 1955 because look at the world we have now but it really could have started coming out in the early teens and 20s if you look at the documentary the law Century the the subc caption is and how to reclaim it we talk about how we need to come together as a people and develop these energy generation systems and open source them meaning that it&#x27;s no patent no intellectual property held back at the first level of this because the patent office will seize it we prove that in the documentary we have a national security order on a patent that a scientist I know submitted we took his name off of it so the question is are there some people who can financially uh put up the funds and it needs to be a substantial amount you know 50 to 100 million to start to create a high energy physics lab that develops this and gets it out to the public no intellectual property hold back or if there was that much funds B we could go to some of these scientists who probably have these and say look we want to just acquire this you&#x27;ll be here&#x27;s $10 million now go and relax let us move this out to the public you can&#x27;t do it most of these engineers and scientists and inventors think they&#x27;re going to do it the way they do a new software program and they&#x27;re going to try to monetize it through uh intellectual property protections and patent you cannot do that with this because the system is so completely weaponized and corrupt and I&#x27;m talking from the patent office on uh that only way to do it is to do an open- Source release of it massively through the internet blockchain so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing but the technology if you go if you look at this documentary you&#x27;ll see this trajectory there&#x27;s a a great photograph with Nicola Tesla with this engineer farmer self-talk guy I believe it was 1908 or 1902 the caption and this guy had like an earth battery he had some uh metallic stakes and wires in the ground he was pulling resonant in it was running as far Farm wow 19 I mean my even my father you know I wasn&#x27;t alive he was born in 1916 this was before my dad who was hand toand combat in World War II with the Japanese amphibious Landing unit uh but you know I&#x27;m going what the heck you know we have our planet half the planet&#x27;s population doesn&#x27;t have indoor plumbing three billion people have no way to cook their food they&#x27;re cutting down the rainforest 3 billion the biosphere e even if you don&#x27;t think climate change is real 5 million people die from breathing particulate matter soot all over the world from this noxious stuff we keep burning so we need to take care of our creation the Earth and our future and it isn&#x27;t going to happen with a windmill and a solar panel believe me no way you&#x27;re going to run 8 billion people off of those Technologies we&#x27;re going to have to have Innovative high-tech solutions to the energy and environmental and poverty I mean look you know I just want to backtrack on that real quick when you&#x27;re talking about people dying from from inhaling these particles and these chemicals and I mean you know this is this unfortunately is a touchy subject you know the the pollution and I and climate change and all this but what I can attest to that is 100% fact is what you just said because I&#x27;ve been to these parts of the world yeah I&#x27;ve spent over a decade in these parts of the world and you see one you see all these veterans coming home dying of weird cancers from that they breathed in overseas Y and and I can tell you in the winter time the winter time in Afghanistan the soot is so thick in the air that if you go outside for I mean we&#x27;re talking just 5 minutes and you go back inside and spit in spit in the sink or spit in whatever blow your nose yeah you&#x27;re it you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re going to spit gray right and but those fine particles get into your lungs and then your circulatory and heart and cause a huge number of problems not just cancers but I&#x27;m talking heart lung disease so why are we doing that when these technologies have existed now this same corrupt organization because it doesn&#x27;t just deal with one issue have been responsible for basically hoovering up vacuuming up all these Technologies for a hundred years uh I know people personally personally who have been murdered because they had one and it&#x27;s because they very against my advice AMA against medical advice against their own security interest they wanted to keep it secret and they thought they were going to be so clever and they were going to out Fox this big super state of thugs I&#x27;m going dude you have no idea what you&#x27;re up against here and then they think they&#x27;re going to do encryption and keep it secret I&#x27;m going oh my God you think this group needs to worry about about an electromagnetic encryption when they can Target a volume of space anywhere and extract anything being said I mean I I mean it&#x27;s you know and it&#x27;s I understand it because if you&#x27;re in the normal engineering world you&#x27;re not going to know this believe it&#x27;s hard to believe it but I said you know if you don&#x27;t believe it just wait you&#x27;re going to be dead or it&#x27;ll be confiscated and I you know you&#x27;re only you&#x27;re lucky if all they do is come in and kick your door in hit you with a national security order and drag it off you know that&#x27;s your best outcome that&#x27;s your best case scenario if you do it the conventional way so I go look you knows like what is that saying attributed to Einstein the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result the reason I can prove that the strategy most people use doesn&#x27;t work is that we can prove these technologies have been around for over a hundred years and you and I are still tied into a coal fired or gas- fired power grid right so if if the strategies if the if the conventional Business and Technology strategies were going to work they would have work before you know you and I were born so we need to think we need to have different thinking about this strategically so what we&#x27;re saying is all of these Technologies if they&#x27;re used for peaceful Pur purposes would really give us a whole new civilization beautiful</p>
