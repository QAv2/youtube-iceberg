            <p>The cure for cancer, free energy, gravity manipulation, clean propulsion. It might have already been invented. You just weren&#x27;t allowed to see it. [Music] In 1951, at the height of Cold War paranoia, the US passed a law that gave the government sweeping control over private innovation. It was called the Invention Secrecy Act and it gave federal agencies the power to shut down patents in the name of national security.</p>
<p>In 1951, Congress made it permanent. The Invention Secrecy Act allowed the Pentagon, the NSA, the CIA, and other agencies to review thousands of patent applications every year and slap secrecy orders on anything they didn&#x27;t like. The inventor isn&#x27;t allowed to talk about it, not even to a lawyer. A gag order is baked into the law. So what kind of inventions get buried? Energy breakthroughs, surveillance resistant tech, military level communications, and anything that might threaten the status quo.</p>
<p>The moment an American files a patent, it doesn&#x27;t go straight to the public. It first passes through something called the patent security category review list, a classified filter used by multiple government agencies to decide if your invention is too dangerous to be released. And dangerous doesn&#x27;t just mean weapons. Every year, the Department of Defense, the NSA, the Department of Energy, and even NASA review thousands of applications. If any one of them flags a patent as a national security risk, a secrecy order is issued.</p>
<p>And just like that, your idea vanishes from the public record. You can&#x27;t manufacture it. You can&#x27;t talk about it. You can&#x27;t sell it. You can&#x27;t even challenge in court because the order itself is classified.</p>
<p>The government doesn&#x27;t have to tell you what part of your invention is sensitive or if they even plan on using it themselves. And no one knows exactly how many breakthroughs have been buried forever. Because the people deciding what&#x27;s a threat are the same ones who benefit from controlling the threat and innovation dies quietly in the dark. Nicola Tessa was the kind of inventor who doesn&#x27;t come around twice. The press painted him as unstable.</p>
<p>investors stayed away, and his most advanced work was never fully published, patented, or protected. On January 7th, 1943, he died in his room, broke, in debt, and largely forgotten. Within hours, the FBI seized his notebooks, papers, and equipment. Much of it was classified under national security, but not all of Tesla&#x27;s materials were accounted for. Some vanished entirely.</p>
<p>To this day, parts of his research remain classified. The Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 is still active today. As of now, over 6,000 patent applications are under secrecy orders. So, here&#x27;s the real question. What else have they buried?</p>
