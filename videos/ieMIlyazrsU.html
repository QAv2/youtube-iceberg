            <p>all right everyone hello I&#x27;m Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos and today is no exception we&#x27;ll be doing uh video number 66 on the reciprocal system of theory uh drive by Dewey B Larson back in the middle part of the 20th century up until his death until uh in 1990 and today we&#x27;re looking uh I think this is the 44th video that we&#x27;ve done on his final book that is called beyond space and time and uh this book came out after he died in 1995 and it is a departure in that is uh dealing with metaphysical issues all of his previous books were physical science uh astronomy and physics and chemistry and so on and uh these books are on philosophy religion or this book is on philosophy religion um and psychology and a few other things a little biology thrown in there and uh we are uh right now in chapter 16 which is called uh dream interpretation so he&#x27;s getting into uh discussing his dreams now just um and everybody&#x27;s dreams uh just to give a quick wrap up here uh the basic gist of Larson&#x27;s theory is that the universe is not made out of matter and the universe is not made out of energy uh but the universe is made out of motion and motion uh and uh you know so both energy and matter are kinds of motion and um as is really everything else in the universe all kind of scientific units they all uh are forms of motion motion is the relationship between time and space or the ratio or the fraction uh every kind of motion is some kind of relationship between time and space time over space space over time space over time to the second power time over space to the second power because the next part of Larson&#x27;s thing is that both space and time have three dimensions and uh I would add three or four dimensions but that&#x27;s pretty much for a later discussion um and they are both quantized meaning that they both have a minimum unit there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space that&#x27;s one unit but nothing less than that can exist and then there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time that is one unit and that nothing less than that can exist and one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light the speed of light is unlike what Einstein says where it&#x27;s he says the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson is saying that the speed of light is the neutral point or the midpoint of the universe and um also by uh so there is a half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and then there&#x27;s also the half that is moving slower than the speed of light that we are accustomed to that is called the physical universe um and it&#x27;s uh called the material sector this is also the physical universe as well but this is the material sector or sector one this faster than the speed of light is physical but it is what he calls the cosmic sector or sector two and then the boundary between them that speed of light that is is uh non non-physical it&#x27;s metaphysical beyond space and time he calls that sector three other people would use uh more lofty terms like God or the spirit world and uh so we don&#x27;t know anything about this sector too except that we know stuff about sector one and by the reciprocal relationship between space and time we can extrapolate here what is here with the slower than the speed of light sector which is really the realm of space over time relationships this is where you have your three-dimensional time a three-dimensional space and you have your progressing time or flow of time over here all you have to do to extrapolate is just reverse the space and time relationships so over here you have time over space relationships and you have three dimensional time XYZ coordinates or four dimensional with w x y z and you have uh a space that is progressing or flowing and this can be seen in the recession of the distant galaxies identified by the Hubble telescope back in the 20s all the galaxies are moving away from each other uh in a scalar Manner and this kind of scalar motion is a motion with no Direction or you can think of it as motion with every direction and uh you can Envision it by just taking a balloon putting a bunch of dots on the balloon with a magic marker and then blowing up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other so that is an outward scalar motion if you suck in the balloon then all of the dots will be moving toward each other that is an inward scalar motion they they don&#x27;t have any specific Direction it just has a magnitude that is the fundamental motion that Larson is discussing where he says the universe is made out of motion it&#x27;s made out of a scalar motion not a vectorial motion a vectorial motion is a motion that has a Direction that is where you get like the XYZ coordinates that&#x27;s factorial motion so um so we&#x27;ve got sector one and sector two uh sector one builds up by aggregation things uh moving together with one another and connecting with one another once the aggregation gets to its most complex level which Larson says is DNA then that DNA molecule becomes eligible to be taken under the control of a sector 2 unit and this sector 2 unit uh can then connect with the sector one unit and uh even though it&#x27;s only a minor part of it it can take control and Larson calls that the life unit life is a combination of material and Cosmic units and then further life can develop up until its most complex level which Larson says is the intelligent human or humanoid and at that point it it is eligible to be taken control by a sector 3 unit which is a unit that is beyond time and space and um at that point there ensues somewhat of a competition between sector two and sector 3 controls because the sector 2 control is is uh uh predicated on or toward um survival whereas the sector 3 unit is geared toward ethical Behavior or good behavior and so you&#x27;ve got those two different uh objectives uh in the mind of the human being now when we are talking about Larson here chapter 16 dream interpretation dreams are basically a sector two thing because they are uh part of the the mental apparatus it&#x27;s a result of thinking and memory which are prerequisites for sector three so there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a sector three um interest involved but it&#x27;s really a sector two it&#x27;s it&#x27;s ordered in order to get to that place where a sector three can uh take control and uh dreaming is as the result of we have a thinking apparatus which includes memory thinking and memory and those are you know part of the sector two apparatus and uh sector two is based on this three-dimensional time this factorial time whereas sector one is based on the flow of time and so as a result the both the thinking and the memory will get out of sync with the flow of time and if they get far enough out of sync the individual has to unplug the thinking and the memory and Rewind them to get them back into sync and that process is called sleep and um but the memory process is is more simple than the thinking process and so the memory process has to be shut off for less time than the thinking process is shut off and so once the memory process is done rewinding it pretty much just idles and at this part where it&#x27;s idle memory is idling but thinking is still rewinding is what you call REM sleep so this is where the dreaming comes from now in the last uh episode we were talking about Freud and Larson&#x27;s basic his basic idea is that dreams do not contain any symbolism they uh they appear to contain symbolism because uh the memory process is a process of Association and many things can be substituted uh by the memory in the process of Association uh a thing and it&#x27;s opposite are associated with each other a uh you know you can say somebody uh you know you can see uh Jackie Robinson on the baseball field and you can see um you know um the the p u n Peacekeeper or whatever peacekeepers and they both have blue helmets on and so you can associate them together and they can switch from one to the other um at just by association everything with blue Health everything has a blue helmet uh is is fair game to be switched in uh there if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re kind of gauging things by um so uh you can get all kinds of bizarre substitutions as a result of the uh Association process um but basically Larson is saying that the dream is the contents of the dream are basically events of the previous day that are basically played back to you but these associative substitutions are there and so sometimes you don&#x27;t recognize what&#x27;s going on but they are specifically literal in their uh there&#x27;s no need for any type of interpretation all you have to do is just go back to the previous day pretty much and examine your activities and the contents of your dreams are the result of uh the theme of your dreams are the result of what happened to you the day before so we&#x27;re gonna pick up here he had just got he just got done uh kind of going over a few of Freud&#x27;s dreams that he insisted were uh needed to be interpreted due to symbolism by symbolism and he showed exactly how they were actual events experiences in Freud&#x27;s life that he had the day before okay so here we go um now he&#x27;s talking about history I do not dream of things that are inherently absurd or incredible although they may be combined in absurd ways because of the inability of the memory system to recognize in congruity it is probable that this is the general rule but my rejections are based on what I consider absurd not on the Judgment of anyone who attempts to interpret my dreams this too must be the general rule if anyone believes in ghosts he may very well dream of ghosts even if I do not anyone who thinks reads or hears about relativity physics may dream of a station moving to meet a train regardless of how absurd that may seem to Freud that was one of the examples that Freud gave or to any other dream interpreter the rather fortuitous fortuitous fact that Freud gives us enough information to show that the illustrative examples he uses in three different applications are almost certainly direct memories rather than instances of the symbolism wish fulfillment Distortion and concealment that he employs in trying to interpret them leads lends strong support to the conclusions that I have reached from Theory and from the analysis of my own dreams normal dreams I find are simply memories altered in their details in most cases because of the nature of the memory process that is involved okay um the significance of dreams as seen in the light of the findings of this present investigation can be best expressed by comparing the dream state to the idling of a motor of an automobile while the vehicle is stationary in dreams the memory apparatus is idling in a similar manner maintaining continuity of operation without accomplishing any other useful purpose this is a far cry from the prophetic role uh seen by the ancient world and the safety valve concept proposed by Freud but it is all that the evidence will support this does not mean that there is nothing to be learned from dreams most diagnostic work on automobile Motors is done under idling conditions and the reasons for this procedure are applicable at least in some degree to the memory mechanism as well it is therefore reasonable to conclude that those who are diagnosing the ailments of the human mind may find the idling period convenient for some of their investigations it might be concluded from what has been said in this and the three preceding chapters that the results of the present investigation are adverse to the essential claims of the psychoanalysts foreign this is not true as a general proposition on the contrary these new results are entirely in agreement with Freud&#x27;s assertion that there is a continuing conflict between different aspects of each individual&#x27;s personality the question as to whether this conflict is the cause of personality disorders and the further question as to whether such disorders can be cured by exposing and treating the conflict or outside the scope of this work but in light of the present findings the contentions of the psychiatrist and psychoanalysts in these respects are plausible the finding that the individual components of the dream reproduce the original memories without the concealment or Distortion envisioned by the psychoanalyst does not preclude departures from reality in the dreams of abnormal or troubled individuals or in a lesser degree those of some individuals who could be considered normal but it points to the original memory as the location of the Distortion rather than the dream it is the memory that is subject to control there is a certain degree of mental control over the non-rem dreams but most of these dreams have a matter of fact character that is not compatible with the Distortion hypothesis the distortions that the dream interpret interpreters claim to find are primarily in the REM dreams which according to Theory cannot be distorted by the dreamer because they&#x27;re not subject to control memories on the other hand are notoriously inaccurate and much of this inaccuracy um is a is a product uh I&#x27;m getting lost I thought maybe he had a typo there uh but I guess that&#x27;s right that memories on the other hand are notoriously inaccurate and much of this inaccuracy is a product of the individual&#x27;s attitude to considerable considerable degree we see what we want to see and remember what we want to remember thus even though the dreams merely reflect what is contained in the memory system they do reveal some things about the production of these memories that may be just as useful to the analysts as the distortions for which he has hitherto been searching so he&#x27;s basically saying Freud and the others are not out of a job if you know Larson&#x27;s um you know his hypothesis is valid they just have to kind of retool their grift and they can go on being psycho uh psychoanalysis dream interpreters um but just do it in a different way the dream uh we have been treating psychoanalysis merely as one of the prominent schools of psychology the study of human behavior and the amount of attention that has been given to the theories of Freud is merely a result of the fact that dreams play a much larger part in his theories than in those of schools of other psychology psychology um but Freud and his followers have made some assumptions that have a bearing on the conflict between science and religion in present-day thought um so he&#x27;s going to give that some consideration personality disorders According to Freud are due to conflicts between different aspects of an individual&#x27;s psychic mechanisms he identifies three of these the ID the Primitive animal-like aspects the ego the social aspect developed by contact with the outside world and the superego which is commonly equated somewhat roughly with conscience disorders of certain types originate he says from conflicts between the ID and the ego others originate from conflicts between the ego and the superego okay now we will uh we will get into this here uh tomorrow uh and we&#x27;ll finish this chapter here tomorrow um but we are pretty much out of time right now um so we&#x27;re gonna start out by just talking about a Freud&#x27;s um personality conflicts and then he&#x27;s going to um apply this uh his dream interpretation Theory to that all right um thanks for tuning in today and we hope you have a great day hope you come back tomorrow and uh we will see you then</p>
