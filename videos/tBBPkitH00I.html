            <p>[Music] good day learners this is easy engineering this time we&#x27;re going to talk about scalar and vector quantities the mathematical quantities that are used to describe the motion of objects can be divided into two categories these are the scalar quantity and vector quantity so first let&#x27;s discuss this scalar quantity a scalar quantity is a me physical quantity that can be identified by number one a number which tells us the magnitude of the quantity number two an appropriate unit scalar quantities can be added subtracted multiplied and divided by common algebraic laws such examples are distance mass temperature energy and many more and now on the other hand is the vector quantity a vector quantity is a me physical quantity that can be identified by number one a number which tells us the magnitude of the quantity number two an appropriate unit number three a specific direction this means that a vector is both a representation of a quantity and its direction this includes displacement velocity acceleration and many more for example imagine yourself calling for a pizza delivery then the pizza owner asks you where do you live then you apply 15 meters is from your store the 50 meters East is a vector quantity because both quantity and direction is present but when you apply to the pizza owner 50 meters from your store it will only create confusions because the direction is not specified here 50 meters is an example of scalar quantity now let us check your understanding by matching the following words to the corresponding category let us check your answer under scalar art ten meters by when I told megabytes and 37 degree Celsius an under vector are 500 kilometers southeast 30 meters per second Norton 50 Newton downward I hope you get everything right that is all for now I hope you learned something today once again this is easy engineering [Music]</p>
