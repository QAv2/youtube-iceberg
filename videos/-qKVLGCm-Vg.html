            <p>all right hello everyone uh hope you&#x27;re having a great day welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas I do educational videos we are uh doing uh the 49th video here on the reciprocal system of theory developed by Dewey B Larson um and this is a theory of everything that he developed back in the 20th century and uh the basic gist of it is that uh comes from his uh two fundamental postulates but in particular the first one and uh it&#x27;s basically that the as opposed to the ancient Greeks and Einstein the universe uh is not made out of matter and the universe is not made out of motion I I mean not made out of energy but it is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time and space are the same except that they are reciprocals of each other meaning that they both have three or four dimensions uh Larson says three I say three or four uh and you can look at a cube uh to to get those three or four because the uh faces of a cube will give you three dimensions XYZ coordinates but the diagonals of the faces will give you four dimensions or tetrahedral coordinates uh for that that would be a star tetrahedron so then also uh the uh space and time both have a uh discrete minimum unit a one unit a quanta and um they are whereas the speed of light is the maximum speed in Einstein&#x27;s Universe in Larson&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is the midpoint or the neutral point of the universe meaning that half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light half slower the half that&#x27;s moving faster Larson calls the cosmic sector and the cosmic sector serves as a control over the material sector once the the slower than the speed of light part the part that we&#x27;re familiar with the cosmic sector comes on to control the material sector once it gets to a certain level of complexity and that level of complexity is the DNA molecule and the DNA molecule then becomes controlled by the cosmic unit and that turns into a life unit and the life unit then can evolve until it becomes a level a certain level of complexity which he calls the intelligent human being and then that intelligent human being then can become controlled by a sector 3 uh the slower than speed of light is sector One faster than the speed of light is sector two sector three is entirely independent of SP of space and time and uh which I would say is meaning that it&#x27;s in the realm of this midpoint this light and um when it becomes under control of the sector 3 component it is uh geared toward ethical Behavior or good behavior and that is uh you know really Larson&#x27;s term for God is like sector three and uh we are looking and then he went through uh three or four chapters just recently where he was discussing um communication between the sector 3 entity and um the life unit the intelligent human and he called those variously ESP and [Music] um intuition scientific insight and religious Revelation and said that they really all are the same kind of communication process but different in degree and different in context uh now we&#x27;re looking at his chapter 12 which is called miracles and in this chapter uh we went through it a little bit yesterday he was uh kind of trying to distinguish ESP from psychokinesis and uh eventually came to the conclusion or Recon he comes to the conclusion that psychokinesis is different because it is not a communication process and he kind of dismisses the psychokinesis while accepting the ESP uh and now we&#x27;re going to take over here a little bit further down the chapter uh while we cannot completely exclude let me just uh preface one other thing uh with the intelligent human the intelligent human is kind of uh in the place where it needs to be able to make decisions because it is under the control of this life unit and the life unit is directed towards survival but once it also comes under control of the sector 3 unit the sector 3 unit is directed toward ethical Behavior I certain times those two dovetail are and are working in harmony with each other survival and ethical Behavior but in other situations they are working at Cross purposes um and so uh the human will have to be able to make a decision between um the ethical Behavior and the survival Behavior okay now uh back to Larson uh where he&#x27;s talking about uh uh earlier he was talking about how uh sector three um does not intervene like as far as Miracles are concerned um except impossibly a couple situations one where is a um a matter of chance process uh like so that the sector 3 can can intervene uh in a chance process because it doesn&#x27;t affect the laws so um he says that sector 3 does not intervene either because it cannot intervene or because it chooses not to intervene uh while we connect a completely uh exclude the possibility that the sector 3 existences can intervene in physical events and must rely to a large extent on evidence indicating that they do not intervene at least in macroscopic events the situation in Reverse is clear purely physical objects or existences cannot exert metaphysical influences as they have no sector three components and there is no direct connection between the inanimate physical world and the metaphysical region now the next argument here I think is flawed um because I don&#x27;t see this as being a um a in an influence a metaphysical influence this could be a purely physical influence and so I don&#x27;t really know uh where he&#x27;s going here but he says the belief that some objects numbers or days are lucky whereas others are unlucky has no basis in fact a rabbit&#x27;s foot is equally as ineffective in the Dark of the Moon as in broad daylight the events of Friday the 13th are no different from those of any other day nor will these events be modified by the discovery of a four-leaf clover or by nailing a horseshoe above one&#x27;s door the idea that the Stars can influence human life a concept held over from the days when the celestial was thought to be a totally different org order of existence from the terrestrial is likewise groundless okay so uh he dismisses all of this stuff but and I&#x27;m not saying that all this stuff is valid but he&#x27;s saying that it he&#x27;s dismissing it because he&#x27;s saying that it uh physical things cannot exert metaphysical effects but it would seem to me that a lot of these things would be more like physical effects and they&#x27;re not metaphysical effects these aren&#x27;t ethical the metaphysical has to do with ethical and you know whether you&#x27;re lucky or unlucky because there&#x27;s a four-leaf clover or a horseshoe above your door or a rabbit&#x27;s foot um doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with ethics as far as I can tell so I&#x27;m not sure why he&#x27;s so uh you know eager to dismiss uh these kind of um you know popular uh superstitions uh as because they are not he I don&#x27;t see that there is a claim that they are uh exerting metaphysical effects these uh you know if you&#x27;re lucky because you have a four-leaf clover uh or whatever that would seem to me to be a physical effect from a physical object same with the astrology stuff so anyway um that that doesn&#x27;t mean that those things are valid it just means that I think his critique of them isn&#x27;t valid um they may be valid they may be not valid you know I&#x27;m not saying either way um okay so he goes on no physical object religious or secular Celestial or terrestrial common or unique as any metaphysical power or influence the kind of luck attributed to a horseshoe or rabbit&#x27;s foot is essentially equivalent to a miracle a miracle Junior grade we may say and like any other miracle that involves a deviation from physical laws it is ruled out by our findings I don&#x27;t see that as being any kind of Miracle it can be purely physical so uh you know we receive light from Stars uh we receive uh you know we can photo synthesize or some uh something can photosynthesize that light it&#x27;s a physical object so it you know and in the same way there might be some kind of physical vibration involved in a rabbit&#x27;s foot or a horseshoe or a four-leaf clover that has actual physical um effects so anyway uh you know that&#x27;s one of you know many criticisms that I have of Larson here but um uh the term uh luck is not only applied to influencing the course of physical events the objective of a talisman which we find impossible it is also applied to success in anticipating the course of events particularly where these events are determined by chance as in gambling this is precognition one of the forms of ESP and the considerations applicable to the ESP phenomenon in general are also applicable to this form of luck so he accepts that that kind of uh luck that we get from precognition even though metaphysical intervention is purely physical in purely physical situations does not take place if the conclusions of the foregoing analysis are correct intervention in human thought and action is not only possible but clearly occurs as brought out in the previous discussion human behavior to the extent that has been emancipated from the animal type of control or sector two is subject to a control of a metaphysical origin sector three and there is direct contact between the metaphysical region and the control unit where conditions are such that the human individual is receptive to the metaphysical influences these influences May well constitute the decisive factor in determining the course of action which he will take the religious concept of the metaphysical existence as a source from which human beings can obtain assistance and guidance is therefore entirely in accord with our findings however most religions also regard the metaphysical region as an actual or potential source of harmful influences uh and then he cites uh a couple of uh or at least one uh so-called expert on the matter um when viewed in the perspective of human life this dual concept of Good and Evil metaphysical influences seems quite logical here on Earth those who possess power have the option of using it for good or for evil and it is natural to assume that the same would be true of any outside agencies that are capable of exerting some influence on human affairs but the application of this concept to relations between man and the metaphysical region encounters some serious difficulties and the trend of thinking on this subject has followed a strange and tortuous path [Music] um primitive man found no problem here he applied the original concept of the supernatural in a straightforward Way by expecting his Gods with a small G to protect him and assist him and that members of his tribe and at the same time to inflict hardship on their enemies the development of the quote Universal religions uh erased this distinction between the we and they in religious thinking okay you can kind of think of that as as you know distinction between uh Judaism and uh Christianity uh you know where the god of the of the Old Testament is protecting and assisting the Jews uh the Hebrews um and inflicting hardship on their enemies but then with the development of the universal religions such as Christianity uh the distinction between we and they in religious thinking um just uh dissolved and A New Concept in which the separation between good and evil is at the source rather than at the receiving end instead of a single power or a single group of powers dealing out benefits to some uh and harm to others these more advanced religions envisioned a spirit of good and a spirit of evil contending for Mastery over the Affairs of men but the human race has too much pride and self-esteem to be content with a doctrine of this nature which reduces it to the status of a pawn in The Game of Life and there has been a gradual reinterpretation of the original ideas that has reduced the at the once powerful Spirit of evil to a mere shadow of his former self and then he goes over these uh near Eastern uh that ariman Prince of Darkness who once contended on even terms with ahura Mazda Prince of the light has become nothing more than a vague and even somewhat ludicrous devil who no longer acts on his own authority and for his own ends but exists merely for some obscure reason connected with the long-range purposes of the powers of good even the status of warden of the celestial Penitentiary which has been traditionally assigned to him is becoming meaningless as the doctrine of Eternal punishment for the evildoer becomes less and less acceptable to the modern mind uh if the present Trend continues as seems altogether probable although maybe it hasn&#x27;t since he wrote this uh 28 years ago or a 30 30 plus years ago published it 28 years ago uh his wife after he died if the present ten Trend continues as seems altogether probable it will not be so very long before the whole concept of a metaphysical Spirit of evil has disappeared from Human thinking what this development will accomplish will simply be to bring the general thinking on the subject into harmony with the findings of this present study as will be brought out in more detail later our conclusion derived from logic a logical analysis based on factual premises is that the external metaphysical region sector 3 is good by definition in as much it is as it is in Conformity with the laws and principles of sector 3 that constitute good behavior hence there cannot be any evil in sector 3. and whatever influences May originate in that sector are good influences we get only help not harm from this metaphysical source evil as we know it is a product of our physical Universe it is action in accord with the governing principles of that Universe in those cases where these principles are in conflict with the principles of sector three and it is confined to that physical universe if there are other universes similar to ours as our findings indicate that there are then these other universes also have their evils analogous to ours confined to their particular universes uh if there are still other universes of a different kind multi-dimensional perhaps as our findings also indicate these universes may or may not have evils so far as our present information is able to tell us but sector 3 the general metaphysical region is the home of good not evil at this point it may be asked whether it might not be possible for influences evil or otherwise originating in these foreign universes to have an effect on our own this question must also be answered in the negative sector 3 existence as a whole can have an influence on human life because every location in the physical universe is also a location in existence as a whole but it is not a location in any other universe and consequently there is no point of contact through which an influence could be exerted so uh on the basis of the findings of this work all assertions concerning evil or harmful influences exerted by metaphysical agencies will have to be identified as Superstition even when they emanate from religious sources of the highest standing there are no evil spirits to be exorcised no powers of Darkness to be defied or placated whatever evil there may be in an individual&#x27;s thoughts or action comes from the inside from his inheritance as a biological organism not from the outside um okay we will uh we will resume from this uh controversial Point uh next time hope you tune in and uh hope you have a great day we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow</p>
