            <p>[Music] most people understand that science is a broad term describing many different fields of study like chemistry biology and physics [Music] what makes these scientific fields different is not necessarily that they study different objects but that they use different techniques to study the objects just like science mathematics is also a broad term that describes many different fields of study like algebra geometry and topology and many others however many people don&#x27;t understand how these mathematical fields are different so let&#x27;s take a closer look at how a geometry a topologist and an algebra study a circle to a geometry a circle is made of a rigid material and it has a perfectly round shape from this geometric perspective we can study the curvature of a circle as well as reflectional and rotational symmetries of a circle [Music] from a topologist point of view if you look at a circle from different angles it no longer looks perfectly round it might as well be made from a flexible material from this topological perspective a circle can take on many different shapes and forms so we can learn about knotting and braiding of circles from an algebraic point of view a circle is a collection of separate points along with a rule for connecting the points we can choose different connection rules to describe the same circle and from this algebraic perspective the circle can be used to visualize non-standard arithmetics although these fields of study are very different the greatest mathematical discoveries happened in the different fields of mathematics work together [Music] you</p>
