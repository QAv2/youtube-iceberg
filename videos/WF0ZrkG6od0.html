            <p>That&#x27;s why JP Morgan took his funding away. Like, it&#x27;s cuz you free energy to everyone. Like, why isn&#x27;t there a revolution for this technology to be released? Like, it&#x27;s enough with the patent office. Goddamn patent office. Release the technology.</p>
<p>Quit [ __ ] doing wet works to it. Quit suppressing it. Quit putting it in the secret category of patents where it doesn&#x27;t get released and you can&#x27;t do anything about it. Like, if you have a free energy device and you go bring it there, oh, they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll basically make it so that you can never massproduce this thing. It&#x27;s terrible.</p>
<p>So, you have to make it open source.</p>
