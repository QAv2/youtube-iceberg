            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel my name is Thomas and I do uh educational videos on this channel today is I think it&#x27;s the 175th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and this is a system of theory it&#x27;s a Theory of Everything that was developed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 but not before writing many books on the subject and many many articles you got a little bit of a following and a few other people have followed him along since then and written a few things that we will go over very shortly not today but uh in the coming months and um I think it&#x27;s a great system the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe of motion now when he first uh published his um findings back in the late 1950s he used the term space-time rather than motion and before he died he also um he&#x27;s he continued to use the term motion but he also called it change in three dimensions so you can think of it in any of those three terms really we live in a universe of change okay things are changing we don&#x27;t live in a static situation in uh you know a situation where things are uh the same as they were two seconds ago or two hours ago or whatever things are always changing so other people have come up with that idea that the universe is made out of motion but what distinguished Larson is that he defined how he defined emotion he defined it as the relationship between space and time and that&#x27;s utterly logical uh the only real understanding we have emotion is uh really speed uh the car is moving at 20 miles per hour 20 miles of space in one hour of time space over time that is speed space over time but uh it turns out that really all uh like physical quantities have time and space as their sole constituents um but as as he said change in three dimensions so space and time both have three at least three dimensions he calls that their coordinate aspects so we kind of understand coordinate space x y z coordinates euclidean coordinates uh you know so if you&#x27;re graphing something you got your x-axis and your y-axis and then you have your z-axis also in three dimensions those are the coordinates of space but time also has their coordinate aspects now those coordinate aspects are not space like they are time like but it&#x27;s still uh you know coordinate three or more dimensions and then space and time also have their clock aspects we understand the clock in terms of time time is Flowing time is progressing time is always getting later and later and later but space is also flowing and progressing and getting farther and farther and farther apart Larson calls this scalar motion clock time and clock space is a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but it has no particular direction or you could think of it as all directions and you envision this by using a balloon and a magic marker you put a bunch of dots on the balloon with the magic marker and then you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but in no particular direction or in all directions and this is what&#x27;s called an outward scalar motion you suck in the balloon and then you have an inward scalar motion this was also detected by the Hubble telescope you know could have been a fraud I guess but um all they discovered way back in the 1920s that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other that is the progression of space now what also uh you know occurs with both time and space is they both come in only discrete units there is not no continuity of time and space they uh have a minimum unit and that is uh one unit of space is 4.56 times 10 to the minus 8 meters and um the one unit of time is 1.5 times 10 to the minus 16 seconds so that&#x27;s six quadrillion per second um and you know 20 million per meter in terms of space so they&#x27;re very small but they are not continuous they are in chunks and one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is really like the midpoint of the universe which contradicts Einstein who says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe that&#x27;s because Larson didn&#x27;t know about the half of the entire half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls this the cosmic sector and in that half of the universe the speed of light is actually the slowest speed in the universe and uh so uh that speed of light outward in all directions is what Larson caused the progression of the natural reference system this is the natural reference system when we have a reference system our reference system is generally zero like from stationary and then something starts moving and you say oh it&#x27;s going faster uh or in if it&#x27;s you know backing up then it&#x27;s going slower than zero but uh the reference system that nature or God or whoever is using is the natural reference system that is outward at the speed of light in all directions if it&#x27;s going slower than that then it is a material phenomena if it is going faster than that then it is a cosmic phenomenon okay um now today we&#x27;re looking at Larson&#x27;s 1979 book that&#x27;s called Nothing But motion which is primarily on physics a little bit of organic chemistry as well and we are in chapter 10 that is called atoms and we just started this chapter so I&#x27;m going to back up by uh two paragraphs and read those again and then get in to uh the bulk of this chapter um now atoms are uh you know uh one of the they are rotational combinations Larson really says that there are four kinds of motion there is your translational motion there&#x27;s your vibrational motion there&#x27;s your rotational motion and then there&#x27;s your rotational vibration and these can come in one two or even three dimensions and um that is how an atom gets built up it gets built up by combining different kinds of motions uh and now in the second paragraph he&#x27;s going to be uh giving you a uh a visualization and I think it&#x27;s really important that you kind of go over this very slowly like rewind me a few times and listen to it until you can make this visualization and you can see how there are really two photons at the core of every atom now the photon is really a simple harmonic motion that&#x27;s a wave now for Larson the simple harmonic motion comes from a combination of a translational motion and a vibrational motion uh normal to or 90 90 degree angle off of the translational motion so the motion goes along but at the same time it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going up and down and up and down and so that creates this wave-like motion now a lot of Larson&#x27;s followers have disagreed with that and have said that the uh that the rotational that the photon comes out of a by rotation when you combine two counter rotating bodies or two counter rotating motions then you also get a sine wave so when Larson&#x27;s talking about it here he&#x27;s talking about it in terms of that he understands but um others especially Dr Kevin K nehru who came up with the idea of by rotation and also Dr Bruce paret have gone Along on a different track there and we will be looking at those those Scholars as well later on okay uh chapter 10 Adams in some respects the combinations of motions with greater rotational displacement those which constitute the atoms of the chemical elements are less complicated than those with the least displacement the subatomic particles and it will therefore be convenient to discuss the structure of these larger units first foreign geometrical considerations indicate that two photons can rotate around the same Central Point without interference if the rotational speeds are the same thus forming a double unit the nature of this combination can be illustrated by two cardboard discs interpenetrated along a common diameter C the diameter a perpendicular to C in disk a represents one linear oscillation and the disk a is the figure generated by a one-dimensional rotation of this oscillation around an axis B perpendicular to both A and C rotation of a second linear oscillation represented by the diameter B around axis a generates the disk B it is then evident that disk a may be given a second rotation around axis a and disc B may be given a second rotation around axis B without interference at any point as long as the rotational speeds are equal okay so you want to kind of go over that in your head a little bit until you can can kind of grasp it uh the the image there okay the validity of the mathematical principles of probability is covered in the fundamental postulates by specifically including them in the definition of ordinary commutative mathematics as that term is used in the postulates the most significant of these principles so far is the atomic structures are concerned are that small numbers are more probable than large numbers and symmetrical combinations are more probable than asymmetrical combinations of the same total magnitude for a given number of units of net rotational displacement the double rotating system results in lower individual displacement values and the probability principles give them precedence over single units in which the individual displacements are higher all rotating combinations with sufficient net total displacement to enable forming double units therefore do so to facilitate a description of these objects we will utilize a notation in the form a dash B Dash C where C is the speed displacement of the one-dimensional reverse rotation and a and b are the displacements in the two dimensions of the basic two-dimensional rotation okay so you you know you have a disk to represent a one-dimensional rotation and then when you rotate that disc it creates a sphere and that is your two-dimensional rotation um now his his notation a dash B Dash C is uh basically running parallel to the atomic number in the periodic table okay so um you would just you would use that notation uh so really every different atom is going to have a unique uh combination of numbers there of the a dash B Dash C uh every different atom every different kind of atom so if you have oxygen that will have one particular a dash B Dash C notation whereas if you have carbon it will have a different a dash B Dash C and it turns out that that c uh can be positive or negative um it can and so uh that kind of increases the permutations there okay um back to Larson later in the development we will find that the one dimensional rotation is connected with electrical phenomena and the two-dimensional rotation is similarly connected with Magnetic phenomena in dealing with the atomic and particle rotations it will be convenient to use the term electric and magnetic instead of one-dimensional and two-dimensional respectively except in those cases where it is desired to lay special emphasis on the number of Dimensions involved it should be understood however that designation of these rotations as electric and magnetic does not indicate the presence of any electric or magnetic forces in the structures now being described this terminology has been adopted because it not only serves our present purposes but also sets the stage for the introduction of electric and magnetic phenomena in a later phase of the development okay so he&#x27;s gonna be using these terms but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily imply that any magnetic or electric uh forces are at play uh in the discussion and again uh this is uh you know a difficulty of the reciprocal system is that Larson has to come up with a language to describe what he&#x27;s what he&#x27;s uh trying to uh impart to you because the language isn&#x27;t already there these are completely new Concepts and so the uh progenitor of those Concepts has to provide a language to communicate those and sometimes that language isn&#x27;t as you know smooth um as maybe or slick as maybe you know an older Theory that&#x27;s had some time to work out the Kinks You know there are some some terminology some some terms that Larson used uh didn&#x27;t work out as well as others and he he sometimes he changed the terminology uh after a few years or whatever after getting some comments from some readers and so on um so uh you know just um just take his terminology and just try to remember what it is um eventually you know maybe you can change it if you don&#x27;t like it uh but uh that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s going with he&#x27;s using electric and magnetic and I know that at least for one friend of mine this served as kind of a big sticking point because he you know he was a adherent of Legacy science and he sees these terms and they set off ideas in his head about what they are and that they&#x27;re not always one in two Dimensions so but that&#x27;s the way that Larson is rolling here one dimensional is electric two-dimensional is magnetic but that&#x27;s not implying those forces but that&#x27;s just the description of these one and two dimensional rotations where the displacement in the two magnetic dimensions are unequal the rotation is distributed in the form of a spheroid okay not a sphere but a spheroid is fear like it&#x27;s like an uh like oblong in one uh one dimension okay in such cases a the rotation which is effective in two dimensions of the spheroid will be called the principal magnetic rotation and the other the subordinate magnetic rotation when it is desired to distinguish between the larger and the smaller magnetic rotational displacements the terms primary and secondary will be used where Motion in time occurs in the material structures now being discussed the negative displacement values of this motion will be distinguished by placing them in parentheses all values not so identified refer to positive displacements or Motion in space now again Larson flips it uh he calls Motion in Space the positive displacement even though technically it&#x27;s negative because it&#x27;s slower than the speed of light the material sector is slower than the speed of light whereas the cosmic sector is faster than the speed of light so you would think that the cosmic sector would be positive but he caused the cosmic sector negative because we basically live in the material sector this is where we make our observations this is where we make our measurements this is what we&#x27;re accustomed to this is the cosmic over here is the cosmic Universe this is the universe that Einstein didn&#x27;t know anything about and Legacy science doesn&#x27;t know anything about and so he accommodates by changing the positive and the negative around to so the positive is what we&#x27;re used to the positive displacement is called Motion in space um again Larson is the person that has to come up with the terms here and uh you know you just have to give him the benefit of the doubt he put a lot of time into thinking about this and so he probably knows what he&#x27;s doing when he&#x27;s coming up with this terminology [Music] um and if he doesn&#x27;t then he&#x27;s probably willing to change it um okay uh we didn&#x27;t get too far today but we you know are plugging away on chapter 10 and uh we will talk tomorrow and resume from where we are thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
