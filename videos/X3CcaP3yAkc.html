            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Were you involved with a tip? Yes, I was in what? In what respect were you involved with a tip as a consultant? The IRS program was where I was actually a subcontractor as an employee here. We were a subcontractor to big low aerospace advance based studies, be a SS on the ISAF, which was the other side of a tip. A tip was handled out of the office of the undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, and ASKAP was at the Defense Intelligence Agency. And that&#x27;s the actual funded program that received enough congressional appropriation to hire outside contractors like Bass and Urtext to work on the programs. OK, so you you you all you ultimately worked for were part of the Pentagon&#x27;s UFO program.</p>
<p>Yeah. What kind of what kind of stuff did you do for the Pentagon UFO program? Oh, basically what I just discussed was we we had. Well, first of all, we gave technical advice to the field investigation. We&#x27;d get information and data on reports and we would do physics analysis and report back on what we what our opinion or assessments on the field. Investigations and data was on variety of observations and encounters of UFO phenomena.</p>
<p>But one big main part of our work was to hire 38 independent expert scientists in industry, academia and government to write defense intelligence reference documents on future transformation concepts for concepts that we can envision in the year 2050. And take what we have in our existing really advanced physics and really advanced aerospace technology and evolve it to the future 2050 and see what it looks like and see if we can compare. See if we have any hopes of of developing an advanced technology in 2050 that&#x27;s comparable to the Tic-Tac UFOs that the USS Nimitz and Roosevelt encountered. And the other type of UFO is at the other naval warships have encountered out in the Middle East and elsewhere around the around the Pacific and Atlantic. OK.</p>
<p>So you said that part of your job at all set. Right. All set us out. So that was you would get reports and you guys would study and analyze the physics behind those reports. What kind of reports are you talking about? One was the least.</p>
<p>One was a Navy laser weapon report about the development of the breakthroughs in Solid-State laser weapon technology. Another one was a paper I coauthored as a second author on extra space dimensional warp drive. So the lead author got his p.g in physics at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, on looking at extra space dimensions and drawing on vacuum energy, quantum vacuum energy from the extra dimensions to power warp drive. So we coauthored a paper that I coauthored. I wrote as a single author, a paper on traversable wormholes.</p>
<p>And then I wrote a paper on how to explore the quantum vacuum to produce negative vacuum energy that creates that you would need to create a wormhole and work drive. And then I authored a paper on anti-gravity propulsion physics using generativity because all that is all wrapped up into the same physics. Other people talked about smart materials, nano materials, MHC aerospace propulsion systems, hypersonic propulsion, invisibility cloaks, using metamaterials, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. There were 38 reports. I don&#x27;t have the list of I have them that I have.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have all of them. Only a few, I think, were released. But I have the one on traversable wormholes. OK, one quick thing about Allsopp. So how long did you work with Allsopp? Five years from 2007 to 2012, and then it was shut down, right? Yeah, because we couldn&#x27;t get.</p>
<p>We couldn&#x27;t. The DEA director and executive director were against renewing it for another five years. So they&#x27;re supposed to get another five year appropriation from the Senate through the defense appropriations bill. But they turned it down because they were not given enough complete information, understand, with the full scope of the program was and the reason for that is we were not sure that they would be accepted or receptive of this type of program. So they were only briefed on superficial aspects of the program that they misconstrued to be a waste of money or just, you know, unexplained.</p>
<p>Why are we putting that kind of money into something that got 138 technical papers come out of it while there&#x27;s was much more than 30 technical papers? And and the problem is, is that you have a problem with a very biased, closed minds where the UFO subject concern, especially if you&#x27;ve got military and civilian leadership that have been raised and educated as evangelical Christians or other religious or other religious cults or whatnot, where they object to UFO is being set. Canik tone. And got it. You know, nothing that you worked on, though, during those five years was considered top secret. Correct.</p>
<p>It was it was top secret FCI. It was T.S. FCI sensitive, compartmentalized information. So the DOT s it was a slash FCI. So the documents I have in my possession, 38 reports are classified except for the laser weapon one, which is now that particular report is now.</p>
<p>I think it got unclassified because or declassified because the technology is now old and out of date. It&#x27;s been replaced by more recent Solid-State weapon technology that the report. Well, that that report was basically a survey of the existing state of the art of Solid-State laser weapons at the Navy and other elements of the DSD have been developing and deploying for testing. OK, so that paper&#x27;s now opening with all the other papers. Of course, they were unclassified, but that&#x27;s the nature of those papers.</p>
<p>We wanted the authors of those papers to be allowed to publish those papers in the peer reviewed journals that correspond to their professional discipline. So we deliberately wanted those papers to be unclassified so that the authors can publish those. In fact, my boss. How put off had already published his limit that he had already published his time metric engineering paper in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society during the asset program. But before his DARPA got published by the DEA.</p>
<p>My my paper on warp drives, wormholes and negative vacuum energy that the quantum tomography of looking at negative vacuum energy in a variety of squee state systems that didn&#x27;t get published until 2013 in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society. It was also a paper that I presented as in the in the 20 and the 2011 DARPA, NASA 100 year Starship Symposium in Tampa in Orlando, Florida. And that that was in September, the end of September 2011. So I presented that DARPA paper as a symposium and proceedings. That symposium proceedings was being published along with the others by Jabe is the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society after they underwent the usual peer review process for acceptance.</p>
<p>Where was all seven eight? To date coexist at the same time. Pretty much all atrip came before Orsa because of the Nemitz encounter. So almost, almost simultaneously, a tip came a little bit before, but they coordinated and they both ended in 2012. No, no. A tip never ended.</p>
<p>A tip never ended. No. It&#x27;s still going on today. Yeah. Who runs it? Not me.</p>
<p>They changed the name, changed names, changed location, changed leadership. So what did was on. What&#x27;s the new name? I can&#x27;t tell you, though. You said the reason you know this is because you are still on the inside. Oh, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a consultant still.</p>
<p>Yeah. You are still insulting. You are still a consultant for the program, formerly known as a tip. Correct. And you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s it&#x27;s been renamed.</p>
<p>It still exists and it&#x27;s still being run out of USDA. I won&#x27;t confirm where it&#x27;s been run out of, but generally an intelligence program. Yeah. You know. Yeah, I mean, maybe I am confirming yelped up generally oh, issue.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, USDA. Yeah, it it isn&#x27;t likely to change locations for any reason because of the way the DOJ is organized. This is not a this is this is an intelligence operation to gather data, analyze it, evaluated and and recommend courses of action. So that falls into the intelligence area.</p>
<p>I got I got a quote from the DOJ D. That said that a tip did investigate and research unidentified aerial phenomenon. Does it still investigate? Unidentified aerial phenomenon? Yes. Confirm that a tip is still going. It&#x27;s still owned by the, oh USD guy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s under a new name and that&#x27;s under new management. That&#x27;s about all I can say about it, because you are still under contract, right? No, there&#x27;s no contract. It&#x27;s an informing consulting right now because they don&#x27;t have an appropriation to fund external contractors. So I&#x27;m I may unofficial. I&#x27;m just a consultant and I&#x27;m not getting paid to do it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just what happens. But you have signed some kind of NDA, correct? No, don&#x27;t need to. I had security clearances. OK. And I&#x27;ve got a history in this business going back to 1996, so the all of the the program director knows me very well.</p>
<p>He knows my boss very well. He knows my former boss very well. So if you are not contracted nor why can&#x27;t you reveal the name of the program? Well, because I still have security clearances on the record. So, you know, I wonder, under those conditions is still we were still patriotic Americans. We don&#x27;t like to talk about sensitive stuff even if we don&#x27;t have a contract.</p>
<p>OK. It&#x27;s the rules of the road over there. You know, we have some informal, informal rules. Why would the Pentagon say that efficiently to the press? Why would the Pentagon say that a tip was shut down? Let me tell you something about the Pentagon. It is not true that the public relations office knows everything that&#x27;s going on, especially if it&#x27;s a classified program.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no automatic procedure by which they are briefed on everything there. They don&#x27;t receive it from there. They&#x27;d be flooded with information that they don&#x27;t know what to do with. So basically, they would have to find out about something after the fact in order to make a public comment about it. They are they don&#x27;t know what the let&#x27;s say let&#x27;s say they&#x27;re the right hand.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t know what the left hand is doing. And that&#x27;s how they. That&#x27;s how your government operates. That&#x27;s how the Pentagon operates. When they said that statement, they were only slightly to correct the H by that mean no longer exist.</p>
<p>But the but as an organization under new leadership, it does exist with a new name. So that statement is incorrect. And that&#x27;s not because somebody is lying. It&#x27;s because they simply don&#x27;t know the answer. And they did not know who to ask to get that answer, to get that information from.</p>
<p>All right. When when they came out and said that Lewis Elizondo had nothing to do with a tip whatsoever, the Pentagon, it was horrible, wrong place of public relations. That was absolutely incorrect. They did not know what they were talking about. My boss went to report to Lou at the Pentagon and the YO USDA offices during the atypia era.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s, you know, who my boss is, how put off, right? Doctor, help it off. Right. So your boss reported to little. Yeah. And I&#x27;ve been over there, too.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t report to Lou. I wasn&#x27;t involved with Lou at that time, but I&#x27;d been I&#x27;d been involved with the new management. So are you. Are you guys still investigating UFOs at the Pentagon? Yeah, I would say yeah. Course, they&#x27;ve they never went away.</p>
<p>They never went away, Steve. They&#x27;re still there. They&#x27;re still coming up and causing aviation havoc. They&#x27;re getting in the middle of military aviators operations. And that&#x27;s dangerous.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s dangerous for those pilots. I&#x27;m gonna ask one more time. Sure. Could you at least give me a clue nugget breadcrumb about the current eight to anything? That&#x27;s about all I have for you. All right.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s about it. I try like Bel Air. Yeah. Okay. That&#x27;s about it.</p>
<p>All right. Thank you so much. Take care. Bye bye.</p>
