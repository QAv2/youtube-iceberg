            <p>hey everybody jay whitener here reality check thanks for uh dropping in uh hit subscribe like and all that other stuff and try to get me up to 10 000 subs that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m trying to get to today you know we&#x27;ve been talking a lot about the future in the last few shows uh we had astrology about the future and then we had johnny enoch talking about sylvia brown&#x27;s prophecies that were pretty eerie and strangely correct about 2020 and people wearing masks and all that and so today i want to kind of go towards um technology i guess the future of technology and um so i brought in ken schwartz ken say hello to my audience well hello out there glad to be on ken makes this this is what he does this is c60 you guys most of you probably know what c60 is you&#x27;re gonna learn a lot more right now and um i&#x27;ve been taking this now for a couple of weeks and i&#x27;ve noticed i do have more endurance i can&#x27;t go outside because there&#x27;s so much smoke but other than that you know life is good so um ken uh when did you start making this uh purple power well it&#x27;s about it&#x27;s been about six years now and uh when originally you know i was working on a democracy fusion reactor i think we&#x27;ll talk about later but uh you know all the people that were involved in that you know they&#x27;re the late doctor this the late doctor that because it all died off so i figured i&#x27;d go find something that was protective against radiation and so i was researching i heard about this stuff called c60 so i went out and i uh bought a couple sources and i was trying it out and uh for myself and my crew doing the research so we&#x27;d have some radiation protection the example they gave like one set of rats would get c60 the other set wouldn&#x27;t get them they&#x27;d hit them with like multiple doses of fatal radiation none almost none of the c 60 rats would die but all the control rats would die like that and the c60 lips so i said that&#x27;s right yeah let&#x27;s go back to that though those rat studies because those are important to understand what you&#x27;re really dealing with here so it was in france right uh oh that was this was that was the the life doubling of lifespan study yeah yeah let&#x27;s tell tell us about that yeah we&#x27;ll see yeah c60 had been you know was discovered in 1985 and then they got a nobel prize in 1996 but it&#x27;s really really hard to work and to to produce right so they uh so i think at the beginning of 2000 or 1999 they actually started an animal study and uh so they&#x27;re testing it for toxicity right this is a new molecule nobody knows anything about it so and what it resulted in was doubling the lifespan of animals primarily by preventing the occurrence of cancers cognitive decline and other diseases associated with aging yeah i give it to my cat and dog so i don&#x27;t know if anybody else does that but uh you know i do every day i just put a little drop in their food they don&#x27;t even it&#x27;s so tasteless that it doesn&#x27;t they don&#x27;t even bother them so they did this study where they gave uh c60 to rats and then they did and then a control group that didn&#x27;t get it and then they watched and the control group essentially died away and the ones that were getting the c60 had an extended lifespan yes and uh yeah they actually when the last control rat died i think they stopped giving c60 to the test animals so potentially they could have had a much a longer lifespan but uh actually the last two rats had a terrible accident and died because you know it was uh they&#x27;d been living for five and a half years and they needed to publish so there was a terrible accident so technically they probably could have lived a little bit longer and what&#x27;s their average lifespan of a rat well these were worcester rats and they were kind of wimpy rats they have uh you know they&#x27;re kind of the ones you look at cross-eyed and breathe on and they keel over so because they wanted you know to make it but uh uh probably about five years four and a half five years so they were kind of like living past average rat lifespan interesting so c60 we do we know how it works what it&#x27;s doing oh sure what c60 is it&#x27;s a antioxidant and uh basically what it does it fights inflammation supports immunity and brings increasing mental clarity and energy but the way it does that is in like for instance like 65 percent of the oxidative radicals produced in our bodies are made in the mitochondria and uh and the principle like super oxygen which is an oxygen with an extra electron and and then the hydrogen peroxide and then occasionally hydroxyl radicals and stuff and as we age those things go down the larger cell provides the mitochondria when you take c60 it completely replaces the and then some of those missing antioxidants and so what it does it basically just lifts the oxidative burden your cells are under so your cells can operate and function correctly the way they were when you were younger and that&#x27;s how c60 works gotcha so um i recommend you uh look into it especially if you&#x27;re over 50 because uh it really does give you more energy it really really does you said you started um you discovered it because you were working uh with radiation and you wanted to alleviate the effects of of radiation what were you working with oh that was the metal oxygen fusion reactor and uh that was uh yeah a couple of japanese guys osama and kushi discovered this in the discovered the principle back in the late 50s and i think they really did their official studies in the early 60s you know even before i was around and uh they deleted them what you said they deleted their studies no well they got they got suppressed basically japan was under occupation they were putting in the westinghouse nuclear reactors which were you know the fukushima style stuff and uh yeah they basically just their discoveries got suppressed and you know they continued for a while but i had read it like 30 years ago but uh i don&#x27;t know about five or six years ago i was in the right place at the right time with the right people and we basically redid their experiments and proved that metal oxygen fusion actually exists and this is a room temperature yeah it&#x27;s basically well it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not particularly room temperature what they basically did is they uh they had a they basically took like a sodium light lamp that you see on the street lamps and then what they did is they added argon to it inside and argon&#x27;s a noble gas for those people out there so it&#x27;s non-reactive but it&#x27;s like a modifier in this and and you know the the uh the sodium lamp gives out that yellow orange color and so what they did is they slowly fed a little bit of oxygen into the lamp and over time it turned into the bright purple color of potassium and if you actually look on your atomic chart you got a little one here for those who study but uh here&#x27;s sodium there&#x27;s uh here&#x27;s sodium and there&#x27;s oxygen if you actually fuse oxygen and sodium it makes potassium the next one down on the atomic chart there so they were basically doing they did a lot of others that that was like their flagship one and uh and it was a real threat because you know it&#x27;s not only a threat to uh yeah it&#x27;s a threat to metal manufacture mining and also for energy production and so they just got suppressed they were they were fusing uh elements and creating other elements yes and and at a reasonable rate so it was it was costing like 60 an ounce to fuse some sodium into potassium or anything else for that matter so they were could undercut the markets drastically oh absolutely interesting and so is there any other is that the only effect from this uh uh l e n r is there well what we did is uh well it put out x-rays see one of the things that people remember you remember freshmen and ponds yeah yeah those are the guys in utah i think was the 90s i think that they came out with 80s okay they came out with the uh the cold fusion stuff where they said they&#x27;re packing deuterium basically in a platinum or palladium lattice and uh and then they were getting evidence of uh fusion activity and so of course they got really brutalized by it and uh well ponds moved back to france and the fleshman kept doing it but one of the things we discovered with moxie is when you lower the colon barrier that&#x27;s the barrier of tunneling so that fusion can occur it also lowers the energy level of the fusion so instead of putting out gamma rays like a regular fusion what this is putting out in the x-ray band so a lot of these guys were walking around with geiger counters looking for gamma rays when they&#x27;re actually x-raying themselves wow which is unfortunate so as i remember cold fusion you were getting more energy out than you were putting in oh yes and they were getting other things like helium but one of the uh one of the things is they couldn&#x27;t say because it was intermittent they couldn&#x27;t really reproduce it but there was definitely something going on but they couldn&#x27;t give a a mechanism they had no mechanism well unfortunately for a lot of these cold fusion reactor we the actual mechanism appears to have been metal oxygen fusion instead of like the the metal fusing with or instead of like the two deuteriums fusing to make helium they were unfortunately fusing to make uh the oxygen and the experiment was actually fusing with platinum which which makes radon and then if they were using palladium it was fusing and making radioactive xenon these are alpha emitters and like for instance this is what they did they were doing what is an example of what happened with one uh one uh the guy that actually tested this this is like there&#x27;s a you&#x27;ve seen the radon detectors that you get for your house you put your basement well inside of them there&#x27;s this little chip it&#x27;s a p39 plastic and when an alpha particle hits it it it burrows a little hole and they soak it in the hot sodium hydroxide and then it shows pits so like this is an example of uh the pits in like a raw one that&#x27;s maybe been out in the air for a day or two right this is the this year then they take it and they put it on top of one of these cold fusion cells and that&#x27;s the number of hits each one of those little hits things is a uh is an alpha particle so these guys were actually venting because of their electrolysis cells they vent in the laboratory the laboratory air so they were breathing like uh they were breathing air is like a thousand times worse than your worst radon basement and so that&#x27;s why fleshman died and ponds didn&#x27;t and so a lot of these these cold fusion guys have died out and uh and they&#x27;re of course blaming that the government killed them and well maybe but but it looks like actually the ones there they were breathing you know they were living in like a terrible radon environment and getting x-rayed at the same time and so that&#x27;s what took them out and that&#x27;s the work you do it doesn&#x27;t do that oh yeah well no it still produces x-rays right but we figured i figured it out that this is what was going on instead of that and let me grab one here oh well anyway so you wear a lens and so i figured it was x-rays so what i did is i made sure that we had uh we had x-ray plates in there right so the geiger counter is not going to pick that up and because of the electric spark on it it&#x27;s not going to uh you&#x27;re not necessarily going to uh uh you&#x27;re not necessarily off i&#x27;m not going to worry about that finding it but yeah we just basically flooded x-ray plates just like that we turn it on flooded x-ray plates and and also it made a whole lot of heat what we did is we changed it from flesh from uh osama kushi&#x27;s because they were using sodium oxygen well i took deuterium which is in heavy water which is an isotope of hydrogen and i fused it with the oxygen because what we&#x27;re trying to do is when you fuse things together it releases a little bit of energy and and that energy is what the energy that powers the sun and stuff the fusion energy releasing energy so what we did is we we put deterrium and oxygen together and it would release it would turn it into fluoride 18 and then it would kick off x-ray but it would also release a lot of energy and so like when we were when we&#x27;re running our things we&#x27;d have to pack it in ice because it would melt all the ice we didn&#x27;t have all the fuel in there running it we could run our little electric spark thing for you know hours right it would do nothing but the minute we had all the fuel turn everything on in 30 seconds it would heat up so fast inside the reactor the gas has become too thin for the spark so we had to pack it in ice all the time so it was way over unity hugely so i mean it basically turns every gallon of seawater into the energy if you take the story amount energy of 40 gallons of gasoline so there&#x27;s a lot of seawater out there uh yeah there is so i just want to get this straight because i&#x27;m just a layman just trying to figure this out and you&#x27;re taking oxygen and then you&#x27;re taking different metals and you&#x27;re fusing them together yes right and this creates two effects one you&#x27;re creating a another metal that&#x27;s just one step below in the table of elements yes and you&#x27;re also creating more energy than you&#x27;re putting in yes as long yeah all the way up to iron after iron it takes energy but uh but yeah we&#x27;re but you can yes you&#x27;re so you&#x27;re definitely definitely uh yeah it&#x27;s definitely positive hugely over positive it&#x27;s easy to do and also explains things because like alpha particles alpha particles are basically hot helium nucleuses and when they cool down they become a helium and that was the helium they were discovered in these cold fusions so yeah it&#x27;s a totally different type of fusion uh i figured out the mechanism but you know other people kind of figured out the whole concept uh before me and so this is active experiments going on right now yes and we we did have a third party tested we were kind of third-party testing misawa kushi and then we got another guys to third party test that and yeah it&#x27;s definitely happening and uh and yeah we got a couple of bands because it&#x27;s happening not only is the oxygen fusing with the uh with the deuterium but we also get a little fusion we had an iron electrode in there so anode and so the little bit of the iron would fuse with the oxygen so we were getting two two different bands of uh x-rays out from the two different types of fusion going on so as long as you&#x27;re protected from the x-rays it should be pretty good yes and that&#x27;s easy yeah we basically left the room when we turned it on right and uh we had x-ray detectors and we we used uh we used like dental plates one of our friends gary he has his brother was a dentist so we just got some dental x-ray plates we put him in there and that way because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard with the because there&#x27;s electric discharge going on in the tube so it&#x27;s putting off rf frequencies which will interfere with the geiger counters because they&#x27;re like electric discharge but a uh but an r but uh but the the film x-ray film isn&#x27;t bothered by rf at all right so this is pretty amazing i mean you could uh not only make a lot of money but i mean you know this could be the answer to free energy well yeah we took out a patent on it but they&#x27;re fighting us at the office originally they had a cia atomic energy guy run our patent but after he saw that it actually worked he shifted off to some other sucker because he didn&#x27;t want his name on because they as a rule they have to reject any cold fusion thing right that&#x27;s just the way that they&#x27;re running it so he didn&#x27;t want he didn&#x27;t want to be like one of those idiots in the future well this guy when we remembered an infamy for rejecting the patent but it doesn&#x27;t matter we&#x27;ve actually one of the things this isn&#x27;t kept secret i think i sent you a copy of the paper and you can post it anywhere yeah i mean i have no problem with people reading this and that&#x27;s you know everybody can have it i mean well we do have a patent and you have to license from us but if you go commercial but yeah you can make it and you can do this in your own basement like we did uh just be careful about the x-rays and uh and you know it never hurts to get a little uh c60 to help you do that definitely very interesting so that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s fascinating so we had lunch a few weeks ago and we were talking about um one of my favorite subjects which is uh the plasma universe and um i i did not know but you you actually knew trevor constable right yes you ever dave&#x27;s cosplay yeah he taught me etheric brain engineering and a whole lot of other stuff yeah he&#x27;s a fascinating guy for you guys out there who don&#x27;t know he was he just recently died like three or four years ago i think yeah about three years ago guys 95 i think yeah he was he was up there yeah he was he was like the world&#x27;s first hippie and he was doing all this crazy uh technology in the desert in california he&#x27;s originally from new zealand yes moved to california and he started using infrared cameras with infrared film because there was no digital in the 50s and he started photographing these creatures that are in the sky that you can&#x27;t see there they are yeah this is from his bike cosmic pulse of life if you want to read about it get this book the cosmic pulse of life and he has all of these and what it is is he used oh the secret to is he used an 18a filter right for those people out there an 18a filter blocks just the visible still still let you see the ultraviolet and the infrared will block out the visible so you can just go out there and there&#x27;s these creatures these plasmoid creatures and he&#x27;s got you know he&#x27;s got dozens and other people have done this too that are actually living in our atmosphere and you can go out there and they&#x27;re attracted to as weather engineering things but you can go out there and take pictures and you can&#x27;t visibly see it but with an 18a filter on film and also it&#x27;s interesting is a lot of this stuff can only be caught on silver the silver-based film some of it can&#x27;t be caught on digital and there&#x27;s something to do with the the etheric life-force energy that he talks about you know these they&#x27;re flying some of these beings are giving off this energy and so that&#x27;s detected by the little crystals of silver which form whereas in a digital format they may not be hot so you actually need the silver iodine or the silver crystals in your uh your regular film to see this i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anybody developing infrared film anymore no but you can take regular films with the ata filter and get something film yeah there are there are kodaks coming back with film now and so film is on its way back right now which i&#x27;m really gratified much superior to uh digital yes but um so uh my theory is is that like we&#x27;re looking like we&#x27;re living at the bottom of a plasma ocean or walking around the bottom of the ocean and all around us is this ocean we don&#x27;t even know about inside this ocean are all these creatures and some have intelligence and sentience and some don&#x27;t it&#x27;s just like they&#x27;re different just like sea creatures would be right some care about you some don&#x27;t most are indifferent and um and we&#x27;re walking around in this world and we&#x27;re completely oblivious and blind to it and it&#x27;s actually the key to understanding a lot of the great spiritual traditions for instance tibetan buddhism they talk about these tea glaze which are these spherical translucent objects that are in the air if you do your buddhist prayers i&#x27;m not a buddhist but my wife is and if you do your buddhist prayers then these tigglies all come and surround you right and i don&#x27;t know what they do to you but um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just fascinating and um there&#x27;s a bunch of people on the internet that are kind of working together to photograph these things one of them is a guy in england i want to get him on the show nick hayes so if you guys want to look up nick hayes and look at his stuff he&#x27;s the best of the digital uh images i think today so trevor had a lot of um a lot of crazy theories actually are coming out to be true and one of them he said was that the use of radar was damaging these creatures and he was a radar guy from world war ii and a lot of the ufos he said were also these creatures that they would be visible on the radar and then when they&#x27;d run to the ship to go see what was coming at them and there would be nothing out there and uh so his theories were crazy and great and he believed that there was this energy pulsing through everything that gave it life and uh and i think that the plasma universe explanation is really you know really the best explanation for for all of this yeah he called it etheric energy but i think it would be more closely related like prana or chi that would be actually because ether has a different connotation but so yeah he had just i&#x27;ve seen dozens and dozens of us he had a whole book of pictures and stuff that they&#x27;d taken and it was just just amazing uh levels of stuff and the yeah i think a lot of that of course then you know radar damages a lot of things yeah you know they they&#x27;ve and uh yeah so we&#x27;re kind of yeah that&#x27;s one of the other pollutions that we&#x27;re doing to our environment that are really trashing things up uh yeah that&#x27;s why one of the reasons why the bird population has been reduced so much in the last 4g 4g too yeah yeah yeah 4g uh people don&#x27;t realize how many birds there used to be i don&#x27;t want to wax a like an elder here but when i was young i in the fall i could go in my backyard in the suburbs where i grew up and i would literally watch hundreds of thousands of birds flying south the sky would be darkened with them there&#x27;d be um usually one breed all together flying the sparrows or you know starlings and literally that never happens anymore yeah it&#x27;s the same with bugs too yep and now they&#x27;re going to um use crispr technology to rearrange the mosquito uh and make it less vicious and i think that that&#x27;s going to have some serious rep you know uh effects i mean what could possibly go wrong exactly you could go wrong all the bats die um but you know that what do you think about messing with all these technologies that they&#x27;re messing us with um they&#x27;re bringing in the 5g even in my small little community you&#x27;d think there&#x27;d be no way in the world that they would afford to pipe it in because they have to go down this 12 mile long road to get here yep they&#x27;re just going straight ahead and putting it in this is like they&#x27;re not stopping so what do you think about all that well it&#x27;s well that you know it&#x27;s that internet of things that they want to do it&#x27;s seven billion i mean there&#x27;s there a 5g is basically microwave right that&#x27;s what it is it&#x27;s different gigahertz frequencies but it&#x27;s basically microwave and they&#x27;ve got tens of thousands of studies out there that show the negative effects of microwave radiation even at low levels on living organisms so it&#x27;s not like they know it but then they there&#x27;s this seven billion a trillion dollar thing to make the internet of things it&#x27;s like this seven trillion dollar development market and they want that money but uh and but i i think it&#x27;s going to end up something like asbestos you know they&#x27;re going to put it out there they&#x27;re going to tell you how wonderful it is and then after a certain amount of time you know they&#x27;re going to get all these health things and it&#x27;ll get worse and worse until finally you know it&#x27;s un undeniable and of course then the lawyers will flood out from underneath the floorboards and uh and that will be the end of those 5g companies well cliff ice seems to think that it&#x27;s not going to last long they&#x27;re going to some other technology quickly after 5g what do you think of that oh yeah well i mean look if you just light if you just do light fiber directly in your computer it&#x27;s like a thousand times faster than 5g will ever be okay so why it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like you know you could just hardwire in with fiber you&#x27;re a thousand times more than 5g you&#x27;ve got no radiation problems i mean it&#x27;s just such a superior thing and you&#x27;ve got to actually light fiber the 5g units anyway so just run the fibers into the houses i mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just a ridiculous it&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s one of those things they come up with and it sounds good at the time but when actual inflammation comes into it&#x27;s gonna end badly wow that&#x27;s such a great suggestion and it came believe that no one&#x27;s ever us you know anyway so we&#x27;re about to go through all the horrors of 5g before they finally go and put the glass fibers in right or you could even do quantum eventually they&#x27;ll have that too where it&#x27;s just to be even faster but uh you won&#x27;t there won&#x27;t be any uh you know entanglement communications you just put like a little thing inside your thumb drive you&#x27;ll stick it into your side computer and you&#x27;ve got instant communications anywhere in the galaxy in real time we already have that technology we do we already have that yeah the military&#x27;s been developing that for quite a quite a while i&#x27;m i&#x27;ve heard that we have a bunch of them actually yeah they just don&#x27;t seem to want to share it with us no what do you think about disclosure you think that they&#x27;re ever going to disclose or there&#x27;s super secrets inside their programs no they&#x27;ll never disclose and if they ever do try to quote do a disclosure it&#x27;ll it&#x27;ll be a bunch of lies i think disclosure will come when some event happens where it&#x27;s undeniable and it probably won&#x27;t be in the u.s and there&#x27;ll be this undeniable event that happens you know giant craft over some city somewhere you know hanging out for hours and it&#x27;s live stream for the world well then you can&#x27;t deny it but uh but yeah i don&#x27;t i just don&#x27;t ever see them actually disclosing and if they ever did it would probably be a lie you know of the alien invasion they&#x27;re coming to get us give us all your money and your obedience so so we can defeat these evil aliens from zeta reticuli or something yeah that&#x27;s actually what i&#x27;ve been told is that their plan that they that they want to do a limited hangout on disclosure but they don&#x27;t want anyone to um get hung because we&#x27;re going to have so many questions like how long have you had this and you mean fukushima could have been avoided and you know so they&#x27;ve devised this fake alien invasion that&#x27;s supposed to happen like sometime soon i heard and then those all magically come up with all of the the toys that defeat the aliens they&#x27;re all going to be the heroes and um and uh it it could happen actually it sounds so crazy but after all everything that&#x27;s going on in 2020 no it could it could be oh yeah they&#x27;d make the fake alien spacecraft and they&#x27;d fight him and then there would be yeah it&#x27;d be just like a hollywood movie it would be cgi but people would probably die they&#x27;d have to like destroy some places they&#x27;d have to yeah some people but they they did it you know i know they don&#x27;t we know that and so i i think that uh so where do you think we&#x27;re going to be technology in in like that over the next 20 years well it&#x27;s that see it&#x27;s there&#x27;s a question there and and what is the technology that&#x27;s available and whether we&#x27;re going to have a society or system that&#x27;s going to allow that technology to be available to to you know commercial interest or the people that&#x27;s the question what sort of government are we going to end up are we going to end up some sort of flat fascist police state which we&#x27;re kind of rapidly speeding into for actually here where you know it&#x27;s all controlled you know and you you know if you don&#x27;t have your you know your digital currency and your in your covid pass or your immunity pass you know they&#x27;ll just you can&#x27;t go out and buy or sell they&#x27;ll or they could just press the button and cancel your your credits down at the uh the crypto the federal crypto note world and so yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s really you know we have that choice of moving toward freedom and development or kind of going into a complete controlled network and go down and i think that&#x27;s going to be found it would seem that the high-tech companies really want to take us into this high-tech fascism yeah but they&#x27;re not you know but we really haven&#x27;t had that many you know they maybe they have a better computer right these other things but if you look at like real developments and technology we haven&#x27;t had really any much development real developments in technology i mean aerial travel right we&#x27;re still basically running up planes you can go all this other stuff sure the electronics and computer stuff&#x27;s all faster but you know the united states doesn&#x27;t have a very good record of even applying advanced technology i mean but china has 20 000 kilometers of high-speed rail the united states has zero you know germany and france and spain and and uh south korea and i mean they have high speed rail all over the place tens of thousands of kilometers of high-speed rail and the united states has zero and and and they remember they tried to do that one from frisco to la the corruption and criminality and incompetence was so bad they just sucked all the money out and there&#x27;s nothing built that was criminal that really was jerry brown&#x27;s uh i don&#x27;t know what you would call it but uh and you see the fires in california you realize how incompetent they&#x27;ve been managing the forest too i don&#x27;t know where we&#x27;re headed with all of this well i think there&#x27;s this rising tide of incompetence which sinks all boats that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening yes it does but you know at the same time what do you think about like uh somebody like you or me out there who makes a another kind of youtube is that possible absolutely slippery slope right we don&#x27;t have to be going down this slippery slope we can you know you got brighton you got shoot you got all these others popping up and you know and uh yeah i think i mean eventually we&#x27;re i mean you&#x27;re kind of getting a bifurcation in the population maybe intelligence there&#x27;s only so much intelligence in the universe and so there&#x27;s a small group of people that are kind of slowly growing getting smarter and the rest of the population seems to be it seems to be draining out of them and they&#x27;re just becoming television watching droids that believe what they&#x27;re told i mean i live in boulder right so outside of boulder so i go into town and you know there&#x27;s all these people driving around in their air-conditioning cars with their face mouse though i mean or they&#x27;re or you see them hiking out here in the woods right all by themselves with their dog and their face mask is out i mean i mean that&#x27;s a level of i don&#x27;t know what you call it something missing up here yeah i see that too i saw a woman riding her bike your face mask on all alone out in the country i was like what in the world are you doing lady you&#x27;re gonna die of hypoxia so um yeah so i yeah i think you&#x27;re right i think the world is um is bifurcating and actually nostradamus talked about that one of his claw trains that around this time the world would turn into two different humans one would be really highly advanced and the other would be a flatline kind of description and i think that&#x27;s what i see and um and i think that the people who are the most fearful are now our leaders i i don&#x27;t necessarily mean trump but the governors and some of the mayors seem like they&#x27;re so afraid and and it&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t understand herd immunity or that the way that everything they&#x27;re doing backwards is what i&#x27;m saying yeah they i think they&#x27;ve started to believe their their own propaganda machine is basically turned them into droids themselves incapable of really understanding anything it&#x27;s like the guys they were doing the you know a night uh you know the the false positives right yes they didn&#x27;t they didn&#x27;t understand that the false positives applies to every test that&#x27;s given to the people not the people that test positives so if like there&#x27;s you know ten thousand people test positives well it&#x27;s a ninety percent false positive no that&#x27;s not no it&#x27;s not that&#x27;s you know whatever it&#x27;s a ten percent false positive only ten percent of the people know ninety percent of the people who tested positive are don&#x27;t have it and so they don&#x27;t they don&#x27;t look at that they don&#x27;t look at it&#x27;s from the people so they just but that&#x27;s just simple stuff but that&#x27;s everywhere in everything whether it&#x27;s you know managing the forest or understanding the very basic simplistic uh you know concepts of science or statistics or anything else they they become you know they&#x27;re they&#x27;re like zombieoids too or flat brainers or something right and i think that the the smart people have been watching this whole covet thing and going you know hey wait a minute i remember last month you said that mass were no good and now you&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re good and hey i remember the cdc saying that it was topical you touch it on the surface and get it then they said it wasn&#x27;t then they said it was and i know i heard it i know i heard it and then the who did the same thing they and and they think that they think we&#x27;re not listening but some of us are and then what&#x27;s that what&#x27;s caused that what has caused now to happen is that now i personally and i think all my friends are absolutely rejecting the experts on everything not just yeah it&#x27;s like it reminds me of a cross between 1984 and idiocracy yeah yeah oh god how awful the worst marriage ever yes um yeah so yeah i don&#x27;t know where we&#x27;re headed with all of this but um i think that in the end um we&#x27;re going to look back at this and oppose border and go oh my god what should we do ourselves and uh maybe we really do have to move into the um what was the uh the uh on ron book where the all the intelligent people left and went to the mountains in colorado and oh yeah yeah yeah it&#x27;s just yeah it&#x27;s not but that&#x27;s you know there&#x27;s the potential here i mean some places i think they&#x27;re going to break out in the high-tech world i mean we have so much technology that could be applied that isn&#x27;t being applied that exists and i mean my moxie stuff is just one of a whole dozens of likes sort of quasi-suppressed technologies that if applied would advance human society but you have to have humans with the cognitive capacity to understand and be aware and and and put it together and and that&#x27;s just you know maybe you know maybe happen here in the states but it may happen in places like in east asia that&#x27;s what i would say is going to happen is east of vietnam or someplace like that cambodia some place where there isn&#x27;t an open overarching power structure and they&#x27;re poor enough that they need it i think that&#x27;s exactly where it&#x27;ll happen maybe that&#x27;s where you should go with your moxie stuff the weather is smart man they got really high iqs and they can apply things you know you look at south korea and japan and china you know they&#x27;ve uh yeah they&#x27;ve kind of left the us in the dust yeah every way educationally uh and all the stem work uh we&#x27;re just getting left behind and we we and we invent a lot of it too so it&#x27;s kind of weird to see us we will make a great invention but the nobody here in america perfects the invention but the chinese and the east asians all okay thank you very much we&#x27;ll do we&#x27;ll take it yeah we become like the soviet union because that&#x27;s what happened in the soviet union i mean they had all these brilliant scientists that made all kinds of amazing discoveries but there was no way to implement them they just ended up on a shelf gathering dust and you know but eventually the whole that but that&#x27;s because the communists the soviet comcom system couldn&#x27;t technologically innovate because you have to do that your your economy will collapse that&#x27;s the whole marxian thing so ironically the soviet union collapsed due to the marxian death spiral right whereas the communists that communist ccp right communist chinese party they they they&#x27;re chinese right if they&#x27;re smarter than that so what they did is they made sure that technological development would be implemented in their society and so now they&#x27;re this advanced prosperous society and even though they&#x27;re quote communists whereas well look at the us i mean we have this crony capitalist whatever you call it but they&#x27;re just a bunch of thieving&#x27;s well anyway i will say that word online but uh they and so they basically created a thing where they have these giant corporations which basically stifle innovation and uh and so there&#x27;s no innovation into the productive capacity so it doesn&#x27;t develop that&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t have an electronics industry because they can&#x27;t they can&#x27;t actually innovate they can&#x27;t let because it&#x27;s so corrupt they can&#x27;t allow innovations or or should i say the 737 max the f-35 the uss ron uh ronald reagan or the the uh you know whatever else the littoral fighter failures oh you&#x27;re like the hummer right this is this is the whole thing they got this new they were the new hummer right so they got this new hummer it&#x27;s going to be the greatest thing ever they started running them off the production line then they put the weapons package on it and it warped the frame so much they couldn&#x27;t open and close the doors i mean and you just see that everywhere and that&#x27;s why you know look at the where&#x27;s the you know like guys like musk right elon musk he had the the his spacex and they produced the product and it got there at a fraction they got boeing trying to make whatever that thing is that they&#x27;re making complete failure completely yeah and they can never do that because their whole the culture of competency is gone and it&#x27;s all politically correct now and so exactly honestly i have a friend who&#x27;s an engineer at boeing and he&#x27;s now he he&#x27;s he&#x27;s had it he&#x27;s only 52 and he&#x27;s retiring and i i called him up i said so i was mocking him for the for the boeing 737 max and and i said so you guys have kind of lost your touch there and he said um says no no it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s that we&#x27;re not choosing good engineers anymore we&#x27;re choosing peoples by their skin color and their sex and sometimes they don&#x27;t even know what they&#x27;re doing and there&#x27;s nothing we can do about it he said he said the software for that uh airplane is so screwed up he doesn&#x27;t know if they can ever fix it and he gave up because i don&#x27;t want anything to do with it i&#x27;m retiring and so all the old guard is leaving now boeing and boeing you&#x27;re in trouble i hate to say it but what i hear on the inside i&#x27;d sell my stock yeah that&#x27;s yeah so i think there was some old some of those old engineer guys they were putting out tweets anonymously and they said like the 737 max you said it was uh designed by clowns we were supervised by monkeys i&#x27;m telling you i&#x27;m not flying it not ever i guess yeah i mean i think we&#x27;re going to lose the air industry just as they&#x27;ve lost electronics completely they&#x27;re going to lose i mean what will the united states have i mean the only thing that holds this place together is the dollar being the world trading currency you know the military backing it up and as long as that happens they can force other countries to buy dollars and give us free stuff right that&#x27;s what&#x27;s propping it up when that goes the dollar larimbi the chinese are going to becomes whatever when that the day that the dollar is no longer the world trading currency this country is toast that&#x27;s soon because it&#x27;s going to be digital there&#x27;s already talk about it in like financial times there&#x27;s articles about how they&#x27;re going to do the digital transition and how the dollar will not be the currency anymore and there&#x27;ll be a whole new world currency and actually all you have to really do to push that over is bazel&#x27;s just needs to create an amazon dollar a bitcoin for amazon and that&#x27;s right trade it in for amazon points yeah yeah i mean you&#x27;re in baby i mean everybody&#x27;s going to be in [Music] amazon oh man don&#x27;t get me going on jeff bezos [Laughter] well that&#x27;s kind of the way it goes i mean that&#x27;s one of those things that&#x27;s one of those natural monopolies that happens i mean who&#x27;s ever in there first and grows there first just kind of gets so big it runs it it&#x27;s the same with alibaba and china right they get on there first they grow it and uh and then you know how are you gonna yeah it&#x27;s just one of those natural monopolies or or initial monopolies or one of those things well if you look at the covid uh 19 virus and you say cui bono you&#x27;ve got to say well before you say event 201 exactly oh gee you&#x27;re gonna you know that&#x27;s just like anything like when you know 9 11 they were doing simulations of planes running in and then remember the london bombing 7 7 oh we were running the stimulation the bombings in exactly the places that the bombings happened what a coincidence and then they come out you know with this two event 201 about this coronavirus that&#x27;s going to get come out and cause all these problems at the very same time the crota virus was being released somewhere you know oh wow what a coincidence yeah yeah i&#x27;m afraid to say it but uh it&#x27;s not a coincidence it&#x27;s part of a long-term plan it&#x27;s going to go from now till 2030. it&#x27;s all about agenda 2030 and um they&#x27;re going to be implementing all sorts of things that are that are going to be sneaky and nasty changing our genome screwing with our kids designer babies the whole thing is coming down on us like uh and we&#x27;re literally being run by the technocrats not by politicians not by the military a bunch of guys that we don&#x27;t even know their names are making all of our future decisions for us right now yeah but but you know there is hope there because if you look back remember that a new american century plan they had back there at the beginning of the century where they were going to capture all the oil in the middle east and caspian basin and then they would rule the world since they controlled all the oil well that didn&#x27;t really work out so i suspect that 20 30 won&#x27;t work out quite the way they plan either i would totally agree with that that&#x27;s one of the reasons i keep talking about it because i know that you keep everybody informed about it then pretty soon they yeah you know what we&#x27;re not going down that road the same thing with the whole peanuck i mean they were starting all the wars and you know i was doing everything i can to tell everybody in the world about these crazy neocons and what they were doing right and they&#x27;re still at work they&#x27;re still trying to get wars going everywhere so yeah but you know they they kind of blew they yeah they kind of destroyed but if you look at like the status of america the united states you know at the beginning of the century and where it is now i mean they basically they&#x27;ve killed the goose that laid the golden egg and they&#x27;re still killing the goose that laid the golden egg i guess they&#x27;re maybe they&#x27;re beating a dead horse now but and so that&#x27;s just why i don&#x27;t see them succeeding they&#x27;re missing they&#x27;re missing certain logic functions in their brains that can&#x27;t really understand cause and effect beyond you know they just think that they can make history of like we make the history right and you know that that sense whatever i want to do whatever i believe is truth and reality well no there&#x27;s a bigger reality and a bigger truth out there and it doesn&#x27;t care what you think or believe and if you get you know it&#x27;s like laws of nature yeah there&#x27;s not a cop out there that&#x27;s going to pull you over but uh you know if you break one you will pay the consequence yeah well also should be noted and a lot of people don&#x27;t under know this but a lot of those neocons were actually former leftists um they were leftists of heavy leftists marxists in college um some were uh red diaper babies yeah earth were dialed marxists and uh so it&#x27;s just strange that the neocons that wrecked our country all just happen to also have been in their youth you know extremely left-leaning leftists so i just wondering about them it&#x27;s all just pondering with what they&#x27;re really about and they have disappeared yeah look at antifa i mean antifa is like an anti-fascist fascist organization right whatever and all these leftists now there was real leftists like gore vidal and dean henderson&#x27;s out there and these guys but you know the real left just the old guys back there i mean they were for free speech right oh yeah sponsorship free speech they&#x27;re anti-war yeah they&#x27;re like uh corporate consolidation they were all those they were all those things these quote fake leftists today and even some of those fake red baby diapers no they&#x27;re there for more censorship they&#x27;re for more control they&#x27;re for more consolidation they&#x27;re for more money in their pocket and you know and maybe they&#x27;ve always been that way so i think yeah but sometimes you know when people try to make simplistic things by making it left and right maybe even though it&#x27;s a little more complicated than that it&#x27;s a lot more complicated than that i would say that the only thing that i note now that is uh troubling with the left and it actually used to be with the right when i was younger is that the left has become more akin to a religion where you can&#x27;t break any of their you know you can&#x27;t be a heretic you say something like you even begin to question like i have left as friends and i say you know it&#x27;s weird because the average temperature for where i grew up is exactly the same now as it was 50 years ago and they lose their there&#x27;s loses like i told a christian that jesus really didn&#x27;t exist you know they just lose it and i wonder why they why they lose it so much and why they they have a set of rules that you can&#x27;t break i think that&#x27;s why everybody is mad at them right now at the lab you know actually the liberal brain or the even the christian fundamentalist brain if you put it under the electrodes or you know mars it actually functions differently it does like a normal person&#x27;s brain or a traditional human that lives in the environment they actually you know they had this one test they could tell with 98 certainty whether the person is a liberal or what they call a conservative but that&#x27;s actually more like a traditional person right and so that&#x27;s so yeah that&#x27;s never they&#x27;ve never found it actually in a traditional society that liberal mentality that liberal brain function that they see because usually like most people just for the audience out there you know you have you know when you&#x27;re running full your cognitive buildings are running and then like if something you there&#x27;s a tiger jumps out right then your amygdalas will click back to the fight and flight response and everything goes on there well and then you know when it&#x27;s gone it&#x27;ll click back up and it&#x27;ll everything run on their frontal lobes and stuff like that well liberals are different it goes to the left and and anterior cortex and then and then it goes out to the rest of the brain and and so it&#x27;s totally a left singular cortex and it&#x27;s in that&#x27;s in a mammal center in the brain an emotional center in the mammal brain and so it&#x27;s basically like a slave mind what will the master think and so and so it keeps going there and it doesn&#x27;t matter if there&#x27;s like that&#x27;s why the liberals they test is basically liberals lost the ability for the disgust response so you could like have a big poo in front of them or a big you know rotting body with maggots on it you know a normal person like whoa and you get the fight and flight response we&#x27;re liberals that&#x27;s very it&#x27;s very little really very little and you can see it on the things and so they don&#x27;t have a discuss response it&#x27;s gone and that&#x27;s probably why they did put up with a lot of disgusting things it was really interesting because i remember a test about five years ago and what they did is they had took five liberal people and five conservative people and then they did things to them all right one of the things they one of the things they did was they had the liberal go in to a bathroom a public bathroom that where the toilet was filled all the way up with you know excretement and then you know did you see anything you know in there and that you that made you disgusted and they go no no just flush the toilet you know sat down and then the conservative would go in there and he would come out oh my god the irresponsible person that was it was funny as hell and uh so you&#x27;re right there is a different kind of disgust response between people there&#x27;s no doubt about it and this brings up a question you know not only can that test like tell liberals and versus traditionals right but it can also identify psychopaths and everything so we have a test today that we could give to any politician any corporate head any police officer or any lawyer any judge anything we could put them in there you could put it on and you would know with you know 98 accuracy whether they&#x27;re a psychopath or a sociopath or a liberal well that&#x27;s just kind of like a sociopath and you know or a traditional functional mind so i mean we have that capacity today we could get rid of psychopaths in power and well of course there wouldn&#x27;t be any congressman left but we could do it i would think that would be a really good good thing to do having dealt with psychopaths in my whole life i&#x27;m really up to here with them so they really have it&#x27;s like a helmet or something they put it on they read the brainwaves the nmr the magnetic uh mris or they actually have the ones where they put the little things on them they just flash things we were actually working on an app for it because what we could do is we could like you could facetime somebody while they&#x27;re watching there would be like a thing of poo at flash on subliminal right right you couldn&#x27;t see it consciously but your subconscious could and then we&#x27;d measure like the dilation of your pupils and they they have a new thing now or they uh there&#x27;s a lot of chromosomal damage that you can&#x27;t really detect but you can see it in the faces but nobody is an expert at that right so they actually develop a computer program which can detect with like something like 97 or 99 accuracy these chromochromal uh damage that&#x27;s actually reflected in the face so you just take that with a little bit of this and you can just facetime somebody and you know within you know 30 seconds whether you&#x27;re talking to a psychopath or that so but we never got the app done so if somebody&#x27;s out there wanting to build that app you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s still available should be mandatory test that&#x27;s for sure for anybody that runs a corporation or anybody that&#x27;s a politician well ken it&#x27;s been really good talking to you uh thanks for coming on i want to remind everybody that he makes this great stuff purple power c60 take it and get your aging to reverse and um give it to your pets too because you want to keep pets around yeah it&#x27;s cause c60 purplepower.com that&#x27;ll go to our site we&#x27;re also on that app i&#x27;ll put that up on the link too yeah we&#x27;ll get a link and uh yeah so yeah it&#x27;s great being on and uh i&#x27;d like to have you on again yeah we&#x27;d like to yeah they&#x27;d like to do a tour of the valley sometime with the all the you can only get christopher o&#x27;brien to come back out and visit he&#x27;s he&#x27;s uh he would be out here but the cove is stopping it um but i think he&#x27;s coming out soon i think and he&#x27;s got that equipment that he&#x27;s got set up and i think he needs to check it but yeah we should do like a little reality check where i go around the valley showing all the weird oh yeah i did that once it was great there&#x27;s just so that valley has more um weird amazing things in it than i think anywhere else in the world yeah well you have any opinion why what the what that is about well part of it&#x27;s the the earth&#x27;s crust is ripping i mean you&#x27;re sitting on top of a big rip in the earth&#x27;s crust and then the the sediments from you know the mountains have filled it up but there&#x27;s there&#x27;s no nothing between you and you know the mantle just straight on down below where you&#x27;re at that explains a lot that explains an awful lot yeah um yeah so it&#x27;s the san luis valley case you don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re talking about the highest biggest valley in north america and one of the highest biggest valleys in the world and it&#x27;s in southern colorado northern new mexico it&#x27;s like a bowl with the san juans on the west side and the sangre de cristo mountains on the east side and it is spook-a-rama for sure all right ken great talking to you thanks so much thank you</p>
