            <p>Welcome to the official YouTube channel for the Colin Coward podcast. Go on, hit that subscribe button if you&#x27;re new so you don&#x27;t miss any of our great football content this season. Today&#x27;s guest on the pod is Dan Farah. Dan&#x27;s the director and producer of Age of Disclosure. It&#x27;s currently on Prime Video.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#x27;s the number one movie on Prime. And if you look at their lineup, uh, that&#x27;s pretty heady stuff. Uh, Dan Farah has made a movie that has altered my perception of intelligence beyond our borders and beyond our capabilities. And when I watched Age of Disclosure, um, and I&#x27;m not as cynical today as I was 20 years ago, and a lot of that&#x27;s because of videos of craft and technology that we&#x27;re clearly not capable of. And so I thought I want to spend an hour with Dan Farah.</p>
<p>And many of you have seen it. Probably many more of you will see it. And so let&#x27;s start our interview. For those of you who have been cynical, u age of disclosure, it took I read three years to produce this. 34 senior intelligence officials, astrophysicists, uh, pilots, people who have been biologically affected.</p>
<p>I have to start with this, Dan. over the course of your production of this. This this is um this is really um a lifetime work. I mean, this is something you&#x27;re obviously proud of. Um when was the moment, maybe it was an interview um I certainly know I had a couple during the documentary.</p>
<p>When was a moment kind of a jaw-dropper or a just got real? I am hearing things that even I you may have questioned or been a bit cynical about. Did you have one of those aha moments? &gt;&gt; Well, for me it was when I started to get access at a high level to intelligence officials, military officials, government officials, and got an audience with them in private before I interviewed them. private conversations, phones off, &gt;&gt; real honest, grounded conversations about the reality of this. For me, the eye open the first eyeopening experience was realizing that all these people who have mostly no relationship at all um and are ideologically opposed, you know, they all have different world views, they all have different political beliefs, they all have different social beliefs, they were all saying the same thing. And it was super eye opening to me right off the bat in those first few weeks of, you know, going to DC and and getting these these private meetings.</p>
<p>It it it it was it was shocking how lined up they all were on these big truths that have been hidden from the public. And they were also all lined up on why they haven&#x27;t spoken about it so far. So there&#x27;s this line that they can&#x27;t cross, right? There&#x27;s classified information that none of these people ever reveal, but there&#x27;s a lot that they can lawfully disclose. And for decades, people with that information have just been discouraged from sharing it publicly uh in through through v through for various reasons. Um you know, threats to their career, threats to their reputation.</p>
<p>Some people feared it would cost them their life. Um and they just decided it was best to keep silent about it. And and as I had these conversations with them, I realized that the only way to get these kind of people to speak up with what they lawfully could would be to give them the platform to do it arm in arm, you know, to have numbers for them all to, you know, you know, step up and and speak their truth together and and to do it in &gt;&gt; a film that is assuring them, hey, you&#x27;re not going to be inner cut with some knucklehead, you who&#x27;s just cool casting or has like an interesting opinion. It&#x27;s only going to be I will only interview people who have direct knowledge of this topic as a result of working for the US government. And I&#x27;ll put you all on the same film together.</p>
<p>You can have safety and numbers. There&#x27;ll be dozens of you that and that that was the solution to to to the problem. But, you know, again, the eye opening thing for me was just how in sync all of these people were, you know, regardless of their political opinion, regardless of their, you know, ideologies, like they were all in sync on the reality of the situation. And that just didn&#x27;t, you know, that&#x27;s eye opening. &gt;&gt; So, let&#x27;s talk about the retrieval program.</p>
<p>Um, because that&#x27;s not something that happened over the last year or two. That is 40, 50 plus years. Russia &gt;&gt; 80 years &gt;&gt; 80 years 80 years total. &gt;&gt; Um and for the uninitiated the people who have not seen this and I figure between 30 and 50% of my audience have and and you know 60 to 50 something thereabouts haven&#x27;t the explain what the retrieval program is that&#x27;s been going on for 80 years because we&#x27;ll make that our starting point. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So look, the biggest headline of what&#x27;s revealed in this film is that the existence of non-human intelligent life, intelligent life that is not human, has been covered up for 80 years. And on top of that, there has been a deeply hidden program within our government system and our military system that has been capturing and retrieving crashed UAP, formerly known as UFOs, right? And been doing so for 80 years. And they have been actively working behind the scenes to figure out how to reverse engineer this technology. Meaning how to recreate it, right? This technology that does things that we don&#x27;t have the current ability to do &gt;&gt; and they are trying to figure out how it works so that we can use that technology. That is the simplest way to say it.</p>
<p>Now, people in my film reveal that this program has been operating for 80 years &gt;&gt; outside of congressional oversight, meaning it&#x27;s been hidden from Congress. The people we elect to oversee how our tax dollars are spent, how our country is run, right? This program is operating outside of their oversight. People in the film also reveal that the program has even been operating outside of the oversight of the president of the United States, meaning the public, Congress, and the White House are out of the loop, right? And a number of the people in my film feel like that needs to change because we are now in a very heightened highstakes cold war technology race with China because they have the same set of circumstances. They have also been retrieving these crashed UAP UFOs &gt;&gt; and our intelligence tells us that. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And that that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what the people in my film reveal that China has a very active program and so does Russia. Uh the biggest concern is China specifically, but China and Russia have programs and this is a technology race and people in my film refer to it as the Manhattan Project on steroids. You know, the atomic race, right? &gt;&gt; Sure. And and so people in my film feel like it&#x27;s important for this all to come out of the shadows and the base facts to be known so that the US can put more resources towards it. You know, government only puts resources towards what the public demands resources or put towards.</p>
<p>Right? You know, &gt;&gt; right? Right. &gt;&gt; After 9/11, average person in America was like, &quot;Hey, we got to put more money towards counterterrorism, right? We need more, you know, going on here to fight this stuff.&quot; And so what happened? We put tons of resources, funding towards it. The the position of the director of national intelligence was created to make sure the intelligence community was sharing more information so we could avoid an intelligence failure like 911 happening again. And so what the people in my film are essentially saying is, hey, let&#x27;s not wait till something bad happens on this front. Let&#x27;s let&#x27;s make the public aware of the base facts of the situation so that the right amount of resources can be put towards it so people can learn the average person can learn what&#x27;s happening and can make their voice heard to their elected representatives and say hey take this more seriously put the right resources towards this and that that&#x27;s really why they&#x27;re speaking up about this secret program.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve had [music] repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities and it&#x27;s [music] not ours. &gt;&gt; These are other worldly things that are performing maneuvers that have haven&#x27;t been seen. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a whole fleet of them. &gt;&gt; I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings. &gt;&gt; This is so secret.</p>
<p>There have been very few people in our entire government that have been allowed or provided access to it. &gt;&gt; Even presidents have been operating [music] on a need to- know basis. But that begins to ramp out of control. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not [music] acceptable to have secret parts of government that no one ever sees. [music] &gt;&gt; People have been hurt protecting and hiding this information.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Some people claimed it would cost them their lives if they spoke out about these things. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You had information being locked away that could change the trajectory [music] for species. [music] [music] This is the biggest discovery in human history. [music] So um and in terms of technology there are things that China is ahead of us. Electric vehicles some would say 5G um I would say um high-speed rail you could argue that China is are equal space technology is again They feel like I feel like they&#x27;re in our class.</p>
<p>And so as I watched the Tic Tac, that video that came, you know, from the Pentagon, New York Times, I remember opening the paper and thinking, WTF, what is going on? My first thought is China&#x27;s ahead of us. Now, there are things there are economic metrics, Dan, that they&#x27;re not. um and their form of government I don&#x27;t think is obviously not as progressive but there are things that they are ahead of us and I thought you know what they have cracked the code of reverse engineering that&#x27;s why and they may have done it decades ago because if they can activate and deactivate nuclear you know um base weapons why wouldn&#x27;t they blow us up why wouldn&#x27;t they sow doubt and chaos us. Why would they do this covertly? So, are are there anybody in our 34 insiders that you talk to that think maybe a big part of this is China beating us to the race, not wanting to start World War II, but if they can deactivate nuclear sites, which has been discussed and has happened, they&#x27;re testing stuff and they&#x27;re simply ahead of us. They don&#x27;t want to start war, but they want to end it and control us.</p>
<p>Is that possible? &gt;&gt; Well, look, anything&#x27;s obviously possible, but the the the people I interviewed made it clear that this highstakes race with China is a very close race. And you know, Senator Rounds from South Dakota, who&#x27;s a very senior guy in the US Senate, he says in the film, he says, you know, do you do you think that Putin and she would hesitate for even a second to use this technology for their global domination if they didn&#x27;t think we, the US, had access to the same technology? And that was a really bombshell line in the film and a big statement by him because it sheds light on how real this technology race is. Both both countries have made progress clearly and and you know there&#x27;s a general belief though that we would benefit from general belief amongst the people I interviewed that we would benefit as a nation if the base facts were made public and and the analogy a lot of these guys made with me is you know when we entered the space race Kennedy gave that big famous you know rally speech where he said you know we&#x27;re we are determined to win this race and he speaks about the space technology he says space technology is like nuclear technology. It has no conscious of its own. It&#x27;s up to mankind to either use that technology for good or for bad, for peace or for war.</p>
<p>Right? And his whole point was he wanted the US to lead the way in the space race so that the US could make sure that technology is used for the better betterment of mankind and not for war. And it&#x27;s the same situation here. And and I I don&#x27;t think and a lot of people I&#x27;ve interviewed have made it clear to me that they don&#x27;t think we would have won the space race if that speech hadn&#x27;t happened and made it clear to the public that this was a real thing. Because what happened as a result of that is people in the scientific community and people in academia could say to themselves, hey, I can put my brain power towards this. I can help the US win, right? Um they, you know, they can apply themselves to that to that effort.</p>
<p>Whereas now this situation is so hidden in secrecy. The average scientist, the average person at, you know, at, you know, academia, these like, you know, super smart people that are at MIT and all these fancy schools, they don&#x27;t even know this is real, right? And and obviously they can&#x27;t help us win this race if they don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s real, you know, &gt;&gt; right? And that&#x27;s another reason for the age of disclosure. People are pressing this this the Manhattan Project. Um, of course there were, I think, uh, 130,000 people involved. UK, Canada, the United States, the Manhattan Project, it was, you know, the nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do we have a sense between the number of people, 130,000 people in America as a large corporation? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But given the time of the Manhattan Project, um, it&#x27;s a remarkable number of people working on something covertly. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do we have any idea that the the the volume, Dan, the number of people between defense contractors, CIA, Air Force, intelligent officials? Um what is the number? We&#x27;re talking about the people that have knowledge and that are working on retrieval programs and advancement of devices and craft.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is this is one of the one of the fascinating thoughts like I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve been told off the record that this is not a small program that this is thousands of people employed full-time and and that it&#x27;s been the case for 80 years and and I&#x27;ve been told that the overall budget of this situation is closer to a trillion dollars. this is billions a year for 80 years and yeah &gt;&gt; to people who focus on this every single day and every time I&#x27;ve thought about that um &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really a head scratcher cuz what what it leads you to is you know the guy you&#x27;re sitting next to on the bleachers at your kids&#x27;s little league baseball game you know he might have just spent his day working on this stuff and you think he is you know a UPS driver you know or like you know the the the family across from you at the local pizza place the dad might be dealing with non-human technology all day in this high stakes race and his family doesn&#x27;t know about it, his neighbors don&#x27;t know about it and you don&#x27;t know about it. These are normal people who are living amongst us who have the job of dealing with this, you know, and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a pretty remarkable thought. Um, but it was the case with the Manhattan Project, too. Like you said, lots of people going to work every day working on this atomic race.</p>
<p>You know, the stakes were the the f the future of humanity back then, whether it was going to help us win World War II or not. And they were dealing with this. They were falling asleep with that on their shoulders. And their neighbors had no clue. their family had no clue, you know.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;ve been we as a as a country, we&#x27;ve been in a situation like this before, but this is this is the biggest version of it yet by far. &gt;&gt; Um the first pop moment for me watching this when um I I really sat back I watched it twice uh and then I&#x27;ve watched several interviews was when you went and it was senior officials, highly credible people, many retired. you went to Missoula or Missouri or uh California, you went to bases, had great, &gt;&gt; it was really like Google Maps. You went in and zoned in on these bases and told stories. &gt;&gt; And these were people that were older.</p>
<p>Um there were they were not hyperbolic. They they they almost felt as if they were ashamed they hadn&#x27;t told the story earlier. They were they were that&#x27;s what it felt like to me. They felt like listen I&#x27;m telling you the story. I mean what in the world could it have been? I didn&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>They felt guilty for not telling it earlier. &gt;&gt; Of all those base stories and there&#x27;s four or five you illustrate and and it&#x27;s really worth watching for that fiveminute part of the documentary. Which one to you? I mean, because they all felt so real and there&#x27;s no reason at this point, you&#x27;re retired &gt;&gt; to um &gt;&gt; you know, add libit or disclose information that&#x27;s not &gt;&gt; forthright and honest. &gt;&gt; Which one of those base experiences to you, &gt;&gt; is there one you still think about or one that had the most impact to you? &gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. 100%.</p>
<p>One one really stands out to me. But first, I&#x27;ll tell you, look, you you you interview people every day. this film. Um, this was the first documentary I directed and the first time I conducted interviews, right? And [laughter] and and I I really truly felt it when they when they were sharing their truths and their experiences. I felt like these people were just getting a weight off their shoulder and and like relieved to finally talk about it, right? Like they wanted the world to know the truth.</p>
<p>They felt deserve the world deserve to know the truth. Um so the activity at bases, UAP bases, um the UAP activity over military bases, it&#x27;s not just military bases, it&#x27;s also our nuclear weapons sites and and it&#x27;s active. It&#x27;s an ongoing issue. And I interviewed a number of um military officials who experienced events that happened in our classified airspace over military bases. And one that really stands out took place at Vanderberg Air Force Base.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m in Los Angeles right now as I talk to you. just up the coast like two hours is Vanderber right around Santa Barbara area and I interviewed a Air Force security guard whose job at the time was to guard nuclear weapons like a guy we clearly trust right like not a not a crazy person like someone put in a in a very trusted position and he was amongst it was five or six other Air Force security guards at the time they saw a light coming off the coast the Pacific coast towards the base at first they thought it was an airplane that was flying towards them. They just saw a single light and then as it got closer the light went away and what came into view was a giant what they described as a giant craft the size of a football field. He puts his arms out like this and says it was the size of a football field. It was rectangular.</p>
<p>It was matte black, no lights, no visible means of propulsion, and it was just there. And it came over the base, over their heads, and it hovered over their heads. And they said they just looked up in awe and shock at this extraordinary thing that just defied everything they knew about reality. And then it shot off at thousands of miles an hour. Obviously, you know, mankind has never made a craft the size of a football field that could fly with no propulsion system and no lights and then shoot off at thousands of miles an hour.</p>
<p>And you know, hearing hearing this this this person tell this story was extraordinary. Uh he had never spoken up publicly about it. This was his first time going public after decade. um um he he had no desire previously to talk about it, but when he learned about, you know, who was speaking up in this film and revealing the truth, he felt like it was important for him to to to join that and and share his truth. But what was also extraordinary on top of that is after talking to him, I talked to other um Air Force security guards that were on the base that day and they all told the same thing.</p>
<p>They all had the same story from different perspectives. And then a couple of them actually slipped me the police report, the Air Force security police report that had the details in it. And it&#x27;s a real situation that actually happened. And that is extraordinary. The idea that there are human beings out out there in our country that have had these experiences, you know, and I and I and I, you know, I was talking about this with with Joe Rogan last week.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll ask you like think about like put yourself in the shoes of this guy. What like what would your reaction be? You look up and you see a UFO the size of a football field just above you and it takes off thousands of miles an hour. It&#x27;s you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s so insane and such a like uh departure from what we know to you know be reality right um it&#x27;s got to just forever change you and I think these people who have these experiences I think they are forever changed by them.

Well, I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve told my audience this, I think, once before.</p>
<p>Um, I had an experience years ago. Um, I was in college. I was in a car. Um um I believe it was a AMC Pacer my dad had got from his friend who was a car dealer &gt;&gt; and I had driven from college with Mark Fischer who was my friend and we uh were in a very rural area in Gland Washington &gt;&gt; and we pulled up to my house which had a long driveway and I had a Frank Lloyd Wright house. I&#x27;ve told this once or twice before.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, and I saw a light above the house and it it was a very rural road. So I Mark was sleeping and I said, &quot;Hey, dude, look. What is that?&quot; It was very small, hovering right over our house. Multiple lights. And as I pulled up our driveway, it shot out and up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And I went, &quot;Okay, I&#x27;m going to take Mark home.&quot; I did. I came back. I came and my mom, she was up actually because I&#x27;d driven from college and she wanted to make sure I was safe. I said, &quot;Did you hear anything?&quot; She goes, she was British.</p>
<p>No, darling. I didn&#x27;t hear anything. I said, &quot;Nothing, a humming, anything.&quot; So, I always chocked it up. Um, my town was small. We We didn&#x27;t have helicopters in my town.</p>
<p>Um, it wasn&#x27;t a small plane because it hovered and then went out and up. Um, and it was I was thinking as I was taking the train in Chicago, I&#x27;m in LA some, but Chicago more. And I was thinking I&#x27;m not going to waste his time with the story, but now we can, you know, kind of segue to it as as you know, you there have been Aaron Rogers has talked about this, Baker Mayfield, who I, you know, I I didn&#x27;t chide, but I sort of poked fun at him. I said, I don&#x27;t want my quarterbacks talking UFOs, right? This is an adult position. But the truth is a lot of people who have nothing to gain from it have had these experiences.</p>
<p>What I thought was really fascinating is the negative biological effects of people you interviewed of your 34 in senior intelligence officials who have come in contact with not only craft &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; but um I guess I would say lack of a better word aliens. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That have had very negative physical biological effects. take our audience there because that to me again to say that publicly to say it privately at a party is one thing.</p>
<p>To say it publicly um is mind-blowing to me. I don&#x27;t remember anybody of that level ever saying that publicly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, one of the big reveals that came out making this doc is that intelligence officials, military officials who have encountered UAP, UFOs, um, have had biological effects, meaning being getting too close to this technology has negatively impacted them, uh, their health, their bodies, in some cases caused cancer.</p>
<p>And, um, you know, it it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s understandable because this is a technology that we don&#x27;t fully understand and it&#x27;s extremely powerful and it gives off a lot of energy. So the analogy is like, hey, if you didn&#x27;t know what an F-16 was and you went and stood behind it when it was taking off, you&#x27;re going to get effed up, you know, like it&#x27;s not great. &gt;&gt; And and so, you know, I think what we&#x27;re learning is that this technology um is far outside our understanding in every way. And and yes, there&#x27;s been a number of of of intelligent officials and mil military officials who have had severe health issues and and some people have have passed away from cancer that they got by being too close to UFOs and and that&#x27;s a darker part of this whole truth that is coming out now and it is shocking. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh Dan Farah is joining us director and producer age of disclosure. What has been interesting is since you have done this uh documentary, there&#x27;s been other pieces of video that have run even on the network nightly news. &gt;&gt; One in particular is what appears to be a UAP. I think it&#x27;s Yemen. And we fire at it and the missile or the shot goes through it, bounces through it, which based on the bubble wrap theory in your documentary is explainable.</p>
<p>So, the nightly news couldn&#x27;t explain it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I want you to talk about the two physicists that talked about the bubble wrap theory because I have seen and many people who have seen these UAPs. There is a um um almost a muted look like they&#x27;re inside something. And if you could let&#x27;s talk about the bubble wrap theory.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about a 3 to five minute discussion. And it really I I to me it was a pivotal moment because a lot of these things look different. The ones I&#x27;ve always struggled with is the ones that appear to have a circular um device or a shield around them and it was described by your physicists. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So over the years there&#x27;s been a lot of uh flight performance characteristics that have been observed.</p>
<p>When people see UAP, they see them doing these these these these performance characteristics that defy physics as we know it, right? And a couple of the very senior scientists that I interviewed who worked on classified UAP programs for the US government, they reveal in the film that they have figured out how this technology works, how these UAP are are doing what they&#x27;re doing. And simply put, these craft are generating a significant amount of energy and they are creating a they&#x27;re essentially warping space time, which sounds like something out of a science fiction movie. I understand that. But they are saying what these scientists reveal is that they are warping spaceime in a localized area and they&#x27;re creating a bubble around the craft. And essentially the simplest way to say it is that bubble creates a barrier between the cra the environment the craft is in and our environment.</p>
<p>So the laws that you know define what you can do you know with you know what physics allows you to do in our environment are no longer applicable right? So what happens in that bubble is completely different than what happens outside the bubble. So they might be moving along having a Sunday stroll like a leisurely flight, right? And to us it looks like they&#x27;re going at these impossible speeds. Uh it explains everything. Um it explains why transmedium travel is observed. We see these craft going from space to the air to the ocean seamlessly through these separate environments, which is not something our aircraft can do.</p>
<p>But once you understand that they&#x27;re in their own space-time environment, they&#x27;re within this bubble, then it makes sense because the bubble and everything in it is not impacted by the environment around it. It also explains why we&#x27;ve had so much trouble getting these things on radar because the way radar works is a radar emitter shoots radar at an object and then it bounces back to the radar emitter and that&#x27;s how you figure out where the thing is, right? But in this case, the radar is just bouncing around the bubble and continuing on, right? It also explains, you know, the answer to the age-old question of why is it so hard to get a good photo or video of a UFO? The simple answer is because we&#x27;re taking photos and videos through a space-time barrier through this bubble. It&#x27;s the equivalent of trying to take pictures of fish under the ocean from above the ocean. You can&#x27;t do it, right? No one would ever be like, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m trying to take a picture of these fish in this koi pond and it looks all blurry. Why is that happening?&quot; You&#x27;d be like, &quot;Well, you&#x27;re taking a picture from above the water &gt;&gt; something in the water, right?&quot; And it&#x27;s the same thing here.</p>
<p>Like you can&#x27;t get a good picture of these things because we&#x27;re trying to take photos through a space-time barrier, through this bubble that&#x27;s been created. And this work bubble is the key to that technology. And what&#x27;s also extraordinary about it is, as these scientists say, this technology, this ability to generate this immense amount of energy in a localized area and create this warp bubble, it is it is in their opinion the key to interstellar travel. Yes, it&#x27;s the key to basically the next chapter for humanity, right? It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a solution to the energy crisis. You know, they are creating immense amount of energy and they&#x27;re tapping in energy that we haven&#x27;t figured out how to tap into yet, right? That could solve one of the biggest problems humanity has, the energy crisis.</p>
<p>It could set up future generations, you know, for a much better life. Um and then you know in terms of you know opening the door to interstellar travel that could just expand you know you know mankind&#x27;s exploration of the galaxy. Uh the possibilities are limitless. Um one of the other big big things talked about with regard to technology is once we start making this information known to academia and the scientific community then they can put their brain power towards it. And who knows what else comes off the back of that.</p>
<p>You know, the the space race was a single mission to get to the moon, right? But the process led to something like 35,000 other inventions coming off the back of it that have benefited us, like things we don&#x27;t even think about, like, you know, I think Velcro and microwaves and like things we use, right? Um, and you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;ll come off the back of something like this. So, so yeah, that that that sequence in the film is one of my favorite um sequences in the film because the two people who speak are incredibly intelligent. They&#x27;re quantum physicists. They worked as senior scientists on these classified UAP programs for the government and they&#x27;re just straight up revealing how this technology works. And it&#x27;s stated in such a simple way that you don&#x27;t need to be a rocket scientist to follow it, you know, and and it all makes sense and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really inspiring.</p>
<p>How has the UFO community I would be considered a normie, right? like that I I I when I said how much I loved your film, your documentary, uh you know, a few people pushed back, oh, now the normies are talking about it, but um uh I can sense because you&#x27;re getting such legitimate corporate discussion, nightly news, &gt;&gt; major cable programs. Um, you know, Joe Rogan has always had a great interest in this, but because you&#x27;re getting so much credit and so much discourse and discussion, has there been any push back from, you know, nobody&#x27;s ever done this. Nobody&#x27;s ever had 34 senior intelligence officials and the documentary beyond that is so brilliantly made, &gt;&gt; right? Has there been any push back or have you been universally uh accepted and celebrated? &gt;&gt; Well, look, I think before the movie came out, I certainly dealt with some people who were causing problems for me behind the scenes and there were a number of people who wish this movie didn&#x27;t exist, wish I hadn&#x27;t made it, wish it wouldn&#x27;t get released. Um, I overcame all that and obviously got the movie out there. Um, I think that the response to the film has been so overwhelmingly supportive and as you said it in an unprecedented way is getting serious news coverage and I was on Jake Tapper on CNN.</p>
<p>I &gt;&gt; you know Hannity and and Brett Bar on Fox, the New York Times did a big piece about a secret screening I held for Congress a couple weeks ago, how important that was. And so I think all of that is making people realize how important this is and it&#x27;s overcoming those who would want to cause problems. But there are still there are still bad actors on social media. I&#x27;m aware of people who are paid bad actors who are actually on social media paid to just wake up every morning and disparage this film and the people in it take shots at it and that&#x27;s a very real thing. So, but you know what I think the reality of it is the good guys win in the end and you know the truth will prevail and this film is 34 people arm in- arm putting their credibility on the line to share their truth and I think ultimately that that&#x27;s any of these bad actors on social media just making up disparaging negative stuff.</p>
<p>I just think it&#x27;s noise and the truth is the truth is going to win. And and you know, you know, speaking of 34 people, the thing everyone&#x27;s got to remember this day and age, you could put a 4K video of that giant craft that went over Vanderberg online and half the human population will think it&#x27;s AI. They&#x27;ll be like, &quot;Oh, some Hollywood producer made that with visual effects or this or that, right?&quot; But people, credible people with amazing resumes and and lots of credibility putting their their name and reputation on the line and going on camera on the record revealing this information. To me, that is that is the strongest evidence you could hope for. And I think it&#x27;s going to ultimately overshadow any any bad actors online who are, you know, saying disparaging things.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Only 27% of the ocean is mapped. Uh many of these videos, these craft have been in and out of the water. There&#x27;s two or three that um are more prominent that I think almost everybody listening to this will have seen. Um were there discussions with any of the people that you talked to that believe that&#x27;s their primary base on this planet? or is it something they can um you know they can activate, they can hide um or or does it go deeper than that? Sometimes, by the way, when you do a documentary, there&#x27;s some stuff that that may be interesting, but doesn&#x27;t make the cut. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>um you guys didn&#x27;t spend a ton of time on the ocean and my take is because you didn&#x27;t want a six-hour documentary, but in but when you talk to these um intelligence officials, the 34 people, is there a sense that there are bases, a base, or there&#x27;s a lot more activity in the infrequently mapped oceans that&#x27;s going on? &gt;&gt; Yeah, there&#x27;s an enormous amount of activity in the oceans that I&#x27;ve learned about. And and yes, the only reason I I didn&#x27;t go deeper into the ocean is just cuz I had to get this this documentary under two hours or people would kill me. Um but uh yes, so everyone I interviewed um was of the same mindset and thought that the most obvious place for UAP to hide is the ocean because the majority of our planet is the ocean and it&#x27;s the easiest place to hide from humanity. On top of that, there&#x27;s been a lot of activity recorded by our military intelligence community under the ocean. There have been reports of craft the size of football fields again moving at hundreds of miles an hour under the ocean, which is not something we have the capability to do, you know, and it&#x27;s extraordinary.</p>
<p>Um, there are definitely hot spots. Um, &gt;&gt; oh, there are Congressman uh Tim Burchett actually uh recently talked about it publicly in an interview that there&#x27;s four or five hotspots that are believed to be either maybe their bases, maybe it&#x27;s just a lot of activity there. We we don&#x27;t know. Um that&#x27;s yet to come out, but there&#x27;s a lot of activity under the ocean. And and that&#x27;s also, you know, for people who haven&#x27;t really looked into this topic and they hear, okay, now people are calling UFOs UAP.</p>
<p>Why why did that change happen? The primary change is UFO stood for unidentified flying object. UAP stands for unidentified anomalous phenomena and that that is because it covers activity under the ocean and not just in the sky. Um because the things underwater are not flying technically, right? Um but there is a tremendous amount of UAP activity in our oceans. And as Congressman Carson, uh, one of the senior members of Congress in my film reveals, they have lots of reports of of these craft coming out of the ocean. And as he says, these aren&#x27;t rockets.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re not aircraft. They&#x27;re otherworldly things. He literally says that on camera. And he&#x27;s a very senior member of Congress. He&#x27;s on the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
<p>He was on the House Committee for the Central Intelligence Agency. Um, really smart, senior, thoughtful guy. Um, yeah. So there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a there there&#x27;s a real situation and um it&#x27;s fascinating. &gt;&gt; Has an American pilot ever been shot down? Um again, that&#x27;s not something that would be reported to the public right there.</p>
<p>The stigma has worn off significantly. Um I mean the story about George Bush and the ranch, I I remember hearing about that. Um, and I also you talk I believe um I&#x27;ve watched so many interviews with you and others in regard in regards to Bush having like a like a a meeting a private meeting. Should we talk about this to the public? There&#x27;s been suggestions Trump will, but it can affect our economy and how do you present it? But has there ever been privately not discussed? Has there been a pilot shot down uh a ship attacked to that level of violence? I haven&#x27;t heard anything about an an aircraft being shot down. Um, there are stories of events that happened in the past of UAP causing seemingly intentional biological effects.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s um there&#x27;s some historical events that happen in other countries where UFOs seem to um have intentional encounters with people and and cause harm to them. But overall there&#x27;s not a lot of those stories. Um the one of the big reveals in the film um a senior intelligence official Hal Pudof reveals that we have actually fired missiles at UAP that that humans have and and um obviously that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a bit of a slippery slope and um &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; probably not a great idea, &gt;&gt; right? the um I&#x27;m interested going back to the retrieval programs &gt;&gt; that um our intelligence discovered that Russia had retrieved because Russia, the United States, and the US are the are the three countries that we I think we broadly believe um at least we have access to their access. if you could talk about I think it was in the late 80s, Dan. Um, &gt;&gt; again, a tic tac, although larger than the one we saw on the Pentagon footage.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Russia encounter or retrieval of some note that has sort of changed their perception and perhaps created um their retrieval program and and and their program. All these programs sound like they&#x27;re being ramped up over the last 80 years. Can we talk about the Russia uh invasion or retrieval? &gt;&gt; Yes. Two two of the two of the senior scientists um who are in my film who worked on UAP programs for the government, they go on the record and say that that the US government is aware of um retrievalss in Russia of UAP.</p>
<p>And one of them specifically they hone in on was a tic-tac-shaped UFO UAP that was significantly larger than the tic-tac UAP that the Nimttz carrier strike group encountered 20 years ago. The the incident we know as the Tic Tac UFO, right? So much bigger than that. And it was recovered in Russia and apparently there was a very advanced directed energy weapon in in that craft. And um yeah, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s alarming that that kind of technology, you know, has been in the hands of an adversarial nation since the 80s and it&#x27;s not the only time it&#x27;s happened. &gt;&gt; Um the suggestion that Trump perhaps would go public with the acknowledgment um of all this.</p>
<p>What do you make of those reports? So people in the film reveal that there&#x27;s been a few occasions where a sitting president has contemplated going to the microphone and telling the world the base facts that they learned that we&#x27;re not alone in the efforts. &gt;&gt; Um there&#x27;s a story in the film about um Bush too contemplating doing it. Um one of the intelligence officials in the film goes on the record saying he was part of a think tank that the Bush administration put together to determine whether it would be a good idea or not to go public and that their decision was not to do it. obviously at the time uh that was Bush 2. Uh there&#x27;s another intelligence official, very senior guy in the film who goes on the record saying that during the first Trump administration, Trump contemplated just sharing the base facts that he had learned that we&#x27;re not alone in the universe and that secretary minutian who was the you know secretary of treasury at the time um called this intelligence official in and asked him for a briefing on the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>And um he explained to this intelligence official, he said, &quot;The reason I&#x27;m asking you is I want to be able to think about what the economic repercussions will be if &gt;&gt; President Trump decides to step to the microphone and tell the world we&#x27;re not alone.&quot; And and and so these people in my film reveal that this almost happened a couple times. And now I I do think that this film sets the stage for him to comfortably do that. I don&#x27;t know if he will choose to do it. Um, obviously only he can make that decision, but I think this film makes it, you know, extremely clear to the average person that this is a real situation, that there&#x27;s real stakes, and that the average American is owed some basic level of transparency on this from the president. And so, you know, we&#x27;ll see.</p>
<p>Time will tell if uh if he uses this opportunity to comfortably step to the microphone and tell the world we&#x27;re not alone. It would certainly be one of the biggest moments in human history if he did. But uh we we will see. I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time though before a sitting president does decide to do that. &gt;&gt; Dan Far, a director of producer Age of Disclosure.</p>
<p>Um I worked in Las Vegas as a sports cer. Um, Area 51 was understood and it was newsworthy at the time. And over the course of about a 2 to threeyear period, we had a reporter, that was one of his beats, Area 51, Dan Burns, and the activity ramped up substantially over about a 2-year period. Then stealth fighters emerged from our country. And so as Dan in some of his reporting which was accurate, many of the triangleshaped lights seen over a two to threeyear period was the development of stealth.</p>
<p>Bob Lazar made a name for himself uh years ago. Um his background has sometimes not checked out. Not a knock at Bob, but that&#x27;s the reality. I looked up his Wikipedia page for the first time ever. Um so Area 51 is something that gets discussed.</p>
<p>I thought one of the and all the moments were credible, but James Clapper, who is now in his 80s, has no reason to be involved in this at all. You know, again, this is because the stigma has to a large degree died, but James Clapper came on and share it with the listeners now. Um, he acknowledged and I mean, it was a real moment where I went, &quot;Okay, time out. [laughter] &gt;&gt; James Clapper, he&#x27;s been with multiple White House, multiple presidents.&quot; Was that a was that a wow moment for you? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that was a significant wow moment for me. And and just you know for for your audience, James Clapper was the director of national intelligence.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. The highest level position in the intelligence community. &gt;&gt; Um he was the head of air force intelligence. He was the head of the defense intelligence agency and [laughter] a number of other other agencies. His resume reads like a Marvel character.</p>
<p>It is [laughter] it is a ridiculous resume that no one else has. like uncomparable resume and credibility and a very serious guy and he&#x27;s in his 80s. when I when I did the interview, he was he was already in his 80s and um at the time to give some other color to it, um at the time his his wife was was was was battling cancer and &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; in her in her in her final days and the and despite that and despite being an amazing loyal husband who was like there for her every day at the hospital, he left the hospital to come do this interview and I really have a lot respect for him for doing that. He told me he thought it was important to still do it. Um I remember saying, &quot;Hey, should we reschedule this? Should we not do this today?&quot; And he was like, &quot;No, this is important.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s do it.&quot; And he shared what he lawfully could. And one of those big things he shared was that UAP activity over our sensitive military bases and training sites uh is is very real and very active, especially he said, our ranges out west in the the west the west side of the United States. And he specifically said, most notably Area 51. And that&#x27;s such a big statement because &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; UAP activity, UFO activity over Area 51 is widely considered, you know, the epitome of conspiracy, right? And like  Like your average person thinks, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s That&#x27;s there&#x27;s nothing there, right?&quot; And here&#x27;s this extremely credible intelligence official who ran Air Force intelligence saying, &quot;No, that is real. That is a real situation.</p>
<p>UFO activity over Area 51 is real. And I remember when he said it, he he said it so naturally and then there was a part of me that felt like he was like, &quot;Oh, why&#x27; I say that?&quot; You know, there was I felt it like, &quot;Oh, that turned out, but it&#x27;s the truth, so it is what it is.&quot; And and um and he and he kind of put his head down for a second and realized, you know, how significant what he just said was. And in that moment, I I turned around to a couple other people that were in the room. Some other intelligence officials were were there because they were going to do interviews with me next. Um and and I looked at them and their jaws were on the floor because it&#x27;s such a big statement from a guy like that.</p>
<p>And um yeah, I I have a lot of respect for him um for sharing that with us and I think he probably felt um a responsibility to share what he could. He &gt;&gt; civic duty almost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He also shared in that interview that despite the US Air Force saying that they haven&#x27;t had an active investigation to study this stuff or investigate this stuff since the closure of Project Blue Book, which we have all heard about, you know, um Project Blue Book closed in the late &#x27;7s and the Air Force has consistently taken the position even as recent as a couple months ago that they have not had a program to investigate UAP since then. But Jim Clapper says on camera on the record that when he was running Air Force Intelligence, they did in fact have a program to investigate UAP.</p>
<p>Um, so he he dropped some very significant statements in the film and um I think he did us all a service by opening our eyes to the truth that he that he could share. And uh you know the the thing for everyone to remember when they watch this film and they see these extraordinary statements made by credible people is this is just what they can lawfully disclose. there&#x27;s a whole lot more on the other side of that line that you just have to use your imagination and and and think about what could be there. Um, and that&#x27;s a pretty that&#x27;s a pretty wild thought. I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time thinking about that.</p>
<p>And if if these extraordinary bombshell statements, this paradigm shift information they can lawfully disclose um is so big and so significant, what the hell&#x27;s on the other side of that line? What&#x27;s the other stuff that they can&#x27;t talk about? Dan, my theory would be is they are testing the reaction. My theory is these including James Clapper are testing the waters. They are seeing the reaction. They&#x27;re finding out that it&#x27;s it is now publicly credible and that it&#x27;s the it&#x27;s the first step of a second or a third evolution of information and disclosure. That that was my takeaway watching this, which is what they&#x27;re allowed to say.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re they&#x27;re kind of putting everybody&#x27;s foot in the water. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There will be a second or a third evolution of this, perhaps a president. Does that seem too random and too conspiratorial? &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s 100% the case. You know, I called the movie The Age of Disclosure um because as I was making it um it became clear that this film was the beginning of the age of disclosure of a period of time in which a lot of information will come out.</p>
<p>You know, it&#x27;s not a it&#x27;s not a singular event. It&#x27;s going to be a a period of time where we all slowly learn the reality of the situation. And um what I would suspect is on the other side of that line is events like contact events um and technological advancements that sound like the stuff of science fiction but that have in fact been figured out. I &gt;&gt; you know &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s where it goes. Dan, I mean, have you noticed the timing about every six weeks now there&#x27;s a new piece of video which which wasn&#x27;t discovered within the month.</p>
<p>I feel like stuff is being leaked. There&#x27;s a plan about every six weeks, every eight weeks, there&#x27;s another piece of video, the Yemen video, I believe it was there, where you you see a high-speed craft, we shoot at it, and it goes right through its bubble or its force, its field. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I again that sound I&#x27;m not a conspira conspiracy theory person but it does feel like it&#x27;s we&#x27;re getting information parsed to us as it&#x27;s almost like a guide book. Okay, here&#x27;s the big documentary.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s senior officials. Here&#x27;s more video. That&#x27;s what it feels like to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look, when I was making the documentary, at some point in the process early on, I realized that this film I was making as a as a normal person outside of this world, like trying to uncover what can lawfully be talked about and and learn the truth, somewhere in that process, it my film became the vehicle for people in in in the no to bring about disclosure.</p>
<p>like it became a number of these people&#x27;s plan for disclosure where where people who were aware of significant information wanted to find a way to disclose to the public they they decided my film would be that that vehicle and then once that decision was made I think a lot got um held for after the movie and so the movie coming out I think is setting the table for a lot more coming out is the simplest way to say it. Uh I really believe that to be true and and and in some cases I know for sure to be true. I mean there I know some people who are you know Jay Stratton for example is in my film. Um J Stratton is the most senior intelligence official to ever investigate UAP and non-human intelligent life for the US government. He did it for 16 years.</p>
<p>Like a like a real life moulder from XFiles. This was his job, right? He he was the director of the UAP task force, the largest whole of government investigation at UAP. He um when he retired, he was a senior executive. He was a member of senior executive services of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Um it&#x27;s a basically the civilian equivalent of a two-star admiral.</p>
<p>Extremely serious, very credible guy. Uh he reveals in the film that he has seen non-human beings and non-human craft. He reveals details like there were bodies recovered at Roswell, non-human bodies. He reveals where they were brought to. He reveals how he uncovered the deeply hidden crash retrieval and reverse engineering program and how they created obstacles for him trying to get to the truth.</p>
<p>He reveals a lot of information. He&#x27;s also got a book coming out uh early next year that&#x27;s his tell all memoir where he shares even more and then I know after the book comes out he&#x27;s going to share even more after that. So a lot of these people who participate in the film are aware of so much information and they&#x27;re also aware of how people digest information. You you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t tell you can&#x27;t share everything at the same time. It&#x27;s just too overwhelming.</p>
<p>And I think this film plays a really important role of establishing the lay of the land and the base facts and who&#x27;s involved and why it&#x27;s complicated. It answers basic questions the average person has like why has this been kept secret for so long? Why why should it now be made more public? What are the concerns we have to have? You know, all these basic questions, the lay of the land. I think this film really lays that out and you know uh it&#x27;s a complicated situation that&#x27;s been going on for 80 years but I&#x27;ll tell you Con when I was making it a big goal for me was to make it digestible to the average person and I just kept thinking of my parents who are in their mid70s and live in Jersey and are normal middle class people and you know I just kept thinking okay at every turn making this movie like is the information going to be too overwhelming is going to be too much is it going to be the kind of thing where you watch it and then you can&#x27;t remember anything cuz it was just so much information, right? And so it was really important for me to make this film very digestible, easy to understand, like give the average person who doesn&#x27;t know anything about the situation, a clear understanding of the lay of the land. Uh they can walk away from this film and really get it, you know. Um it&#x27;s kind of thing you can watch this film, you could tell your friends, hey, this is what I learned.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s this is this is why we&#x27;re in this situation. This is what&#x27;s been going on. these are the players, the this is the the pros and cons of the situation, this is why we got to worry about it. Um these base facts and and um you know, I I think the response I&#x27;m seeing is is is that that worked and it&#x27;s really opening a lot of people&#x27;s eyes. And so so yes, I think there will be more after that.</p>
<p>Once people understand the base facts and the lay of the land, then then more can come out. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I you definitely landed you landed it. Um it is called the age of disclosure. I told my wife, I&#x27;m like, &quot;Listen,&quot; she goes, &quot;I I&#x27;m not really into this.&quot; I said, &quot;Just watch it. I don&#x27;t tell you to watch anything.</p>
<p>You tell me to watch everything, I tell you to watch nothing.&quot; I said, and I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve had at least five or six buddies would be like, &quot;Holy shit.&quot; And I&#x27;m like, &quot;That&#x27;s that was my reaction.&quot; That bubble wrap theory, I was like, the two things that really I mean, it was all great, but when you go to the bases, the way you use Google Maps, it was like, &quot;Oh, those poor guys felt they almost felt guilty not telling it earlier, their reaction.&quot; the bubble wrap cuz I&#x27;m you know I&#x27;m never going to be a physicist. My dad was a doctor but I I didn&#x27;t get that math brain you really show I thought you did such a good job showing it. Then you followed up showing pieces of UAP video. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; With the video I was like okay that&#x27;s the one I saw to see the bubble.</p>
<p>Yeah. And that&#x27;s because our our camera systems on our fightercraftraft become more advanced. You could actually see the bubble. Um, the other wild thing that we didn&#x27;t get into is &gt;&gt; when the when when when a craft is in a bubble, &gt;&gt; a warp bubble, and it gets knocked out of it, then it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s um subject to the same laws of physics that that our aircraft is, right? And so, one of the things that has caused crashes is nuclear blasts, nuclear blasts, nuclear testing. Um when we were doing our testing in the 40s in the atomic race, one of the unforeseen consequences was those nuclear blast knocked UAP out of their bubble and caused crashes.</p>
<p>And so one of the one of the things that I think has unfortunately been um one of the learnings that has unfortunately been used by um militaries around the military around the world is using those testings to essentially go fishing with dynamite is the best way to put it. And um that&#x27;s, you know, terrifying on a lot of levels cuz it means, you know, humanity is is is is essentially picking a fight with a more advanced intelligent species and that probably won&#x27;t work out great, you know. Um but that is also fascinating. And then obviously there can be error, there can be issues, you know, there can be other circumstances that would make the bubble not work and that just causes a crash, right? So when people say how these things are so advanced, how do they crash? Well, any technology that exists can have issues, right? You know, &gt;&gt; look at AI. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot there&#x27;s a lot of examples. Um, so that that&#x27;s really fascinating. Dan Farah, director, producer, Age of Disclosure. Dan, where do I watch this if I just popped into this and I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to view it tonight? &gt;&gt; Cool. So everyone in the world can watch the movie on Prime Video.</p>
<p>You do not have to have a Prime subscription. You can just go to Prime Video. You can rent it. You could purchase it. It&#x27;s available in every country around the world and with subtitles in every major language.</p>
<p>So I encourage everyone to watch it and tell their friends and family and join join the conversation about this issue. &gt;&gt; Um so appreciative of you taking time. Um, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s been really um for me an attitude documentary and I think I&#x27;m reasonably curious. I appreciate your work and your excellence and your devotion to it and Dan, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it. Thank you. [music] &gt;&gt; [music]</p>
