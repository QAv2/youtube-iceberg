            <p>welcome to the home of mathematics in this video series we will show you the milestones in the journey of human mathematical discoveries william rowan hamilton 1805-1865 william hamilton was born in dublin ireland on the 4th of august 1805. hamilton was an irish mathematician he made important contributions to optics classical mechanics and algebra in particular his reformulation of newtonian mechanics now called hamiltonian mechanics this work has proven central to the modern study of classical field theories such as electromagnetism and the development of quantum mechanics in pure mathematics he is best known as the inventor of quaternions mr hamilton why you have damaged the broom bridge well quaternion is the algebraic extension of complex numbers i j k equals minus 1 is the central idea of quaternion which is very useful in computer graphics and robotic actions in defining 3d general rotations excited for this discovery i carved the result on the bridge i don&#x27;t understand how quaternions could tell a robot to dance based on the quaternion the 3d rotation about an axis can be easily defined compound rotation of many operations about several different axes can now be easily combined without ambiguity as the process is entirely algebraic such that rotations are transformed into quaternion multiplications thank you for watching talent is important but how one develops and nurtures it is even more so see you at the home of mathematics</p>
