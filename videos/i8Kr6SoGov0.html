            <p>and we could begin to make a rationalization if we get enough noise discharging fast enough and cover enough frequencies we have things in there which are going to do lots of summation very non-linear so those summations will lock together you will have some zero summations in there so you can make a reasonable argument for the possible existence and i accent the word possible now this is proven uh of sudden scalar waves at least in certain bands the bands may be random and it may be changing back and forth through the whole region on an absolute very rapid random basis it&#x27;s after all noise we&#x27;re talking about north summation so if that&#x27;s true something like that is going on then what we&#x27;re doing we&#x27;re getting at least some parts a very fast changing scalar way well there&#x27;s some nice equations in the book already that show that the rise time or inversely the fall time of such a way that you get effects the sharper the change time and here he&#x27;s trying to be as sharp as he possibly can discharge this huge potential that he&#x27;s built up so he&#x27;s meeting the criteria if you wanted to let&#x27;s have a shot at it if you wanted to have that kind of process and so let&#x27;s see what happens and let&#x27;s shoot it lots of times and hunt around in here and see if we don&#x27;t occasionally get some effects he&#x27;s actually doing the sort of thing that one would lay out to say well a shotgun approach that&#x27;s probably the way you can look at it and see if you get any kind of effects uh you will have to then go on past that and rule out you know very carefully such things as magnetic levitation and etc etc if you can then separate and show clearly that the effect you have is none of those things or else those things are minimal compared to the effect that you&#x27;re actually getting then you would begin to be on a good experimental basis to say we are now getting some kind of levitation effect it may not be controlled because of my sources or no sources so they&#x27;re randomized the changes are giving me the scalar bands are random but every once in a while conditions would get right in order to get levitation well as a matter of fact the gentleman does get something that looks exactly like that the other thing he gets is he gets extraordinary breaks and metals i have seen some of these metals are broken i was particularly interested in what i call the shingle effect in some of the breaks that he has done and particularly aluminum which demonstrated quite well the fact that the thing would split like it reminded me of the people who used to make baskets and would carefully with their drawing knives split out long strips of nice hickory and then weave baskets out of that the metal would actually split into an array of strips like this i know of absolutely no other effect it may be one that somebody in this room knows of but i don&#x27;t know of one that will give you that kind of a break from a distance from a distance of so many feet from a distance of so many feet using sudden electromagnetic discharges in a metal so i thought that was something that was to me a very anomalous indeed but of course again a professional metallurgist would be the fellow you need to bring in here and look at that but it seemed to be very anomalous to me what he was doing so i saw things in the experiments which certainly resembled the kinds of things that i would have suggested would be the one one way to go in there with equipment you could put together from surplus equipment and scrap equipment and have a go at it to see if you can get the gross effect now he&#x27;s certainly getting effects and i&#x27;m very cheered to find something i didn&#x27;t know till very recently that some an independent laboratory had actually done rigorous tests on some of the metals and found significant changes that is of an interest to you i can give you the the microphone institute report because that of course is the kind of thing that you&#x27;ve got to have done uh applied to it to show that yes indeed you do have enough evidence here to show you they&#x27;re probably getting what is clearly an anomalous effect so more of that kind of thing is what should</p>
