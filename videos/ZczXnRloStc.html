            <p>so before we move on to questions from redditors how you have a really interesting piece of art behind you would you mind commenting on that sharing a little bit about that with us oh yes this is uh you you can see it this is actually made by Ino Swan one of the people that I interacted with in an earlier CIA Dia program on quote remote viewing or the possibility of using ESP kinds of effects for Espionage and that was a long detailed uh program and so on so Ingo Swan who&#x27;s a very famous artist among other things was also as it turns out one of the best remote viewers so-called psychics that we uh used in the program uh involved in Espionage using those kinds of talents and so it turned out that early in the program while I was at SRI Stanford Research Institute in in California he visited our house and uh decided that uh in you know for for having the opportunity and also as as a chance of giving my wife and myself kind of a a present for our marriage he decided he would make a a painting for us and so uh he actually set up his easel in the basement of our garage uh or in in our garage and uh started painting uh this painting which turns out to be the first of many in a series he calls U Highway in the sky paintings and so uh what&#x27;s interesting you have of course you have the asphalt painting with the line down the center which is the path that most scientists take dealing with the physical reality that we have but then uh in the sky he said there&#x27;s another path and there&#x27;s another Highway and some people like myself and others who are willing to take a look behind the scenes and investigate uh other options of of what might be true in our universe that&#x27;s the highway in the sky so anyway he gave that painting to us now an interesting aspect was that as he was painting it I took pictures of it along the way and I got a it just looked like garbage all along the way until he got to his last step and then the last setup of of painting and brush Strokes he put on just brought the whole thing to life so it turns out there&#x27;s a whole series of these uh Highway in the sky paintings and among his most famous collection</p>
