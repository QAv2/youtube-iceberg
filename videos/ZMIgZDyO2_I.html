            <p>But have you ever learned about something that seems like it would change the entire course of humanity and it seems like a nobody cares or b no nobody&#x27;s talking about it? Have you heard of the Casemir effect? Have you heard of a guy named Sunny White? Because Sunonny White was a guest on the Joe Rogan Experience and he literally brought a prototype of a device that gives unlimited energy. This capability is amazing to think in terms of what it could unlock. Mhm. Right. Especially if we could, you know, if this is three three and a half watts, you could imagine you put a bunch of these together, you could rapidly get to a kilowatt or even more, right? And uh have expeditionary power.</p>
<p>Now, I&#x27;m not a physicist. I don&#x27;t know all the specific terms, but basically using the Casemir effect, which happens on a quantum scale, it&#x27;s able to pull energy. We can some people call it, I guess, 0 point energy or vacuum energy. And again, I don&#x27;t know the specifics of how this works, but it produces energy that&#x27;s unlimited to the point that if you want to conceptualize it, if you have a cell phone, you plug it in right when the battery goes to zero or close to zero. What if you never ever ever had to plug in your cell phone? The prototype that he brought on the Joe Rogan Experience, it works.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t generate that much wattage, but it literally works. It pulls wattage. We&#x27;re making these little these little nano chips that are we&#x27;re trying to use to extract energy. Yeah, sure. These is that the actual nano chips? These are a bunch of the nanochips that we&#x27;re doing.</p>
<p>This is part of the Casmir company that we spun out. Uh these chips uh interact with the quantum field uh and generate a voltage potential between those leads. How is this not the most important thing on everyone&#x27;s radar? Go and Google honestly Sunny White Casemir effect. There&#x27;s like one or two articles in the past 5 years. And this isn&#x27;t like some crackpot.</p>
<p>This is a former NASA scientist that has a literal company that&#x27;s already set up that has created working prototypes. I just feel like nobody&#x27;s talking about this. Nobody cares. Am I missing something? And I get it. I&#x27;m not a physicist.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not a scientist. I have my bachelor of arts in political science. I took like I don&#x27;t know four science classes my entire college career. So maybe I&#x27;m wrong. Maybe my misunderstand I&#x27;m misunderstanding stuff.</p>
<p>So you tell me am I missing something? If you yourself are a quantum mechanic or you are an astrophysicist. Um yeah let me know like what am I wrong about? Am I just missing some giant glaring point? Or is it that uh there&#x27;s a bigger effort to just not talk about?</p>
