            <p>hey everybody so finally got the video up you&#x27;re looking at a real 10-year 100,000 hours Zero Point Energy device yes the energy comes from the vacuum of space Tesla was right they&#x27;ve been able to accomplish it after Decades of thousands of tests uh the formula is what the expense is the parts right there can be bought at the local lab store but the formula is what had to be perfected the solid state of energy coming out not intermittently which they had a problem with but this is one of many companies this right here lasts 100,000 hours 10 years of use you can go anywhere with it decentralized so if there&#x27;s a hurricane there&#x27;s an outage well that right there will keep going you know solar no the sun doesn&#x27;t always shine wind doesn&#x27;t always blow but that device right there can be stacked and scalable from 3 kilow it&#x27;s 3,000 Watts it&#x27;s about the size of a carry-on luggage for a plane and you also 6 kilow you can go to 10 Kow they go up to a megawatt point being is that we finally broke through Z point energy is real they also call it low energy nuclear reaction but no radiation it&#x27;s safe it&#x27;s recyclable and it comes with a guarantee point being is it&#x27;s Justified for The Upfront costs because the savings are far more the infrastructure think about how far you could be out into you know the middle of nowhere think about you know things like desalination plants out in the middle of the desert you know you have a one megawatt plant like this it&#x27;s always energy intensive uh you know things are energy intensive everywhere think about laying cables to go all the way to Antarctica we need heat that&#x27;ll provide your heat for you it&#x27;s basically plug-and-play technology now a little Engineering in order to stack it and scale it for large homes for um you know businesses but this is going to be industrial this is going to be everything we ever needed and it will siphon off the revenues from the electrical grid yes 30-year bonds energy bonds 15E energy bonds will lose their attraction uh competing values this right here is coming into play so we know now that the 9 trillion roughly 27 trillion a year worldly in electrical cost energy cost because 80% of everything we do is energy and so if you can start siphoning that off in the next year or two years yes I&#x27;m sure the super wealthy that you know own most of the energy grid uh the oil the coal um shelling I mean you name it you know those are going to start coming down when these first products hit the street and those revenues will start coming out and this this news will get out but like I said if you want to really take a look at this company you can just go to Quantum eversource you know look them up um or you can go to mine because I&#x27;m not going to be on here I assume in a few days to learn about all these companies go to newfire energy. substack domcom this is truly a paradigm shift you know ex essential I mean we&#x27;re talking about a a new world order here where that all those trillions that are used in energy over the next few years are going to start to become independent our own decentralized no more dependent upon the electrical Grid or Shackled because that&#x27;s ultimately where we&#x27;ve been a 100 years worth of incremental increases each year energy has gone up it&#x27;s our right to have this energy decentralized away from the governments away from you know I don&#x27;t want to get too much into it in case Tik Tock doesn&#x27;t want me to be on here but please I&#x27;ll put the um in the comments the website uh and also my newfire energy. substack docomo watch what&#x27;s going on this is exciting take a look at that you should see the small one it&#x27;s about the size of two cell phones that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a 100 watt unit I mean you know phone TV I mean small small but still I mean that the idea that it&#x27;s so mobile it&#x27;s just amazing technology we broke through this is what we needed this is what we want this will save the world and it&#x27;ll save all of us social quality thank you watch my videos well I don&#x27;t know if you want to watch these it might not be around all right thank you</p>
