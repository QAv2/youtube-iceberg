            <p>Honoring again the old gods, those archetypal essences pouring down from the planets and stars and into the maelstrom of human life on Earth. This is Neon Galactic. I&#x27;m James Faulk. Thanks for joining us. One thread seems to unite all the ancient philosophies now being resurrected by seekers like us.</p>
<p>The new initiates people trying hard to accommodate visionary experience into a modern world view. The occult, hermeticism, alchemy, cabala, so on and sundry all draw deeply upon the notion that this universe is rife with powers and principalities that are embodied by planets and stars, divine agencies who spin human lives like flatsom on the seas of possibility. Astrology is a remnant recollection of wisdom so ancient its origin is lost to history. may be as old as intelligence itself. A signal we&#x27;ve followed for as long as we&#x27;ve walked upright to trail the Milky Way out of from Africa and at the end back to origin.</p>
<p>Astrology is a fundamental part of our intellectual identity and perhaps an engine of our ability to self-conceive. Once upon a time, I would have scoffed at the idea, arrested as I was in a materialist mindset that offered no room for remote influence or idealist notions of cosmic intelligence. Those days are long gone. Interest in UFOs and non-human intelligence has cracked me wide open, breaking down old walls and allowing me to finally register just how precisely connected this universe is. From far-flung galactic superclusters and errant interstellar comets to neighboring Alpha Centauri and this sparkling blue water planet hosting life in all its miraculous moods because there seems to be a singular sense in all this multiplicity, a cohesion of purpose, evolution writ large.</p>
<p>The named forces we&#x27;ve come to know as Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Saturn among others are the exterior expression of a cosmically vast interior experience. And our lives are in that crucible shaped by those forces ground down or lifted up as Saturn, Neptune, and Pluto continue their ancient pilgrimage around the sun. We are in the mind. We are of mind. And all of our miseries and ruminations, joys and passion are merely fractal facets of an endlessly reflective fountain of light and therefore consciousnesses.</p>
<p>And so the patterns of this energy exchange, the movement of stars, planets, sun, and moon carry insight for those with eyes to observe. Our guest today, Dan Weights from World Astrology Report, is one who is paying attention to this astral parade. This is his second visit to Neon Galactic and we welcome him back. What are the stars telling us, Dan? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a good question, James. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a good question and uh for people following your channel, World Astrology Report, uh they get lots of data about what the stars are telling us and a lot of fantastic posts.</p>
<p>So, I want to recommend that people go check it out. Um not that you need my recommendation, your channel is doing quite well. So, cheers. &gt;&gt; Thanks, James. &gt;&gt; Great.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now, um, one of the things that, uh, I wanted to do is we&#x27;ve had you on the show before, and at that point, you sort of gave us a primer on what, you know, how astrology works from your point of view and how you got to where you are as an astrolog, but I wanted to sort of uh, get an update from you. We&#x27;re a couple months into the year now, and everything seems to be falling to pieces. Um, and uh, so I was hoping to just kind of touch bases with you and see how you um, read, you know, the uh, the forces playing out now on planet Earth and where we&#x27;re likely headed into the near future. Yeah, it&#x27;s an extremely interesting time as anybody who&#x27;s paying attention to the news will probably agree and it&#x27;s pretty weird for an astrologer just following what&#x27;s happening right now particularly right now this month February 2026 because this is a month that we&#x27;ve been um we&#x27;ve been looking at from afar for quite some time um we&#x27;re essentially what we&#x27;re doing in astrology among Other things is tracking cycles and planetary cycles essentially um undergood the unfolding of reality the various processes that you see and that that manifest in in the news and in world events and events in our own lives &gt;&gt; and there&#x27;s a conjunction this month in fact it&#x27;s happening in three days time conjunction &gt;&gt; yeah a conjunction of Saturn and Neptune which only happens every 36 years or so. Um however this particular conjunction of these planets is happening in the very first degree of the entire zodiac which is symbolically extremely potent.</p>
<p>You can imagine the the first degree of the zodiac in some sense it speaks to the theme of of birth and rebirth. And in general, these conjunctions of Saturn and Neptune, they tend to bring periods where our ideas about how the world is structured are essentially dissolved and new myths and stories that we tell ourselves about how the world works come into their place. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is often accompanied by dramatic world events as well. Um, if we look at the last time this happened, last time Saturn met Saturn met Neptune, it was 1989 and it was the the fall of the Berlin Wall. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, obviously that was a massive event, but it also set up a period of history. You know, it kind of the Soviet Union fell. We entered this uniolar world order where the United States was the sole superpower. But another another aspect of the the order that we entered was that was this idea that we were living in a you know a rules-based international order that there were these international institutions and law that governed how things worked. And even though everybody knew that, you know, the US was the most powerful country and could essentially do what it it wanted, there was always some sort of lip service paid to international law, international institutions and so forth.</p>
<p>You know, you think about uh George Bush invading Iraq, for example. You know, they they he he they determined that they were going to do that, but they did put a lot of effort into trying to assemble. Yeah. Selling it, getting a coalition, sending Colon Powell to the UN, &gt;&gt; you know, um sending in weapons inspectors, all of that kind of thing. &gt;&gt; Um and that last uh that last cycle had this this this theme, I think.</p>
<p>And you you&#x27;re now seeing a lot of commentators basically saying that that that world order that so-called rules-based international order is finished. You&#x27;re seeing very senior politicians saying it. Mark Carney just said it at at Davos. I think um some of the politicians at the Munich Security Conference, which has been going on this week, have been saying the same thing. I think Friedrich Mertz, the German leader, said the same thing.</p>
<p>You know, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s what everybody is seeing. Um, and if you look at some of the things that have happened, some of the things that that President Trump has done, for example, with, you know, what recently happened in Venezuela, &gt;&gt; um, &gt;&gt; unilateral &gt;&gt; military action. Yeah. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>And and so what we&#x27;re seeing, you know, as an astrologer, you&#x27;re seeing, okay, we&#x27;re expecting this this conjunction which is going to initiate some new phase of world history, a a new world order, you could say. I&#x27;ve actually been calling it a new world disorder. Um because just to contrast it with this sort of so-called rules-based international order um we can also see this in the astrology of where these conjunctions take place. Which sign do they take place? So the 1989 conjunction took place in Capricorn. Capricorn is this sign of um human institutions and things that we&#x27;ve built the struct the extent structures that govern manifest reality &gt;&gt; among other things.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what Capricorn is about. And then you get this rules-based international order with these institutions that are supposedly supposed to be kind of governing things. Um then the conjunction we&#x27;re seeing this week is happening in Aries, the first sign of the zodiac. Aries is this sign that&#x27;s ruled by Mars, you know, the god of war. Aries is the first sign.</p>
<p>It has this um sense of acting without kind of concern about these kind of larger structures. It&#x27;s just about kind of following the will and doing what one wills, what one feels driven to do based on, you know, the intuition and the kind of fire that drives us. there&#x27;s a certain um there&#x27;s a certain almost innocence to Aries in that it&#x27;s not really um concerned about justifying itself or about the bigger picture. It just acts essentially and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing. So, &gt;&gt; you know, we&#x27;ve kind of we&#x27;re entering this new phase of history.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s it going to look like? Well, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s difficult to say, but you can get a lot of clues by just watching what&#x27;s happening now. And &gt;&gt; yeah, and there&#x27;s also another aspect of these Saturn Neptune conjunctions in particular is a sense of dissolution of the previous way of understanding the world. Um, and you know, if you think about all this stuff that&#x27;s coming out with the Epstein files right now, &gt;&gt; what&#x27;s being revealed through their release, we&#x27;re seeing this picture painted now to some, you know, quote unquote conspiracy theorists. what&#x27;s being what&#x27;s coming out is is nothing new. But to a lot of other people who haven&#x27;t taken the time to go into some of this stuff, they&#x27;re seeing their picture of the world melting down a little bit because we&#x27;re seeing that there are these other power structures that operate in the background completely amoral if not e evil.</p>
<p>um this sense that that powerful figures whether it&#x27;s in business, politics, civil society, um science are linked by these networks behind the scenes and that they use these horrific kind of methods of keeping everybody in line. They commit abuses and so forth and there&#x27;s this sense of mutual mutually assured destruction. You know, we&#x27;ve all done terrible things so I&#x27;m not going to tell on you. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not going to say anything. Yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly. And there&#x27;s people that are from every, like you were saying a minute ago, every walk of life. It&#x27;s not as if it&#x27;s contained merely to conservative politicians or, you know, I mean, it&#x27;s like he had everyone on his island and he was contacting everyone, spread his influence far and wide. So, it really does a lot to undermine our conception of the whole sort of elite class of humans, you know, and it&#x27;s uh could be deeply upset un unsettling for folks. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think you&#x27;re you&#x27;re right. It&#x27;s the the the one of the things that&#x27;s eye openening is the way as you say that it kind of transcends partisan political boundaries. There are these power structures that are above the I use the word above advisedly. I don&#x27;t mean that in the sense that they&#x27;re better, but you know, there are power structures that operate behind the scenes that kind of have their tentacles on both sides, so to speak. Um, are interested influencing politicians of all stripes because they have certain goals that they&#x27;re trying to achieve, certain things that they want to do in finance, in global governance, etc.</p>
<p>and they don&#x27;t really care what a politician presents as, you know, I&#x27;m a I&#x27;m a liberal, I&#x27;m a conservative. That&#x27;s all, you know, essentially. And it and it really does vindicate again what quote unquote conspiracy theorists have been saying, which is that um that the leftright dichotomy is in some sense a bit of a bit of theater, sideshow theater. It&#x27;s &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s not real. It&#x27;s show business.</p>
<p>Um and you know we know that there are diff you know people do have political differences they always they always have but what we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve kind of seen is the way I think that um there are other there are other goals that power has which um transcend those sort of superficial differences. there are things that it&#x27;s trying to do and it uses extremely ruthless methods methods to do it and the astrology just to bring it back in we have this sense of um dissolution of the old order or how at least what we thought was the order um what&#x27;s coming in its place is not yet is not yet clear and you know how far this is going to go again is not yet clear but I personally think it&#x27;s going to go a lot further over the next few years um and we we&#x27;ve really just we&#x27;ve seen a kind of a particular milestone. these conjunctions and the way astrology works is that there are kind of periods where you can say that two planets are interacting with each other and then they have exact moments where they&#x27;re ex you know where we can see that they&#x27;re exactly conjunct which in this case is the 20th of February where Saturn and Neptune will be conjunct but they&#x27;ve been they&#x27;ve been in in kind of in conversation with each other let&#x27;s say for you know at least um two or three years now where they&#x27;ve been quite close together. But we we also tend to see when you get close to the exact conjunction events that are serve as kind of punctuation marks. And I think the release of these 3 million Epstein files is absolutely one of those.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can I say also that it&#x27;s I mean I totally agree with what you&#x27;re saying, but there&#x27;s also the surrounding circumstances around the release of those files. I mean, everything that&#x27;s happened along with it is also un like undermining that same thing that you&#x27;re talking about, like the way the uh attorney general has been selective and trying to protect certain people and um you know, hiding certain names of the rich and powerful while releasing the names of victims. It just all goes to sort of serve that same purpose of like the elites shouldn&#x27;t be trusted.</p>
<p>We need to rethink how much we&#x27;re investing in these folks because they&#x27;re don&#x27;t necessarily have our our best interests at heart. And that&#x27;s um powerful medicine. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, you know, a very famous astrologer, Richard Tarnis, I know you&#x27;ve had on this channel.</p>
<p>He has written really eloquently about Saturn Neptune. Um there&#x27;s essentially a mood of disillusion. There&#x27;s a certain sadness about it. It&#x27;s like, oh my god, is this the world that we live in really? And I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve felt that over the past couple of weeks. Um it&#x27;s not that we didn&#x27;t kind of know some of this stuff because there have already been things coming out about the Epstein files for a while, but um I I&#x27;ve spent some time just reading what people are saying about this and the various files that they&#x27;ve picked out.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really uh sad saddening to and sobering to know that we &gt;&gt; live in this the world of this kind. And again it&#x27;s the archetypal flavor of Saturn Neptune is diselusion. The illusion that we were living under is shown to have been false. And during this period there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s also a sense of kind of you know of of illusion of our illusions being stripped away and then new ones will take their place. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>If you think about reality as as Maya, as the world of illusion, then it it&#x27;s not as it&#x27;s I&#x27;m not certain that it&#x27;s quite so much like um we&#x27;re going to now enter a new era of where, you know, of truth and where we no longer have any illusions about the world. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s possible, but we we may. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re humans after all. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Um, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s possible, but we may um be able to build up new stories and myths that are at least healthier um and and we can do some process of perhaps deconstructing some of these power structures.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen um how how far this is going to go, but astrologers uh are well aware of the history of some of the other cycles that are underway right now. I think I might have mentioned last time, I&#x27;m not sure, but Pluto is in Aquarius now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And this is a cycle whenever Pluto&#x27;s been in Aquarius. Well, the last time was the American Revolution and the French Revolution.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So people are very well aware of that. Um &gt;&gt; and that&#x27;s now the fact that they are on top of each other sort of. I mean does that redown? I mean, does that make it exponential in terms of its uh power or is that uh I mean, are they different energy sources, different directions? You know what I&#x27;m saying? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>This is where astrology gets complicated because you have all these different um influences that are layered on top of each other, all these different things that are happening at the same time that speak to different aspects of reality. And what an astrologer is charged with doing is somehow trying to put these different signals together into a coherent message which can get really difficult when the when the world is as confusing as it it is right now. But yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s you have to think about the current moment is always a kind of composite of all of these different processes and cycles and impulses that are interacting with each other. And so Pluto in Aquarius again has this historical resonance with these revolutionary periods. You can go back another 250 years before the uh American French revolutions and you get to the Protestant Reformation.</p>
<p>Um you get, you know, Henry VIII is act is active supremacy and all of that. Um, and there&#x27;s an astrologer named Rosie Finn who has done a lot of research on these these Pluto in Aquarius transits going back very far into history going back thousands of years. And what she&#x27;s seen is that when Pluto is doing what it&#x27;s doing now, it&#x27;s actually uh its declination, it&#x27;s in the south declination. And it&#x27;s a bit of a technical thing, but when it&#x27;s kind of gone into Aquarius in in its south declination, it&#x27;s tended to see the um rebellions and people rising up uh to try to overthrow power structures. And so you can you can imagine that this Saturn Neptune um aspect is kind of like it&#x27;s bringing us a sort of a part of that story.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve seen some illusion stripped away and that is then feeding into the Plutonian impulse to which is also one of of revelation from below. Revelation of the unsemly aspects of reality which then cause eruptions in the public sphere. And so there is also that um I I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about this lately and I I&#x27;m it&#x27;s it it you know I I hope that there is some a sense of some kind of revolution over the next few years that does clear away these clearly evil um power structures. But it&#x27;s not quite as simple as that. I think um if you look back for example at the French Revolution &gt;&gt; lots of blood lots of lots of I mean &gt;&gt; well there&#x27;s that there&#x27;s that which is you know extremely troubling a lot of lot of blood we had the terror but also you know it depends on how you interpret the French revolution as well because there I think a lot of people have the idea of a of it being a sort of uprising of the commoners um but there&#x27;s another perspective on it which is really it was a a bourgeoa driven uprising the rising class of that time was the with with the bourgeoa traders, merchants and so forth.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. The merchant class who were considered part of the uh the the commoners, the third the the estate of the commoners in the French state um versus the clergy and the nobility who had higher status in French society. The merchants even though many of them were richer than the aristocrats were considered commoners and of course they didn&#x27;t like that. They played a very important driving role in the French Revolution. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s not as simple as you know some as the commoners rising up there always forces leading these things.</p>
<p>So you know if you if you think about it from that perspective then you have to also bear in mind that sort of quote unquote revolutions firstly as you say they can be very bloody and not not things to be to um to take lightly and secondly um you also have to look at you know who who might be trying to to take the place of the current elite class and who is the rising class which might be wanting to ally with the common people so to speak to overthrow these corrupt power structures which is where you kind of think is this the sort of certain tech oligarchs maybe a certain Elon Musk or Peter Teal or people figures like this &gt;&gt; are they kind of angling to kind of clear out this old structure and replace them with themselves and so it&#x27;s interesting you know astrology can kind of reveal these interesting kind of historical comparisons which become very relevant and can inform your understanding of the current time. So, I&#x27;m a bit &gt;&gt; almost troubled by this to be honest, James. I&#x27;m trying to &gt;&gt; because I I want to believe in the the uh the best possible outcome for for we the people and I hope we do get that. But, um reality is messy. &gt;&gt; It is.</p>
<p>And you know, I mean, I I think that self-ruule is uh, you know, a democracy in the larger sense, not uh, capitalistic western democracy as it&#x27;s come to be known, but people choosing their own leadership, I think is huge. And when you enter the chaos of a revolution and, you know, uh, people are fighting and killing each other, there&#x27;s no way to be sure where you&#x27;re ultimately going to end up. And it&#x27;s really troubling to me that you mentioned, you know, the the astrology of all this because I can see and sense the uh divide growing in this country, the violence that shows up through like the um you know, the ICE enforcement and the people on the streets of Minneapolis who are uh rightfully I think indignant about the way that they&#x27;ve been treated and the violence that&#x27;s shown up. I mean, on Reddit, there&#x27;s like left-wing groups that are now gun clubs because they want to make sure that they can protect themselves against both right-wing, you know, groups who have the same kinds of uh um you know, interest in guns, but then also against a potentially authoritarian government. Like the what would have seemed absolutely absurd that there could be a civil war in America um you know, 5 years ago, 10 years ago, is now not that crazy of an idea.</p>
<p>Uh and it&#x27;s scary to know that we&#x27;re actually on a uh you know historical cosmic track uh energetically that can back that up you know uh so we have to be very I think conscious moving forward of the energies that are at play and try to I mean even if we are ultimately forced into conflict that we do it intelligently as we as as much as possible. I mean, it&#x27;s just uh it reminds me how small, you know, we all are and against the tides of of history and all of this. It&#x27;s like we&#x27;re getting strung along and uh what can we do as individuals to fight off things that are this huge, you know? It&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s scary. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I I agree. And I think something that probably a lot of us might be reckoning with is that you we&#x27;re all kind of expected to pay attention to everything that&#x27;s going on in the world, which is a really odd and unusual thing in history. You know, people usually just were concerned with the people around them, maybe their family, maybe their, you know, the town that they lived in and um and then later on maybe their nation and so forth. But now we&#x27;ve got this this uh technology that forces us to be conscious of everything and demands our attention and what about this and what about this and but isn&#x27;t this important but isn&#x27;t that important? And we also I think are faced with this feeling of like oh what am I going to what can I do about this? Um, and we I think one of the things we have to realize is we&#x27;re not individually responsible for the whole picture and to to &gt;&gt; to do what we can do as individuals to keep ourselves right. Maybe to contribute in the small way that we we can but without taking the whole the burden of the whole situation on our our shoulders because we we we we can&#x27;t shoulder it.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s interesting actually that you mentioned the civil war and that&#x27;s another interesting facet of the the current moment which has got astrologers going yeah we&#x27;ve been here before because um Neptune has just moved into Aries again the first sign of the zodiac where it&#x27;s meeting Saturn in this conjunction this week. Neptune cycle is 165 years long &gt;&gt; and so the last time it did this &gt;&gt; it was 186 61. &gt;&gt; So um yeah this is another factor where we can see that that there&#x27;s actually a lot of historical resonance and astrological resonance between this moment and the outbreak of the civil war. And you can kind of see that um you can see the divide in the in the US obviously everybody knows about it and um as an astrologer when you&#x27;re kind of you know the history you know what Neptune in Aries has brought previously and then you see on the ground what&#x27;s happening and what&#x27;s building um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s worrying and you can kind of see a kind of confluence of things. It&#x27;s like that&#x27;s what&#x27;s weird about this current moment as you mentioned when we were talking earlier.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s kind of everything all at once. We have um this dissolution of our understanding of the kind of power structures that govern the world. Um we have all this great geopolitical tension including with the war in Ukraine, what&#x27;s going on in Gaza and Iran, all of that stuff. uh we have the civil tensions in in the US and in you know across the world or in so many places as well. We have things like UFO disclosure.</p>
<p>We have the rise of AI. &gt;&gt; Even if you you didn&#x27;t do any astrology, you don&#x27;t need astrology to see that we we&#x27;ve got a confluence of really transformative factors at the moment. And it&#x27;s &gt;&gt; and that&#x27;s not even talking about global warming. I mean, you know, which our planet is having fits environmentally that we&#x27;re all kind of riding along which are starting to accelerate. I mean, every aspect of human uh um existence right now is on uh quicksand, you know, it&#x27;s all shaky foundations.</p>
<p>And uh yeah, it&#x27;s a daunting time. And I uh you know for myself I&#x27;ve found that turning back on these sort of esoteric subjects like I mentioned in the beginning and sort of trying to um explore uh the wisdom of the ancients but then also doing so with a mind for what science has taught us over the past 2,000 years. It&#x27;s like I uh I find comfort that there is a throughine um that you know uh based on all of that history we will get through it. We&#x27;ve always gotten through it in some form or another. and that perhaps this is a way that we shake off um some of the old uh you know philosophical detritus that&#x27;s kept us lock in locked into certain worldviews.</p>
<p>Um and so part of what I hope to do is to work on uh influencing the coming change by being a uh an advocate for uh positivity in that space and trying to open people&#x27;s minds. But um yeah, again like you were saying before, it&#x27;s like none of us are entirely responsible. We all just have to kind of be as as good as we can in our own space and make as positive positive a contribution as as we can make. Um, knowing that the world is going to do what the world&#x27;s going to do, &gt;&gt; too, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I I wandered into a secondhand bookshop the other day, week or two ago, just as I was getting the sense that it&#x27;s almost like there&#x27;s some sort of um spiritual battle underway right now. &gt;&gt; And I wandered into this shop and I was looking for the spirituality astrology section. went up two floors to the top of this old building and right in front of me on the bookshelf kind of in its own place separated from all the other books was the Bagavad Gita and I took that as a sign like I&#x27;m supposed to buy this book because I&#x27;d never read the Bagavad Gita and um &gt;&gt; so I bought it and I read it this week and &gt;&gt; you know as an astrologer or somebody who&#x27;s used to kind of reading signs you you kind of get used uh synchronicities and when you think you you you&#x27;ve been led to some sort of message that you&#x27;re supposed to take in and so that was absolutely what happened there and I thought I need to to read the book and I read the book and you know one of the striking things that Krishna tells Arjuna is the the need in the in this great battle that they&#x27;re participating in for him to just to do his duty and to not worry about so much about well my um my family members are on the other and all these kind of things that he&#x27;s um upset about. He says your part is just to do your part in this battle. And that&#x27;s what I have in in mind over this period.</p>
<p>Just don&#x27;t get in don&#x27;t get overwhelmed with the sense that it&#x27;s all on your shoulders because it isn&#x27;t. Just figure out what is yours to do and do that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I uh I too have had a sense of the spiritual battle thing that uh and I keep coming back to the gnostic idea of there being uh this sort of artificial uh spirituality um artificial uh fake spirituality uh fake beingness almost uh and being on one side and then sort of the earnest message um which are represented by all the esoteric traditions of almost all the faiths. All the faith have a you know sort of the public message that they give out to the sort of you know normal followers but then they also have a mystical side that&#x27;s based on transcendental experience of early practitioners that is much more coded but is often has to do with planetary energies believe it or not and uh astrology I mean all the way back through history all the faiths had astrological predilictions which is was shocking to me to discover but uh as we see the rise of AI I can&#x27;t help but read it like you know um is that the sort of antichrist energy that has been predicted you know because it is um not alive it is something that is going to be eminently practical eminently brilliant but has no sense of empathy uh besides what we program into it it&#x27;s not going to have any human connection because it can&#x27;t possibly have any human connection so I mean we&#x27;re at this forking of the path where we choose you know which directions we&#x27;re going to want to go and I think it&#x27;s going to we um you know the choice we make is going to determine a lot of what our future is and so we need to think very carefully about who we follow uh you know oops anyway yeah that&#x27;s just sort of something I keep when I&#x27;m laying awake at night thinking about the the world situation I&#x27;m like this AI thing means something about human existence and I don&#x27;t know what it is and I&#x27;m not saying that all AI is going to be evil I use chat GPT occasionally that&#x27;s but you know if we surrender all of our decision-m and future planning to to a machine that doesn&#x27;t, you know, have the same emotional landscape that we do.</p>
<p>I think we&#x27;re going to be losing something in that in that exchange. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very interesting that you mention nasticism um because this is something I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about recently um for astrological reasons. If you if you think about some of the things that we&#x27;re dealing with in the world today, including of course AI, the threat of nuclear weapons being another one, and then just the very world order that emerged at the end of the Second World War. Go back to the year 1945 when the second world war ended and you have the explosion exploding of nuclear weapons for the first time &gt;&gt; in 1945.</p>
<p>You also have the invention of the first computer or the ENIAC &gt;&gt; computer 1945 1947 very soon after we have the the transistor which facilitates the information technology revolution and we have UFOs appearing on the scene at that time or around that time. And in 1945 we also had the discovery of the Nagamadi library. &gt;&gt; Yeah. in Egypt, this huge trove of Gnostic texts. &gt;&gt; And you surely when you just look at the lineup of things that happened at that time, you know, astrologers say moments in time have equality and when you have like a lineup of all these kind of worldchanging developments that are seemingly kind of independent coming at almost the same time, you have to wonder, you know, are the are the astrologers maybe on to something? There&#x27;s there was something there.</p>
<p>And you know, if we think about what the Gnostic texts are telling us, among other things, they talk about the the demiurge and the the false god that rules this material reality and it&#x27;s archons, these kind of these these forces that structure &gt;&gt; our reality. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; which are in some readings are the planetary uh gods. &gt;&gt; Yes. which are the which are what we&#x27;re talking about when we&#x27;re talking about you know the planets is how they used to describe those things which &gt;&gt; absolutely fascinating &gt;&gt; yeah true it&#x27;s in some read readings it is the the entities that lie behind the planets um but also something that you see withnosticism I think is that it originally grew at a time of empire the time the Roman Empire ruled Egypt and Alexandria and you had this extremely powerful mundane power structure which you know controlled a large sway of the of the world and there&#x27;s something about um I think um great sort of power in the world that leads people towards gnostic thinking and we&#x27;re kind of faced with that now as you say um these archons are said to be these kind these forces which can&#x27;t really be negotiated with. They&#x27;re just uh they just rule the world.</p>
<p>And uh if you look at some of the things that are being invented right now in fact that have come out just this month we saw this um saw this whole story around Moltzbook where people have sent these a AI agents to interact with each other in a social network and people have started I&#x27;ve seen um websites that allow AIS to actually hire people to do tasks. So literally what&#x27;s happening now is people are are working for AIS and if you you know if I don&#x27;t think you could kind of come up with a better way that the kind of gnostic vision could kind of manifest in the world in a very almost sort of literal fashion than with what&#x27;s just happening right now. Now the the other interesting thing is if you if you go back to 1945 that time is also highly cyclally resonant to right now right we&#x27;re reaching the Uranus return of that time Uranus&#x27;s cycle is 84 years so in the next you know in a few years time 2029 2030 we get to the Uranus return of 1945 the Pluto opposition and the Neptune opposition and in astrology we&#x27;re looking for kind of these kind of cyclical resonances and moments and what we call aspects um that tend to mark shifts and changes. So right now and leading up to 29 2030 we&#x27;re coming to this moment of great cyclical resonance of 1945 where all all of these kind of things that are consuming the world right now emerged all at once as well as the Gnostic wisdom perhaps to live in a world dominated by archons. you know, how to how to connect with the divine and how to understand that this world isn&#x27;t all there is as the the the Gnostics practiced.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s I think a really important signal that we need to to pay attention to. I I haven&#x27;t read that many of the Gnostic texts myself, but it&#x27;s on on my list to do to give them some more study. Yeah, I&#x27;ve read about them a bunch by people who&#x27;ve written commentaries and whatnot, but I haven&#x27;t actually read some of the do read the documents themselves, the originals. Uh, but uh it&#x27;s a radically different reviewing of, you know, all of the sort of the ancient traditions that we&#x27;ve been handed through dogma in the church and elsewhere. it throws a lot of that on its ear and resurrects things like the divine feminine which is something that uh you know a lot of people uh including Chris Bledsoe um have been saying are are reemerging now which which could be a part of all that.</p>
<p>I mean maybe that&#x27;s to pave the way for the reemergence of of Sophia uh you know or um something along those lines. I noticed that you did you have been posting about Chris Bledsoe as well and I know that he&#x27;s been talking about um his the return of the star Regulus and it&#x27;s supposed to line up with the Sphinx and at that point there&#x27;s supposed to be some sort of manifestation or something. Can you talk a little bit about what you posted and what your thoughts are on on all of that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;ve been intrigued by Chris Bledsoe for a little while. Um &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s I mean Yeah, me too. He&#x27;s Yeah, I&#x27;ve watched I&#x27;ve watched a few interviews with him and my sense is that he&#x27;s an you know an earnest and honest fellow.</p>
<p>You know, I I I don&#x27;t essentially believe that he&#x27;s experienced what he says he&#x27;s experienced. And of course among those experiences in 2012 he had this first encounter with this luminous female be being this um beautiful blonde lady in a kind of tunic um who first appeared in the form of a bull which is interesting. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Um, and Chris, I think, has since suggested that this may have been some sort of representative of of Hatheror, the Egyptian &gt;&gt; cow goddess. But, as you say, this lady gave Chris this prophecy.</p>
<p>Um, when the red star of Regulus rises in the gaze of the Sphinx, a new knowledge will come into the world. And Chris has since said that he&#x27;s been told by other people around him. And I think he he had, you know, he&#x27;s quite well connected in, let&#x27;s say, intelligence, national security circles because a lot of these people have paid a lot of attention to him in his case. Um, and I think he&#x27;s in contact with people from NASA as well. And he&#x27;s said that he&#x27;s been told that this alignment happens in 2026.</p>
<p>and he&#x27;s said I think um around Easter of 2026 he may have gone backwards and forwards a little bit and and mentioned um September October once or twice um but generally he seems to say he seems to think that the the references to Easter now I&#x27;ve looked at this prophecy and there are some weird things that don&#x27;t really add up about it he&#x27;s saying when when Regulus rises just before dawn in the gaze of the Sphinx what he&#x27;s referring to I think is what we call the helical rising of he of of Regulus which is essentially when it it first emerges um from the beams of the sun and becomes visible just before dawn. Of course after dawn the sun rises and then you can&#x27;t see any stars but just before that the helical rising regulus will be visible uh in the in the east. So the sphinx faces east. Now a couple of weird things that are sort of problematic here is that firstly Regulus isn&#x27;t a red star. It&#x27;s a blue star.</p>
<p>Um, &gt;&gt; and secondly, the helical rise of Regulus comes in early September, not Easter. So, it&#x27;s only it&#x27;s only early September that that will actually happen. So, there are some weird things here. And &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m trying not to make any strict judgments on this. You know, will it happen? Will it be a nothing burger? May be um will something happen? Possibly.</p>
<p>I have some astrological reasons for thinking that um it&#x27;s possible that we might see some interesting things um this this year. One of them is the history of these Saturn Neptune conjunctions which we&#x27;ve already been talking about. So we have one of them this year. It&#x27;s going exact in 3 days, but it will still be in effect, let&#x27;s say, through 2026 because the two planets will still be close enough that we consider them in conjunction. And if you look back at the history of these conjunctions, there was one in 1917, which was the year of the Fatima miracle and the miracle of the sun, which is this story, imagine quite a lot of your viewers will be aware of where these um shepherd children in in Fatima, Portugal, had this series of uh meetings with a a Marian apparition.</p>
<p>So it was it was a quite a similar apparition to what Chris Bledo has described. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. A luminous female figure &gt;&gt; um who was later who never actually selfidentified as the Virgin Mary, but people around the children said, &quot;Oh, that must be that was the Virgin Mary.&quot; And that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s gone down.</p>
<p>You know, it&#x27;s obviously in a uh it&#x27;s a Catholic miracle. But they saw this series of apparitions and then the culmination of this series of events in October of 1917. There was what there was this um essentially a big gathering of people because the the being had told the children, I will show you something to prove that this is all real. So all these people gathered in one place near Fatima and they saw this remarkable event in the sky where people described the sun sort of zigzagging through the sky and multicolors and um the rain that had been kind of getting completely dried out of people&#x27;s clothes and all sorts of strange things. And the Jack Valet, for example, has has analyzed this event and he suggested it&#x27;s very similar to a to a lot of UFO events.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So, we have this thing that came at one of these previous conjunctions. Um there&#x27;s something also about these Saturn Neptune conjunctions that suggests a kind of thinning thinning of the veil because for astrologers Saturn is the planet that represents concrete reality and Neptune is the the ideal or the the the uh ephemeral the imaginal and when those two planets come together there&#x27;s a certain kind of level of dissolution of material reality or our sense of material reality. We&#x27;re seeing it in the the way that we&#x27;re being sort of disabused of our notions about the power structures of the world. But but the history of these conjunctions, you tend to see important milestones in UFO history or with kind of strange happenings of this kind.</p>
<p>So I&#x27;m thinking, you know, I&#x27;m know I know what happened in 1917 at Saturn Neptune conjunction. We have Chris Bledso pointing specifically to 2026 describing a very similar visitation entity. And so I find that intriguing. There&#x27;s another um interesting aspect to this because Bledsoe first meet meets the lady in 2012, I believe, or 2013. Um maybe it&#x27;s 2013.</p>
<p>I might have been wrong when I said 2012, but it&#x27;s I think it&#x27;s 2013 now. Um, one interesting thing that I found looking at what the star Regulus has done is I&#x27;m not sure if all of your viewers will be aware, but there are actually more than one zodiacs used by astrologers. There&#x27;s the tropical zodiac, which is aligned with the seasons, the equinoxes and solstesses, and there&#x27;s the cidurial zodiac, which is aligned with the the actual constellations, even though it&#x27;s still an idealized zodiac. Um, now due to this phenomenon called the procession of the equinoxes, the two zodiacs are gradually moving apart away from each other. This is, you know, Hamlet&#x27;s Mill, if you know that, that book.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That book. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And so what this means is that the actual stars in the sky, including Regulus, gradually shift through the tropical zodiac uh over time, and they&#x27;ll spend about 2,150 years in each of the zodiac signs before they move to a new sign. Now, what&#x27;s interesting is that at the end of 2012, Regulus moved from the sign of Leo, right? This is the sun sign, the sign of kingship. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Into the sign of Virgo, which is the only sign of the zod of the zodiac to depict a woman, a maiden. And I find that very interesting because this transition happens at the end of 2012 right at the time that he has this famous encount now famous encounter with this sort of divine feminine goddess like figure who gives him this u this prediction.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It again I don&#x27;t really know what to to make of some of this stuff. Yeah, there are there&#x27;s astrology that I&#x27;m doing where I&#x27;m on you&#x27;re on much more comfortable ground when you&#x27;re kind of talking about more mundane developments and you can kind of be a bit more concrete about what you think it means. I don&#x27;t really know what it means. I&#x27;ve like looked at all of these different signals, seen them lining up. It makes me think it&#x27;s at least possible that perhaps um BTO may end up being correct.</p>
<p>And what he&#x27;s actually predicted is or at least the lady told him is that the a new knowledge will come into the world. Um and you know looking at what&#x27;s happening right now with what&#x27;s coming out now about the Epstein files and stuff. Would you bet against that? I I&#x27;m not sure I would. you know, we a new knowledge. I mean, we&#x27;ve also got all these stories about how perhaps President Trump has a speech lined up &gt;&gt; and around Easter, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh, is it has it been moved to Easter? So, I heard that it was it was July that he was originally supposed to &gt;&gt; Maybe that&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Maybe I heard I&#x27;m misremembering. Uh but okay, so July, but yeah. Um, I have mixed feelings about a Donald Trump disclosure. Even if it happened, I I&#x27;m conflicted because I think people would immediately dismiss it based on his track record. But, uh, yeah, who knows? &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; any truth is welcome, I guess.</p>
<p>But if, you know, if it&#x27;s going to be something where like, is he doing this because he wants to distract the people from the Epstein files? So, let&#x27;s just throw up a bunch of chaff. Aliens are real. uh whatever else he can possibly come up with that would that would be really dramatic and distracting. Half the country is going to be like you know? &gt;&gt; Right. Well, you know, yeah, I think there&#x27;s definitely some truth in that.</p>
<p>A lot of people won&#x27;t believe it. But I still kind of wonder if you know, people are skeptical about government disclosure and rightly so because this is a maybe perhaps not not a phenomenon that&#x27;s, you know, the government&#x27;s responsibility to tell us what it means. you know, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of a it&#x27;s much more deep deeper and more profound than that with big spiritual implications and and so that&#x27;s not something that you need that your government to say this is what it is. Um, and I totally agree and see that perspective, but I also do think that it can open the door. &gt;&gt; It can it can &gt;&gt; it can make people say, well, is it, you know, he&#x27;s he said this and um and and that will then potentially lead to a lot more questions being asked.</p>
<p>So um I do think it&#x27;s significant. I do I do think that there are probably you know elements in national security circles for example who or intelligence circles that want to mold the narrative in certain ways. I can kind of see that argument for sure but I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think they can they necessarily keep control of it once it&#x27;s sort of out the bag. I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. No, I totally agree and I think that you&#x27;re right that they don&#x27;t need to interpret it for us. What we need to hear is that something is going on. Something is real about we&#x27;re encountering some kind of other intelligence. And if they go that far and no further, then all of a sudden even the people who oppose Donald Trump as a political figure will rush to the subject to disprove him, you know, to call him out as a liar, which will then just open the subject further on for more and more people to kind of encounter the evidence that um if you get further far enough along, I think it&#x27;s incontrovertible that something is going on, but people just often so quickly dismiss it because of whatever biases they bring, you know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, yeah. And and you know if you if you&#x27;re kind of worried about well you know half the country is going to going to say well we don&#x27;t believe you if if Donald Trump says it but Barack Obama&#x27;s just just said it as well in an interview. He just uh it&#x27;s all over the place that Yeah. &gt;&gt; back which was so so frustrating. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>Right. It was weird. Yeah. There was this interview and this guy asks him are aliens real and he said yes they&#x27;re real. And then he offered some, you know, but you know, some some explanation about I think the unit, but they&#x27;re not here or something like that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He said that they&#x27;re Yeah, I haven&#x27;t seen them and they&#x27;re not at Area 51 and the underground bases because I don&#x27;t think underground bases are real unless they that&#x27;s a huge conspiracy kept even from presidents. &gt;&gt; All right. Yes, you&#x27;re right. &gt;&gt; And then, as you say, he&#x27;s walked it he&#x27;s walked it back now, which is kind of odd. But um we you know if Trump does say that then you do have obviously a de democrat president also saying the same thing this year.</p>
<p>So you know I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know like is is Chris going to be end up being on the money? I I I think if you also look at the some of the stuff that&#x27;s happening with Egypt as well, you know, these kind of these synthetic aperture radar scans with the area beneath the pyramid, which you know, I know some people are skeptical about, but um that also looks to me like, you know, it offers the potential for new knowledge to come into the world. There were very, you know, long-standing rumors and stories and uh the statements of Ed Ed Casey also testify to this that there are &gt;&gt; pyramids. Yeah. interesting to me that you talked about nakamati and that was basically new knowledge um getting released into the world. Uh it&#x27;s very much the same and if it&#x27;s following the astronomical energetic cycles that would line up perfectly between 1945 like you were saying and the current day and it matches.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s some heavy pointers saying that in this area maybe something is going to be popping up. That&#x27;s exciting. &gt;&gt; It is. It is. You know I I there are the ast the astrological weather this year really does point to new knowledge coming into the world.</p>
<p>So you know this is as you say the cyclical resonances with with nagamadi and various other factors they they are lining up. There are also other other cycles that speak to UFO disclosure and so forth. Um, something else that I&#x27;ve noted is that there is a eclipse happening in August in the sign of Leo &gt;&gt; and that eclipse is uh hitting important points in the charts of quite a number of spiritual teachers of the 20th century and 19th and 20th. um Rudolph Steiner, Helena Bllovatzky, Edgar Casey um all these kind of figures who were I think in different ways partly responsible for the the sort of emergence of modern spirituality and new age thinking and all that kind of thing. Um and they all talked about Atlantis among other things and that then connects to Egypt.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got Bledsoe talking about the Sphinx and so forth. you know, there&#x27;s this kind of there&#x27;s all these strange factors coming in and yeah, what what it all means, I don&#x27;t know, but I would not necessarily bet against Bledo there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I wouldn&#x27;t either. I mean, and even if you are totally cynical and you want to think that he&#x27;s uh you know, part of some intelligence effort to move along disclosure or anything else like he like you said is he is in close with a lot of intelligence uh types.</p>
<p>Uh Jim Semivian for instance is a family friend. I mean so the idea that uh he may know things not only from his own personal experiences but from things he&#x27;s hearing on the um the grapevine about you know certain dates coming forward. There&#x27;s just a lot of smoke there for there to be no fire. Um so I I hope so. Um I think it would do my channel some good.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. No, I I agree. I mean the there&#x27;s the the astrological cycles are lining up to tell us that new knowledge is coming into the world, but we&#x27;re also in a time of great upheaval as well. Um and things are feeling a little a little bit biblical right now. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d almost use that word.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I I mean I think I totally feel that and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re all of these things are happening. um we&#x27;re at the confluence of you know like you were pointing out all these different threads and then we&#x27;re also living at a time where information is just at our fingertips constantly and it&#x27;s like how are people not going to be overwhelmed? We&#x27;re already overwhelmed just like we were saying before with following the news of all of this stuff. But then if some really heavy onlogical stuff gets thrown into the mix on top of that, what happens to society? I mean, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not as if it&#x27;s just one thing, but we&#x27;re talking about undermining government, uh, economics, religion, um, science, every aspect of, uh, human, you know, beingness of the 21st century has, um, a a fracture in its, uh, structure at this point. So, give it enough of a shake.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&#x27;s not to say the end result won&#x27;t be good. Earlier you were talking about how uh after the cold war, the last time we had this uh Neptune um cycle that you were talking about um it started off with you know the unipolar government or the unipolar status of the United States being the only superpower and it was a change from from the cold war and that seemed like a positive development at the time but then over time it turned out that that was actually problematic and it led to the moment that we&#x27;re in now. So over the course of that cycle, what was positive turned to negative? So can we look forward to that flip? I mean it&#x27;s like what seems negative now does that over the course of the cycle flip so that it you know the positive side of it arises near the end of it? I mean that&#x27;s only what we can hope for, right? I mean is that &gt;&gt; I mean &gt;&gt; yeah I mean that that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s one way of seeing it. I I think um I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s it&#x27;s all going to shake out to be honest. Uh I I I don&#x27;t think anybody can &gt;&gt; predict can predict can predict it.</p>
<p>You know even if you&#x27;ve got astrology as a tool I&#x27;d be I&#x27;d be a little bit um a little bit skeptical about anybody in astrologers included who tell you that they know what&#x27;s going to happen and too much I don&#x27;t know where they get their their certainty from. Um because we we we can&#x27;t hold all this in our in in mind and I don&#x27;t know if anybody has a monopoly on the truth. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s all too too complex but yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s possible. I mean there are certain aspects of the astrology of this year that are very uh positive looking and we shouldn&#x27;t lose sight of that. There was a very famous astrologer who&#x27;s now deceased named Andre Barau who made some extremely positive statements about the astrology of this year.</p>
<p>He successfully predicted the pandemic of 2020 many years in advance. So that&#x27;s one of the reasons why um people respect him and what he says and he thought that 2026 was extremely promising because there there are there&#x27;s an outer planet configuration at the moment with the three outer planets. I know most people don&#x27;t consider Pluto a planet anymore but Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are in this kind of arrangement which uh is very harmonious let&#x27;s say. And um Barau looked at this and he thought that what it showed was a kind of um a a new world world civilization emerging. Um and that it would be extremely positive that it would be lifting uh lifting up the less fortunate people of the world.</p>
<p>And you know he wrote this quite quite a number of years ago but it was based on the kind of harmoniousness of some of this astrology um which is going to be I think perhaps feel more um clear in the middle of this year where that the first few months of this year look much rougher than the the sort of the middle to late some of the middle months. Um July I think is potentially there&#x27;s going to be things coming around that time July August maybe that u provide a lot of grounds for much more positivity as well and we have to bear that in mind um that you know that it&#x27;s I think the world is forged through the interplay of opposing forces the darkness doesn&#x27;t get it get everything its own way &gt;&gt; absolutely not and we we should never forget that there&#x27;s there there are people and forces working for the the benefit of us as well. So it is easy to at times like these to get to focus a bit more on the negative. Um but I&#x27;m not you know I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not pessimistic really. I I&#x27;m generally optimistic that we are where we need to be and we&#x27;re here for a reason.</p>
<p>Um we&#x27;re going to do a lot of growing and learning in the next few years and hopefully we will emerge in a much better place. Um I&#x27;m not I think we might get signs that things are going to be improving this year or at least yeah signs that that we reasons for optimism let&#x27;s say. However, uh I do think that a lot of this chaos is going to play out for at least probably up to 10 years. I think until the early 2030s, maybe by the as late as the mid 2030s, something like that, we&#x27;re going to be in for a lot of chaos. Um but I do think we&#x27;ll emerge in a better place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, I uh I think that that&#x27;s always something solid to hold on to. uh humans I mean for as much as we cling on to the world order that we currently know there is a lot wrong with it and so maybe you know the fracturing of that uh world order will lead us to somewhere a lot better but there&#x27;s going to be pain in that transition and that&#x27;s just something that that comes with growth right I mean um we heal back stronger and so that&#x27;s that could be um where we&#x27;re headed &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; thank you Dan &gt;&gt; go ahead do you want to add &gt;&gt; I was just going to Hey, I was just going to say, you know, if you if you&#x27;ve if you&#x27;ve put some time into soaking up what&#x27;s in the Epstein files, you&#x27;ll you know, you&#x27;ll know that this is not not a world order that deserves to abide and it&#x27;s a very good thing that it&#x27;s being exposed and hopefully uh dissolved. So, &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And hopefully we can create a world where that kind of uh unaccountability uh no longer exists, especially just because of of wealth, you know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; All right, Dan. I appreciate you, man. This was fantastic.</p>
<p>You have such a grasp on all of this stuff and you really have a knowledge of current world um politics and uh events and are able to contextualize it all so well. So, um I am deeply appreciative of having you coming on the show. Uh, thanks for for having me again, James. It&#x27;s always a pleasure.</p>
