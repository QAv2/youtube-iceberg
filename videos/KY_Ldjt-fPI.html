            <p>[Music] how do you go about recruiting for something like this like what are you looking for kind of people it&#x27;s uh it is a very good question um you know i i personally interviewed um both by phone by telephone and face to face in about a four and a half month period in 2008 about 300 people when we were doing this massive recruitment drive to populate we we recruited phd level scientists we recruited md phds we recruited technicians translators data analysts military intelligence people security officers retired police officers we recruited 50 people in about four and a half months we trained them and we then we started conducting field research and probably and we got them security clearances probably in in the space of what would normally take a contractor two to three years to accomplish we accomplished in about five months because we had to get this program up and running and get start getting data um in order to deliver what we were we had promised so it was a really i mean it was a rocket ship taking off in terms of but the recruitment process was um luckily that the program itself was not compromised because we recruited the the normal channels but we were looking for professional people and during the interviews we had a sort of a weeding out process where we weeded out people who were you know this was against their religion this was against their their belief system they were they thought all this was fantasy and this kind of thing so we we we had a uh screening process that we went through and out of the over 300 people i interviewed we hired about 50 people and uh i mean we were like a well-oiled machine after 24 months we were really rocking and rolling on this program and suddenly it was terminated like i said out of nowhere so the same kind of recruitment process the same kind of professionals um recruit people if possible with security clearances because that saves a lot of time in terms of um you know reinventing the wheel so um that&#x27;s what we did and i think that&#x27;s what should be done again [Music] you</p>
