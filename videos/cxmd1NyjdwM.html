            <p>yeah the National Security order what it basically says is that your invention has been deemed to be a detriment to the National Security of the United States therefore you cannot share it with with anyone and anybody who you&#x27;ve shared it with you you need to notify that so yeah it it basically uh shuts down thousands like Michael was saying uh of inventions that could uh you know help help our situation on this planet you are listening to exopolitics today with Dr Michael Salah your source for the uncensored truth regarding the human extraterrestrial Global and political agenda click the like button and subscribe to this channel and now here&#x27;s Dr Michael Salah it&#x27;s my great pleasure to have Dan Willis back on exile politics today and he&#x27;s going to tell us about his experiences with some really fascinating new Energy Technologies and work with top inventors and scientists and actually introduce us to one today so welcome down to the show ah pleasure being on your show again Michael this is going to be the first time I&#x27;ve publicly ever shared this experience of uh over 10 years of working with scientists and inventors around the planet vetting Technologies so um and I&#x27;m very honored to be able to uh and bring on a scientist that is incredibly brilliant that will join us on the show here shortly well that&#x27;s that&#x27;s fantastic that you&#x27;re doing this for the first time and I know you&#x27;ve been working with some top inventors over the years so why don&#x27;t you begin how did how did where did it begin for you your work with these different inventors and scientists on working on new Energies right um I prepared a little 15-minute slideshow which I can narrate and feel free to jump in and you have a question and uh so uh here we go okay um May of 2001 event you&#x27;re very familiar with Michael they got you fired from the University um Dr Stephen Greer gathered hundreds of military intelligence Witnesses 21 of them willing to go before the mainstream needed the world at the national Press Club in Washington DC give their testimonies and each state they were willing to testify under oath before a congressional hearing we were seeking I was one of these top secret military witnesses that testified that day impressive uh testimonies were given which the mainstream media completely sanitized and suppressed from The public&#x27;s awareness using what the intelligence Community calls a limited hangout they didn&#x27;t want these uh incredible testimonies into the public mind uh the disclosure project had scientists that were willing to come forth which have been working in highly classified black budget unacknowledged special access programs that contain technologies that would allow the world to no longer be dependent on fossil fuels coal nuclear and other dangerous and obsolete polluting sources of energy the Bush Administration denied the Congressional hearing so Dr Greer formed an organization to identify and Test new technologies in the civilian sector that claim to be over Unity that is they put out more power than is required to operate and do so renewably and without pollution because of my technical background I volunteered to be one of six technical advisors of which uh Dr Eugene malov was one of our six who was murdered before releasing important information to the public the other technical advisors although less active all had multiple phds and Science and physics myself not having a PhD was primarily self-taught with many decades of Hands-On Electronics experience and out-of-the-box Technologies how all this began well this the little journey started when uh I asked my future wife Rebecca to join me uh for a little trip down in our Airstream motorhome from Oregon to the international gym mineral show in Tucson Arizona to acquire a quartz sphere quartz crystal sphere um here we&#x27;re crossing the Golden Gate bridge heading down to Arizona we arrived in Tucson we found this amazing 10 inch quartz crystal sphere from Brazil and some other goodies up the gym show I&#x27;ve been listening to the radio and I heard Dr Stephen Greer had identified an inventor in the Dominican Republic who created an energy device producing many times over Unity power one night sleeping in a motorhome I kept thinking about this energy device and felt compelled to sit up and say to Rebecca I think the professor needs my help Rebecca half awake was getting flashes of uh you know the professor on the TV show Gilligan&#x27;s Island since we never mentioned I never mentioned Professor Ted loiter to her before I then explained to her that Professor loiter was working with Dr Stephen Greer to bring forth an energy device from this inventor being the situation that the professor was a teaching professor of Earth Sciences at the University of New Hampshire and that Dr Greer was a retired emergency room physician both having little knowledge on electronic circuits to be able to schematic and reproduce this energy device it only made sense that I would help them since I had an extensive background electronic systems working with the naval electronic systems engineering center in San Diego for 13 years as well as researching out of the box Technologies such as those I joined Dr Marcel Vogel and his laboratory researching I called Professor loiter and he very much agreed that my technical background in electronics would be extremely helpful in bringing this technology out to the world so we left our motorhome parked at the friend&#x27;s house in Arizona and Dr Greer had Rebecca and I fly out to Virginia Dr Greer ran an apartment down the street from Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello which was to be used as a makeshift laboratory and validate these Technologies the department was completely unfurnished so Dr Greer brought over a few folding tables and a wicker couch we went out and bought an inflatable bed and that is where we stayed for several months meeting with scientists and and vetting their technology claims Dr Greer set up a corporation called Advanced Energy research organization otherwise known as Arrow we had several meetings at his home there in Virginia here&#x27;s myself and our associate Dr Greer and Professor Ted loiter the first major project to work on was to vote and reproduce the energy device that was down in Dominican Republic Professor loiter and Dr Greer originally flew down to the Dominican Republic to measure the device Dr Greer said he didn&#x27;t want to see any batteries connected to the device so what the inventor did was to create what&#x27;s called an earth battery using using rods in the ground connected to capacitors in the front yard of his apartment the output of the earth battery was measuring to be only about one Watt and was powering the device which was powering almost 500 watts of loads connected to the loads were 300 watt and 100 watt light bulbs an electric fan and a radio boom Blaster playing Caribbean music this this operated for over two hours uh just being connected to the surf battery so the professor and I get on a flight and arrive in the Dominican Republic for the purpose of Blueprinting and drawing out the detailed schematic of the device so it can be reproduced there&#x27;s just one major problem when we met with an inventor he said that just before we arrived that two CIA agents appeared at his door and told him that quote if this works you&#x27;re dead unquote so the device that was previously measured was completely disassembled the inventor didn&#x27;t want to risk his life and told us don&#x27;t worry I have another type of device I can show you then before you go on yeah I just wanted to get some clarification with that Earth battery and the way the picture shows it just anchored into the ground I mean is this kind of like drawing energy from the earth is is that is that the sort of thing Nikola Tesla uh had done some work in I recall him being able to kind of like show how you could have lightning come out of the earth and there&#x27;s been a lot of research done on the Earth being having a lot of energy that can be discharged as Lightning so lightning doesn&#x27;t just come from the sky but it can also come from the ground so is this Earth battery kind of connected to that potential to be different it&#x27;s using uh the similar metals and he&#x27;s forming uh in Earth not not a very high output battery but uh was able to accumulate and store in the capacitors and just enough to give this motor uh ability you had to hand hand spin it and once it got going it started generating its own power and putting an output but that was enough to get these CIA agents out there to shut this inventor down oh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a bad story yes all right um bruh back to our nightmare story here um and so um it was completely disassembled he didn&#x27;t want to risk his life so we uh ran around this foreign country attempting to assemble all the electronic and other components of this new device that and we were finally able to get it operational my job was drawing out the schematic and component lists and detailed instructions which would be sent by various carriers DHL FedEx ups and in the event that the professor and I get whacked on the way back someone would still be able to reproduce the device so a little drama ensues where I&#x27;m drawing out the schematic and instructions the inventor is a French Canadian which the Hell&#x27;s Angels in Quebec Canada knew of this inventor&#x27;s talents and wanted the energy device for their marijuana operations in Canada to power their growing lights so they could completely operate off the grid and stay undetected by the authorities so one of the angels shows up on his Harley with a girl in the back he shows the inventor at a Showcase with a lot of money to buy the energy device from him the inventor refuses and the angel speaks to him in French saying well we&#x27;ll have to kill you then for it and the inventor responds with no I&#x27;ll kill you first so the situation is getting ugly quick the angel then turns and leaves and says quote I&#x27;ll be back and we&#x27;ll kill you and your friend over there you know pointing to me I asked the inventor does he have any weapons we can defend ourselves with he says don&#x27;t worry meanwhile the professor is missing all this wonderful excitement and it&#x27;s awesome we&#x27;re giving a report to Dr Greer on a cell phone Professor returns and we update uh here&#x27;s a here&#x27;s a picture of the inventor myself and uh Professor loiter the professor returns and we update him on the situation the inventor invites us to go to a Chinese restaurant it turns out that the this is where the head mafioso kind of guy who runs everything hangs out the place looked like out of a Hollywood movie set with everyone had weapons such as Uzis AK-47s the inventor explains to the head guy the Hell&#x27;s Angel situation it turns out that the inventor previously put an energy device on board his yacht so they were good friends he says to the inventor no problem we&#x27;ll take care of it apparently this group had a reputation that was greatly feared by the Hell&#x27;s Angels and in a matter of hours the Hell&#x27;s Angels Came Back to the investors place and apologized to us for the misunderstanding so this new energy device the way it was configured we were not able to adequately confirm this viability due to the huge battery banks that were connected with it the professor wanted to bring back the motor unit that was connected to the bank of batteries and apparently a miscommunication happened between him and Dr Greer who would have preferred not to bring back anything that was not totally verified which makes sense nevertheless we brought back that component and I was able to wire it up and reconfigure it and get it running with components from electronic stores in Virginia but it was never able to perform as a one that was originally disassembled in an attempt in auditory you can see my wonderful supportive wife Rebecca uh attempting to we were working off of photographs and diagrams that we had to try to recreate the original device without success Dr Greer flies the inventor to the University of New Hampshire where he and I stay at the professor later&#x27;s home and use the University&#x27;s machine shop to begin construction of yet another device in the professor&#x27;s basement I&#x27;m running all over from different states and different counties getting different gauges of wire and ordering different parts from different electronic suppliers and we put this whole elaborate thing together and yeah no cigar another dud so one of the brilliant uh inventors that I met not all of them are are like that some of these are like out of their backyard inventors others are incredibly brilliant scientists such as this uh Dutch inventor who wrote multiple volumes on the advanced calculus so the Dynamics of electron flow it was able to demonstrate the principles of generating power at our lab sadly he was found dead in his car at the airport parking lot before flying to Europe to pound his little device about the size of a shoe box that was producing about 140 watts of power out of the environment here you can see them with the copper sheets and toroid coils that were configured to draw the power out uh then then in terms of that inventor um was there any follow-up on you know what it was or how he died I mean was this I mean it sounds very very suspicious I mean it sounds like someone obviously didn&#x27;t want this guy going off to Europe to Peyton his invention and just you know bumped him off I mean is this pretty much what others kind of concluded was was there any kind of follow-up done on that it does kind of appear that way it doesn&#x27;t it he was slumped over the steering wheel in the long-term parking lot in the airport and we know the intelligence agencies have heart attack weapons so uh and he was just about ready to go patent his device and so um unfortunately now I kept meeting with different inventors different situations it was just ongoing with different here we we have a meeting with Professor Thomas Bearden some of uh you out there who are familiar with uh The Cutting Edge energy technology knows he he was a legend he was in the military and doing advanced concepts of of over Unity that he was creating a device called the Meg which stood for the motionless electromagnetic generator another legend in the over Unity that he was uh gave to Watson and one uh energy conference that was producing five kilowatts with a uh using a Tesla switch and he became very very famous for that and he&#x27;s made a lot of uh don bedini made a lot of different devices I worked with him for many years um I traveled a long trip from Oregon to his lab in Hayden Idaho numerous times sadly John and his brother Gary bedini mysteriously died uh seemed very odd on the exact same day um again again uh I mean how did he die I mean was this uh I know they&#x27;ve had heart attack Technologies I mean that was the church commission what 1976-77 that it was revealed that the CIA had heart attack Technologies so again was this the kind of situation where that kind of Technology could have been used yeah that&#x27;s right yeah the church committee um I don&#x27;t know about that uh I tried to get some information nobody could give me any information I knew did know that his brother Gary was had ill health and it could be just coincidence that you know when somebody who&#x27;s very close to you they were very close Brothers you know one person has dies and the other person gets a heart attack immediately after because of the the grief you know it could have happened uh so I don&#x27;t know but it just seemed very odd like within this within the same hour that they both died um so you know it could be some of these inventors have like kill switches you know I was like you know something happens to them and then this information gets released um so I I don&#x27;t know uh bedini studied all of Nikola Tesla&#x27;s patents and created a number of patents himself of which I carefully studied all of them the interesting aspect of these other forms of energy is that they don&#x27;t follow the normal rules of physics that are taught such as when putting a load on the device the device actually generates more power small wires conduct large amounts of power that would normally require larger wires and as more power is drawn from the load the wires get colder rather than warmer here on uh bedini&#x27;s oscilloscope you&#x27;re watching energy pulses move forward in time as is normally displayed on on a scope is most technicians know but here you see the darker pulses at the same time while one is moving forwards in time the other is moving backwards in time it&#x27;s almost like they are tapping into this other mirror world where everything is in Reverse to our known laws of physics uh bedini was using his uh different timing circuits you know based on Nikola Tesla to capture the radiant Spike at a certain point when uh when energy flows just before the current flows there&#x27;s this huge radiant Spike that Tesla would capture that would pull energy from the uh direct sea as they they call it and he was created a number of rotational um motor generators that uh utilize that principle but again we had uh years of trying to work with him and nothing was able to really pull on the load uh Dr Greer had identified a military man who um gave us a design for an anti-matter type device after ordering a lot of exotic parts and working with a local machine shop the device was ready to be activated and tested because of the nature of the radiant signal the device would emit which the nro satellites could detect we rented a temporary hotel room which the three of us activated it yeah you know another dud um you know in brief conclusion I&#x27;m leaving out an enormous amount of decal and several other inventors and scientists that I worked with note that everything listed here is not exactly in chronological order but after so much intense effort over so many years to bring out an energy solution the only thing that kept me persevering was that I found it incredibly hard to believe that the dozens of scientists and inventors that I met with that anyone would go to that much trouble to deceive what they claim nevertheless it appears that some of these people were in fact delusional or had other Integrity issues sadly the real solutions brought about by some people were suppressed by either threats to their life National Security orders or outright murder apparently at the stage of my understanding of global control mechanisms in place I was apparently naive to think a solution could be brought out to serve the people of our planet this Venture started out in 2003 continued on and off for over 10 years until 2014 at which point I completely surrendered the idea of attempting to bring out Alternative Energy Solution out to the world with so many elements that are working against that from being realized today I realized that these Solutions will only be allowed to help Humanity once the Deep State controlling elements are removed first so one of the last uh on the segment going on a long journey uh attempting to bring out the solution we returned to our friend&#x27;s place in Arizona where our Airstream motorhome has been parked for quite a long time my friend in Arizona had a business in the 90s and hired my internet services to promote his product I figured out the search engine algorithms and those early internet days and made him very wealthy in the process he happened to have a helicopter in the backyard it was rather large Arizona State there was one more inventor to vet that was located in Sedona Arizona so he flew Rebecca and I to Sedona to meet with this inventor and we land at the Sedona Airport considering I haven&#x27;t been even begin to scratch the surface of all the inventors stories and drama that Rebecca and I experienced I realized that anyone as a potential mate uh that could persevere through all that must be my future wife Rebecca was amazingly supportive in all that we went through because she sincerely felt that we were on a quest to do something for the good of humanity and at the airport Vortex is it&#x27;s called it&#x27;s a spot where I asked Rebecca to marry me and so from that point on we uh headed home back to Oregon to our uh peaceful quiet Off the Grid Mountaintop home and uh that uh ends the story uh and one of the brilliant incredible scientists that I met along this journey whom I become friends with is Dr James Schwartz who I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to introduce to you on our show today well I&#x27;m looking forward to that and I think it&#x27;s great really wonderful that you found a soul mate that can accompany you and support you during this journey I know what that&#x27;s like I mean to have a supportive partner really makes all the difference and uh an incredible amount of energy that you can direct when it&#x27;s focused on the betterment of humanity when you have a partner that&#x27;s on that same Mission with you and certainly um that I think is essential for anyone that wants to to really crack this very difficult knot of whether it&#x27;s extraterrestrial disclosure or new energy inventions that you do need that support because it is very hard and and you mentioned some of the forces aligned against you and um yeah so I I remember hearing a lot about this era project and the serious project that Dr Stephen Greer organized after the 2001 disclosure project but you&#x27;ve presented I guess the the kind of the kernel of what what happened during that period when uh he was flying along with some of his technical advisors including you to different scientists and and trying to bring out this technology but was frustrated at every turn that was so frustrating yeah and Angelica has been incredible and doing the graphics and things uh I I you know so amazing you it was censored on the last one um yeah uh speaking of censorship you know the um the our technology has been suppressed for so long that goes you know goes all the way back to beginning of the 19th century you know it was not only dealing with anti-gravity free energy but also medical breakthroughs uh he&#x27;s Dr Schwartz is here to join us oh fantastic oh perfect timing I&#x27;m very happy to have Dr Schwartz join us so Dan tell us a little bit about him yes um in my journey of uh scientists and inventors uh I&#x27;ve met one brilliant scientist who is highly credible who&#x27;s built a number of energy devices that uh were functional and has received National Security orders unfortunately could not release all of them he&#x27;s uh done some in incredible research I can&#x27;t even begin to scratch the surface of what this man has worked with one of the things that I felt was extremely fascinating was that uh he Acquired and verified through the U.S Navy uh one of the uh magnetic single generators rather that was used on the USS Eldridge and the famous Philadelphia Experiment and verified that uh it was able to get it functional and created a dimensional portal and we&#x27;ll go into that and other things but it&#x27;s my great honor to uh introduce uh Dr James Schwartz well thank you Phil for being on the show Dr Schwartz um so Dan I think people would love to know about this uh generator from The Philadelphia Experiment uh that uh Dr Schwartz got so do you want to tell us about that well the old the old one I found was uh in a junkyard there in uh San Diego um I was I used to go there a lot looking for scrap military stuff you know because they have a lot of good uh uh electronic parts they didn&#x27;t destroy and uh I ran across that frequency generator and at first I couldn&#x27;t figure it out because it&#x27;s pretty Rusty and all and uh needed a lot of work I&#x27;ve taken it completely apart and put it back together I I got it working but still haven&#x27;t found out the function I haven&#x27;t uh been able to get it to function like it&#x27;s supposed to what what did it look like and and how did you find out that it came from the USS Eldridge well it had a tag on it um uh oh well it was a small small brass tag it was on one side you can see where they tried to knock it off and it was hanging by one rivet on there and it uh it had a government number on it and when I tried checking that government number they they claim there&#x27;s no such number uh but somebody else told me that uh all of those numbers uh in ending in uh 7174 7174 all had to do with the Philadelphia Experiment so you&#x27;ve got your hands on some equipment from the USS Eldridge that was part of the Philadelphia Experiment and it was made by the Tesla company by the way well I&#x27;ve never got a function very very good it&#x27;s not putting a signal or a vibration or anything it lights up and everything but I can&#x27;t get it to function I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have a schematic to go by you see so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to take me a few more years to uh figure out uh what&#x27;s missing on it but there&#x27;s something else missing so why don&#x27;t you tell us about this kind of creature that came that emerged this interdimensional creature when we uh generator was when you uh reworked it and got it operational what happened oh yeah that well that wasn&#x27;t what this uh generator This was um uh uh frequency generator that I built myself see when I when I gave up my medical practice at uh Cedar Sinai and told them to go take a flying leap they threatened me and everything so I knew I&#x27;d never be able to get a position anywhere as a doctor in California so I set up my own little clinic there on Sepulveda Boulevard and uh when we was doing some experiments in my little laboratory there and um that&#x27;s when uh all of a sudden the wall right by a plant there you see it like a hole there and then a small creature and it looked kind of kind of like a monkey um yeah that&#x27;s it there yeah you see the plant back there um and and something I didn&#x27;t tell you about that before that plant is growing uh two to three times faster after that happened but now this was this was taken with my uh secretary she had this little brownie camera with um this flash bulb you know on that you have to have a flash for it and she she got that picture of it and she claimed that she could hear something from it from this creature but she didn&#x27;t understand what it was saying I didn&#x27;t hear anything yeah I think you said something like that people are doing what do you want or something like that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what uh uh Kathy said she said that it was she the way she understood it it wanted to know who we were or what are we doing another interesting aspect you did was with a lab rat uh two inch wood cutting block that was able to go through walk through the two inch cutting block to something yeah I set up two cases yeah a set of two little bird cages there that I got and we took the doors off of them and then I put a two inch uh chopping block that you use for cooking in between the cages and I put this white rat on one side and the food was on the other side and we&#x27;ve tried for weeks and weeks to try to get that uh find out if that rat could go through that piece of wood and it when it happened we weren&#x27;t there to see it because the frequency generator was on auto load it would go through a sequence and then it would flip over it would go through another sequence it flipped over it went through another one I made up a crude device uh switching device for the frequencies and uh when I came in that next morning one morning there I went in there and the rat was in the other side of the cage went right through the wood uh but the rat was dead so I done an autopsy on the uh Rat and I found um in the uh cell structure of the Rat was wood wood cell structure that was mixed in with the structure of the rat&#x27;s uh cells you modified your frequency generators to be able to go down to very very small increments yes and so somewhere in the auto load there was one exact frequency that I guess opened up the molecular structure of the wood and the rat saw the cheese and went for it well I I had a submit some old notes from uh Tesla and it scribbles some different uh things on there and uh it it had something to do with his work that on at the Philadelphia Project uh and I guess in one of the notes there he was really mad about something uh you can see where he he was making some marks there and all of a sudden he just he just starts going like this scribbling out over everything you know and then later on down the page Eric uh he mentioned that uh this whole damn thing is a waste of time oh now you were over at the Roaring Cliff facility in Colorado that Tesla had set up and you were you modified some uh ground penetrating type radar and was able to find some boxes that were buried like three feet under the ground of wood and wrapped in burlap that had Tesla&#x27;s papers in it all the boxes I found that was in uh this Colorado lab those wooden boxes we found there um but at the uh Warden Cliff site there&#x27;s an antenna below ground um she and I I got I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to send it to you I gave it I printed it and gave it to my wife because for some reason I when I try to load it and send it to you it wouldn&#x27;t work so she scanned it in her computer and sent it to me now I can send it to you and you can see the antenna at the bottom at 126 feet below ground and on each corner um there was four boxes on there and there&#x27;s no way of knowing what&#x27;s in their boxes but there&#x27;s some kind of a compound or something in there now uh and all those receipts that I uh got of uh from the hardware store uh there there was some chemicals in there um I can&#x27;t remember all the names of it now but uh he was using some uh cells um he bought a 50 pound bag of sulfite there and he had a few other things and what those were I have no idea I have no idea why oh so the boxes that were buried they were just held uh yeah surround antenna well I was saying that the boxes that were buried at the warden Cliff site they had like something oh yeah that those those are my nightmare notes we call them uh so many of them are damaged and everything uh all almost every one of them it&#x27;s got some small damage on them uh some are missing pieces of paper where the paper fell apart you know kind of um but we&#x27;ve we get little bits of information here and there but not a lot to help us very much the only thing that helped me was I was able to create those those small rods that he was using to power his car oh the Pierce Arrow yeah yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the one we manufactured in Japan and wind up going to jail I spent 63 000. wasn&#x27;t it uh yeah no it&#x27;s all all together with 68 000 of the uh uh the 300 watt and then we had uh the 900 watt ones we had we we had only about uh a little less than 600 of those oh people could use those so badly I mean but you receive the National Security order which you you sent to me and showed me um and so the world isn&#x27;t able to benefit from that incredible uh creation that you uh you put together based on Tesla&#x27;s information by the way that uh uh that information you set there uh I went through that it&#x27;s quite long and uh that&#x27;s where you guys were uh experimenting with anti-gravity and stuff there&#x27;s a picture in there of that uh uh government to I don&#x27;t know what you would call it it came it came from the patent office but when I when I looked at the one that&#x27;s in your picture and I compared it to the one I have they&#x27;re they&#x27;re almost perfect image everything is the same word for word the only difference is mine had my name and everything on it so just to kind of like clarify here that uh I mean the the U.S trademark and patent office I mean they have a they give a numerical number of the number of secrecy orders that have been issued which today stands at just over six thousand so six thousand inventions have been suppressed through the secrecy order so you&#x27;re one of these secrecy orders applies to this invention that that you made based on Tesla Technologies and you must produce 68 000 in Japan and you&#x27;ve got a national uh secrecy order dropped on you and so that so so that secrecy order how long has that been in the application for I mean uh is there a time limit on that or do they just kind of keep renewing it um yeah time limit [Music] um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s worded in everything exactly like that uh uh that article that uh Dan sent me it had you know you&#x27;re much younger than I noticed uh when you were working on that those different uh anti-gravity stuff and all that didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t turn out good uh oh right yeah that was Otis Carr right you know see the that to that same government uh page in there um same color and everything it&#x27;s identical to mine uh the wording nothing&#x27;s changed the only thing difference is is uh uh the information about me and everything on it and I got another one but it was uh uh an audio that I didn&#x27;t get to to uh copy it was on a telephone conversation that I got and he was claiming to be one of the officials from the U.S patent office and uh he called to tell me to make sure that I cease and desist from this particular project that I&#x27;m working on and it cannot be patented it didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t give his name or anything and you know what gets me I noticed on yours it&#x27;s in that uh video that or that uh article you sent to me nobody signed it nobody took the responsibility to sign it so we would to keep us from knowing I guess who why would they do that you&#x27;d think because it&#x27;s such an official document or whatever it should be signed by by somebody you know the National Security order what it basically says is that your invention has been deemed to be a detriment to the National Security of the United States therefore you cannot share it with with anyone and anybody who you&#x27;ve shared it with you you need to notify that so yeah it it basically uh shut shuts down thousands like Michael was saying uh of inventions that could uh you know help help our situation on this planet and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s worth pointing out that this uh secrecy order um that uh there are certain categories of inventions that fall under that that and I think God can do a share screen of the secrecy order that you were talking about so that&#x27;s what you were talking about right Dan that secrecy order that&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the exact one right there that&#x27;s it but you see where it says secrecy order and everything but now mine&#x27;s a little different at the top they printed my name to remove your your personal uh address uh James oh you did yeah oh so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s different there right yeah okay I didn&#x27;t know that that but you see down at the bottom where it uh says uh what Secretary of uh was that Commerce right I can&#x27;t read it yet there&#x27;s no signature so they sent you one of these for a device that you produ must produce that could that could create 250 Watts so we&#x27;re not talking about a tremendous amount of energy but nevertheless they thought that that was such a national security threat that they had to shut it down and issue you one of these letters you&#x27;re speaking about the incident in Japan now uh yeah just the the Japan incident and this National secrecy order that you&#x27;ve got well well the court paper my lawyer got to see it and he showed it to me and it had that same information that you just showed me there typed out on a a page um and they was using that against me in Japan also as a rule and I told them I tried to tell the judge well I have never applied for a patent for those two rods because I didn&#x27;t figure it was necessary and I and I and I didn&#x27;t think they would give it to me anyway because of the I&#x27;ve been refused you know so many times on different things so it was a wasted effort so the same people that were dealing uh trust were uh product Prosecuting me there in in Japan is the same ones I think were involved in uh my talks with the patent people I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m still so confused over the whole thing it doesn&#x27;t to me it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense you know that and that paper I had to sign which you know I use ndas all the time when somebody comes here to see my generator that they sign an NDA okay and I give them a copy and I keep a copy see but the ND this agreement that I signed in Japan uh the judge handed it to me and said you either sign this or you go back to jail and I when I read it and everything basically the part I didn&#x27;t like it said you cannot create or manufacture these rods any on anywhere in the world any place no country and when I tried to ask the judge uh well this is a Japanese Court and I&#x27;m being prosecuted in a Japanese Court why is it I can&#x27;t go someplace else and do it and the judge said uh uh this information is confidential yeah it&#x27;s a global control mechanism you were they didn&#x27;t you have some physical intermination like your cars being blown up and that sort of thing oh yeah I still have all the pictures of it a small parking lot in in my uh place there in the Philippines and all my people you know all park in that one area well where my van was I pulled in there in the morning it was exactly about uh five 540 something in the morning there in Philippines uh the next one that came in was Arne he parked on the left side he parked his vehicle there and and then uh uh who was it uh no yeah it it was it was Mabel&#x27;s car but Mabel didn&#x27;t bring it that day see her daughter was was trying to learn some stuff uh office work that we&#x27;re doing so she drove her mother&#x27;s car and she parked it on the right side of me there now when it went off it wasn&#x27;t like a normal explosion like you see on TV when he blows up the cars flying through the air or something everything is sitting just like it was but all three of the vehicles especially mine were burned all the way down to the metal there was nothing but metal left the seats the Springs every all the metal uh everything else so when the FBI came out they said that it was an incendiary device uh that burns very very hot and it was set off by a cell phone so evidently they didn&#x27;t want to kill me they wanted to warn me um and uh that particular incident when that happened that came right after I just done a a demonstration in Dubai at one of the universities there I took one of my small little prototypes and it won&#x27;t run more than an hour hour and a half at the most before it&#x27;ll burn itself up because it&#x27;s not attached to the Earth but it&#x27;s good enough for a demo to show the basics how the plates work and everything and how the frequencies cause a place to release their uh electrons so I have a question for you and and that is so definitely there are different government agencies that want to silence you or stop your inventions from seeing that light of day were there efforts to recruit you did scientists approach you working with different government projects and say we we would like to have you involved in this project or that project or or maybe you could work on your invention within one of our facilities and we&#x27;ll you know find Finance you and all of that well they they didn&#x27;t treat me like they did one of our other people um Stanley Myers worked worked with us in the Philippines for several years he was one of our technicians there um but for he mysteriously died Stan Myers yeah and he was approached by some government officials who wanted to make a deal with him to work in a government facility and he refused but nobody&#x27;s came to me at all nobody the closest I ever came to an official was that that day in court in Japan on the eighth day uh when my court came up and there was a table about 20 25 feet away from me and there was two gentlemen sitting there with suits and ties no tags no no ID everybody else in the courtroom uh officials except for the judge of course all had name tags you know and they gave me a name tag to put on me when I went in because I had a prison uh uniform on that we have to wear in a jail there that&#x27;s the only time and it&#x27;s the closest ever been to one to any official and they refuse to talk to me I wasn&#x27;t allowed to ask them questions and uh and I think my lawyer was a waste of time and effort because he didn&#x27;t do anything to help me you know he he was controlled by the judge and those two gentlemen sitting over here at the table and they handed the uh the document uh to the assist there in a court that assists a judge and he took it up to the judge the judge read it and then he called me up there in front of the uh bench and he handed it to me and he asked me to read it out loud you want to make sure I read every word so I read it out loud to him and then he that&#x27;s when he said now this agreement you either sign it right now or you go back to jail and sooner or later sometime or another when all the evidence is finished and everything you&#x27;ll come before me again and then we&#x27;ll sentence you to so many years or whatever you know but I didn&#x27;t want to go through all of that so I signed it I agreed to not produce those small uh devices can you maybe explain you know why you were jailed for just having someone in Japan manufacture what 68 000 of these things exactly well see I had a very close old friend there uh tamasaki and uh he introduced me to one of the well one of the government officials there in Japan he&#x27;s like a congressman uh and he was very interested in my small rods and then he brought in this other government official uh who was a little bit higher up in the government than him he would be more like a senator you know and uh over a period of about 45 days or less uh the three of us came to an agreement uh we each put up uh 270 000 each uh and later on the two of them put up some extra too another 40 or 50 000 besides that I wasn&#x27;t able to to add any more because I had already uh overcharge myself on that that project and we all went together we rented a place there outside of uh the main city area the rent was real cheap it was an all metal building very cold in there uh we had to run these uh furnaces these uh what do you call them construction heaters in there we had three of those in there to keep us warm because that building wasn&#x27;t insulated but we made the we made the dies uh we set up everything and with that small amount of money we didn&#x27;t we can&#x27;t uh we can&#x27;t do what I would have loved to have done I wanted to make something a lot better than that um what we were using was we were using solid blocks of um aluminum and uh they were real thick they were about seven a little over seven inches thick and they were uh two feet wide and three feet long and they had holes drilled on them those holes were the exact size of the rod now we were mixing the compounds in there and then after they were mixed they had to be hand poured in every one of the Hulls and then there&#x27;s another piece of aluminum on the top with the uh the stainless steel uh pegs that fit the hole exactly they&#x27;re precise and it comes down and it puts pressure on the dry compound that we put in there you see there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s nothing you can add if you add anything to the compound like like cement you have to put water in it in order to get it to harden see well Tesla wasn&#x27;t using anything he must have been using pressure and it was pressurizing it so that&#x27;s what we were doing we were taking that powdery substance and we we were compressing it and we had uh over 14 tons of pressure on the on the top that was pressing down then it then it comes up a little higher than we add some more compound to it uh then it comes down and presses some more then it goes up uh it takes about nine different presses in order to get the rods at a certain length and then they have to be drilled by hand so we had a a jig set up and we had uh 12 drill presses in there and a man was working on each one and he would set him in the jig and he would drill them he&#x27;d drill them a half inch deep and then uh we put this uh we need threads on it you see so we bought this threaded material and uh it&#x27;s made out of aluminum also and we cut those out and we press those down in there now they&#x27;re ready then uh I have pictures uh we we put some advertising in the paper there in Japan and I can show you the advertising and you&#x27;ll you can get an idea James how were you tapping the power off and and what type of power and how much were you getting off of the unit well you see there&#x27;s between those two rods one of them has one extra compound in it and that extra compound um is the uh uh what we call it uh the the arsenic hard to get uh what we needed there in the Philippines without ordering it special uh so the ones we made in the Philippines uh we had to make changes and uh in Japan so we we were using magnesium powder uh to make up the difference so between the Arsenic and the Magnesium power powder mixed with the other chemicals and everything one of them now they didn&#x27;t work until you put them on the board and you got the right distance between them then they would produce energy then you have positive and negative there but if you put them any further apart they don&#x27;t work now and what what did you measure for uh for power was it DC yeah it was a DC power and and how many watts were able to be uh generated well there&#x27;s supposed to be 300. uh but every batch that came out like if the first batch it came out uh over half of them didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t work so we had to discard them only half of them actually worked uh and each one seemed to be a little bit different uh I the see the problem was we had all these uh uh Grinders in there because we had to polarize everything into powder Farm and I&#x27;m afraid we when we have to clean the machines and everything we didn&#x27;t get them clean enough it had some of the op the opposite powders in there that you shouldn&#x27;t have so so some of them were uh 200 and they they go from about 247 uh Lots up to about uh 293 somewhere right in there 93. well with today&#x27;s uh automated uh you know uh manufacturing process is probably a lot easier I just want to make a comment for the viewers not familiar with Stan Myers I didn&#x27;t realize that uh Stan Myers was working with your team it wasn&#x27;t mysterious that he died he died of a botulism that was put in his food and uh made two steps and sub and poisoned uh our our team we were working with with Dr Greer had put a bid in for all of stanmeier&#x27;s equipment after he died yeah other group outbid us and so it was out of England and the five people who acquired that technology all of them have died are you the one that got all Stanley&#x27;s equipment we attempted to get it yeah uh you know he was uh working with the Navy was uh familiar with radar systems and you know wave guides and everything and uh he had he had quite a bit of equipment so we were attempting to acquire it and see if we could reproduce now for those who are not familiar with Stan Meyer he was able to make patents on how to drive an automobile on just water and he was able to do that he had a little dune buggy that he had running on water um and of course the oil Industries wouldn&#x27;t like that too much but it was you know um everybody could retrofit their automobile to run on water it&#x27;d be non-polluting and wouldn&#x27;t have any oil concerns would we uh but yeah another group outbid us and all that all members of that group have uh have died well we still have some of the when he was working with us there in the Philippines uh uh that was uh 1990 92 I think something like that 91 or 92 I can&#x27;t remember now um it was using our equipment there uh and he we still have that uh that small uh Briggs and Sprat Briggs and Stratton engine that he brought there and that&#x27;s what he was using uh he was running that Briggs and Stratton engine off of his hydrogen yeah I worked for the number of inventors from my City built there work out a you know splitting the uh but you see hydrogen didn&#x27;t we didn&#x27;t learn that he was dead until uh almost seven months after he&#x27;d left you know so we had no idea and that last uh seven months before he died he made a trip there and I wasn&#x27;t there that day uh uh only my son was there and my son&#x27;s the one that uh told me he called me on the phone told me that Stanley&#x27;s here he wants to talk to you you know and he was asking uh he had some questions you know he wanted to know first he needed to borrow some money you know so I said okay no problem there you know uh but then after that we didn&#x27;t hear from him for a long time and then by the time I found out he was dead um I I tried to find out about his equipment that he had in his garage and his house there and uh nobody nobody would answer my uh questions yeah well James uh your latest invention is kind of exciting I shared with Michael salad the uh video of you know doing a proof of concept of the little plastic box that just has some plates and a circuit board and it&#x27;s powering yeah thousand watt uh helicopter Spotlight you know I I shared that with them the flux power generator oh yeah I can sure a screen here here&#x27;s here&#x27;s a plastic box that holds the plates and the circuit board and um here are um here is in your uh your setup with your your latest design powering all these all these light bulbs you can see and here you can see the plates and hooked up converting the energy into AC with an inverter there and we have quite a quite a bit of circuitry in order to uh Well we&#x27;d uh oh oh sorry about that yeah I forgot to hit the share button right right here is the plastic box and the plates uh this was powering a helicopter&#x27;s uh thousand watt uh light here&#x27;s in your um yeah the most the most we&#x27;ve ever got out of that yeah that small prototype is the one that we used to give a demonstration in Dubai and that&#x27;s the one that I guess the uh we we suspect it was the Oriole cartel people they got scared that we were going to manufacture those things because see the the room where we were working here at the uh University had a bunch of fluorescent tubes for lighting in there and they there was a about four or five engineers in the front row there and they wanted to do these tests and stuff and I said the only thing that we would allow was an amp gauge or a voltmeter nothing else no oscilloscopes so they they were running these tests and everything and uh at one point they wanted the lights all turned off all the uh defloration tubes so the caretaker went in the back and he shut all the lights off and then uh he came out there he had a flashlight and uh this one engineer that we&#x27;re sitting in the front row he pulls out this small fluorescent tube out of his bag and he takes a tube and he goes all around my device because see he thought we were transmitting the power somehow because there&#x27;s no no wiring going to it at all and uh his AB gauge he knew you know we we were using right in the neighbor that particular day um we were only putting out about uh less than 900 watts but we could still light up that helicopter life um the thing is with my technology there&#x27;s various places on the Earth where it works better than other places the closer you are to the Equator the better it works if you if you go all the way to the North or South Pole it quits working at all it no longer works say that&#x27;s that that&#x27;s the one thing that the uh grid people don&#x27;t like they don&#x27;t like the idea that it uh in some places you have to have more plates in order to get uh one megawatt output than in other places if you get close to the equator um which which makes sense now remember all the all the way around the earth they had pyramids all the way around and they were all connected together somehow they had electricity inside that pyramid because when you go in the pyramid I&#x27;ve been in the the one in uh uh the main pyramid the biggest one there&#x27;s no marks on the ceiling anywhere in the tunnel where a torch you know it would so evidently that maybe they claim that that&#x27;s probably how they were creating the light with these jars but I don&#x27;t think so I think they were doing it wirelessly so with this electromagnetic flux generator that you&#x27;ve built in the last couple of years that you&#x27;re using to power your home I mean what Prospect do you have for that actually being something that could be commercialized or be best released my idea was to get known you know so that maybe I would uh one of the grid systems would pick it up and say okay put one of your power plants uh on the grid but it&#x27;s always the same problem uh financers that come to us you know and say okay we&#x27;ll put up the money to build a power plant and attach it to the grid but then they come back in two weeks our board of directors says no they changed their mind and I found out these great people you know they&#x27;re they&#x27;re a cartel they&#x27;re they&#x27;re not going to change the grid like we change our phones every year the grid system is good for 50 years and 75-year leases and they&#x27;re by Rich wealthy families and organizations they&#x27;re not going to let cheap anything in there look how long they kept the solar out the solar panels they kept them out for a long time you couldn&#x27;t you couldn&#x27;t even put them in now in your houses around uh here in Phoenix the homeowners wouldn&#x27;t allow it on the roof uh and now that the you see people using solar panels the electric company is charging them a penalty for using it you see now a year a little over a year and a half ago I built this one in my backyard the one you just showed them that one okay in a small shed I I took a long extension cord and I ran it out to the front of the house I used it to charge my little electric car and also I I attached it to my electric box my meter you know after the meter there the next day I got a knock on the door from The Electric Company Two Gentlemen there they said sir uh do you have solar panels or a generator of any kind on your house uh and I kind of panicked a little bit and I said well yeah look I got I got a I got a little solar panel in the back I didn&#x27;t want to I didn&#x27;t want to tell them about my generator they said well anything you attach to the house whether it&#x27;s solar or anything else you have to have a permit and it has to be inspected by the electric company that&#x27;s the law here so I disconnected I took it off and I know how they caught me because you see inside their uh they don&#x27;t read meters like the old fashion way man like you may use you know know about the meter guy come around and read your meter all the time they don&#x27;t do that no more it&#x27;s all done from their office from their uh facilitate and my my sine wave is a little bit different from SRP sine wave so they&#x27;ve seen that different sine wave on there just like the sine wave from the solar panels is a little different too every kind of different device other than what they&#x27;re using their generators they&#x27;re big generators they&#x27;re coal-fired and oil-fired and all of those they have a they have a sequence of a perfect sine wave that they use anything else uh like one of the engineers told me he says they uh they were having problems because there was a law pass that if you have a lot of solar panels and you&#x27;re using uh you&#x27;re making more electricity than you&#x27;re using the electric company has to buy that from you see well they didn&#x27;t like that idea uh and when that when that solar energy goes back in the line to them they have a special setup there that lines it up with their sequence so then everything works good normal now when I built my small one in the backyard I had two problems I had to deal with first of all I couldn&#x27;t go any higher than what I&#x27;ve got I&#x27;m roughly around anywhere from six five to seven thousand Watts okay but my the back of my house is on Indian School Road that&#x27;s a very big highway right there four lane and across on the other side way up there there&#x27;s you see the high voltage lines that they haven&#x27;t changed yet eventually those are supposed to be underground but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re still there so I&#x27;m between that and in the front of my house underground out there is the underground wires that have been buried you know all the houses now in this area no more poles or anything everything is underground except for those high tension well I&#x27;m right between the two if if I if my unit put out some more say if I double or triple the number of plates I&#x27;m using my uh my electromagnetic field is gonna touch that electromagnetic field across the street now that&#x27;s very high that&#x27;s that&#x27;s uh what 30 30 I think 38 000 votes there so if if mine touches that it&#x27;s gonna just fry everything I got it&#x27;s all going to burn up so I had to be very very careful putting this in my backyard that&#x27;s that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re getting this bigger property where uh I got over three acres I can get far enough in the middle of my property to get away away from any of the uh uh the City Line because the City Line out there in Waddell is buried down the street in the front of your property so I can get quite a ways back from it because I&#x27;m gonna I&#x27;m gonna build a one megawatt one one megawatt and then I&#x27;m gonna try to get the uh UL people to give me a UL safety approval I&#x27;m going to surround it with chickens and some rabbits and you know I want to put white rats on the inside uh they they had all these laws and everything when it comes to electromagnetics every 30 days I&#x27;ve got to take one of the white rats in there and I gotta dissect it take the liver out and put it in one of the you you know uh cold boxes that they give you um you put the Frozen uh slats in there you take it out of the freezer and then you put the liver in there tape it up and send it to their Laboratory see they want to know that my electromagnetic field is not dangerous say I wonder if the inspectors come out and they have a cell phone checking with the office they&#x27;re using a cell phone up to their head you know uh you know uh it was quite a you know the the fox are foxes are guarding the ten house so to speak on uh maintaining the status quo on uh keeping keeping inventions like that from uh being able to help Humanity so I I guess from the perspective of a lot of my viewers now I mean they probably are feeling quite depressed because any attempts to come up with these Alternative Energy Technologies by inventors such as you Dr Schwartz uh experience all of these difficulties event is being killed or being persecuted in courts having secrecy orders are imposed on them having to deal with utility companies that kind of come and interrogate you if you&#x27;re displaying any kind of uh power generation that doesn&#x27;t fit within their guidelines so you know what&#x27;s there to look forward to well I&#x27;ve after that incident of burning my car up um after that I made uh I made six DVD discs with the technology on it all the frequency yeah James I don&#x27;t know if you can hear us your your internet&#x27;s freezing um you left off you made six discs CD CDs uh just scattered out around the world if anything happens to me or my family they&#x27;re all going to go on the internet everybody on Earth is going to have basically free energy and I got the simplest one in there too the easiest one to make would probably be the the compounds for the rods okay and then I got the technology on there for them to to build the plates and how to energize the plates and I even uh got a way to do it where you can take a uh an AM FM radio that you buy uh in the store take it apart use the circuits on it and buy it and then get a little small uh frequency generator which you can buy online and how to wire it up and set and you with those two circuits you can give enough sequence to those plates to generate some electrons that&#x27;s the easiest way to do it but it&#x27;s very clumsy now the way I&#x27;m doing it is much better it&#x27;s sad Brilliant Minds like you you know you uh have to do a dead man switch in case something happens to you to be able to you know the Deep state control mechanisms are Global it&#x27;s International all over the world doesn&#x27;t matter like you we&#x27;re trying to do in Japan it doesn&#x27;t matter if you were in uh Tasmania or India or any country there&#x27;s these control mechanisms unless this deep State Control mechanism is is removed uh and and and you and I know and Michael as well that there&#x27;s technologies that have been withheld that are in these uh classified projects that are so far Advanced where every home and Business can have a little unit the size of a shoe box and give you multiple kilowatts and the grid is uh susceptible to a EMP or CME uh and they&#x27;re ugly wires running all across the planet that&#x27;s right you know we could have decentralized power and mass production of these units and you know cut the cut the cord from the power companies and everybody have independent power I get the results of a Think Tank survey that was done on uh why the government does what they do and according to the this Think Tank study that was done if say my technology say uh they put it on every power plant all the way around the world yeah 90 90 93 of the people employed involved in it everything all the way up to the highest blue collar and everything is is unnecessary it makes such a vast change at one time it Causes Chaos you see what I mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s their reasoning why they want to keep me away from the grid system until they&#x27;re ready for me you see so I want to have that UL approval that&#x27;s very important to me because you know Dan a lot of people that have come here to see my unit because nobody believes it you know I&#x27;ve had MIT out here I&#x27;ve got uh University engineers and all that came out here and I&#x27;ve got it suspended so you you no wires to it or anything you see I mean it&#x27;s obvious it works you know and I let them use they can use a volt meter or an amp meter that&#x27;s all and they uh this one guy that came out here a couple of months ago he&#x27;s seen my oscilloscope on the top shelter and it and it was turned off but it&#x27;s connected to my unit and he says well can we turn on your oscilloscope and I says no you can&#x27;t well it does seem that um you know given everything you&#x27;ve described that the controllers still have this system in place where they&#x27;re preventing energy inventors such as yourself from being able to achieve any kind of success it seems that what we&#x27;re waiting for is some kind of major shift in the control system and maybe this is where we get into this whole uh question of the earth Alliance versus the Deep state that the Earth Alliance representing this kind of progressive group of military government intelligence types working in unison to overcome the Deep State and once that happens then not only will these repressed Technologies be released that have been secretly developed in this kind of like compartmentalized world but also inventors such as yourself will actually be helped so that you can actually get the funding and the supports so that your inventions see the light of day and that you you know you obviously have a lot more to contribute and rather than having to kind of like hide and be protected from these kind of like Sinister agencies that you&#x27;re actually being supported and helped and you know be nice to see people like you becoming celebrities in the future because of all your inventions well I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t care about that I just I just want to leave me alone you know amen my little research area they I I&#x27;ve been on the internet ever since it started my cell phone is the same as when the first cell phone came out the same number I mean I&#x27;ve been around a long long time you know and I just try to stay under the radar you know I don&#x27;t want all that attention or anything I&#x27;ve um I&#x27;ve seen too much crap out there that I could spend days telling you about some stuff that I&#x27;ve seen it just it&#x27;s unbelievable especially in India uh I was hired by somebody in India there to go there and to check a very very elaborate device that&#x27;s supposed to produce electricity well when I went there I showed them how how phony it was because I revealed how they&#x27;re doing it you know it was just a scam you know and there&#x27;s they&#x27;re all over the internet you I know you Dan you&#x27;ve seen all that crap on there you know and they saying uh especially when they&#x27;re got all these moving parts and belts they got a generator and you gotta uh a motor and now you&#x27;re using a battery to to power it and they claim that more power out than power and and that&#x27;s a bunch of old it doesn&#x27;t work that way um the closest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen to anything that&#x27;s that&#x27;s uh halfway decent had a 3 000 pound flywheel on it now that was pretty impressive um it was a guy right here and uh uh Nebraska had one in his barn he made that three thousand uh pound cement fly flywheel and balanced it and everything and when it gets going it&#x27;s good you know but sooner or later you pay for it you see what I mean it&#x27;s not gonna run forever um and what they don&#x27;t like about mine is it&#x27;s electromagnetic well when they attack me because my electromagnetics I tell them well look it&#x27;s been around for billions of years and and they say well what do you mean for billions of years look at the lightning lightning builds up in the clouds okay it builds up and sooner or later there&#x27;s so much of it there it&#x27;s got to strike the ground okay just like cross putting a wrench across your battery in your car it&#x27;s going you&#x27;re going to get a fire there you know Spark um well that&#x27;s the way the earth is made that&#x27;s the way God made the Earth the Earth&#x27;s a magnetic field you see um that lightning builds up until it reaches a point it&#x27;s got to strike the Earth it&#x27;s the same way when you uh help to entertain you sometime and actually come here and see what I&#x27;ve done I would love to meet you face to face but if I didn&#x27;t have those six little see I got six panels in there when Dan showed it to you you&#x27;ll see the place there&#x27;s six sets of plates in there okay each one of those plates has a little fine wire it&#x27;s a speaker wire attached to it and it&#x27;s going out and into the ground and I have some special ground devices on there not ordinary not like putting on iron and uh rod in the ground and you see those red wires in there those red wires one of those is attached to each plate now if I didn&#x27;t have those my unit would do exactly the same thing as Lightning does it would keep building and building and building after a certain time until it would burn itself up you see you have to work with the Earth that&#x27;s the way God designed it Tesla found out that and they mocked him they made fun of him and everything when he tried to tell them that nobody would believe it but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s if you&#x27;re gonna uh use the Earth&#x27;s field just like the Egyptians were doing okay you got to do it properly all of these power plants that we have all the way around the world do you do you know what they&#x27;re doing to the Earth they&#x27;re actually damaging the Earth we live on because of the way they&#x27;re producing power the natural way to produce power is just like lightning exactly what I&#x27;m doing here it&#x27;s simple it&#x27;s easy and I&#x27;ve just begun right now if I didn&#x27;t have Dan sometimes to talk to I&#x27;d go nuts I I&#x27;d I&#x27;d be I&#x27;d go crazy I got somebody to talk to to under to help understand a little bit you know and I learned a lot from him from listening to him you know um I and I right now I think I found a missing thing in my technology that Dan is working with on those crystals that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m very anxious to learn more I&#x27;m like a like a sponge I want to soak up some energy there and I think that&#x27;s going to make a lot of difference in my technology yeah he&#x27;s very interested in what Elena has been bringing forth and uh Crystal technology from Yes sirhan&#x27;s uh brother John Hannah Radion uh and we&#x27;re going to be uh bringing forth more information on crystals and I&#x27;m going to be sharing that with uh with James uh yeah uh you&#x27;re doing also doing work with regeneration with uh in water tubs yeah with uh with Rife frequencies um something uh something I&#x27;m familiar with I used to build Rife generators a long time ago uh tap onto that briefly well Michael you and I have something in common we&#x27;re both know the medical field okay I&#x27;m I&#x27;m gonna build a a a chamber right now it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not as good as a med bed but I&#x27;m gonna fill it with salt water and the whole idea is to use Royal Rife technology uh an altered Royal Rife generator and send those frequencies through the water and the patient gets all the way down in the water and breathes just like he was scuba diving and sits on the bottom okay now instead of the uh these Royal Rife generators are a joke as far as I&#x27;m concerned because they go through one hand through the other and not the other side they don&#x27;t get the organs of the body and when you stand in the pan they go through one leg drown it that way okay frequencies are a lot like uh electricity seeking a lamp the line of least resistance because there&#x27;s parts of the frequency that mankind hasn&#x27;t learned about yet that Tesla did he found out that you can actually Collide frequencies too if if they would give me two hours at the cyclotron to run a couple of tests I could show them how to to power the whole world well I&#x27;m so people there&#x27;s an answer to that I&#x27;m sure people look forward to these inventions I&#x27;ve actually went there when I went well they when you&#x27;re the little guy like me and Dan you know we&#x27;re doing these little things you know they look down at you like hey you know you&#x27;re not a a physicist she uh you don&#x27;t have the billion dollar laboratory uh you know you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing you know well I think what you&#x27;re doing is very important work and I certainly think that people want to know more about how Tesla&#x27;s Technologies can be applied today and it sounds like you&#x27;re doing a lot of really important work in in bringing those principles into realization with these inventions so I I want to kind of bring this to a close so Dan any kind of final words you want to say about uh James and his inventions no this has been uh it&#x27;s been an honor to bring uh my friend uh Dr James schwartzon and and for also the first time being able to share my story how I got involved and all these scientists and inventors and uh and you know bringing awareness you know if people aren&#x27;t aware of the suppression that has been going on for decades and that we&#x27;ve had Solutions and that there&#x27;s a global control that uh well one way or another make sure that you&#x27;re still using gasoline you&#x27;re still paying for the power company still using dangerous obsolete Technologies um and it hasn&#x27;t been needed for decades and um um you know the more awareness we need to educate the public which is what you&#x27;re doing an incredible job Michael uh of these possibilities exist and what what exists in the uh unacknowledged special access programs is far beyond you know what most uh civilian scientists and inventors with the but limited budgets that they have have been created you know not to mention assistance from off-planet cultures so uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s been my honor to uh to join you and uh bring on Dr Schwartz well thank you Dan and thank you Dr Schwartz I&#x27;m I&#x27;m Jill and a great privilege to get to meet you uh no I know a lot about you you know from the internet and all but uh this first time I actually got to see him in person um you know I look at myself as a very small part of the Cog in the whole system you know I got so much to learn um I&#x27;m going to be changing my plates even pretty soon here those uh plates are not gonna no longer going to be shaped like they are they going to be around like a disc you know just like a an old phonograph record is what it&#x27;s going to look like with a hole in the center and um it&#x27;s going to work at least five six times better than the one I&#x27;m working with now I just gotta um I have to do it slowly you know I don&#x27;t have the billions of dollars you know and all the money to do things and since I&#x27;m kind of the the out-of-way type scientists you know I don&#x27;t can&#x27;t go to my books and get all the information you know and that I need sometimes because it&#x27;s not in there you know uh can people find you can people have can people find you on the internet if they want to contact you they want to support you where do they go uh Dan can give you my uh flux powertechnology.com and you&#x27;ll and you&#x27;ll see the drawings of uh the one megawatt that I&#x27;m gonna build um and since I&#x27;m doing it with all my own money and everything without any help it&#x27;s going to take me a little while it&#x27;s going to take me a couple of years to build it but I know I know I can put out at least one megawatt maybe a megawatt and a half because there&#x27;s some new materials coming out now this new graph and Technology I&#x27;m very interested in it I&#x27;ve already added it to my research and I think it&#x27;s going to make a big difference well I look forward to what the future brings and your work certainly is something that&#x27;s going to bring about some really big changes once you get the support and the and whatever the Deep state undergoes in the future I think it&#x27;s going to lead to people like you being able to get the support to release a lot of really life-changing Technologies so again thank you you have been listening to exopolitics today with Dr Michael Salah please remember to like share and subscribe to this channel join or
