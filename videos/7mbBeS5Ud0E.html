            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hi my name is Bob Grenier and I&#x27;m a volunteer with the Martin Fleischmann memorial project today I want to talk about the work of dr. Eugene POD Clinton oov and he is a Russian and he then went to work in tamp air in Finland and what I&#x27;ve done there&#x27;s a one video out there that was produced by alien scientist and I have taken that and done a human transcript of it to highlight a few points and I&#x27;ve also looked at some of the recordings on American anti-gravity site and pulled out a few things that I&#x27;ve wanted to talk about for some time and I think now is the right time to talk about those things so this is a follow on from the previous video about Tesla&#x27;s work and how that links into the work of Winston Bostick and that the work of Kenneth shoulders and Takayuki Matsumoto and here you will start to see other things connecting together so I&#x27;ll dig right into it so I&#x27;ve given in this blog post and the blog post link will be given in the video description unfortunately steam it now has adverts at the top so that&#x27;s just something we have to contend with so essentially I&#x27;ve given the interviewers an initial R or o and that when Eugene is talking I&#x27;ve given him an E and I&#x27;ll just want to pull out a few points in here so essentially he did some work in the 1990s and on superconductors it was all the rage then and they discovered when they were spinning a superconductor at high speeds and someone came in and they were smoking mission and been smoking in the lab the smoke went directly upwards when it went over the projection area of the superconductor so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the basis for it and he published in physical C and all of the links to the relevant page pisar in in this blog post so you can dig into those so there was a second paper and then Martin time are at the European Space Agency did a replication so just really a few points but I seriously recommend you read this entire thing because it has some very interesting things that it says so when we rotate the whole disk in the magnetic field normal conducting layers produce a lot of electrons and they move to the superconducting area and they become not electrons but Cooper pairs and they form what we call in physics it bones Einstein condensate which has unusual properties and one of the main properties is that it has the property of super fluidity superconductivity definitely and it can also interact with subatomic particles that exist all around all the objects and practically form the whole universe and by using this interaction of our superconducting material with summer topic subatomic particles we get very unusual reaction and we can to some extent change or to some extent change or modify local gravity field now in no writings comments or whatever that I&#x27;ve seen or certainly the videos and audio recordings that are made by claude de courten of does he discuss the fact that the subatomic particles that are there in everything and going through everything everything could be neutrinos but that is being suggested by alexander park Marv it is being suggested by constantan mail it is being suggested in the number of papers that I will present to you that formed some of the background behind the explanation for some of the observations by Xu and Yu and and so forth that I presented in the previous video anyway essentially actually in in in nature you have a few things that are able to be stable and and exists for basically permanently and one is a proton two is an electron and three is a neutrino but in basically a proton electron become come together with the aid of neutrinos to form an Neutron and neutron is like basically stable in a nucleus as as it&#x27;s thought of and of the unstable particles it&#x27;s one of the most stable but long-lived particles there&#x27;s basically those three electron proton and neutrino and the neutrino for me is the very interesting thing here and he&#x27;s saying that basically by getting to a situation of a bose-einstein condensate you can interact with whatever it is that effectively he goes on to describe that is the ether that it is that which through light propagates and there&#x27;s an important experiment that he did which kind of banks this outside so this is essentially what he&#x27;s saying in an implant influences the gravity field and I will be able to point to papers from the 1950s through to 19 2010 where they are talking about how the the gravity could be explained by neutrinos and so I wanted to talk about those sooner but I haven&#x27;t been able to find the time to date but you will get those videos coming up so do subscribe to the channel if you want to know how these things tied together in my opinion so there&#x27;s a lot being said here and you really should take the time to read it okay so there are various approaches and there are pages on the net where we could called American anti-gravity and it&#x27;s a very big work by Tim Ventura and I have small abstract there and there are different ways to polarize space and to have interaction with the physical vacuum we can create high magnetic fields we can create electric fields like by field Brown effect we can have extra low frequencies and here&#x27;s it&#x27;s necessary to mention the works of professor friend de que de aquino from Brazil and is also possible to use magnetic fields based on the works of Professor Searle from Great Britain what he&#x27;s saying here is that essentially you you don&#x27;t have to have super conductors to achieve this and in fact his most advanced latest research doesn&#x27;t involve superconductors and he&#x27;s quite clear and he mentions it several times in this interview that the superconductors are interesting because you can freeze into them magnetic fields and then you can spin that round and so you can use it as a model for what you might want to build in in a physical way but you don&#x27;t actually need to have the superconductors okay now the the the powerful unit he generated was an impulse gravity generator and he talks about that and I will go and look at some things here so but we have no limitations so he&#x27;s talking about the fact that they assess that the impulse this sort of effect on the gravity field which he says it might be gravitons but there&#x27;s a hypothetical particle particle and no one&#x27;s knows if they exist or it might just be an influence on the ether and if the ether is as I said since it is a neutrino fluid then it&#x27;s traveling through and and he goes into how this works in his opinion with this spin wave so he says we have no limitations because we don&#x27;t work with any material objects they practically have no mass and this impulse is able to interact with light we made a rather interesting research the results were published in the magazine of the Journal of low-temperature physics in August of 2003 and again it&#x27;s with dr. modern a say at first we were able only to work with pendulums and just only the best thing that we were able to do was to push a thick book off the table it was a standing gestures with hand it was just a vocabulary but now we are when we studied and were working with this program for several years and I have a very good team we were able to increase the power of this beam so that now it can bend metals rather thick plates and it can create holes in fragile materials such as bricks or cement or ceramics so I&#x27;m going to go to this journal article because it&#x27;s talking about light and and and this ties into other things that we&#x27;ve been discussing so this is actually the journal article like I say all the links are in the blog post which you can gain access to the link to the blog post will be in the video and so he&#x27;s working with this Giovanni moderner is a and he creates this gravity impulse generator he has this at one point two-to-one on something one one one point two one one kilometer distance here and these firing a laser cross here and it has this optical sensor and when the impulse comes the laser is effectively deflected off this which implies that something is traveling through the ether a wave that&#x27;s pushing the light from its direct path it&#x27;s actually changing the medium through which the light is traveling and and so it&#x27;s actually causing a shift in the light and depending on the intensity of this impulse I the voltage the discharge voltage if i zoom into that you might see this a bit more clear so the discharge quality increasing the discharge voltage means that the light intensity decreases so I guess that when it&#x27;s when it&#x27;s coming on to this sensor it&#x27;s it&#x27;s moving it off more and so the intensity of the laser signal reaching there is is going to drop and this is very interesting just without even thinking for more than a few milliseconds you can create a communication device here that is like very difficult to intercept because you could fire you could have a laser beam pointing to whatever it is you is your receiver and then you use this impulse device to modulate that and this is not something that&#x27;s going to radiate so you could communicate to the moon say with something that the only way to to be able to interact with it is to have the receiver in the same places at the receiver even if you had the technology you&#x27;d still have to have it in the place of receiver the other thing is how they determine the speed line they did it over one point two one one kilometers again and they had a piezo sensor a transducer and that produced a signal and they had an atomic clock and then they had another atomic clock here so they could see how long the impulse took to go from here to here and then I think they later did it over something like seven kilometers as well but they did very many tests to determine that this impulse travels a large multiples of the speed of light so this is very interesting to me the fact that this can modulate light because I I discussed earlier from the the work that was done by the Russians and that were presented at Sochi where you have a a bull Lightning and it&#x27;s spinning on on one side you get a a blue and on the other side you get a red because how is that happening it&#x27;s like changing the the it&#x27;s like a Doppler effect on the light and this is kind of almost like a Doppler effect it&#x27;s pushing it along with it and I was relating that back to the Lyon reactor where we are unable to determine elements and it&#x27;s almost based on angle and it&#x27;s a presentation that I called tractor beam and I put out at the early part last year it&#x27;s immediately the perception that I had of what has to be going on here it seems to be either speeding up or slowing down light so that the the so-called characteristic setting x-rays in the material coming back is nothing the characteristic x-rays that you can observe from any normal elements in nature so what I&#x27;m suggesting is as shoulder said is that that actually these exotic vacuum objects are able to do a similar thing and that they are in the metal as shoulders said and it&#x27;s interacting with the electron and the light that&#x27;s so produced so I&#x27;m gonna go back to his article here it&#x27;s like is there the transcript here and because there&#x27;s a few more key points I want to bring out here so he&#x27;s basically saying like who&#x27;s interested and so forth and he&#x27;s got a comment here on sort of theories and it says if we compare quantum mechanics which is well-established science in physics and general relativity there are enormous contradictions between these two theories which contradictions in formulas in understandings in basics and the whole scientific world closed closes their eyes they don&#x27;t want to mention it and by the way this does not keep people from using both effects for example we use einstein&#x27;s protein and I&#x27;ve taught in atomic bombs and we use quantum mechanics for all electronics and for our portable phones and both things work but they have contradictions in theory and these contradictions are really great so he&#x27;s saying like you know there is a suggestion that what products are now has done the contradicts with some laws and actually he&#x27;s very clear in in and you&#x27;ll see in this transcript that he&#x27;s saying no it doesn&#x27;t contradict anything actually if you actually know what you&#x27;re talking about it does not contradict anything but even let&#x27;s assume there is some contradictions because it definitely does what it does according to him then then so what if you can use it to achieve an end what does it matter because both quantum mechanics and and and Einstein&#x27;s relativity they they kind of have issues but they still able to produce useful embodiments so going a little bit further here he&#x27;s asked you know does it cause any kind of radio interference so if you&#x27;re having a radio playing by he says no no this insulation doesn&#x27;t produce any bad effects on radio that&#x27;s the question but if we speak about the impulse gravity generator we put a Faraday cage over the installation otherwise all the computers in the surrounding area will be burned just let that sink in so a pulse from the impact and this is very much like shoulders described Tesla had these problems he blew up a power station you know the Hutchison had things blow up on him that weren&#x27;t connected and we had some issues when we were doing one of our reactors and in the glowstick series so it&#x27;s very interesting that he says here that when when you have these impulses and and essentially shoulders are saying when you blow up an EVO it produces an electromagnetic pulse and you know depending on the size of the evo or the rate of you know destruction of Evo&#x27;s maleeh he&#x27;s doing these he&#x27;s using marks generators and and when you look at the diagram below for the gravity impulse generator it&#x27;s essentially a shoulders discharge device so here we go as far as we understand how the system works we can move to normal materials because the key to polarizing space is also rotating magnetic fields which work in a certain resonance cycle and in order to create these conditions we don&#x27;t need superconductors we just need normal materials so this would support the kind of findings and that is at 11.and barinov were having in some of the work that they showed at Saatchi last year and you can go and have a look at that presentation on our youtube channel as well see if there&#x27;s anything else i want to share with you guys okay so here when we create polarization of space under the conditions of normal earth that means we create a kind of gravity well and all the subjects all the objects that are close to this area they will fall into this well so we observe this phenomena as a UFO or any flying dis which goes up but in fact speaking in physical terms that means that this object is falling inside a gravity well so he&#x27;s describing you know how it&#x27;s effectively giving lift by changing the the low [Music] vacuum properties and he actually talks of course about how Harold put off and how that played into his thinking and so forth so this is talking about how the he doesn&#x27;t call it anti-gravity he likes to call it gravity modification and he repeatedly says we don&#x27;t know where the gravitons exists I&#x27;d rather he offers two options gravitons if you accept that they exist all and we&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s actually modifying the the ether and what is the ether well and I will speak more on that in the future now there&#x27;s some other things here so this is the gravity impulse generator and here&#x27;s your pendulum and here&#x27;s your anode here&#x27;s your superconducting it arrum barium copper or whatever it is I white ybco and whatever it is why bchow and this is called by liquid nitrogen you&#x27;ve got a Marx generator putting a pulse in you have these coils you have to have the alignment cause this is it&#x27;s similar in in fact the kind of alignment I was talking about in in the Lyon reactors so you have your discharge here and that creates your pulse and that shifts the pendulum or punches a deforms a thick piece of metal or or punch as a hole through a ceramic or or rock or that sort of thing now there&#x27;s this same thing here we&#x27;re saying danger zone and this is the last sort of major thing I want to pull out of this separate interview here which I hope to be able to do a human translation a transcript for when I get time but I wanted to draw your attention to a 5 minute 13 seconds where he says their beam coming from the experiments allows fusion of dissimilar materials that&#x27;s my comment what he specifically cells says is in this area behind the gravity impulse is going this way but in this area you can weld metal objects to plastic and it&#x27;s effective at a distance of several meters so this is the area you don&#x27;t want to be in and you don&#x27;t want to have things in this is almost exactly what was observed by John Hutchison and you know we have some sample where materials are fused into each other and and and this is essentially what he&#x27;s saying here and we do know that John Hutchison used discharge tubes or dips or spark gaps and various interfering radio waves and it could be that whatever the orientation was at that time he was getting this discharge hit now as I&#x27;ve said before you do not need this spinning superconductor here to create this overall effect and in fact that&#x27;s not what he and public art analysis is is using as far as the understanding but this for me is one of the most interesting things here is this is another scientist working for decades now having observed the welding of metal as an example welding metal objects to plastic objects that just absolutely shouldn&#x27;t happen you got a nonconductor being fused with a metal object and this is typical to John Hudson&#x27;s effect a fusion of dissimilar materials and also he talks about pollution-free power generator imagine if this was upright like this and you had a load of rocks on a big black bicycle chain and you shot the beam up and all of the rocks on this side became much much lighter and the ones on this side became heaven you could you look at literally have a power generator with a very you know high gear ratio set of gears to make this side lighter and as it goes around it just goes around like this and you&#x27;re just changing the local weight of one side of this device and so there&#x27;s a way to generate you know very simple power generation he actually says just you have a turbine you make one side lighter effectively and it will just start to turn so this this also is a video so the the actual part here is is from this interview which is just an audio clip but in this video he&#x27;s described the fact that he uses Marxist generators he deforms the metal this deformation of thick metal plates happens in a very short timeframe so it&#x27;s basically like a punch but the punch can be at extremely long distances and it doesn&#x27;t really lose its power it can make holes in concrete walls hit objects said big distances or I should say I think and the at one point he says is like that one of the parameters is very important is the diameter of superconductor should be larger than the Schwarzschild radius and I would like you to go and look at that and its relationship to one astrological feature so that&#x27;s it from this presentation do consider subscribing to the channel thank you for your time and I will see you in the next video</p>
