            <p>So the first thing I did when I got the um x-rays of the young girl, this is the adakama. The otakama mummy, right, was that I checked with some people at the in the department of radiology and I said, &quot;Hey, um, who can I talk to about this?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, you know, it turns out that we have the world&#x27;s expert now working with us.&quot; I took the X-rays to him and he said, &quot;Well, this is unusual.&quot; But he didn&#x27;t laugh me out of the room. He said, &quot;It might be interesting.&quot; So, I said, &quot;Okay, let&#x27;s do it.&quot; So, I arranged then to get a piece of um uh of the rib and uh you know proceeded to do the the genetics. So, a lot of the stuff that I initially thought was unknown were actually explainable by bringing in the experts. You know, it&#x27;s in science.</p>
<p>Knowing the limit of your knowledge and your capability is how you do good science. Now that we know this is a young girl, this should be returned to Chile and it should be given proper burial rights. It shouldn&#x27;t be a circus</p>
