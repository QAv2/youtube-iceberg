            <p>good day learners welcome again to our lesson in general physics 1 differentiating vector and scalar quantities so after finishing the module the learner should be able to define vector and scalar quantities and give example of the vector and scalar quantities so let&#x27;s begin so let&#x27;s think what is the difference between this illustration how about the quantities on the left how do you differentiate the quantities on the right so basically we can compare that both both sections have same values right but the difference is that in the left part of the diagram we can see direction so how is this related to our lesson today so let&#x27;s continue so our lesson today is all about the scalar and vector quantities so when we say scalar scalar quantities are quantities described by a magnitude which means it has a unit alone when we say magnitude magnitude is a numerical value in the measurement so as we go back in these figures or illustration we can see that both of this illustration have the same magnitude right but the difference is that on the right part of this illustration we can see that there is a direction so let&#x27;s continue the distance is a scalar quantity it is the total length of the actual path traveled based on the illustration if you walk from a to b then to c your total distance traveled in is 55 meter so as you can see in the figure we have three stations right so we have letter a letter b and letter c so as you walk from letter a to letter b your distance the measurement of your distance traveled is 20 meter so this is 20 meter now you went to your school with another 35 meter so basically the total distance traveled is 55 so what about this 40 meter how is this related to this illustration so let&#x27;s continue aside from the distance here are the other scalar quantities okay mind you that is speed area pressure temperature time power volume amount of substances or moles and mass are examples of the scalar quantities now let&#x27;s proceed with the vector so when we say vector quantities vector quantities are quantities described by both magnitude and direction a while ago we discussed about the scalar quantity it has only magnitude and a unit right but in vector quantities we can see that vectors have direction so a vector quantity can be denoted using a single letter with an overhead arrow so take note class that if you could see a letter a with an arrow on its top that denotes a vector quantity so at this portion of this slide we can see different examples of vector quantities so 500 meter as a magnitude right now 500 is a value magnitude this is the quantity meter now let&#x27;s include the direction so the direction is left so that is a vector quantity aside from that we have also 7 miles per hour north then we have also 60 degrees north is these are the examples of the vector quantities so the direction indicates the path where the quantity is heading the cardinal directions north east west and south or left right up down positive and negative are some of the common used terms to describe the direction of the quantity so can you see the difference between the vector and scalar quantities let&#x27;s continue a vector quantity can be represented graphically using an arrow so this is now a vector quantity so we have five vectors that have the same magnitude and direction because they are all directed towards that area now the arrow head points to the direction of the quantity while its length represents the magnitude so take note class that if this arrow doesn&#x27;t have any head it only denotes that it has only a magnitude but if it has an ahead arrow like that so you can say that this is a vector quantity so a vector quantity is presented already in this illustration so consider a as the initial position and c as the final position even if you travel from a to b then c your displacement from a is 40 meters south unlike distance the direction is considered in displacement so take note of the word displacement okay when we say displacement displacement is the difference between the final and initial position of the object thus direction is needed so that is the importance of having the direction it would really present the displacement so without displacement you are not able to see you are not able to see whether this is a vector quantity or a scalar maybe you can say that this is a scalar okay so let&#x27;s begin let&#x27;s continue so take note plus that velocity force acceleration momentum and weight are examples of vector quantity so you may encounter these quantities in our next discussions so remember when we say scalar quantities scalar quantities are quantities described by a magnitude with a unit alone when we say vector quantities vector quantities are quantities described by both magnitude and direction so that ends the presentation if you have any question then just message me on the comment box or you can just message me directly so god bless everyone and happy learning</p>
