            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel we do educational material on this channel and uh today is no exception today is the 291st day that we&#x27;ve been working with Dewey B Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory and um the reciprocal system of theory is a theory of everything or a system of theory meaning that once you get the system then you can plug it into any subject that you&#x27;d like you have to kind of figure it out uh and it&#x27;s not easy uh you need to be familiar with a lot of Larson&#x27;s work before you can do that um but the basic idea behind Larson&#x27;s system is that we live in a universe of motion and uh this is a departure other people have posited that in the past a few but um you know most people would say that the universe is made out of matter or perhaps that the universe is made out of energy Larson says that matter and energy are just two different varieties of motion along with all of the other scientific quantities that we&#x27;re familiar with like uh acceleration and speed and um really electric current and electric charge and capacitance and resistance and Force these are all just different kinds of motion and they are all similar in that they can be described exclusively in terms of space and time for Larson motion is the relationship between space and time relationship implies a ratio or a fraction where you have either space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator so for example speed the the bicycle is moving 20 miles per hour 20 miles of space in one hour of time space over time speed speed is space over time uh now when you work these things out you find out that energy is time over space matter is time to the third power over space to the third power force is time over space to the second power whereas acceleration is space over time to the second power pressure is time over space to the fourth power um and so on and so forth now uh the reciprocal relationship that holds between space and time space and time have no other significance other than they come together in motion it&#x27;s kind of like Larson uses the analogy of a box motion is a box and if you have a box you automatically have the inside of the box and the outside of the box one is like time and the other is like space uh and the Box itself is the motion and um so uh the basic uh now Larson kind of had an inkling of this this this stuff way back in the late 1920s early 1930s where he he was trying to work out an equation for the inter-atomic distance between uh elements he um basically just had this uh Epiphany that what if you just assumed that space and time were reciprocals of each other and he plugged it into the equation he was working out and boom the answer popped out and so he was like wow that worked so I didn&#x27;t think too much of it I guess but then he was working on another problem a few months later and he was like once you try that space and time of reciprocals of each other thing again and the answer popped out again and so he was like uh take note and he tried it again with another problem and got another answer and so then he started uh doing a systematic study uh but it took many years he he had a day job so he&#x27;s just working on it at night with his Slide Rule and um eventually in the late 1950s he put out his two fundamental postulates the first of which is by far the uh most important and that basically is that the universe is composed entirely of motion and at first he called it space time the universe is composed entirely of space-time but uh he eventually turned that into motion and emotions of relationship between space and time so uh space and time both have their coordinate aspects meaning that space and time both come in three dimensions coordinate XYZ coordinates and space and time both have their uh they they both progress uh this refers to what Larson refers to as a scalar motion that is a motion that has a magnitude but has no Direction of a scalar motion is uh in time like a clock he calls it clock time and clock space the clock is always getting later and later it&#x27;s moving later and later and later but in no particular direction and in space you could Envision this as uh dots on a balloon you have a bunch of dots on a balloon you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction um that was also observed by the Hubble telescope that determined that all of the distant galaxies were moving away from each other so that is what Larson calls clock space or the progression of space and then space and time also only come in discrete units they are quantized meaning that there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time they are very small but nonetheless they are existent so the minimum unit of space is about 4.52 times 4.56 times 10 to the minus 8 meters so 120 millionth of a meter and uh the uh natural unit of time is about 1.52 times 10 to the minus 16 seconds so that is uh that means that of these units of time you can fit uh 6.576 quadrillion of them in one second so it&#x27;s in uh inconceivably brief but say with the unit of space it&#x27;s a very small microscopic amount but it is still very large compared to the size of an atom so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space or time then you do not have space or time so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you don&#x27;t have space and by the reciprocal postulate and the you know the general idea of the universe of motion composed entirely of motion if you don&#x27;t have space then you only have time and if you don&#x27;t have time then you only have space so those are the really the three caveats that are listed in Larson&#x27;s first postulate coordinate space coordinate time clock space clock time and discrete units of space and time now if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time now remember we already went through space over time is motion one unit of space in one unit of time is what Larson calls unit speed and that refers to the speed of light the speed of light is unit speed one unit of space and one unit of time and the speed of light is really the null point or the origin or The Ether or the background or the reference point of this universe so if you if you have a universe of motion you do not measure from zero you measure from an already moving uh reference point so you measure from the speed of light that you know you have to be able to accept that fact in order to accept a universe of motion you have to be able to accept the fact that motion precedes anything moving and so motion is the most fundamental thing so that&#x27;s where you start your measurements from is from something that&#x27;s already moving um and Larson refers to that as the progression of the natural reference system uh the speed of light outward in all directions at you know at the speed of light so um that&#x27;s where you make your measurements from and that is also the null point or the midpoint of this universe so in Larson&#x27;s system half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light which Larson refers to as the cosmic sector half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light which we&#x27;re familiar with that&#x27;s called the material sector and that&#x27;s where the scientists do all their observation and measuring and that&#x27;s why Einstein said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe so Lars Einstein implicitly is saying that um he doesn&#x27;t understand anything about the cosmic sector now what uh Shores up that that Gap is that in Larson&#x27;s system uh there is a reciprocity and so whatever is going on in the material sector it is duplicated in the cosmic sector the same thing is going on in the cosmic sector as the material sector except that you have to invert the roles of space and time because of the reciprocal pass to it so in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and you have clock time time is always getting later and later and later we&#x27;re familiar with this this is the sector that we make our observations from the material sector but in the cosmic sector you have three dimensions of time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and we looked at a paper the other day that was written by Dr kbk nehru one of Larson&#x27;s uh kind of collaborators uh who I believe is still living uh Larson died back in 1990. at the age of 92. um but I believe neru is still around he&#x27;s been following the reciprocal system and and writing and contributing for many many years and along with Dr Bruce Perrette he put up something that is called rs2 the reciprocal the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system so it it&#x27;s uh the reciprocal system with a few revisions and uh nehru was referring to the example of a quasar a quasar is something that actually uh but it&#x27;s in Larson&#x27;s system it is an exploding Galaxy and when that Galaxy explodes if the explosion is powerful enough that explosion goes the speed of light so it crosses that boundary it crosses that speed of light boundary from the material sector to the cosmic sector and so nehru looked at all of the different things that happen when you cross the boundary from one to the other because you&#x27;re you&#x27;re trading in coordinate space for coordinate time three dimensions of space for three dimensions of time and you&#x27;re trading in the progression of time for the progression of space uh and so that has some consequences that are seen real life uh in the Quasar and in some other um astronomical uh figures as well uh such as white dwarf stars and pulsars um that paper you may want to look at it&#x27;s an important paper I did that for the last four episodes now for today&#x27;s episode we&#x27;re looking at another of uh Dr nehru&#x27;s papers that is called Consciousness motion space and time and section one is called the imaginary versus the real when we study occult truths uh and compare with the concepts of modern science we should not lose sight of the fact that most of these concepts are actually assumptions that are not validated by facts black holes curved space-time the Big Bang gravitational radiation magnetic monopoles the cosmic strings only to mention a few are all hypothetical objects conjured up in certain theories a black hole for example implies infinite density and therefore cannot be physically real um uh just uh to go back a few minutes here I one thing that I didn&#x27;t mention is that uh with quasars uh Dewey Larson actually predicted the existence of quasars before they were discovered okay he predicted the existence of quasars a few years before they were discovered and he predicted um a list of about 14 of the characteristics that they would have when they were discovered so it&#x27;s not that Larson&#x27;s theories are just um you know uh hypothetical they are uh they are indeed hypothetical but they uh generally in especially in the case of the quasars they proved to be uh predictive and um they uh eventually discover that he was right about uh what he said about quasars okay now back to the black hole for example implies infinite density and therefore cannot be physically real it is referred to as a singularity in the theory something that the theorists recognize as a failure of the theory however instead of taking them as pointers to discard the theory in which they occur the modern theorist continues to subscribe to these Concepts they double down on fantasy emotional attachment rather than adherence to fact becomes the driving point the driving spirit especially when the leading figures in the field patronize these unreal Concepts we tend to imagine that these concepts are valid as another example example consider the general theory of relativity Einstein takes gravitational field as identical to acceleration field in the case of uniform Fields this does not give rise to any difficulty however in the case of non-uniform fields like those of the planets for example no amount of mathematical jugglery can create an acceleration field that is identical to the geometry of the gravitational field it is this geometrical difficulty that made Einstein adopt the idea that space is curved since he could not produce the required curved acceleration field from a euclidean frame of reference and could do so only from a non-euclidean frame Einstein assumed that space is curved it has never been independently verified whether space could be curved or how math engenders this curvature okay section two is called the general theory the fact that we do not have a general theory the fact is that we do not have a general Theory of physics a general theory is one that explains all physical phenomena from the atomic to the astronomical encompassing them in a single cogent structure and does not contain ad hoc assumptions the fact that we do not have a single Theory but only a collection of individual theories goes to show that the basic concepts of these individual theories are not right therefore attempts to understand the occult truths from the points of view of these Concepts which are only provisional working hypotheses cannot lead us to truth but only speculations unlimited the emergence of the first truly general theory namely the reciprocal system of theory created by Dewey B Larson should be of immense interest to all the Seekers of Truth the conclusions of the reciprocal system are factually verified in all the domains of physics and astronomy it must be noted that there cannot be more than one correct general theory um I have to think about that I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know that I agree with that but um it seems like all the general theories that I study they they&#x27;re all correct and they&#x27;re all they&#x27;re all saying the same thing but they&#x27;re using different language so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just a Nuance I think I agree with his statement in principle but in practice different people kind of use different languages to express the same thing a man imagine a single sentence of coded message creating a physical theory of limited applicability is like finding the key to the code If the message is short it is quite possible to come up with more than one unique key resulting in an alternative meanings to the code now the creation of a general theory is like finding the key to a very long sentence say an entire book in code the probability of the existence of an alternative key that makes the entire book still intelligible would be zero thus we can see that once we have a valid general theory then it would be the general theory now an example I would give for that is you know say you&#x27;re trying to deep find the key to a very long message in code well Dewey Larson finds the key to this message you know in code into this long met this whole book he comes up with the key and he&#x27;s got the English code for the for the book but somebody else could come along and decode it in a different language you know decoded in French and that would be a different code they&#x27;re saying the same thing but they&#x27;re speaking in different languages so I think both I think neru is probably right about what he&#x27;s saying but that you know he&#x27;s he&#x27;s kind of not looking at you know different languages that will say the same thing but in a different language you know if you speak in physics you might say one thing but if you speak in astronomy you might say another thing if you speak in Geometry you might say another thing and if you speak in linguistics you might say another thing still so um I I still think that uh it&#x27;s very useful to do comparative theories of everything you know uh many of the the people that I study they have theories of everything and I believe that they&#x27;re correct but they&#x27;re expressing the same thing in different languages you know if you can you can come up with a theory of everything about music but it&#x27;s not going to be in the same language as your theory of everything about physics but it will have the same fundamental you know bases and that&#x27;s I think that&#x27;s the beauty of comparative Theory of Everything Is that you you can make have great insights by by comparing the different things that they&#x27;re saying and that they and realize and recognize and figure out how they are saying the same thing but in different languages okay um we will stop it right there and uh tomorrow we will resume on this paper um Consciousness Mass uh matter space and time uh with section three that is called the new paradigm and uh thanks for tuning in today have a great day</p>
