            <p>can you tell me the difference between um AA wsap and AA tip yeah depends who you ask in what day of the week um I can tell you with my involvement when I came in the contract was under the opes of oap think of a big umbrella um there was a small effort a yeah a a wsap ASAP and then there was a effort and that included Skinwalker Ranch uh then there was a more focused nuanced effort that was focused primarily on Military incursions of UAP and that was my focus that was my interest in that and so some of the folks that were working oap were also part of atip uh some people will tell you that that atip was a nickname but it also became a very formal name and you can see that in the 2009 memo that Harry Reid wrote to the deputy secretary of defense Lynn where he talks about atip and p and atip means program Advanced Aerospace threat identification program um you can see in other uh documentation the Pentagon has as well that atip was a formalized program later on and in fact you had the under secretary of defense for intelligence himself testifying before the American people saying that they reviewed the atip files and the blue tip Blue Book files another another UFO program of a predecessor to to AAP and nap um so it&#x27;s you know really depends who you ask some folks will tell you that atip was actually part of oap or others will say no it wasn&#x27;t um you know I I personally I can give you my perspective but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s 100 people out there that will tell you what their perspective is um and you were the director of atip I was the senior ranking person I had my own staff that answered directly to me but it&#x27;s also important to note Glenn that there are other individuals that I worked with that we were colleagues we were co-workers and they worked in other organizations other agencies they didn&#x27;t necessarily report to me we worked together so I had my own staff at the under Secret of defense for intelligence I was the director of national program special management staff and in that capacity I ran atip as a director for that those people but then there were other individuals colleagues that I worked with as well that weren&#x27;t under me necessarily we worked we worked together</p>
