            <p>[Music] so what is atip what is awesome this is really interesting let&#x27;s get into it this is cosmic road where i discuss ufos and the paranormal before i get too far into it please hit like please subscribe share on social media and as i&#x27;m going through it please comment below and let me know what you think okay so i just did an interview with sean hazlett from through through a glass darkly and i&#x27;m gonna put part one of that interview probably on the channel tomorrow and uh he&#x27;s got a really good channel he should check him out um but he highly recommended that i read the book uh skinwalkers at the pentagon which is something that has been on my radar since it came out recently and so i picked it up and i started reading it and almost immediately i was hit by this description of all sap and atip and how one came from the other and what each one was because there have been multiple versions of that story that have come out over the years since the famous new york times article in 2017. even lou elizondo has had a couple of different versions of that story and there may be a reason for that and we&#x27;re about to get into it i&#x27;m just gonna read from the book uh george knapp and tom kelleher say much better than i can so let me just read first of all what was awesome awesome and i&#x27;m reading now was conceived as a program to evaluate the threat potential of uap uh bass was an organization specifically created to execute um to execute the asap contract to evaluate the threat potential of uaps throughout this book offset bass and allsap bass are used interchangeably to denote close operational similarity alsaf was not conceived to study projected advances in aerospace technology except in relation to uaps from the beginning asap was determined to cast as wide a net as possible to study all phenomena within the overall rubric of the uap topic and that&#x27;s why assad is so interesting uh that meant that if paranormal phenomena were known to co-co-locate with i i don&#x27;t i&#x27;ve never heard that word before to known to co-locate with and overlap temporarily with uaps and then paranormal phenomena would also be studied by allsap the philosophy of asap was to study all phenomena observed in relation to uaps and so they looked at paranormal stuff they looked at you know poltergeist stuff cryptids bigfoot you know portals all sorts of crazy stuff everything that was uh on skinwalker ranch they looked at and they weren&#x27;t just confined to skinwalker ranch since the publication of the december 2017 article in the new york times on glowing auras and black money the pentagon&#x27;s mysterious ufo program there has been a multi-year frenzy of speculation misinformation and confusion about the nature of the program asap was not atip this book is written by the two program managers dr james t lakatsky and calm kelleher who oversaw the day-to-day operations of the ossat bass program and it is an attempt to correct the record and present scientific data reinforcing the need to explore uaps and related phenomena george knapp who is arguably the premier journalistic authority in the world on this program contributed significantly to the book ossat bass was not atip the atip moniker arose from an unclassified nickname that was inserted into a letter that was sent from senator harry reid to the deputy secretary of defense requesting the creation of a special access program this letter is described fully in chapter 10. and you know i&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve talked about the letter before and it&#x27;s pretty pretty well known letter from harry reid uh because lakatsky the dia program manager wish to protect the offset name for security reasons atip was a made up substitute atip was a made-up substitute named for reed&#x27;s letter to describe the all saps so after allsap had shut down the atip designation was used to describe a completely separate small initiative that was underway at the pentagon to study uap&#x27;s encountered by military personnel so that&#x27;s really interesting to me so there&#x27;s you know two different a-tips if you like one is actually synonymous with awesome it was used as a nickname for osap because they couldn&#x27;t use the actual word awesome so atip is awesome or was awesome at one point when it you know initially kicked off when they started using that name but later on it became something else and so there are two a-tips in a sense so when lou elizondo has come out with different versions of what atip is he is right on both times but it&#x27;s a little confusing and he didn&#x27;t really make that very clear hence the book this book is to clarify all of this interesting stuff the new york times article i&#x27;m continuing to read uh created enormous confusion by mistakenly linking uh the 22 million dollar funding to the small informal atip initiative the 22 million dollars was specifically targeted only to us authap atip as used by the new york times was not asap and ossip was not atip the 22 million dollars was contracted through the defense intelligence agency into asap to evaluate the threat potential of uaps not a dollar of that sum went to atip despite widespread statements over the last several years okay there you have it straight from the horse&#x27;s mouth that is what atip is and what assat is or was awsapp was an umbrella program that studied all sorts of different phenomena associated with ufos and uavs it looked at all the funky stuff it was the true x-files uh you know the x-files if you&#x27;ve ever seen that show they had a range of different uh you know monsters of the week and phenomena of the week that mulder and scully investigated all sorts of cryptids and you know weird weird things right and so that was awesome although they were you know seem to be pretty much associated with skinwalker ranch and you know some other sites uh but you know a fascinating program and they actually had funding and uh so you know that was really the the real deal as far as that goes atep got a lot of the attention um as it should because of louis elizondo and everything that has come out but all staff was the more robust and funded program uh but atip came later and it was you know narrowly focused on encounters with military personnel and um so anyway so those are the definitions of all sap and atip i thought that was highly interesting and you know thank you sean he&#x27;s lit for recommending this book it&#x27;s been on my radar for a long time but i needed a push to get going on it and i&#x27;ll probably do multiple videos on the book as i go forward and discover new stuff that i think will be relevant to the channel so meanwhile you know go and grab yourself a copy because it&#x27;s going to be a fascinating read and like i said i&#x27;m going to have that interview with sean um that i&#x27;m going to post part one of probably tomorrow so uh stay
