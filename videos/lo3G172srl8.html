            <p>is that in nowhere shape or form is that the case that his name is not on this slide it has no indicators that elzando ran the program um but but before we get the cone of blue I did want to get to to so the famously do you know how David grush um was saying that he that he formally had never been in talks with arrow about any meetings or anything like that right yeah right well The Black Vault releases this this is um from David grush to the arrow staff and it says with due respect I will need answers to my questions before I&#x27;ll be comfortable meeting please provide responses so that we can hopefully move forward and schedule a meeting the law May Grant your office need to know but does not established policies and procedures with various data owners I&#x27;ve managed multi compartmented activities throughout my entire career and have multiple dsca security professional certifications I did not ask these questions for mere curiosity signed DG which I assume David grush now I I&#x27;m not gonna I&#x27;m not attacking Crush but this seems a little weird um why deny any now maybe in his head um I know um people like him uh uh when they say certain things uh they they mean it in a different way um where maybe he never BEC it sounds like he asked qu them questions they wouldn&#x27;t answer them they still wanted to meet with them but they wouldn&#x27;t answer the questions um or do what he would he was asking um so maybe he thought by them not doing that like they didn&#x27;t try to formally meet because they didn&#x27;t so so it could just be miscommunication um totally but I find it weird that he would say that or or not not because he&#x27;s been very open he&#x27;s been very very transparent and nothing but uh commendable in my in my book um but this contradicts what he said is is very disheartening honestly yeah it&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s curious I&#x27;m not sure what to make of that if you know he seems so trivial it does yeah and like you said he seems like someone who has been you know uh he&#x27;s had he&#x27;s been consistent in his message every time um certainly his resume is impeccable so you you know there must be a simple explanation for this what was Black Vault saying when uh you said it was Black Vault who released this right yeah he he just did his job he released it he but didn&#x27;t put context to it because there&#x27;s no context that you can put to it other than he didn&#x27;t have any context is that&#x27;s that&#x27;s I was asking but but he had been trying to formally because because maintained um and K Sean katrick M maintained The Narrative and the story that they reached out to David grush John was like okay well clear I&#x27;ll be able to fo of that so yeah he kept going you know he kept trying and eventually this came to him uh he he got this from that that that trial and tribulation and it confirms that did it was in talks with Crush to some degree now to what that means to David grush and to to what it means to meet versus Email exchange with a staffer um I mean it could be as simple as that right is it he him not just him not considering this formal right yeah it could could you know I usually like to try to give people the benefit of the doubt um until they&#x27;ve proven to me that you know I can&#x27;t trust them and certainly uh David grush has really tried um you know really hard I mean he&#x27;s been he&#x27;s done a very good job I think of showing that he is a trustworthy exemplary guy so maybe we can give him the benefit of the doubt on this until we get more information but if you ever get a chance to talk to him certainly this would be like very first question to pose you know what&#x27;s this about Dave yeah uh no no no absolutely uh so I&#x27;m trying to F figure out because I can download this and then if I open the file I can share it I can share it where in a in a different way where it&#x27;s like slides um yeah okay here it is oh no yeah yeah here we go here we go here we go because I made like a special thing for it um so okay so they&#x27;ve here is Arrow arrow release this um and this is a a set of of slides and it is I mean it&#x27;s 56 slides we&#x27;re not we&#x27;re not going through the whole thing just just just no way um but I I do want to go through some of the it it the the the the stuff that it talks about um because I mean this is a remote viewing program I mean it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it is exactly that um what it describes is uh the project description here says this project will investigate identify and analyze sensitive information Advanced Materials in Technologies to increase the basic knowledge of potential emerging and or disrupt scientific and Technical data this project addresses basic applied and advanced researching technology demonstrations in order to identify and anticipate threats to the US Homeland pretty sounds like a tip and AAP I mean it it um usually these kind of National Security heavy emphasis programs get accepted so um so far I&#x27;m not seeing anything that stands out or would uh um uh get them denied a unified approach will be used for data collection and Analysis advanced technology acquisition appli technology Theory demonstration ah I figured it out guys I know why it got denied it says right in it Consciousness studies and we don&#x27;t take that seriously in the scientific community so that&#x27;s why it got denied is uh it has something to do with uh uh um most likely ious uh because for some reason the government um uh in up front doesn&#x27;t take it seriously uh why is that we don&#x27;t know um but everything up into see how they listed last Consciousness studies they were trying to sneak that in there uh because that always um like physicists won&#x27;t even utter those words Consciousness studies uh because that would that would mean it makes it real and for some reason um they won&#x27;t touch the Consciousness subject uh no nobody will aside from people like us in our community um yeah you know there&#x27;s one because I&#x27;ve been interested in Consciousness studies also so I&#x27;ve I follow that and there is a PhD in the psy the psychology department at the University of Arizona and boy I cannot remember his name right now uh he is pretty much on The Cutting Edge of Consciousness studies right now um a simple Google search would review uh would reveal it but um but he is he&#x27;s done a lot of um Research into tubules and micro micro tubules in the brain and is uh that&#x27; be a whole show in itself but there are some real docs who are doing he&#x27;s also so he is a PHD psychologist and he&#x27;s an anesthesiologist and which seems like a great pairing you know to uh be study in Consciousness Dr Hammer Hammer Hoff that&#x27;s who it is it&#x27;s Dr Hammer Hoff at the University of Arizona and he is on The Cutting Edge Of Consciousness studies right now and I highly recommend anybody interested in Consciousness studies to look up his work it&#x27;s uh Stuart Hammer off really really he&#x27;s written some books um uh so Consciousness Consciousness is it&#x27;s a hot to you know it is well another thing and and if you look down at the bottom here guys um where it says at the bottom here uh total funding is in millions so um in FIS year 2012 they would have received an initial 12 million the next year the budget would have doubled to a little bit over double uh at and it would have went to 25 million um by the third year the budget would increase to 35 to 50 million and then it was set up uh to be a uh seven-year proposed plan and the last four years uh to be decided uh or determined so they were thinking that this is going to be a 50 at least um uh let&#x27;s say 50 75 uh 80 87 a minimum the first three years $87 million um to study this con to study Consciousness um and this is right around the time that assap and arrow uh uh not Arrow assap uh comes into the uh to the play and $22 million gets uh pushed over there so uh do you think that they either so do you think that that there&#x27;s a possibility that this project did move forward but it moved forward under a different name and they just couldn&#x27;t justify the money or it moved forward and you know that&#x27;s completely um top secret or above and we would never have access to that like I&#x27;m surprised this has even come out because um so it sounds like this was The Proposal right and so this is what they call a a p saap so proposed unacknowledged special access program special Access program yeah so I would think that this that this kind of research is definitely going on maybe this not specific proposal maybe like you said the budget was too much or maybe maybe it wasn&#x27;t enough um I mean I we have no idea how much they they put into these special access programs and if you watch um James gordano on YouTube he does uh great presentation and it was at the Naval Academy um and the it&#x27;s a DARPA Pro he was from DARPA and he was talking about how the brain is the battlescape of the 21st century and so this entire presentation that he goes through uh and it&#x27;s on YouTube you know he talks about all of the technology that we have um all the ways that we have to interfere with manipulate and disrupt Consciousness and he really painted Wars of the future as not being with tanks and you know guns and not with you know kinetic energy weapons but with EMP with uh weapons that interfere with with Consciousness and then and we&#x27;ve heard about that we&#x27;ve heard about some of that in the news with Havana syndrome and we still don&#x27;t have a good explanation for that other than it was the Russians in uh you know on United States soil doing this to US citizens which you know if that was truly not even not even us not even citizens but it started with us politicians in Havana Cuba that&#x27;s where it got the Havana syndrome name yeah actually started before that but that&#x27;s just that&#x27;s just um what imagine targeting politicians and military personnel I mean that&#x27;s of War yeah it yeah so it started with targeting diplomats us diplomats and yeah that is most certainly an act of war and we still don&#x27;t have a good explanation for that but I just think that that is a good example of how the brain really is uh the battlescape of the 21st century you know we don&#x27;t need kinetic weapons if we can do something you know uh that interferes with somebody&#x27;s perception or their behavior or if we can manipulate their perceptions or somehow manipulate their behaviors or their thoughts or their beliefs um we don&#x27;t need to fire a single shot and so I really highly recommend the James Giordano DARPA lecture on YouTube just to get an idea of you know what we&#x27;re going into in the future because you know the tin foil hat conspiracy stuff you know tin foil sounded pretty good after I watched his lecture you know although I think get Le whoever goes into the lead hat business they might they might have a real good</p>
