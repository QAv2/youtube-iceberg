            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I do educational videos and um we are on a unit where we&#x27;re recovering the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and uh that is a theory of everything that Larson drive back in the 20th century up until his death in 1990 uh right now we&#x27;re looking at his final book that came out in 1995. but prior to that his final book is called beyond space and time came out after he died and um that is his uh attempt at going into metaphysics religion philosophy um psychology and stuff like that whereas his earlier books were all on hard Sciences science uh chemistry physics astronomy and the like and um those books started out uh from his fundamental postulates that he uh that he induced uh back in about the 1950s the main one of his postulates is that the universe is not made out of matter the universe is not made out of energy the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between time and space time and space are reciprocals of each other hence the reciprocal system of theory and time and space have the same qualities as reciprocals such as the same way that two-thirds and three halves have the same qualities but they&#x27;re just inverted and so um the qualities that space has time also has which is three-dimensionality and the time the qualities that time has space also has which is primarily um progressing or the flow it&#x27;s always getting later and later in space it&#x27;s always getting further and further apart and um both time and square space are also quantized there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light and the speed of light is not the maximum speed of the universe as Einstein would have you believe but in Larson&#x27;s system the speed of light is the midpoint or the neutral point or the null point of the universe that&#x27;s where everything starts from the origin um and that uh means that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls that sector two or the cosmic sector the normal sector that we&#x27;re familiar with he calls sector one or the material sector moving slower than the speed of light and that half of the universe uh uh Aggregates altogether the atoms and molecules of the material Universe until it gets to its most complex level which is DNA which has a few billion atoms per molecule at that level uh it has reached enough complexity for uh sector two to come and take over sector two comes and uh combines with the sector one unit and controls it takes control over it the same way that a thermostat would take control of a room and that is what Larson calls the life unit the life unit is a combination of material and Cosmic forces Cosmic entities and then that life unit evolves it develops over time up until its most complex level um you know all the way from the single-celled organism all the way to the intelligent human being which is the most complex and at that point the complex uh life unit becomes eligible to be controlled by a sector 3 entity sector 3 is the region that is beyond space and time or outside of space and time or independent of space and time or like I was talking about the origin the origin and um other people would have called that God or the gods or the spiritual World Larson calls it sector three sector three is geared toward ethical Behavior or good behavior um while sector two the life unit the control life control is geared towards survival and so there are some times where that survival and the uh ethics where they go together but then there are some times where they are in conflict in which case the human being needs to exercise free will to decide between the two now we&#x27;re in his final book on beyond space and time on metaphysics and this so this is all about sector three and sector three phenomenon he went through several chapters where he was talking about communication from sector three sector three communicates to us variously through um ESP and intuition Visions uh through uh religious Revelation scientific insight and uh we those and all of those messages are correct but we have to be properly prepared to decode the messages and put them into our understanding and that is less uh you know worked out uh we as he says I believe in this uh chapter here the human beings are really kind of like single-celled organisms of ethics okay our ability to uh to operate ethically is very very limited uh because we are really just starting to learn that and so our ability to decode these ethical uh lessons are constrained now he&#x27;s a we&#x27;re in chapter 21 it&#x27;s called the personal uh what is it the personal aspect of Ethics I think is what it&#x27;s called and um he just got done with the discussion on how uh it&#x27;s a misnomer most of the you know most of the religious beliefs out there uh would have you think that you&#x27;ve got a sacrifice and that it&#x27;s acting ethically is a sacrifice you have to give up pleasures and so on um but uh I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m trying to find my spot here again um but Larson Larson counters that and he really says that no an ethical person wants to act ethically it&#x27;s not something that they have to sacrifice that they have to do against their will they they want to behave ethically if they are sufficiently under the influence of sector three and so um you know there&#x27;s no no kind of this asceticism and then also um you know he&#x27;s saying that there are many self-interested behaviors that are also moral because they set the stage for uh sector three activities so he talks about you know uh being able to be comfortable and be not stressed out by money and those kind of things that those are uh in a certain sense prerequisites uh for acting uh ethically okay so we&#x27;re going to take over here uh in the middle of the chapter uh those religions talking about uh you know those that are uh you know talking about the asceticism and so on have another worldly Outlook generally tend to um regard the pursuit of pleasure political or economic power or other non-religious objectives as antithetical to religious beliefs and are all all are open in some degree to the criticism expressed in the foregoing quotation an excessive concentration on secular objectives to the exclusion of religious considerations would of course be incompatible with a religious life but ethical decisions made are made and ethical actions are taken in actual practice participation in the activities of the secular world is therefore essential in order to gain experience in the application of ethical principles if it is possible at all uh development of a well-rounded ethical personality without such experience is obviously very difficult this is a general rule that applies throughout human life one may learn the rudiments of any skill through instruction but proficiency comes only from experience the status of experience is a prerequisite for achieving the objective of human existence also leads to the conclusion that withdrawal from worldly activities a practice looked upon with favor in Many religious systems is not an effective way of attaining the objective as mentioned in the discussion of the Revelation process intense concentration upon the particular matter under consideration to the virtual exclusion of everything else appears to be helpful in setting the stage for the flash of insight that is required but whatever the nature of the subject matter may be religious scientific or other a certain level of knowledge and experience is necessary before an individual individual can make the intuitive jump to a significant conclusion and experience cannot be gained in isolation in many respects life on Earth is analogous to a game a player can improve his performance to some extent by studying the principles of the game and by doing some thinking as to how best to apply these principles but proficiency comes only as a result of practice and participation in the game Buddha Muhammad and other religious leaders who withdrew into Solitude to perfect their understanding were not Hermits they were men of the world who had accumulated a rich fun Rich fund of secular experience before they undertook a life of solitary contemplation the game analogy can appropriately be applied to human life in many ways in our view of the place of religion in life for instance religion is one of the most important sources of advice as to how to play the game of Life anyone who undertakes to play a game receives a great deal of advice much of it conflicting as to the manner of play the value of this advice to the player does not depend upon the authority attributed to the source from which it is derived or upon the degree of acceptance with which it is received that value is determined entirely by the amount of gain or loss in performance that is accomplished by actual application of the risk of the recommended procedures the same is true in The Game of Life strict Conformity with the rules and regulations of one&#x27;s religion is of no avail unless those rules and regulations do in fact Express the requirements of the true moral code it is extremely unfortunate from the standpoint of society as a whole that the agency of the social order that has the primary responsibility for encouraging Conformity with the moral code should be so much inclined to portray that compliance as a burdensome task but as individuals we have the remedy in our own hands we can and should refuse to accept this Distortion of the truth each person has the responsibility of examining the moral doctrines of his religion and determining for himself whether they are valid expressions of the sector 3 code those that cannot stand up under the application of Reason should be rejected regardless of the source from which they emanate it should also be noted that we cannot win the game of life or any other game on the strength of good intentions of course we must have an intention to win but this is not in itself sufficient there must be actual accomplishment those religions that offer some kind of a shortcut whereby the full status of ethical man can be attained by Fiat are in direct conflict with the conclusion that the purpose of human existence is the development of ethical men if that objective could be attained by decree there would be no need for the huge and complicated mechanism that constitutes the physical universe like other games The Game of Life involves an element of chance this is particularly evident in the economic and other non-moral areas but chance may also play a significant role role in determining the extent to which the ethical personality is developed during an individual&#x27;s lifetime the handicaps that are imposed on ethical progress where living conditions are unfavorable have already been mentioned chance events May also result in termination of life before a person has had adequate time to make significant ethical progress these are some of the considerations that have led to the conclusion that an alternate route to the ultimate goal of human existence is required and have inspired the conception of the shortcuts that are now being offered by many religions our rejection of these religious answers to the problems that are involved raises questions asked questions of equity and Justice that should have some attention we will review them uh later on even if chance does not intervene to prevent victory in a game one may still not achieve the amount of success to which he would be entitled on the basis of his skill if the game is under the control of an Umpire a referee or other official the player may be the victim of a wrong decision or if the game is one involving team play some member of one&#x27;s own team may not respond to his moves in the proper manner nor will the captain or manager of the team always give each player full opportunity to display his talents so it is in the game of life we are always subject to the vagaries of chance and we are continually encountering obstacles placed in our way intentionally or unintentionally by the human individuals with whom we deal like those who are successful in playing other games what we need to do is to learn to take these things in stride play the game to the best of our ability and to enjoy the game while we are playing it in order to put life into proper perspective it is necessary to recognize that human existence is an ongoing process one that is directed toward ethical perfection and perhaps some other goals as well we are therefore imperfect by definition aspirants rather than Masters and although our task is to overcome our imperfections there is no sound reason why our inability to accomplish this task quickly and completely should lead us into anxiety guilt and despair that are emphasized by the existentialist philosophers and are Incorporated in a modified form into So Many religious doctrines we have a legacy from our animal Origins that has to be overcome before we can reach our ultimate goal but the fact that this objective has not yet been reached does not justify our acceptance of the sense of guilt that so many are trying to force upon us nor is it catastrophic if we stumble occasionally as we advance toward the goal we are fulfilling our purpose as long as we continue making substantial progress in the right direction the general situation with respect to the personal aspect of morality can be clarified to a considerable degree by consideration of what we may call Caruso ethics as in Robinson Crusoe in the early days of the development of economic theory it was quite common to approach economic questions from the standpoint of how the various principles involved would apply to a loan individual on an isolated island these Robinson Crusoe economics are now out of style so to speak but they served a very valuable purpose and a somewhat similar approach to the morality of the lone individual can be equally productive on the basis of the principles that we have established it is evident that Crusoe has a moral obligation to keep himself alive and in good mental and physical condition he has no primary obligation to work if work is necessary to meet the primary obligations just mentioned as it normally would be then work is a requirement but this is only a conditional obligation if the island has a warm climb climate and plenty of coconut trees the primary obligations may be satisfied with little or no actual productive effort if Caruso does work either by choice or from necessity there is no requirement that he&#x27;d limit his work to the minimum amount that is actually essential an excessive amount of work that would be physically detrimental is barred by the moral code but in between the minimum that is required and the maximum that is allowed there&#x27;s a very substantial margin in which he may make economic decisions he can choose between Leisure and the products of effort and to the extent that he elects to work he can choose between one type of product and another he can make choices as to methods and procedures the extent to which he diverts time and effort from direct production to the making of tools for example he can decide how much use he wants to make of the possibility of storing goods for future consumption and so on in this economic activity Crusoe is living in accordance with the principle of Hedonism he is taking those actions which he believes will bring him the greatest amount of satisfaction but this Hedonism as he practices it is not a principle of morality it has no moral significance at all as soon as any moral element enters into the situation the moral aspect is controlling and satisfaction or pleasure is irrelevant for instance any intentional action that inflicts physical injury on himself is a violation of the moral code and if Crusoe is acting as an ethical man he will avoid such an action no matter how much pleasure he might have derived from it Prudence has always been regarded by philosophers as an important moral virtue even to the extent that it has been classified by some uh epicurus and Bentham for example as the primary virtue but it is evident that to cruso Prudence is no more than a conditional obligation inasmuch as imprudent conduct normally does no more than lessen his pleasure and his comforts only in the exceptional case does it involve consequences that make it a violation of the moral code like pleasure Prudence is primarily a matter of economics in crusoe&#x27;s life rather than a matter of ethics okay I think we&#x27;ll stop there at the end of this paragraph um we will probably possibly wrap up this chapter tomorrow but in the meantime have a great day come back tomorrow and hear what Caruso does and we&#x27;ll see you later thanks for tuning in</p>
