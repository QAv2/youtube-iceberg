            <p>imagine a flying platform that operates without an engine capable of ascending into the air and moving at incredible speeds such device was created by the Soviet scientist Victor grebennikov grebennikov studying the wings of insects discovered their amazing properties the micr structure of kiten could create an anti-gravity effect allowing him to develop a platform capable of levitating his invention was highlighted in many newspapers and scientific magazines within the USSR this platform shows a remarkable connection between his EPS energy pulse system which formed the basis of his gravito plane and the studies of the Kazmir effect the Kazmir effect involves the mutual attraction of two conductive bodies at a small distance due to Quantum fluctuations of the physical vacuum this effect was predicted by Dutch physicist hendrik Casmir in 1948 and was experimentally confirmed in 1957</p>
