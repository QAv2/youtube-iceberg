            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>today august 21st ross coulthart&#x27;s new documentary dropped titled out of this world and in it dr gary nolan world-renowned immunologist of stanford university stated definitively that people who know about uap crashes the programs surrounding them are about to go public and that there is a ufo cover-up the house is falling baby so i was able to see a small clip from the seven news documentary and i have transcribed it and i&#x27;m going to share that with you later i will watch the totality of the documentary and maybe i&#x27;ll do another analysis of it but this is off the fly because this is breaking news and i think it&#x27;s really important to get this out there asap so the way i&#x27;m going to read this transcript is where it is in parentheses it&#x27;s ross colt heart speaking and where it is not it&#x27;s gary nolan but i&#x27;ll say their names before each sentence anyways ross colthardt states when you say the government&#x27;s been involved in a cover-up do you think they think they&#x27;ve been concealing gary responds oh yes ross colthardt responds it&#x27;s an amazing allegation gary responds i know it for a fact ross coltar responds why do you know that gary responds because i&#x27;ve spoken to the people people who are about to come out and whistle blow on it ross responds wow so you know what&#x27;s coming gary yeah ross so there has been a cover-up gary yeah and there has been an active cover-up i mean just look at what the department of defense announced last week they announced an office to study the phenomenon money put aside they said we&#x27;re going back to 1947 rus which is incredible that&#x27;s the date of roswell gary yeah 1947. we want a list of every operation that you&#x27;ve done to disinform and misinform for those that instinctively respond to that with well big deal who cares what gary nolan says well then maybe you don&#x27;t have a proper comprehension of the likes of gary nolan he is a world renowned immunologist nobel prize nominee there is a lab named after him at stanford now i am not suggesting that that substantiates what he&#x27;s saying what i am suggesting is that he is a reliable source and that is extraordinary because he&#x27;s making an extraordinary claim as always let&#x27;s see where the chips fall so i&#x27;m going to read some excerpts from the article that came out today spotlighting the documentary which i have not yet seen but i&#x27;m going to watch from sevennews.com dot a u ufo spotters have been dismissed as loonies but has the u.s government been hiding the truth there&#x27;s been an active cover up the light has finally been shown by ross colthardt all right so i&#x27;m going to share that um excerpt with you congress has already passed laws demanding cooperation by all u.s intelligence and defense agencies to allow former or serving government and private contractor employees to blow the whistle on uap secrets ensuring there are protections against them losing their job for revealing what they know in breach of non-disclosure agreements or security oaths as professor gary nolan observes the congress is even demanding lists of all non-disclosure laws associated with ufo uap secret programs why is that interesting he says he continues it&#x27;s not the ndas themselves it&#x27;s the people who signed the ndas because that then is the paper trail to the individuals and the programs in which they&#x27;re associated and then at the end of the article it&#x27;s written if professor gary nolan is right and whistleblowers are indeed about to come forward with dramatic evidence of a u.s government cover-up then things are about to get very interesting in washington dc you&#x27;re damn right i&#x27;m going to do another dramatic walk into the frame well as i always say let&#x27;s see where the chips fall but personally i wouldn&#x27;t vote i vote personally i wouldn&#x27;t bet against gary nolan just wouldn&#x27;t do it the man is sharp as attack anyways let&#x27;s say there have been crash retrieval uh a program that that is involved with craft retrievals because there has been talk that if there is a program involved crash retrievals that&#x27;s not all they do and let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s housed in an aerospace company um what they call a special access program and there&#x27;s other iterations of that i guess it&#x27;s very complicated and and let&#x27;s say this is all going to come to a four right we&#x27;re going to learn that that that uap have crashed of of unknown origin and and that the stories we&#x27;ve heard are true and it&#x27;s not just intact craft that have that have crashed and been recovered but biological specimens or creatures if you will have as well let&#x27;s say that all comes to a four let&#x27;s say that all manifests in our world even though many people think such a proposition is impossible i mean obviously that that would be profoundly fascinating this will be the biggest scandal i would imagine in american government history other governments are going to start talking about what they know about uap because i imagine this manifestation would cause a an influence a ripple effect for other countries to start opening the books if you will if this has any truth to it we are essentially living through a a pretty interesting netflix series except it&#x27;s real and then there&#x27;s a moral issue that is grounded in this process in my opinion because tens of thousands hundreds of thousands maybe even millions of people all over the globe have claimed that they have had frankly unsolicited contact of non-human intelligences now what happens if we can verify there are crash retrieval programs and craft have been recovered as well as bodies that means that all those people that have come forward and said they&#x27;ve had unsolicited contact now the probability that some of them have been truthful skyrockets the world gets turned upside down in one fell swoop that&#x27;s what i signed up for i don&#x27;t know about you now look if these whistleblowers come forward it&#x27;s going to be huge it&#x27;s not necessarily going to seal the deal immediately but it will make it much more likely that such propositions are true that there is a crash retrieval program and that craft have been recovered and that we are not alone and that we are being engaged by non-human intelligence but it will only be the beginning only be the beginning maybe this whole thing truly is unraveling we are 1700 days post december 16 2017 new york times article which um elizondo was quoted in which we learned about atip we learned that the united states government was studying uap in secret yeah yeah this this is looking interesting this is looking interesting our assumptions about what&#x27;s possible about what governments could do or are willing to do about what they could get away with about how information about our universe could be insulated from all 8 billion of us those assumptions may get flushed down the toilet and maybe we as a civilization will be less hubris wouldn&#x27;t that be something wouldn&#x27;t that be something and maybe and maybe if we do get these disclosures we&#x27;ll learn to better cooperate with one another realizing that we are not on the we we are not at the top of the food chain no we aren&#x27;t far from it look i&#x27;m not a prophet i&#x27;m famous for saying i could be wrong about everything but i think we are not alone and that we&#x27;re being engaged by non-human intelligence and according to gary nolan whistleblowers be a common be a coming yeah so get your snacks ready and get your head straight and maybe maybe we&#x27;ll learn some interesting things in the coming days weeks months and year or two ahead please oh before i say that i am going to watch the documentary and i may do another analysis i just wanted to get this out there because this is huge news by any objective standard gary nolan is a heavyweight a genius intellectual he&#x27;s sold businesses that are on the nasdaq as far as i understand the guy is a immunologist extraordinaire stanford university he&#x27;s not a fool he is not will gonna say stuff that&#x27;s gonna just wipe his reputation away the man knows people the man is a critical thinker and i would not bet against him now
