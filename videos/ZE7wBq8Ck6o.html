            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>t-minus 10 nine regions up and burning two one zero and liftoff you&#x27;re listening to the twisted ten bringing you original and unique hosts created top ten links recorded live in world-famous Cocoa Beach Florida with hosts tak Van Sickle and Adam posted all right welcome to the twisted ten my name is Adam I&#x27;m one of your hosts oh I&#x27;m tak I&#x27;m Lee I&#x27;m one of the other ones and joining us in studio again is Andrea hi there guys hi how are you we got your questions we&#x27;ve got a tough week to compete against Joe Pardo&#x27;s podcast that we did last week when he hosted did the top 10 Disney sexual references is gonna be a tough one to beat that that had a lot of downloads already yeah he&#x27;s all right tack we talked about this a little bit I don&#x27;t remember if so this week is my week no guest host this week what my top ten list is for this week is I was kind of seeded I think in a living pod carry asleep at those show what&#x27;s HAP that&#x27;s the other podcast that we host dodo oh yeah that&#x27;s right it sounds like a really good show it does it&#x27;s a little bit more rough and rather than this show what&#x27;s it about you know sex relationships men&#x27;s perspectives you know that kind of stuff oh that sounds neat I&#x27;ll go check it out today plug I like it so we we kind of briefly mentioned something and that&#x27;s one of my top 10 tonight is this one particular item that you talked about I think it was you that talked about this it might have been somebody else who knows che but this week is the top 10 yeah suppressed okay inventions meaning inventions that these inventors came up with yeah either patented or just did the blueprints and everything ever made the prototypes for then either big companies or government or somebody came in and Chi bashed that invention oh we talked about the water car that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s right that is one of them yeah yeah in fact let me just go right to the water car since that&#x27;s our first one okay I think shadowing oh well yeah no I didn&#x27;t actually have the water car I have something that similar to water car okay it&#x27;s same but not the same all right let&#x27;s just get right into this all right so number 10 I think you&#x27;re gonna like number 10 right off the bat you too okay it&#x27;s biofuel but it&#x27;s made out of hemp mmm hemp biofuel so the article goes and this is from many different sources as always I looked up the you know top 20 top 30 top 40 that I could find online and there was a lot of these types of inventions and I just hand-picked the ones that I like the best so these are not all together from any one source they&#x27;re from all over so hip biofuel the father of our country George Washington who is rumored to have said I cannot tell a lie was a proud supporter of hemp of the hemp seed of course the only thing more surprising in this country that an honest politician is hemp which is often mistaken for marijuana and therefore unfairly maligned so a lot of people think that hemp oil or hemp the product hemp has something to do with marijuana right I always thought that I don&#x27;t really know what the difference is you would have to smoke a hemp joint the size of a telephone pole to even get a slight buzz all right have you tried now him can be used in the funny thing about this and I get more into this article in a second but hemp hemp can be used to make anything from paper to essential oils to fuel to shampoo soap clothing yeah anything I mean or anything at all the number one outlaw of hemp in the past has been the paper industry the lumber and paper industries because the product when you cut up him or chop it down to do it if the hell you&#x27;re supposed to do when you harvest it you can actually make paper products at a fraction of the cost you can with lumber so the lobbyists that originally attached marijuana to hemp back in the 30s or 20s whenever it was was the big lobbyists for the paper in the lumber and mill industry so ya see quite quite interesting that is interesting so the article goes on governmental roadblocks meanwhile prevent him from becoming the leader in extracting ethanol allowing environmental damaging sources like corn to take over the ethanol industry despite the fact that requires fewer chemicals less water and less processing to do the same job hemp has never caught on experts also lay the blame on the feet of who else presidential candidates who kiss up to the Iowa Corn Growers for votes so then all about politics the hemp growers though I guess there&#x27;s down as many they&#x27;re too busy you know tie dyeing shirts and and make an ice cream Ben and Jerry alright number nine number nine number nine is the original electric car the original yeah when do you guys think the original elect electric car was produced 1483 um I&#x27;m gonna have to say no on that one I&#x27;m gonna say nineteen yes I&#x27;ll give you a hint GM produced it and its name was the ev1 1978 you guys are not even a good 1880 no the original one was actually produced in 1999 that was my next guess it was relatively recent perhaps the most notorious suppressed invention is the General Motors eveyone subject of the 2006 documentary who killed the electric car ironically now that it&#x27;s 2016 electric cars are starting to come back but they were originally introduced back then Tesla the ev1 was the world&#x27;s first mass-produced electric car with 800 of them up for lease from GM in the late 90s GM ended the ev1 line in 99 so it was actually mid 90s to late 90s stating the consumers were happy with a limited driving range of the cars batteries may get it unprofitable for GM&#x27;s continued production many skeptics however believe GM killed the ev1 under pressure from oil companies who stand to lose the most if high efficiency vehicles conquer the market so yes they got squashed rumors suggest huh interesting Andrea wants a Prius mm-hmm it&#x27;s fun to say Prius is fun small so it&#x27;s more fun to say Tesla or Corvette or limousine Bugatti we got is really fun to say Bugatti is fun to say whoo God he made an all-electric could I get it sure yeah I&#x27;ll get you one it&#x27;s only four hundred thousand it&#x27;s cool no I&#x27;m sure the electric version would be a little bit more alright so tying into the car a little bit all right this isn&#x27;t your water car but tying into the car a little bit is a carburetor a very simple product in a car tact you know what a carburetor physically does for an engine for an engine it makes it let&#x27;s say Erin pretty much yeah yeah so there was a gentleman by the name of Tom ogle who developed a new type of carburetor that pressurized gasoline into vapor and injected it in the fire Pistons socotra firing chamber is kind of similar to how a fuel injector will work now Oh far more efficient and this was back in 1981 mind you after installing it in his Ford Galaxie the car was measured to get a hundred and thirteen miles per gallon I think I heard about this guy I think he turned up missing too ironically after some licensing setbacks ogle died in 1981 and took the design of his carburetor with him to the grave now the theory there is or that the conspiracy there is is he didn&#x27;t I have necessarily natural causes right there are ways to induce brain aneurysms so yes hmm he was perfectly healthy and then he&#x27;s dead 131 miles to the gallon 113 miles to get to the gallon this is in 1981 with a Ford Galaxie yes 35 years ago hmm yeah that&#x27;s before like emissions wouldn&#x27;t it like State emissions when I was 16 I got like five miles to the gallon I drove my first car was a Mercury Grand Marquis LS station wagon it had the brown panels on the side like the fake the faux wood panels oh great nineteen eighty-four Bonneville miss Becker an engines could run dirty he&#x27;s hot I can hit anyone in the park and I wouldn&#x27;t put scratch in my big ol boat huge every sixteen year old head I think didn&#x27;t turn and floated in it I don&#x27;t know I never tried it I was in the middle of the Oklahoma there&#x27;s no water my older stepsisters have their their first car from lane to Lane and floating won&#x27;t whomp Wow alright number seven alright number seven is free energy let&#x27;s see tack if you can get actually Andrea you might get this to who do you think is the inventor of free energy that would be the Lord Jesus no Nikola Tesla oh yeah was an undisputed genius there&#x27;s no question in 1899 he figured out a way to bypass fossil fuel burning power plants and power lines proving that quote free energy could be harnessed using ionization in the upper atmosphere to produce electrical vibrations JP Morgan who had been funding Tesla&#x27;s research had a bit of buyer&#x27;s remorse when he realized that the free energy for all wasn&#x27;t as profitable as actually charging people for every watt of energy use now Tesla and another famous inventor of the time were going head to head for their DC and AC type currents remember who that was did a little light bulb pop on in your head - Thomas Edison yes Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison were direct competitors of each other while they did share you know studies and you know some privileges of this of the trade they were competitors and also definitely fun fact about Nikola Tesla is that they believed he had Asperger&#x27;s as well yep as well as you know who else most likely had Asperger&#x27;s as well he was actually a family two boys and a girl huge inventor two boys and a girl major discovery family I don&#x27;t know the Wright brothers really and they had a sister - huh because none of them like had any relationships in ever had zero interest in being in a relationship zero interest in getting married they just never did all they cared about was like their work and that was it interesting yep so JP Morgan then drove another nail into free energies coffin by chasing away other investors insuring Tesla&#x27;s dream would die the ability to distribute power wirelessly on a global scale that was his his dream Tesla had dazzled crowds with demonstrations of short-range wireless power through the air using coils and to charge light bulbs as far as 100 feet away there&#x27;s pictures of him doing it you ever seen a Tesla coil in action you know what Tesla coil is it&#x27;s one of those themes with a big ball on top and it&#x27;s a mad scientist&#x27;s labs yeah well no no that&#x27;s that arcing thing is not a coil oh yeah yeah what is that god I care him the name of that right now the Tesla coils the ball electricity it&#x27;s actually charging the air is what it&#x27;s doing but the maverick inventor claimed that he had a significant upgrade on the technique that allowed for electricity to be transmitted through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere using high altitude receiving stations he began constructing his prototype in 1901 but funding fell through and it was never completed some scientists have tried picking up those projects again but it same props exact same problem now big companies want to make money off of it so there&#x27;s a little bit of a problem mmm all right number 6 numbers number 6 really number 6 yeah all right have you ever heard of a rife beam before negative so this is a cancer curing microscopic excuse me this is a cancer curing microscope aka a rife beam where a RRIF beam I think it&#x27;s rife yeah said that right after successfully curing a number of cancer patients the rockefeller owned American Medical Association later had this work laid to rest by closing down Reich&#x27;s set ups and seizing his equipment essentially rife refused to hand over the rights of his work to the AMA because he saw moneyed interests as hidden ulterior motives that the cancer machine would not be allowed to to the world at large because the AMA and medical pharmaceutical establishments didn&#x27;t want the patients cured if you cure the patient&#x27;s you lost return business in the cancer industry right that&#x27;s been the one of the biggest conspiracies now still today is that they could potentially have cures for different types of cancer but have them locked away because those companies can&#x27;t make money if you cure your patients right after years of ensuing court cases with big boys of the cancer establishment having had a little money exiled to Mexico to avoid imprisonment in USA rife died of alcoholism hmm broke and battered bad or was he fried too yeah well deep fried battered beer-battered yeah all right so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s ten through five the the little bit of a water car mmm thing is coming up on in the next one okay so all right we&#x27;re gonna take a break and we will be right back hey this is Adam this week&#x27;s twisted ten is brought to you by Edie just takun myself we don&#x27;t have a sponsor for this week&#x27;s show so TAC and I have been talking a lot about having sponsorships in our podcast weighing the pros and the cons you know we&#x27;re a big fan of having more content than advertising so as opposed to listening to a radio show where 40% of your time that you&#x27;re listening to the show is built around sponsorships Tech and I think that the content delivery is far more important while the delivery of content of a podcast is paramount to the success of the show sometimes you got to have sponsors to help cover some of the bills while we do have two sponsors currently for both of our shows that&#x27;s the twisted ten which is this show and living pod Carius Lee which is another show the TAC and I produced a little bit more raw and rough we do have some opportunities that are coming up for other sponsors if you are interested in becoming a sponsor of the twist of ten or living pod Kerry asleep shoot us an email at show at living vodka really calm and we&#x27;ll get back with you with the contract details welcome back to the twisted ten this week&#x27;s twisted ten is the twisted ten suppress inventions just a recap number ten is hemp biofuel number nine is the electric car say number eight is the carburetor hmm number seven is Nikola Tesla&#x27;s free energy for a child rule number six is the cancer curing microscope aka the rife beam hmm all right so let&#x27;s get on with the rest of this list number 5 number 5 say is system the unified theory cure for heart disease suppose they don&#x27;t smoke this guy sounds like a scientist by the way his first named Linus so Linus Pauling had worked with moths Matthias Rath and they came up with a unified approach to curing heart disease essentially they found that the heart diseases result of a long-term vitamin C deficiency the solution is to treat patients with frequent high doses up to 6 grams a day of vitamin C while using amino acids lysine and proline to remove the oh boy here&#x27;s a big one sad forest girl or osek plaque lining close enough lining the inner walls of the blood vessels that cause narrowing of blocked narrowing or blocking of the lumen or the space of the blood vessels okay that&#x27;s all boring however due to greater interest in corporate profitability in perceived financial threat this highly successful cheap alternative therapy has not been allowed that much attention so Big Pharma Big Pharma came in and said oh hell no vitamin C and some of these amino acid cocktail and like a plan six grams a day though direct injections not like pills not the vitamin C pills or I can&#x27;t drink watch your okay now cuz you from a cocktail if it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like a cocktail of vitamins to take if you take it through your digestive tract it&#x27;ll process most of it out so your body wouldn&#x27;t absorb that much and direct the injection of these amino acids and this high dosages of vitamin C is what it took six frames a day that&#x27;s a ton you know yeah yeah that&#x27;s like okay so you&#x27;re talking about that will prevent heart disease or cure heart disease cure gotcha so people who already have it conditions that will lead them to having heart disease it will cure hmm so Big Pharma came in and said [ __ ] no not allowed not allowed yep can&#x27;t make doctors like not allowed to do that oh you can&#x27;t I mean that&#x27;s not illegal no I mean that&#x27;s Lee that&#x27;s illegal freezing for a doctor prescribe vitamin C it&#x27;s hmm I guess it&#x27;s not illegal but it&#x27;s not I guess it&#x27;s not illegal for somebody to prescribe high doses of vitamin C I guess probably not however what drives the doctor and see this is why it&#x27;s so corrupt us because everybody is greedy yeah so it essentially boils down to greed so either government greed independent like lobbyists type greed whoever pays the highest bill is what drives the nation so there&#x27;s another product in this list that I&#x27;ll tell you about that will okay definitely understand all right number four number anteye-gravity what yep Willy Wonka you drink the soda lifting pop and you burp and it lets you back down yeah nope both the Germans during World War two and a scientist named Thomas Townsend Brown developed forms of anti-gravity disks the effects were so impressive that they were classified as top secret to be later developed more thoroughly and used on military personnel in the utmost secrecy used by military personnel not on military personnel there is a present-day rumor that the b-2 stealth bomber is in fact using an electro gravity ik propulsion system in addition to the primary twin General Electric low-profile engines during the wartime back in World War two a number of eyewitness accounts in London New York and Prague reported strange looking bell-shaped flying objects having militant military cross insignias very high-speed yeah this was the Nazi flying saucer thing theory things yep so all of that was either you know absorbed by the government or governments or it could be a hoax just saying there&#x27;s no twist I don&#x27;t have hoaxes on you know out of these are fake ones gotcha these are all potential effort was somebody said but I don&#x27;t know much about it I&#x27;ve heard of this but I don&#x27;t know much about it though I know that they they tried to do like flying saucer type vehicles that just didn&#x27;t well no pun intended they just didn&#x27;t take off so electrogravitic propulsion system that&#x27;s essentially essentially the system that they&#x27;re using alright moving on number three never have you ever heard of father Pellegrino Maria or Nettie never heard of that guy before no he invented something called weight Peleg no no he invented something called the chrono Visor you ever heard of this something you do with time yeah yeah pretty much all right so this father father or Nettie and it&#x27;s Hallion priest claim claimed in the 1960s to have invented what he called the chronovisor something that allowed him to witness Christ&#x27;s crucifixion the device supposedly enabled viewers to watch any event in human history by tuning to the remnant that are caused by every action his team of researchers and builders also included Enrico Fermi who worked on his first atomic bomb unsurprisingly conspiracy theorists say that the Vatican is now likely the owner of the original chrono Weiser and that&#x27;s rung into what could have been a side top-10 list what what the the Vatican owns as copyright or patent ownership now for season four their you know their religious beliefs or for whatever Vatican owns has thousands and thousands of things in their safes they have more secret [ __ ] than like I don&#x27;t know and then whatever had that you think has a lot of good [ __ ] Vatican&#x27;s like nuts man they have like their own like CIA they have their home like men and black yeah you ever see the movie what was the movie with Tom Hanks wasn&#x27;t a Tom DaVinci Kirk yeah The DaVinci Code and the one that followed it up was what angels and demons or something one of them he went into the Vatican&#x27;s safe and down underneath Vatican City what was you know Hollywood of course but he was supposed to portray Vatican City safes would would possibly act like and some of the unbelievable things that they have in there everything from like the arc could be in there too yep like holes stories of the Bible chapters of the Bible that aren&#x27;t released and the notoriously famous alien stuff to all kinds of crazy the notoriously famous Jesus&#x27;s actual inscriptions yeah in the what movie was that where the stigmata where the girl you know gets all the stigmata and you know whatever Turkish it was gorgeous at the end of the movie they say that you know that the original writings of Jesus were discovered and the Catholic religion denounces them as being the original writings but ironically they keep them in the Vatican vaults yeah well essentially the rumor is that it said that church is to be had inside each man not inside structure and that&#x27;s the biggest problem well that&#x27;s the biggest problem with the Catholic Church - the Catholic Church you&#x27;re going in the temple you go to the church that&#x27;s in the Bible they would lose their livelihood if that was actually true people believe the same thing as you so you can all like have a party together so it&#x27;s like a a for God yes right the whole point of Church is to be around like-minded people but for you to be religious is all on your own it&#x27;s personal so that&#x27;s where I can see it anyway now the Catholics have different views though than a lot of traditional Rhyno Christianity perspectives damn right but Jesus still loves me and Jesus says you should do it in the but what is the song go that is a song go have you heard the stack sounds familiar it&#x27;s like a thing for a different show it&#x27;s yeah that&#x27;s a good point I&#x27;ll strike that comment alright alright moving right along number two miracle cancer cures we&#x27;re back to cancer so far we&#x27;ve had cancer twice now we&#x27;ve had automobiles twice yeah sir a pattern this is in 2001 Nova Scotian Rick Simpson discovered that a cancer spot on his skin disappeared when a few days within a few days of applying an essential oil made from a marijuana going just the other direction since then Simpson and others have treated thousands of cancer patients with incredible success researchers in Spain have confirmed that the THC an active compound in marijuana kills not not just helps but or reduces but kills brain tumor cells in human subjects and shows promise with breast pancreatic and liver tumors the US Food and Drug Administration however classifies marijuana as a schedule 1 drug meaning that it has no accepted medical use unlike schedule 2 drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine which may provide medical benefits this is an ongoing debate in the you know legalize it community here in Florida so no marijuana is very obviously helping people and curing people of certain things my mother&#x27;s had skin cancer for years and years and if she could just use some topical solution to help get rid of a skin cancer breakout Jesus that would be fantastic amazing just man give us another one kiss so we a scoop dog no that was a snoop dog that I did dr. Dre Dr Dre so when I get high oh when I get out when I get high don&#x27;t know that punch a girl in the face video all right and number one number one we are wrapping up this top ten list with your original reference the water car but it&#x27;s not really just a car number one is water engine engine that runs on water I like calluses that&#x27;s right I&#x27;m trying to find this guy&#x27;s full name I just have Meyer maybe it&#x27;s in the article okay Meyer invented a car that ran on water instead of conventional fossil fuels or gasoline the car was able to travel from New York to Los Angeles on 22 gallons of water the engine system was fitted with a fuel cell that was able to split water into components hydrogen and oxygen they burnt hydrogen was the burn hydrogen was the fuel source used to generate the necessary energy to power the car with such energetic sustainability Meyers invention could have made a revolutionary contribution to our planets environment and economy if the full specifications of his work had been allowed to be published we&#x27;d all be using his technology today there&#x27;s hands-down bar none no question and the exhaust is oxygen oxygen is the exhaust that&#x27;s right so you&#x27;re only helping the environment you&#x27;re not hurting it Meyer turned down the offer for how much money for his invention how much do you think $1 Bob damn it you got $1 billion actually Henry&#x27;s closer 1 billion dollars so Meyer Meyer turned down an offer of a billion dollars to hand over the rights to his patents for his refusal it had been said that he was murdered for his profit having died from uranium poison having died of uranium poison he was too much of a financial threat to the ruling elites conventional oil industry and its petrochemical derivatives so essentially Big Oil is conspiracy theory to have killed this guy uranium poisoning come on I doesn&#x27;t the article didn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m trying to remember the story I thought like he was just about to sin and deal with the government and then he died and I forget what the deal was with the patent on it basically I think the guy who did this top 10 list would have looked that part up huh I mean we just talked about this like last week and I don&#x27;t remember the rest of it though but I don&#x27;t know you are here so you know I didn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know if that was last week or not and remember talking to me about something regarding inventions last week or the week before two days ago I remember in the fourth grade we all did come up with inventions in our class to share mm-hmm and I got a pretty bad grade on mics they thought mine was just too stupid and not needed and I wanted to embed a radio that had a screen on it that would tell you who&#x27;s saying what songs when the song came on it would tell you saying it didn&#x27;t and then you could push a button to go to the beginning of song in case you turn on the radio is the middle of it and everyone thought it was so stupid my teacher did Stanley Meyer you should call her and say oh remember me yeah a minute Shazam he was actually the wrestling coach so that&#x27;s why he didn&#x27;t like redheads but it was a racism thing I bet so this guy&#x27;s name by the way was Stanley Meyer so I&#x27;m looking up his his the wiki page on him right now to find out where his patents it&#x27;s probably the new Vatican the no Vatican did you say the new Vatican the Vatican&#x27;s moving to Nevada I don&#x27;t think you as Catholic so here&#x27;s the aftermath on his patents Meyers patents have expired his inventions are now in the public domain available for all to use without restriction or royalty payment despite this no engine or vehicle manufacturer has incorporated Meyers work hmm looks like Elon Musk yes no [ __ ] well cool so those were the top inventions that I thought were interesting enough to bring up for our top ten list what a great list I learned a lot that&#x27;s pretty cool yeah you guys like it do you like it Andrea mm-hmm did you yeah no it&#x27;s great all right that&#x27;s great it was great so you got next week unless we get a guest in but you get the next host driven one right and I have you have a teaser let me look at my notes real quickly maybe I have something in here Andrea do you want to put another one together and host one again okay yours by the way yours still holds the number one download for the most single day downloads of the twisted ten that&#x27;s cuz it was so great it was pretty good you&#x27;ve got some supporters and fans your friends really click the button a lot that&#x27;s cuz I love my friends and they live here ok I&#x27;m not maybe I&#x27;ll do this topic give this teaser I&#x27;m gonna give may change but I may change the topic but let me just think of something here I took George Carlin&#x27;s 7 deadly words into celebrity or arrests so you have some pretty good flexibility on how far you can take your your topic ok it&#x27;s just gonna have something to do don&#x27;t take any guesses this is pretty broad so think crystal ball crystal ball that&#x27;s it all right yes not to take cases before we get out of here attack I want to just give a quick plug to the Orlando tragedy to pulse tragedy there is a GoFundMe set up by a 501c3 nonprofit organization for the Florida for Florida it&#x27;s the state&#x27;s leading LGBTQ civil rights organization the go fund me is go fund me.com slash pulse Victims Fund and it&#x27;s also the website for them as EQ FL dot org so any money raised there goes to that organization and they help directly help the pulse tragedy families victims families etc etc so please help our our local community down here and floor down by go on to visit that site indeed all right thank you you want to get out of here oh yeah it&#x27;s scary here alright so check us out at facebook.com slash the twisted ten email us at ship email us at the twisted ten at gmail.com that&#x27;s correct alright hit us up on twitter at the no twitter at the twisted ten perfect um and if you like tacking Mike and Andrea&#x27;s content go check out livin pod Kerry asleep at our other podcast where we get a little bit more rough and raw around the edges indeed a cool deal all right well FAC next week is all yours unless you get a guest host then two weeks is like crystal ball that&#x27;s it though don&#x27;t yes that&#x27;s it tune in next week next week 7 focus focus alright cool see you guys next week [Music] [Applause] [Music] to have said I cannot tell a lie was a proud supporter of hemp of the hemp seed of course the only thing more surprising in this country the NHANES politician is hemp which is often mistaken for marijuana and therefore unfairly maligned so a lot of people think that hemp oil or hemp the product hemp has something to do with marijuana right I always thought that I don&#x27;t really know what the difference is you would have to smoke a hemp joint the size of a telephone pole to even get a slight buzz all right have you tried mmm now him can be used in the funny thing about this and I get more into this article in a second but hemp hemp can be used to make anything from paper to essential oils to fuel to shampoo soap clothing yeah anything I mean anything at all the number-one outlaw of hemp in the past had let me just go right to the water car since that&#x27;s our first one okay I think shadowing oh well yeah no I didn&#x27;t actually have the water car I have something that similar to water car okay it&#x27;s same but not the same all right in you let&#x27;s just get right into this all right so number 10 I think you&#x27;re gonna like number 10 right off the bat you too okay its biofuel but it&#x27;s made out of hemp Oh hemp biofuel so the article goes and this is from many different sources as always I looked up the you know top 20 top 30 top 40 that I could find online and there was a lot of these types of
