            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas I do videos on educational matters uh mostly obscure and esoteric uh but today today we&#x27;re doing I believe the 57th video on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson he derived this Theory back in the 20th century worked on it for 60 years of his life up until he died back in 1990. since then uh people like Bruce perrett have been working on updating uh the theory and working out the Kinks um Bruce unfortunately died back in 2020 there&#x27;s still some other people kicking around but uh it it&#x27;s a theory that in my opinion has not had enough exposure and so that&#x27;s where I come in hopefully and uh we are looking at his final book that&#x27;s called uh beyond space and time now Larson&#x27;s system of theory is a theory of everything he&#x27;s got books on physics and astrophysics and chemistry and astronomy and economics and other matters but this is his final book on it&#x27;s on metaphysics um philosophy religion um and uh psychology and uh the basic gist of his theory is uh enunciated in his first fundamental postulates uh which is basically that the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are the same except that they are reciprocals of each other so whatever qualities exist in space they also exist in time and vice versa and uh the uh both space and time are quantized meaning that there is a minimum unit of each uh the minimum unit of of space is uh on the order of 4.5 times 10 to the minus 8 centimeters uh 4.5 times 10 to the minus 8 meters and then the um uh unit of of time is 1.5 times 10 to the minus 16 seconds that means that there are um you know over six quadrillion um units of time in one second but basically one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so for Larson whereas uh whereas for Einstein the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe for Larson the speed of light is the midpoint or or neutral point of the universe and half the Universe moves faster than the speed of light and half the Universe moves slower than the speed of light that&#x27;s the half that we&#x27;re more familiar with he calls it the material sector or sector one and the half that and that is the realm of chemistry of atoms and molecules and uh these atoms and molecules aggregate to the point where they uh you know accumulate where they blam onto each other to the point where it gets to its most complex level which is um DNA which has billions of um atoms a DNA molecularized billions of atoms and at that point it becomes eligible to be taken over or controlled by a cosmic unit or sector two which is the region that is moving faster than the speed of light and this unit uh he calls it uh one of the control units it controls the material sector then in the same way that a thermostat controls a room it&#x27;s a small component but it controls the environment and when a material sector or sector one unit is controlled by a sector two unit they become what Larson calls a life unit so life is a uh coupling of a material and Cosmic uh sector um pair uh sector one uh controlled by sector two he also delineates a third region that he calls sector three which is entirely independent of space and time uh this is really how Larson uh is attempting to explain uh God and spiritual phenomena and uh this sector 3 which is independent of space and time also can uh gain control of that life unit once the life unit um gets to its most complex level which Larson calls the intelligent human so the evolutionary process so-called or the biological process of life um makes uh beings more and more um intelligence eventually to the point where they can become controlled by sector three sector three communicates with a sector two or with the life unit and [Music] um through things like ESP intuition scientific insight and religious revelation and uh so he&#x27;s gone through that we&#x27;ve gone through that in the previous videos um now we&#x27;re looking at chapter 14 which is on thinking and memory and thinking in memory are both evolutionary or biological processes sector two processes but they have sector three implications because that intelligence is the Baseline level that&#x27;s the prerequisite for sector three uh to take overall control the human being the intelligent human being is kind of at this boundary line where um they&#x27;re both controlled by the biological process which is geared toward uh survival and by the sector 3 which is geared toward ethical Behavior or good behavior and the human being is kind of caught in the middle there um and so uh here he&#x27;s talking about sleep uh and dreaming uh in this chapter I&#x27;m thinking in memory and that&#x27;s kind of where we are he comes to some uh interesting conclusions about sleep and memory I mean dreaming uh that are very strongly opposed to uh what Bruce Perrette comes up with so this is a this is a a matter of contention among uh the few people who actually do follow this reciprocal system of theory but uh we&#x27;ll resume we&#x27;ll uh pick it up right here [Music] um still toward the beginning of the chapter uh he&#x27;s quoting some uh evolutionary biologist I think it says if sleep does not serve an absolutely vital function then it is the biggest mistake The evolutionary process ever made uh given that it takes like one third of our time uh so that&#x27;s kind of the point that he&#x27;s making now Larson goes on evolution is a purely mechanical process and it responds only to existing conditions it cannot take into account the possibility that those conditions may change consequently when conditions actually do change some of the forms of life that have evolved may be too specialized to survive in the new environment in this sense Evolution may be said to make some mistakes but sleep is not one of these branches that is susceptible to being lopped off it is directly in the main line of evolutionary development it is a behavior characteristic of all of the most advanced forms of life including the human race the most adaptable of all biological organisms and it applies under all of the environmental conditions to which these forms of life are subject it obviously must serve an important and essential purpose uh we may say that sleep is clearly not an evolutionary mistake and costs the cost uh us a third of Our Lives it must serve an absolutely vital function the nature of that function is another of the many long-standing problems that have been resolved by the development of the reciprocal system of theory as explained uh in a previous chapter a biological organism is a material sector one structure associated with and under the control of a unit of the cosmic or sector 2 type in as much as sector 2 The Cosmic or inverse sector of the physical Universe which is the sector of motion in time that is motion in which the location in time deviates from the clock time of the material sector the time to which the sector 2 control units are the life unit conforms continually diverges from clock time the time to which the material structure of the living organism conforms so he&#x27;s saying that the material sector has this thing he calls clock time which is the progression of time that we would normally see on the clock this is a following this uh normal scalar progression um but the sector 2 unit um its form of it is uh in Emotion in time uh so it&#x27;s not uh following the same uh time as the material sector unit and so they deviate from one another the the sector two unit uh is keeping track of time in a different way than the sector one unit at the sector 2 control unit conform uh the time to which the sector 2 unit conforms continually diverges from clock time and uh this reminds me of an article that paret wrote uh no maybe it was nehru uh I&#x27;m not sure which one wrote it but it&#x27;s called clock time coordinate time now these are both the same uh space and time are the same now when we think of space we normally think of coordinate space x y z coordinates or euclidean geometry XYZ coordinates just like a a three-dimensional graph um they&#x27;re all at 90 degree angles to each other but then there is clock time which is a scalar motion which is a motion which has no uh specific Direction uh but just a magnitude and that is how the clock moves um this coordinate time is a vectorial um space a vectorial motion a motion that has directions in either the XYZ or coordinates and so uh the sector two unit is really working with what uh what is called coordinate time uh and by the reciprocal relation then there also is both coordinate space and then what would be called clock space clock space is a would be a scalar motion um now again the way that you would um Envision scalar motion is by taking a balloon and putting a bunch of dots on the balloon with a um magic marker and then you blow up the balloon as you blow up the balloon each dot is moving away from each other Dot uh that but there&#x27;s no particular direction that they&#x27;re moving it&#x27;s really moving in all directions compared to each other and that is a scalar motion a motion without a direction or with all directions either way um which is contrasting to this coordinate motion so uh the sector 2 unit is using uh a coordinate time whereas the sector one unit is using clock time and so uh then he says you know the sector uh two unit continually diverges from clock time um the clock the time to which the material structure or sector one conforms sleep is simply a condition in which the control mechanism is periodically disconnected and brought back into synchronization with the material structure in plants and the lower animals where the control mechanisms are simple and operate only intermittently this is accomplished by means of frequent adjustment periods of short duration but in the higher animals where the control mechanism is complex and operates continuously the period of Readjustment is distinct and much longer one of the most significant features of the reciprocal system of physical theory is that the explanation which it produces as to what any particular physiological entity is also explains why that entity behaves as it does for example the theoretical explanation of the nature of matter leads directly to an explanation of why matter exists in discrete units why it gravitates why there are a specific number of different types of atoms and so on now we find the same situation in biology the theoretical explanation of the nature of life not only tells us why the life unit is an aggregate of processes and why it opposes the tendency of inanimate matter toward disorder but also leads directly to simple explanations of some of the most important features of biological structures such as the reason why they are composed of cells here we derive another significant item of information from the same Source we find that the basic explanation of the nature of Life likewise reveals why sleep is an essential accompaniment of biological complexity exact synchronization of the life unit with the material structure is not required as there is a zone of tolerance within which operation of the control mechanism is not impaired a cycle of sleeping and waking periods is therefore established within the zone of tolerance on some basis that is in harmony with the environmental conditions the principal governing factors so far as the human race is concerned is the rotation of the Earth as the most efficient pattern is one in which sleep is relegated to the time that is least favorable for purposeful activity uh meaning when it&#x27;s dark abstention from sleep beyond the time when it would normally begin on this basis of the established pattern creates what we may call a pressure tending to cause sleep by a deliberate effort this pressure can be resisted and the period of wakefulness can be prolonged quite substantially ultimately however the limit of the zone of tolerance is reached and further deprivation of sleep results in disruption of mental processes if continued this disruption may become permanent and experiments with animals show that it can result in death that is the complete loss of sector 2 control the time Divergence simply becomes too great and the control mechanism loses touch with the physical body so there&#x27;s a pressure tending to cause sleep that gets more and more depending on how far you get out of sync with the material structure how far the cosmic structure gets out of sync with the material structure um now uh Larson does this often where he puts in the key word um but doesn&#x27;t really say expound on it the key word there is the pressure pressure is a physical quality uh you know it&#x27;s a a unit it&#x27;s a physical unit um and in Larson&#x27;s system uh all um all physical units uh have time space components uh time and space are the numerator and the denominator of the fraction so unlike you know your MKS units where you have things like Newtons and gausses and um you know uh well you have you know things that are named after the famous scientists uh to express the units all of Larson&#x27;s units are based on um time and space instead of being based on uh seconds and uh grams and um the time seconds up and also space you know inches or meters or whatever everything in Larson is is expressed specifically in terms of time and space only uh pressure itself is measured as T over s to the fourth time over space to the fourth power that basically also can be uh changed into uh energy energy is time over space so that&#x27;s energy per volume because volume is space to the third power so pressure is is time over space to the fourth power but you could also think of it as energy over volume and you can also think of it as Force um over um a plane uh two-dimensional plane force is time over space to the second power um and then you would say that per um uh per area so Force per area or energy per volume and you might think about uh pressure in in that way this would be more like an inverse pressure probably uh because uh we&#x27;re talking about again when you cross from the material to the cosmic sector you have to invert the roles of space and time okay we&#x27;ll take over here uh next time tomorrow uh and uh you have a great day and we will see you next time</p>
