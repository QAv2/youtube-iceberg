            <p>all right hello everyone and uh if you&#x27;re just tuning in I&#x27;m Thomas and uh welcome to my channel I do a educational videos and I&#x27;m embarking on a new unit I&#x27;ve done uh this is the fourth video on the reciprocal system of theory by Dewey B Larson and uh I&#x27;ve done three other kind of autobiographical introductions just kind of my personal experience with the reciprocal system and uh then I&#x27;ll be doing a couple of videos on the biographical aspects like so uh Dewey Larson&#x27;s background and also probably Bruce perrett a little on Bruce Perrette who is the person that came up with the reciprocal system 2 which is kind of a an updating of Larson&#x27;s original work um uh you know Larson died back in 1990 and so uh over the ensuing 30 years peret died in 19 2020. February 2020 I believe and so uh over those 30 years uh paret work to kind of uh clear up some of the errors that Larson had made now again Larson would say uh you know the theory itself is correct now whether I actually applied the theory correctly in all cases is a different matter and so that is uh one thing about the reciprocal system it&#x27;s a system of theory so you have the theory and the theory is a theory of everything you can apply it to every subject but you have to know what you&#x27;re doing in order to apply it to these different subjects and so he made a few mistakes in the application of the theory but the theory itself stands stands good okay now what I was saying um also if you want to um well I guess you can um leave your name and uh an email in the comments section if you want to get any of my books um you can buy them from me uh you can get my free Guide to the 144 fractal faculties uh by putting your name and email in the comment section and you can donate to me through cash app or venmo and uh if you want my book on improvised music or you want to get my book on Tree of Life uh just specify that uh it&#x27;s a 10 minimum and uh and you can also donate directly that way too anyway so um why I was leaving off uh the other day uh yesterday was um that I really knew okay I looked at Larson started reading his books going over them then I eventually got to this period where I was pretty much nothing but Larson I was studying I mean I I studied some other stuff too but I spent the the majority of my time for about seven maybe even more years just studying Larson&#x27;s stuff and just you know really learning his books especially his structure of the physical Universe which are his uh his um three books on physics and astrophysics and then also chemistry and just kind of the generals of the theory and um eventually I I got around to uh acquiring copies of you know like uh I got a college astronomy textbook and I got a I think it was a college chemistry textbook and a maybe a high school physics textbook and I read them over and it was like I understood just about everything in those books um so um that came from studying Larson so Larson gave me the background to really understand these other books and I think that&#x27;s important because this is this is the position that uh an intelligent 13 year old or 12 year old or whatever could take with their kind of their High School science um I would love to have uh you know the opportunity to tutor somebody like that because if you really learned Larson&#x27;s system before you started taking uh science classes you would totally shine in those science classes even though those science classes come to different conclusions ultimately than what Larson does but he really explains where they&#x27;re coming from where they&#x27;re making mistakes and so you can read these books these textbooks you can read them on like a couple different levels you know you can see understand what they&#x27;re talking about but you can also look at it kind of from above and understand where they&#x27;re making mistakes and also where they&#x27;re really um engaged in this kind of deception which I think it&#x27;s not they&#x27;re not really trying to deceive you they&#x27;re almost even trying to deceive themselves uh you know they&#x27;re trying to convince themselves of how advanced they are so you can you can read in some of these like astronomy textbooks you know um scientists now know this or now we understand this um and what I have found in general is that kind of the less uh the less competent and less uh scientific you are as a scientist uh you know the lower caliber scientists they&#x27;re the ones that are saying oh scientists now know this now we understand this um you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s settled now that this is such and such uh when they say that uh I you know I cringe and I pretty much discount that you know account but I found that the the highest scientists the ones that are the most eminent in their field and the ones that really understand what they&#x27;re talking about you know they&#x27;ll be like well this is just the most this is just the most recent theory that we have uh it&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve got right now there&#x27;s probably we&#x27;ll probably come up with something that that you know eclipses this um but this is where we&#x27;re this is where we&#x27;re at right now this is what we&#x27;ve got to work with you know the the real scientists who really know what&#x27;s going on know that this is just a work in progress and we&#x27;re trying to come up with you know something better but this is where we are right now and uh you know they know that you know these things aren&#x27;t set in stone and that uh you know there&#x27;s always holes in these theories um whereas the people that kind of like write the textbooks um and the spokespeople uh oh and there&#x27;s plenty of propaganda as well you know the people from NASA and so on you know where they&#x27;re just kind of like making things up they&#x27;re uh trying to they&#x27;re vying for billion dollar contracts or billion dollar grants to get you know their thing and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so great about Larson is he had he pretty much had zero budget and he was still able to come up with better ideas and better uh even better Solutions but that&#x27;s another thing about Larson is that um or at least my experience with kind of like trying to teach this to other people and uh trying to get other people uh enthusiastic about this and to recognize that this guy&#x27;s really on to something uh to get them to look at it a little bit deeper um the people that that I approach this with very often they they&#x27;re kind of like they&#x27;re expecting Larson to compete with the Legacy science and it&#x27;s not really very fair because you know Larson is is one guy he has he didn&#x27;t have anybody helping him at least at first you know there was a small group of people who put you know started following him later on after he had written up several of his books and so on and they formed this organization which still exists but we&#x27;ll talk about that later but um you know but the Legacy science we&#x27;re talking about like thousands tens of thousands of scientists with you know millions and billions of dollars to work on this and Larson is supposed to basically compete with them you know um you know uh people will say oh I haven&#x27;t seen Larson uh I haven&#x27;t seen him challenge this you know this Theory or I haven&#x27;t seen him uh you know it&#x27;s kind of like they&#x27;re they&#x27;re expecting him to be on a Level Playing Field with these people and it&#x27;s like well Larson was one guy he had to he had to manage his resources he had manage his time he couldn&#x27;t do everything at once and so he just tried to do the best he could do with the time that he had and with the resources that he had um and the fact that he&#x27;s even really in the con in the same conversation uh shows that he was able to to make great uh strides with the little that he had and um you know it&#x27;s up to uh his successors now to to try to piggyback on what he did and and you know produce the promise like to manifest or potential uh to manifest the promise that Larson started off with he couldn&#x27;t he couldn&#x27;t write books on every subject he couldn&#x27;t do research on all these different minutia you know I mean you look in a physics and or a chemistry department at the the professors there you know they&#x27;re pigeonholed they&#x27;re doing you know some of them are are there and they&#x27;re working on just these tiny little topics these you know and I&#x27;m you know it&#x27;s just like it&#x27;s just like history I&#x27;m a historian you know they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re historians that they spend their whole life working on a five-year period in one country or even in one small segment of a country or they might spend their whole career working on one guy you know the uh intellectual history of one guy or um and they don&#x27;t know really anything about um you know they might know a little bit of the background of the place that that one person lived um and they might know the background of the few Decades of you know around the time that he lived but uh it&#x27;s not interdisciplinary at all it you know in the in the academy it&#x27;s all pigeonholed they they all study these tiny little topics and they hardly can communicate with other people outside of the topic and that&#x27;s another reason why I love Larson is that he&#x27;s such a generalist he tried he tried to work on really every subject every subject that he had time to get to um you know and he has books on physics and astrophysics and chemistry and astronomy and metaphysics a lot of stuff on philosophy uh religion economics dream interpretation and psychology um you know ethics and I&#x27;m sure had he lived longer he would have had others you know would have covered other subjects as well um and that&#x27;s where you know uh his heirs um intellectual heirs come in you know where we we can pick up where he left off but he left the legacy of being you know a generalist uh trying to get the the the you know 40 000 foot view to be able to see the whole picture and he left us with the uh the general guidelines so that we can kind of figure out where to start and where to go you know um and whatever subject it is that your uh trained in that you&#x27;re interested in you can take Larson&#x27;s Theory and plug it into that now it might take a little doing you might have to think a little bit abstractly about this but it can happen um and so that uh but you know I feel like from my experience you really have to you really have to be patient and you really have to be open-minded you know if you if if if you&#x27;re reading Larson or you&#x27;re studying Larson the reciprocal system or paret and they say something that you don&#x27;t agree with or they say something that is ambiguous or you don&#x27;t understand you gotta just keep going you just have to keep keep going and suspend your disbelief you know say well I&#x27;m not sure um instead of you know I&#x27;ve had some you know one friend that I&#x27;ve actually got to to read some of Larson&#x27;s stuff he pretty much just rejected Larson because he felt like oh well in this particular area he says this and I know that it&#x27;s this and so he got that wrong therefore his whole thing is wrong on and it&#x27;s like well you you don&#x27;t really understand uh you know this is especially true with like Larson&#x27;s concept of dimensions he talks about dimensions in two different ways there&#x27;s first there is the normal set of Dimensions that we know of x y z coordinates making three dimensions of space you know that are orthogonal to each other um you know uh you&#x27;re you&#x27;re playing you know your different three different planes that are at right angles to each other um but then he also has a concept of scalar dimensions and a scalar uh scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no Direction so it or it has all directions and [Music] um really a scalar quantity is just something that you you know you can&#x27;t apply any type of Dimensions to them and uh but there are in Larson system there are three scalar dimensions and um so that that gets people confused there are there are you know many things within Larson that are very confusing um and you have you have to just kind of suspend this belief and move on it&#x27;s got this other concept called the inter-atomic distance and like simply put it&#x27;s like if you&#x27;re looking into another Realm you can&#x27;t see everything going on in that Realm and so you&#x27;re only seeing a certain fraction of what&#x27;s happening in that realm and he figured out a way to calculate that inter-atomic distance um and it differs depending on how you&#x27;re applying it and so your measurements need to be reduced by this amount this inter-atomic distance and it&#x27;s a super difficult concept to grasp um I&#x27;m not asking anybody to just uh blindly follow you know blindly follow him I&#x27;m just saying suspend your disbelief long enough so that you can hear him out hear out what he has to say um don&#x27;t don&#x27;t reject things that he has to say before you understand what he&#x27;s actually saying um you know and say in the same way you know the the same person I&#x27;m talking about uh eventually you know he&#x27;s he ended up kind of blaming me for um not presenting it to him on a silver platter for him and you know everybody has a different silver platter everybody has a different wheelhouse where it&#x27;s like if you present it to them in this way they&#x27;ll understand it because that&#x27;s the way they&#x27;re used to thinking about it but if you can&#x27;t read their mind it&#x27;s difficult to present it to them right down their alley where they can really get it you know and uh I I just feel like in this Society people are too spoiled and they&#x27;re too consumerists you know where they they turn they can turn on the TV and if they don&#x27;t like it they can change the channel if they don&#x27;t like that they can change channel turn it off turn on the computer or something and you know that you have all these different options and everybody&#x27;s got to satisfy you in two seconds or else you can just turn it off and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not the way this works and that&#x27;s not the way the world Works um and it&#x27;s certainly not the way that Larson worked when he back in the day long ago before all this really even started where he was writing his books you know it it can&#x27;t be that you&#x27;re a consumer of this you have to be a participant you have to engage with the material with the you know compare the material with what you already have in your head the way you understand it but just don&#x27;t say oh well this is different than the way I understand therefore it&#x27;s wrong or this is I don&#x27;t really like this so therefore I&#x27;m going to turn it off you know if you if you take that approach you&#x27;ll just never get it so um but then uh another problem with the theory is that Larson did make a few mistakes uh at least according to me there are Orthodox larsonians out there that say he didn&#x27;t make any mistakes uh and so that was really where Dr Bruce Perrette comes in and kvk nehru and they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve uh they engaged with Larson while Larson was still alive especially nehru and um but now that Larson&#x27;s dead you know they moved on and tried to you know correct his theories to the uh without distorting them um now peret I can complain a little bit because he did a lot of speculating he wrote very speculatively he moved a lot of Larson&#x27;s work into into very metaphysical uh uh Terrain uh a crypto history crypto archeology ancient crypto history and um you know Geo um you know like all kinds of uh not only Geo engineering but Geo like the shape of the earth and uh history of the earth and um a lot of things having to do with astronomy as well so uh again these are these are places where uh it can get confusing okay I&#x27;m gonna just wrap it up there and uh hopefully tomorrow we&#x27;ll get into some of the Larson&#x27;s autobiographical material all right have a great day</p>
