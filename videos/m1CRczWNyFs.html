            <p>some sort of super sophisticated propulsion system that doesn&#x27;t rely on a combustion engine some completely new style of propulsion system that they&#x27;ve been working on they&#x27;ve been working on gravity propulsion System since the 1950s true they&#x27;ve been at least theorizing these things and the the possibility that someone has come up with something in a drone form that they can pilot like that makes the most sense to me because they keep spotting these things in areas where the military practices they keep spotting these things off the coast of San Diego off the east coast where they have this these uh restricted areas</p>
