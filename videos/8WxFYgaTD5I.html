            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel and we look at some great theories of everything uh from the present the past uh even the distant past and um we try to uh go deep on them show you the ins and outs and how you can benefit from them in your life especially in terms of uh shifting your paradigms and um Awakening to 5D Consciousness today is our 476th video on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey Bernard Larson and uh Mr lson was an American engineer who lived in the 20th century born in 1898 died in 1990 and around 1930 he had some epiphanies about was working as a um an engineer maybe a chemical engineer some chemical company out west in Portland and uh he was kind of working on uh chemistry problem trying to make his small contribution to the field and um eventually recognized that uh some of his findings were uh revolutionary and that um they led to a much broader uh set of solutions than kind of what he bargained for and he answered the call and he developed his theory over the next 30 Years and in 1959 he uh put out his two fundamental postulates about how he believed the universe operated just two sentences um kind of condensing um all the major aspects of uh how he believe the universe operated and then uh through a process of deduction he developed his theoretical universe basically what the universe would look like if my postulates were correct and um he wrote some books um comparing his theoretical Universe with the actual so-called actual um measured empirical universe of the Legacy scientists all the mainstream streamers out there um who had done many laboratory experiments to determine uh you know various um scientific processes and and and measurements and compiled them in tables like so for example we&#x27;re looking at this book here called basic properties of matter from Mr Larson you put this out just a few years before he died in 1987 and uh this book is uh primarily on chemistry and Larson develops equations for many of the basic properties of matter like the melting point and the specific heat and the thermal expansion and then he Compares his results with the uh laboratory results that are compiled in various scientific tables um we are in chapter 8 close to the end of chapter 8 here called thermal expansion now Mr larsson&#x27;s theory is called the reciprocal system and uh it&#x27;s called the system the system of theory because it&#x27;s not just a theory it&#x27;s a system of theories it&#x27;s an intertwined interlocking set of theories on every subject now Larson didn&#x27;t live long enough even though he lived to be 92 uh didn&#x27;t live long enough to extend his theory into every subject but he extended his theory into many subjects he&#x27;s got books on chemistry and physics Astro physics he&#x27;s got uh books on on sections of books on many metaphysical subjects including psychology and religion and uh metaphysics um philosophy uh dream interpretation he&#x27;s got two books on economics so he he has a system of theory it&#x27;s basically one way of looking at things and then you can plug it into whatever field you choose including a fields that Larson never uh explored um some of his followers have plugged his theory in into other subjects even um you know geochronology and um meteorology and uh crypto history conspiracy theories uh these have all been explored by uh some of lar person&#x27;s followers now the basic idea again is laid down in the first two postulates and um the first postulate is really like what&#x27;s particular to the reciprocal system and then the second postulate is really kind of what&#x27;s more accepted by the regular normal everyday scientist uh just as a condition of being a scientist and these the second POS is what Larson basically uses to derive the theoretical universe that he arrives at he takes the uh you know the prongs that are articulated in the first postulate and then he uses the second postulate to um run the first postulate through the second postulate in order to arrive at a theoretical universe so the first postulate again the reciprocal system of theory also known as the universe of motion because Larson is one of the few scientists uh but not the first but one of the few scientists who attempted to build their cosmology on motion as opposed to matter like the ancient Greeks or energy like some of the 20th century folks so the first postulate reads that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so um that&#x27;s the first postulate the second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian okay so you see the second postulate doesn&#x27;t really contribute anything new it&#x27;s really kind of uh the old uh the old way of looking at things um you know math Works geometry Works logic works the first postulate uh is um you know very different than most scientists think of um and it has basically four prongs to it the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time and uh space and time and motion come in three dimensions space and time and motion come in only discrete units now I I have fleshed out this uh these reciprocal system uh ad nauseum and uh I&#x27;m going to do it one more time here uh a little bit but um in the future I&#x27;m just going to refer you to one of my previous 475 videos uh because I&#x27;d like to spend a little bit more time um going through the actual text of Larson um but you know there&#x27;s a lot of kind of background information that you need to have before you can even start to kind of get into it with Larson especially like in the middle of a chapter somewhere and so I want to give the viewer the background information that&#x27;s needed but there&#x27;s so much background information that&#x27;s needed that at this point um I&#x27;ve given you really like 475 different versions of explaining how this works and you could really choose any one of them so I&#x27;m going to start to just refer you to one of my previous videos If you want to get up to speed on how the reciprocal system operates and I might just uh give you a one or two minute explanation and then start getting into the text of what I&#x27;m reading so um kind of from here on in uh at least as far as the reciprocal system is concerned I think we&#x27;re only going to go through this book and maybe not even this whole book um and then and um we&#x27;re going to go through one of his books on economics uh I might not read that that book either I might just go for my notes um I feel the need especially in this book and in some of the scientific subjects to read larsson&#x27;s books word for word because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m really in the place to interpret them I understand the theory as well as I can so far but my comprehension of a lot of the details is lacking um for various reasons um most of which are on me and uh but so I want you to be able to hear it coming you know from Larson um and um but I also feel like I need to be explaining these things to you um for every video and so I&#x27;m not going to do that um starting tomorrow I&#x27;m just going to go kind of get right into the reading uh but so yeah so the first postulate really has these four prongs universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time space time and motion have three dimensions space time and motion come only in discret units when Larson is talking about motion he&#x27;s referring to a specific or or generalized kind of motion called the scalar motion this is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction uh you can model a scalar motion using a balloon that you put dots on if you blow up the balloon you will discover that all of the dots are moving away from each other um but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction every dot is basically moving in every direction away from each other um and if you reverse that motion and uh you contract the balloon then all of the dots will be moving toward each other these are what Larsson calls the progression outward movement so this it&#x27;s a scalar motion it doesn&#x27;t have a direction doesn&#x27;t have a specific Direction you can call it in or out and the outward motion of the progression uh is called the progression the outward motion of that balloon surface is called the progression and the inward movement is called gravitation now you have to uh accept the limits of the model there um it&#x27;s missing a a dimension there um you can also use something like raisin bread to uh make up the difference you um as you uh put the bread in the oven and uh it rises all of the raisins will be moving away from each other and so you can think of it that way too but um so that is a scalar motion and that is the that&#x27;s the motion that Larson basically constructs his Universe out of that is the source the progression and that outward motion is um um Eternal and omnipresent it is occurring at all times in all places and um it&#x27;s occurring at a certain speed uh and it is uh the source of everything and this is something that you have to accept to be able to accept the reciprocal system and to manifest anything you basically need to turn that outward motion of the progression into the inward motion of gravitation the gra gravitation is what um implies matter or is the um the evidence of matter and so all matter gravitates and so anything that is um made out of matter is on the inward motion of that balloon and so that turning that outward motion to the inward motion is done by reversing the motion um first by neutralizing the motion and then moving the motion inward um and uh it has to be um basically rotated if first it&#x27;s reversed and then it&#x27;s rotated um and the the reversal is really called the photon and then the um rotation the rotation is of the photon and that results in uh particles and then eventually atoms and in Larson&#x27;s periodic table he uses three numbers so uh you have your a number is your primary two-dimensional rotation your B number is your secondary two-dimensional rotation and then your c number is your onedimensional rotation in the opposite direction which is optional so every um every atom has a three number group in larsson&#x27;s system um the third number could be zero the third number could be negative or positive the first two numbers are always positive and they alternate uh the first and then the second and then the first and then the second uh and the maximum that you can get for the first two numbers is five uh four plus one one is for the initial level um because there&#x27;s always an initial level when you have the progression the progression is always there so there&#x27;s always this underlying motion uh in the universe it&#x27;s always there this is what Larsson would call the empty universe or the Universe At rest so in a universe of motion the Universe At rest is moving outward um in all directions at all times so then we have motion and motion is the relationship between space and time so this is implying a reciprocal relationship motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator space and time are are reciprocals of one another which means that they have identical properties whatever property adheres to one also adheres to the other not at the same time but um in their totality and space and time do not have an independent existence they only exist together in motion um and space and time have three dimensions you can see this in what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time coordinate space is something that we&#x27;re accustomed to uh three dimensions of time are three dimensions of space in a still frame you know XYZ coordinates uh space is is stationary but time is still moving time is moving in a scalar manner it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later but in no specific Direction This is what lson calls the spatial reference system the spatial reference system is um coordinate space and clock time uh gravity has uh slowed uh or stopped the progression of space when you go back to this progression you know the progression is space and time um outward in space and outward in time um step by step by step but if you reverse the progression in one uh aspect in in space then you get coordinate space three dimensions of space in a still frame and you have clock time time is still progressing so you you&#x27;ve reversed and neutralized and rolled back the progression in one of the two but not the other and by the reciprocal postulate there is also theoretically a place where you have coordinate time three dimensions of time in a still frame time is stationary and has x-like y like and z-like coordinates but space is still progressing space is still scaler everything is getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no specific Direction like on the surface of an expanding balloon and Larson refers to that is the temporal reference system um and the temporal stationary reference system so we&#x27;ve got these two reference systems three dimensions of space and three dimensions of time but but in total we have three dimensions of motion and it only requires one dimension of motion to fully uh you know exhaust those three dimensions of either space or time so the spa the spatial or temporal reference system is not sufficient to describe three dimensions of motion uh and so Larson uses the moving reference system the progression but it&#x27;s the progression at a certain rate uh and that rate comes from the discrete unit postulate all of our scientific quantities come only in units as I was saying the um all motion is a relationship between space and time basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator and um speed is the most basic kind of motion that we know of the car is moving 10 miles per hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time space over time is speed but uh all of our other scientific phenomena are also forms of motion matter is a form of motion energy is a form of motion force is a form of motion electric charge is a form of motion this viscosity is a form of motion pressure is a form of motion and so on and they all have their space over time or time over space signatures keeping in mind that uh they can go up to three or really Six Dimensions like density density is time to the thir power over space to the sixth power and that&#x27;s really because density is mass over volume and mass matter is time to the third power over space to the third power and volume is space to the thir power so uh when you multiply them together you get time to the 3 over space to the 6th and that&#x27;s density and that is a kind of motion it&#x27;s a relationship between space and time and so lson has this uh moving reference system that he calls the progression of the natural reference system there&#x27;s a stationary spatial reference system a stationary temporal reference system and then there is the natural reference system the system that the Universe actually conforms to and that is where Larsson makes his measurements from whereas Legacy science makes their measurements from zero from stationary space um okay now so the discrete unit postulate uh everything comes in units gravity comes in units matter comes in units uh acceleration comes in units Force comes in units energy comes in units speed comes in units and in this case we have the progression at unit speed one unit of space per one unit of time and that space over time is speed 1/ 1 equal 1 unit speed is one unit of space over one unit of time which also turns out to be the speed of light so that is the progression that is the empty universe that is The Ether that is the zero point that is the state of rest of the universe is to be moving outward at the speed of light in all directions from all locations at all times and um then that is the uh data from which you make your measurements and what that also means is that half the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light the speed of light is a boundary between two different sectors of the universe that Larson refers to as the cosmic sector the faster than light sector and the material sector the slower than light sector in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and clock space in the material sector you have coordinate space space and clock time they are reciprocals of one another so even though the Legacy scientists know nothing about the cosmic sector what they can take what they know about the material sector and extrapolate it to the cosmic sector because they are reciprocals of one another also within each one of the cosmic sector and the material sector is a is a sub region um what Larson calls the time region in the material sector and the space region in the cosmic sector and this is again due to the discrete unit postulate um space time and motion come only in discrete units you have to have a full unit of space before you have space and same with time and so if you have atoms or particles that approach each other to one unit of space they can&#x27;t move any closer in space so what they do because uh one unit is the smallest that you can get and so instead they move outward in time instead of inward in space they move outward in time which by the reciprocal postulate is equivalent to outward in inward in space so we see it as inward in space because we are anchored to a spatial reference system so Larsson calls this the time region that&#x27;s the region inside one unit of space now our perception is slightly distorted or very distorted when we look into this region um but we can look into the region but we have to adjust our findings because what we see in equivalent space is a two-dimensional region as opposed to one and it is um reduced by what he calls the inter Regional ratio which is basically the amount lost in the translation as you&#x27;re looking from one Vector of the universe to another now the same thing holds true in the reciprocal in the uh reciprocal um sector the cosmic sector except that&#x27;s called the time region or the space region which is in one within one unit of time and uh when they approach each other to one unit of time um then they can&#x27;t move any closer so they move outward in space which is the equivalent of moving inward in time okay let&#x27;s try to uh read here for a few minutes uh at the end of this chapter uh most of the rare Earths uh Rare Earth elements have the one unit expansion coefficient um 5.2 * 10- 6 per degree Kelvin at the initial level of the second segment of the curve although their melting points are in the range where coefficients of two or in some cases three units would be normal the reason for this the only deviation from the general pattern in the expansion curves of these elements is as yet unknown but it is no doubt connected with the other peculiarities of The Rare Earth elements that were noted earlier the electr negative elements of division three follow the regular pattern the lowest melting point in this group is that of mercury 234 Dees Kelvin well below the lowest value for any of the electropositive elements investigated but this descent to a lower melting point does not introduce any new Behavior the upper segment of the expansion curve for mercury defined by the empirical data in figure 15 definitely terminates at the 4 unit level uh 20.7 * 10us 6 per degree Kelvin as required by the theory thus the theoretical relations are applicable to the full temperature range of the first three divisions as noted earlier the borderline elements of division 4 those with negative electric displacement four are capable of acting as members of either division 3 or division 4 the expansion curve for lead follows the normal division 3 pattern the lower borderline elements tin and geranium have Curves in which the initial levels like those of the rare earth are lower than the values corresponding to the melting points otherwise these curves are also normal very little is known about the expansion of the elements of negative displacement below four the theoretical development has not yet been extended to a consideration of the effect of the strongly electronegative character of these elements on the volume relations and the empirical data are both meager and conflicting division 4 situation is part of the general problem of anisotropic expansion a subject to which the reciprocal system of theory has not yet been applied the measurements previously cited that apply to inotropic crystals were made on polycrystalline material in which the expansion in different directions is averaged as a result of the random orientation in the aggregate both this issue of anisotropic expansion and the application of the thermal expansion Theory to compounds and Alloys are still on the waiting list for future investigation there is no reason to believe that such an investigation will encounter any serious difficulties but for the present other matters are being given the priority okay that&#x27;s the end of the chapter and uh chapter nine the next chapter here is called electric currents that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll start with when we resume tomorrow and again I won&#x27;t be explaining um uh the reciprocal system just for just for a moment and I&#x27;m going to get right into the text now I&#x27;m sure that you didn&#x27;t understand quite a bit of what was said there especially if this is your first video with with us here but um I do like to read it into the record so that uh any uh real studious person can pick up on it and um so that&#x27;s what I did there um you&#x27;re going to have to watch my old videos and watch any of the the new videos and the old videos maybe to to pick up on um exactly what&#x27;s being discussed um but um you know in order to be able to move on I&#x27;m going to have to at some point assume that you uh have a certain amount of understanding and just refer you to previous videos so that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re headed here in the next uh little while and stay tuned tomorrow for um some talk about um electric currents and thanks for tuning in have a</p>
