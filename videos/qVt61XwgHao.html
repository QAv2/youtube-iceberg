            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>You&#x27;ve been running from one feeling your entire life. And almost everything you&#x27;ve done, every relationship, every job, every distraction has been designed to avoid facing it. But here&#x27;s what no one tells you. That one [music] hidden emotion isn&#x27;t just controlling your choices. It&#x27;s collapsing your quantum field.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s determining which version of reality you&#x27;re experiencing right [music] now. And until you observe it, truly observe it, you&#x27;ll keep creating more of the same past disguised [music] as your future. Let me ask you something. Have you ever felt like you know what&#x27;s wrong, but you can&#x27;t seem to change it? You understand the problem intellectually. [music] You&#x27;ve read the books.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve done the therapy, but somehow you keep finding yourself in the same [music] emotional patterns, the same reactive loops, the same story with different characters. Here&#x27;s the thing. You&#x27;re not broken. You&#x27;re not lacking willpower. And you&#x27;re not doing it wrong.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s actually happening is far more elegant and far more [music] precise than most people realize. You are living inside a quantum field right now. A field that is infinite [music] in possibility. A field that responds not to your effort, but to your alignment. Not to what you&#x27;re doing, [music] but to who you&#x27;re being.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s where it gets interesting. In the language of quantum mechanics, there&#x27;s something called the observer effect. The idea that the act of observing collapses a wave of possibility into a single reality. Your consciousness, your awareness, [music] literally determines which version of the quantum field becomes your experience. But what [music] if I told you that you&#x27;ve been observing from the wrong state? What if the emotion you&#x27;ve [music] been running from your entire life is the very thing that&#x27;s been locking you into one collapsed reality? a reality that looks a lot like your past.</p>
<p>Ready to go deeper? Let&#x27;s talk about what [music] nobody tells you. So, here&#x27;s what most people don&#x27;t [music] understand about emotions in reality creation. They think emotions are just reactions [music] to what happens. Something good happens, you feel happy. Something bad happens, you feel sad.</p>
<p>Simple cause and effect, right? Wrong. Because here&#x27;s the truth that changes everything. Your emotions aren&#x27;t just responses. [music] They&#x27;re signals, electromagnetic signatures. And in the quantum field, they&#x27;re the primary [music] factor that determines which potential reality collapses into your lived experience.</p>
<p>Let me explain this scientifically because this is too important to leave in the realm of theory. Dr. Dr. Joe Despensza&#x27;s research has shown that when you experience an emotion, [music] you&#x27;re not just having a feeling, you&#x27;re broadcasting a frequency. Your heart generates an electromagnetic field [music] that extends several feet outside your body.</p>
<p>This field carries information and the quantum field, this invisible matrix of infinite possibilities around you, responds to that information. Think of it like a radio. You don&#x27;t question that your car radio can pick up signals from a tower miles away. You don&#x27;t see the signal, but you trust it&#x27;s there. While your emotional state is broadcasting a signal right now, and the quantum [music] field is receiving it, the question is, what frequency are you tuned to? Most people are tuned to survival.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s why [music] that matters. When you&#x27;re operating from survival emotions, fear, anger, anxiety, shame, your brain releases a [music] specific cocktail of chemicals. Cortisol, adrenaline. These are powerful chemicals designed to mobilize you in the face of immediate danger. And they [music] work beautifully when you&#x27;re actually in danger.</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s the problem. Most of us aren&#x27;t running from predators anymore. We&#x27;re running [music] from feelings. And our body doesn&#x27;t know the difference between a real threat and an imagined one. Between a lion chasing you in the memory of [music] your father&#x27;s disappointment.</p>
<p>So your body keeps releasing those survival chemicals day after day, year after year until something remarkable happens. You memorize the emotion. Let me say that again because this is the key. You don&#x27;t just experience the emotion temporarily. [music] You memorize it.</p>
<p>The feeling becomes so familiar, so practiced that your body starts to crave it. It becomes your baseline, your normal, your comfort zone, even though it&#x27;s deeply uncomfortable. And this is where the neuroscience gets stunning. Dr. Bruce Lipton&#x27;s work in epigenetics shows us that [music] repetitive emotional states don&#x27;t just affect your mood.</p>
<p>They literally signal your genes. They tell your cells what proteins to [music] produce. They shape your biology in real time. So, if you&#x27;re living in fear every day, your body starts to believe the external world is dangerous. If you&#x27;re living in guilt, your body believes you&#x27;re unworthy.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re living in anger, your body believes it&#x27;s under attack. And here&#x27;s the quantum connection that most people miss. Your body doesn&#x27;t just respond to your environment. It anticipates it. It creates [music] it.</p>
<p>Because in the quantum field, the observer doesn&#x27;t just witness reality. The observer participates in creating it. When your body is chemically conditioned to expect danger, lack, or unworthiness, you unconsciously scan your environment for evidence to confirm that expectation. You literally look for reasons to feel the memorized emotion. Not because you want to suffer, but because your nervous system is trying to match your internal chemistry with your external experience.</p>
<p>This is what&#x27;s called coherence in quantum physics. Your thoughts, your feelings, and your environment are all trying to align to match frequencies. And if your dominant frequency is survival, then the quantum field delivers a survival reality, not because it&#x27;s cruel, but because it&#x27;s precise. [music] Now, here&#x27;s where most people get stuck. They try to think their way out of it.</p>
<p>They use their conscious mind to set intentions, visualize outcomes, repeat affirmations, and they wonder why nothing changes. Let me tell you why. Because 95% of who you are by age [music] 35 is a set of memorized behaviors, emotional reactions, unconscious habits, hardwired attitudes, beliefs, [music] and perceptions that function like a computer program. And that program is running in your subconscious mind below your [music] awareness, automated. So you can set all the intentions you want consciously.</p>
<p>But if your subconscious is broadcasting [music] a different signal, if your body is chemically addicted to unworthiness, then guess which signal the quantum [music] field responds to, the louder one, the one that&#x27;s been playing on [music] repeat for decades, the one you&#x27;ve memorized. This is why willpower fails. This is why [music] positive thinking alone doesn&#x27;t work, because you&#x27;re trying to override a biological addiction with [music] a mental thought. And biology always wins. But here&#x27;s the revolutionary part that [music] changes everything.</p>
<p>The moment you become conscious of the unconscious, the moment you observe the emotion you&#x27;ve [music] been running from, something shifts. You activate your frontal lobe, the part of your brain [music] that gives you the power of self-reflection, of metacognition. And in that moment of observation, you&#x27;re no longer being the old self. You&#x27;re being the observer of the old self. That&#x27;s a [music] quantum shift.</p>
<p>Because now instead of unconsciously perpetuating the pattern, [music] you&#x27;re consciously recognizing it. And recognition is the first step to breaking free. So here&#x27;s my question for you. What if that one emotion you&#x27;ve been avoiding isn&#x27;t your enemy? What if it&#x27;s the doorway to your liberation? Because here&#x27;s what almost nobody realizes. There&#x27;s usually one core emotion at the root of everything else.</p>
<p>One feeling that&#x27;s been running the show. one memorized state [music] that&#x27;s been collapsing your quantum field into the same reality over and over again. And it&#x27;s hidden in plain sight. It might be unworthiness, the deep-seated [music] belief that you&#x27;re not enough, that you don&#x27;t deserve love, that you have to earn your place in the world. It might be fear, the constant anticipation of loss, rejection, or failure that keeps you playing small and staying safe.</p>
<p>It might be shame, the feeling that something about you is fundamentally wrong. And if people really saw you, they&#x27;d [music] turn away. Whatever it is for you, and trust me, you know what it is, even if you&#x27;ve never named it. That emotion has become the lens through which you experience everything. And it&#x27;s time [music] to look directly at it.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s go there. Let&#x27;s talk about what this actually feels like in your body, in your life, in your daily experience. Because I want you to know, really know that you&#x27;re not alone in this. What you&#x27;re experiencing isn&#x27;t unique to you. [music] It&#x27;s the human condition.</p>
<p>When we&#x27;re operating from survival, there are specific [music] emotions that almost all of us cycle through when we&#x27;re stuck in this pattern. Dr. Joe Despensza identified 21 core survival emotions, and I&#x27;m going to list them. Now, as I do, I want you to notice which ones land in your body, which ones make you shift in your seat. Which ones you recognize as old friends, unwanted but [music] familiar, insecurity, hatred, judgment, victimization, worry, guilt, depression, shame, anxiety, regret, [music] suffering, frustration, fear, greed, sadness, disgust, envy, anger, [music] resentment, unworthiness, lack.</p>
<p>Now, here&#x27;s what&#x27;s important to understand. And these emotions aren&#x27;t separate. They&#x27;re all connected neurologically and chemically. They feed each other. One [music] leads to another in a cascade.</p>
<p>You might start with anger. That anger leads to frustration. Frustration [music] leads to hatred. Hatred leads to judgment. Judgment leads to envy.</p>
<p>Envy leads to insecurity. And insecurity makes you competitive, selfish, defensive. See how it works? [music] It&#x27;s a chain reaction. And somewhere in that chain is your core emotion. the one you memorized first, usually in childhood, usually in response to something that happened that your young nervous system couldn&#x27;t process.</p>
<p>Maybe it was [music] a parent who was emotionally unavailable. Maybe it was criticism that told you you weren&#x27;t good enough. Maybe it was trauma, loss, or abandonment. Whatever it was, your body created a survival response. And that response became your default setting.</p>
<p>[music] Now, let me ask you this. How do you think when you feel this way? Because here&#x27;s the thing about memorized emotions. They don&#x27;t just affect how you feel. They shape how you think. [music] Your state of mind is directly linked to your emotional state.</p>
<p>If your core emotion is fear, then your thinking becomes [music] anxious, overwhelmed, desperate. You scan for threats. You catastrophize. You anticipate the worst. If your core emotion is anger, your [music] thinking becomes controlling, judgmental, self-important.</p>
<p>[music] You need to be right. You build walls. You push people away before they can hurt you. If your core emotion is suffering, your thinking becomes victimized, [music] depressed, resentful. You tell yourself stories about how life is unfair, [music] how you never get a break, how everyone else has it easier.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s [music] what most people don&#x27;t realize. Your thoughts create more of the same emotions. So, you get stuck in a loop. You think the [music] thought, the thought creates the feeling. The feeling reinforces the thought.</p>
<p>The thought strengthens the feeling [music] round and round. A cycle that runs automatically below your conscious awareness. And all of [music] this, every thought, every feeling, every reaction is happening in your body. This is the [music] part that people miss. Your body isn&#x27;t just experiencing the emotion.</p>
<p>Your body is becoming the emotion. Let me explain [music] what I mean. When you think a thought, your brain releases neuropeptides, chemical messengers that travel through your bloodstream [music] and bind to receptor sites on your cells. Every thought has a chemical [music] signature, and every cell in your body has receptor sites waiting to receive those chemicals. When you think the same thoughts over and over, your cells [music] develop more receptor sites for those specific chemicals.</p>
<p>They start to crave them. They literally become [music] addicted to the chemicals of your familiar emotions. So even when you consciously want to change, [music] your body is pulling you back to the familiar feeling. Because your cells are hungry for the chemicals they&#x27;ve become [music] addicted to. This is why it&#x27;s so hard to break the pattern.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not just dealing with a mental habit. [music] You&#x27;re dealing with a biological addiction. Now, I want you to close your eyes for a moment. If you&#x27;re in a [music] place where you can do this safely, just close your eyes. Think about your core emotion.</p>
<p>The one you know is there. The one you&#x27;ve been carrying. And I want you to notice what happens in your body when you think about it. Do you feel hot, irritated, [music] jittery, weak, flushed, deflated, tight? Where is the feeling located? [music] Is it in your chest, your throat, your stomach, your shoulders? Notice how your breathing changes. Notice any pain, any tension, any numbness.</p>
<p>[music] Don&#x27;t try to change it. Don&#x27;t try to make it go away. Just observe it. Be with it. Allow yourself to feel the emotion as energy moving through your body.</p>
<p>Because here&#x27;s [music] the truth that no one wants to hear. Almost everything you have done in your life has been to run from this feeling. Think about that for a moment. The career [music] you chose, the relationships you stayed in or left, the distractions, [music] the substances, the behaviors, the constant doing, achieving, performing, proving, all of it [music] designed to avoid this one feeling. And because of that feeling, you created an ideal for the world instead of an ideal for [music] yourself.</p>
<p>You built your life around making sure other people approved, accepted, or validated you. Because if [music] they did, maybe you could finally escape the feeling. But it never [music] works because the feeling is inside you and no amount of external validation can fill an internal void. So you keep [music] running and the quantum field keeps delivering more experiences that match your internal state. Not the one you want, the one you are.</p>
<p>This is the gap, the split between who you present to the world and who you really feel like inside. And living in that gap is exhausting. But here&#x27;s what I want you to hear. This isn&#x27;t your fault. You didn&#x27;t choose to memorize this emotion.</p>
<p>Your nervous system did what it needed to do to survive. And now, now you have a choice. Because here&#x27;s what no one tells you about the observer effect. The moment you observe something, you change it. In quantum [music] physics, this is a proven phenomenon.</p>
<p>A particle exists in a state of probability, a wave of potential until it&#x27;s observed. The act of observation collapses the wave into a definite state. Your memorized emotion is the same. As long as it&#x27;s unconscious, it controls you. It runs automatically.</p>
<p>It collapses your quantum field into [music] the same reality over and over. But the moment you observe it consciously. The moment you name it, feel it, acknowledge it without running from it, you&#x27;re no longer identified with it, you&#x27;re not the emotion. You&#x27;re the observer of the emotion. And that changes everything because now you have a choice.</p>
<p>[music] Now you have power. Not the power to suppress it or fight it. The power to transmute it. So here&#x27;s the radical shift I&#x27;m inviting you into. You have to know what the problem is before you can change it.</p>
<p>You have to name it in order to have power over it. This is what I call recognition and it&#x27;s the first step in breaking free from your memorized emotional patterns. Recognition is about becoming [music] conscious of what was once unconscious. It&#x27;s about using your frontal lobe, that uniquely human part of your brain, to observe yourself objectively. [music] Most people go through life being the old self.</p>
<p>They react automatically. They think the same [music] thoughts. They feel the same feelings. They make the same choices. and they wonder why nothing [music] changes.</p>
<p>But when you engage your frontal lobe, you shift from being the old self to being [music] the observer of the old self. And that&#x27;s a quantum leap in consciousness. So let me give you the practical [music] process, the one that I&#x27;ve used with thousands of people, the one that works if you&#x27;re willing to be honest with yourself. You&#x27;re going to use what I call frontal [music] lobe questions. These are questions designed to activate your metacognitive abilities, your ability to think [music] about your thinking, to observe your being.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the first question. What [music] kind of person am I? Not what you want to be, not what you tell yourself you are. What kind of person are you really? Are you angry, controlling, insecure, judgmental, lazy, impatient, [music] defensive? Don&#x27;t sugarcoat it. Don&#x27;t justify it. Just name it.</p>
<p>Second question, what type of person do I present to the world? This is the mask, the persona, the version of yourself you&#x27;ve constructed [music] to be acceptable, likable, successful, the performance. Who do people think you are? And here&#x27;s the question that cuts deep. Is there a gap between those two? Between who you are inside and who you show the world? [music] If so, that gap is where your energy leaks. That gap is where your power is drained because it takes enormous energy to maintain a false self. Third question, what emotion do I struggle with every single day? You know what [music] it is.</p>
<p>You felt it this morning. You&#x27;ll feel it again tonight. It&#x27;s the emotional weather system that follows you everywhere. Is it anxiety, unworthiness, fear, [music] resentment, guilt? Name it. Write it down if you need to, but name it.</p>
<p>Fourth question. How do I think when I feel this [music] way? Because remember your emotional state drives your mental state. Your feelings create your thoughts. When you feel your core emotion, what thoughts automatically follow? Do you think victim thoughts? Why does this always happen to me? Do you think [music] controlling thoughts? I have to manage everything or it will fall apart. Do you think catastrophic [music] thoughts? This is going to end badly.</p>
<p>I know it. Pay attention to the pattern because this is your subconscious program running. Fifth question, what physical [music] sensations do I associate with this emotion? Because your body is the unconscious mind and the body never lies. Close your eyes again. Think about your core emotion and scan your body.</p>
<p>Do you feel tightness in [music] your chest, a knot in your stomach, tension in your jaw, heaviness in your shoulders? Notice where the emotion lives in your body because that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s been stored. [music] That&#x27;s where the past is living in your present. And here&#x27;s the profound part. Your body has been fooled into believing that your external world is staying the same because you keep generating the same [music] internal chemistry. So your body is literally preparing you for the same past over and over again.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s conditioning you [music] to expect more of what you&#x27;ve already experienced. This is why you can&#x27;t just think your way into a new future because your body is anchored in your past. But when you become aware of these sensations, [music] when you observe them without judgment, without trying to change them, you begin to separate your consciousness from your conditioning. You begin to wake up from the dream. Now, here&#x27;s where this gets really powerful.</p>
<p>There are people who&#x27;ve had near-death experiences [music] who come back and talk about something called a life review. They describe seeing their entire life, every moment, every choice, every interaction from an objective perspective. They see who they really were, not who they told themselves they were, who they actually were in their actions, [music] thoughts, and words. And they see how their thoughts and emotions affected everyone around them. The ripple effects of their energy.</p>
<p>And almost universally, they [music] come back wanting to live differently. Not because they were judged, but because they finally [music] saw themselves clearly. Well, you don&#x27;t have to die to have a life review. You can do one right now. Every day through meditation.</p>
<p>And this is the practice [music] I&#x27;m inviting you into. You sit down. You close your eyes. You go into an induction, a process of getting beyond your analytical mind and dropping into [music] a deeper state of awareness. And then you ask yourself these questions.</p>
<p>You observe your emotional patterns. You feel the sensations in your body. You notice [music] your thoughts. You become the witness of your own consciousness. And in that witnessing, something remarkable happens.</p>
<p>The emotion begins to lose its grip on you. Not because you&#x27;re suppressing it, but because you&#x27;re no longer identified with it. You&#x27;re not the anxiety. You&#x27;re the one observing the anxiety. You&#x27;re not the unworthiness.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re the one noticing the unworthiness. You&#x27;re not the anger. You&#x27;re the awareness that contains the anger. And that awareness, [music] that observer, is who you really are. It&#x27;s the quantum you, the consciousness that exists beyond your conditioning, beyond your past, beyond your memorized emotions.</p>
<p>This is the observer effect in action. When you observe your emotional patterns [music] from a place of awareness, you collapse the quantum wave of possibility into a new reality, not the reality of your [music] past, the reality of your presence. Now, let me be clear. This isn&#x27;t a one-time thing. This is a practice, a daily practice, because your body [music] has been chemically conditioned for years, maybe decades.</p>
<p>Those neural pathways [music] are strong. Those cellular receptor sites are hungry for their familiar chemicals. So you have [music] to practice taming the body, teaching it that it no longer has to run on autopilot, that it no longer has to be the mind. And the way you do [music] that is through observation, through feeling the emotion without reacting to it. Through being present with what is instead [music] of running from it.</p>
<p>Some days it will be easy. Some days it will be hard. Some days you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re getting somewhere. Some days you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re back at square one. But here&#x27;s what you need [music] to understand.</p>
<p>Every time you observe the emotion instead of being controlled by it, you&#x27;re weakening the old neural pathway. You&#x27;re pruning the old circuitry. And every time you choose a different [music] response, a different thought, a different action. You&#x27;re creating a new neural pathway. You&#x27;re wiring in a new possibility.</p>
<p>This is neuroplasticity. The brain&#x27;s ability to change itself. And the quantum field responds to that change because you&#x27;re no longer broadcasting the same signal. You&#x27;re no longer collapsing the wave [music] of possibility into the same reality. You&#x27;re becoming someone new, not in the future, right now in this moment of observation.</p>
<p>And the quantum field meets you there. So here&#x27;s what I want you to do tonight or tomorrow morning or whenever you can create 15 minutes of uninterrupted [music] time. Sit down, close your eyes, and do this recognition practice. Start by asking yourself, &quot;What emotion have I been running from my entire life?&quot; Don&#x27;t overthink it. The answer [music] will come.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s been there all along, waiting to be seen. Once you&#x27;ve named it, feel it. Allow yourself to experience it fully in your body. Notice where it lives. Notice how it moves.</p>
<p>Notice the sensations without trying to [music] change them. Then ask, &quot;How do I think when I feel this way? What state of mind does this emotion create? Notice the thoughts. Notice the patterns. [music] But don&#x27;t judge them. Just observe them.</p>
<p>And then ask, who have I become because of this emotion? What kind of person have I been? What kind [music] of reality have I created? Be honest. Brutally honest. This isn&#x27;t about shame. This is about clarity. Because only when you are truly conscious and aware do you begin to wake up from the dream.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s the promise [music] I&#x27;m making to you. If you do this practice, if you show up and observe yourself with this level of honesty, your life [music] will begin to change. Not because you&#x27;re trying to force a change, but because you&#x27;re no longer unconsciously perpetuating the same [music] pattern. The observer effect doesn&#x27;t lie. The moment you observe something at the quantum level, it transforms.</p>
<p>And you are [music] not exempt from that law. Your consciousness is the most powerful force in your [music] reality. Not your circumstances, not your past, not the people around you, your awareness, your observation, your presence. That&#x27;s [music] what collapses the quantum field. That&#x27;s what determines which version of reality you experience.</p>
<p>So the question is, are you ready to observe? Are you ready to see yourself clearly perhaps for the first time in your life? Because once you do, there&#x27;s no going back to unconsciousness. Let me tell you what happens when you truly commit to this. At first, it&#x27;s uncomfortable. You&#x27;re going to feel the emotion you&#x27;ve been running from. You&#x27;re going to want to distract yourself, [music] to numb out, to go back to the familiar patterns.</p>
<p>Your body is going to resist. It&#x27;s going to crave the old chemicals. It&#x27;s going to send you signals that something is wrong, that you need to go [music] back to the old ways. But if you stay with it, if you keep observing, keep feeling, keep being present, something shifts. [music] The emotion begins to move.</p>
<p>It begins to transform. Not because you&#x27;re fighting it, but because you&#x27;re finally allowing it to [music] be seen. And in that transformation, you discover something profound. The emotion was never the problem. The running was the problem.</p>
<p>The emotion was just energy, a sensation in your body, a chemical cascade [music] in your nervous system. It wasn&#x27;t who you are. It was something you were experiencing. And when you stop running from it, [music] it loses its power over you. You become free, not free from the emotion, free from the identification with it.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s when the quantum field begins to [music] respond differently because you&#x27;re no longer broadcasting the same signal. You&#x27;re no longer collapsing reality into the same pattern. You&#x27;re present. You&#x27;re aware. You&#x27;re conscious.</p>
<p>[music] And consciousness is the force that creates new realities. This is what it means [music] to be reborn in the same life. Not to start over, not to become someone else, but to wake [music] up to who you&#x27;ve always been beneath the conditioning. The quantum you, the observer, the consciousness that was there before you memorized the [music] emotion, the consciousness that will be there after you&#x27;ve released it. That&#x27;s who you really are.</p>
<p>Not the fear, not the unworthiness, not the [music] shame or anger or anxiety. You are the awareness that contains all of it. The space in which all emotions arise and dissolve. And when you [music] live from that awareness, everything changes. Your relationships change.</p>
<p>Your health changes. Your energy changes. Your reality changes. Not through force, not through trying, but through alignment, through coherence between your consciousness and the quantum field. Through the observer effect in action.</p>
<p>This is [music] the power you&#x27;ve had all along. The power to observe, the power to witness, the power to choose which version of reality you collapse into form. And it&#x27;s been waiting for you [music] to claim it. So here&#x27;s my question. The question that matters more than any other.</p>
<p>Are you ready to [music] stop running? Are you ready to observe? Are you ready to become the quantum you? So here&#x27;s what we covered today. You have one core emotion that&#x27;s been controlling your reality. [music] an emotion you memorized probably in childhood that became your default state. That emotion broadcasts a signal into the quantum field and the quantum field responds by delivering a reality that matches that signal. You&#x27;ve been unconsciously creating more of your past disguised as your future.</p>
<p>But the observer effect changes everything. The moment you observe the emotion consciously without judgment, without running, you&#x27;re no longer controlled by it. you activate your frontal lobe. You become the observer of the old self [music] instead of being the old self. And in that observation, the quantum wave collapses into a new possibility.</p>
<p>Not the reality [music] of your past, the reality of your presence. Now, here&#x27;s the thing. This is video number 15 in the quantum U series. And recognition, what we covered today is just the beginning. Because once you&#x27;ve observed the emotion, once you&#x27;ve seen it clearly, there&#x27;s a next step.</p>
<p>A step that most people never take. A step that requires more courage than observation alone. In [music] video 16, I&#x27;m going to show you what happens after you recognize what you [music] have to do with that recognition to actually break free. It involves something most people are terrified of. And it&#x27;s the only way to close the gap between who you are and who you&#x27;ve been pretending [music] to be.</p>
<p>So, if you felt something shift in you today, if something clicked, if something [music] recognized itself, hit that subscribe button. Drop one word in the comments that captures what you&#x27;re feeling right now, your energy, [music] your state, and I&#x27;ll see you in number 16 because we&#x27;re about to go somewhere [music] most people won&#x27;t. Ready?</p>
