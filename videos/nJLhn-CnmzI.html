            <p>all right hello everyone and uh welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas I do educational videos and uh we are working on getting through this talk given by Dewey B Larson back in 1986 and Larson is uh the guy who originated the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory of everything that he came up with uh in the middle part of the 20th century he died back in 1990 and uh hardly anybody&#x27;s ever heard of this but I think it&#x27;s a a very interesting theory that uh has a lot of ramifications and the theory has been uh moved forward by Dr Bruce paret uh Dr kvk nehru and uh doc Dr Gopi Krishna as well as others um and uh they made some great progress with it so uh the basic idea is that the res uh the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it&#x27;s made out of motion motion uh is the relationship between space and time and space and time are identical except that they are reciprocals of each other and so any type of fraction that you have between space and time space over time or space squared over time or space over time squared or anything up to uh well could be even Beyond three dimensions uh is a scientific phenomena so some type of unit a scientific unit so for example time to the third power over space to the third power is matter uh anyway uh time and space are reciprocals of each other and they are identical to each other in terms of their quality qualities the quality that we know best about space is that it&#x27;s three-dimensional or multi-dimensional and uh so time is also multi-dimensional what we know about time is that it&#x27;s always progressing things are always getting later and later and later and so too space has that property things are always getting farther and farther and farther apart okay so that&#x27;s the uh one minute version of that uh reciprocal system just enough so that we can uh get in now what we&#x27;re looking at is Larson starts with that original beginning and then he builds his theoretical Universe step by step from that initial postulate and he has another postulate but that&#x27;s in dispute and I I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s uh necessary to get into it uh quite yet um and uh so we are uh way down the track though on this this is the 11th video that I&#x27;ve done on this so we&#x27;re all the way up to number 107 statement number 107. so uh you&#x27;re kind of jumping in right in the middle here and uh you might want to go back and start uh this this talk is called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so you might want to go to to letter A on that I think this is uh letter K or possibly even l I think it is L okay so um number 107 from statement 33 the scalar motion that constitutes the atom of matter is three-dimensional and inward the one-dimensional outward movement of electrons or units of space through matter or through a gravitational field therefore neutralizes a portion of the gravitational motion and leaves a scalar motion remnant in two dimensions the physical effects of this residual motion are known as electromagnetism as would be expected they are similar to those of gravitation except for the differences introduced by the two-dimensionality now just recall that Larson makes a distinction between spatial dimensions and scalar dimensions uh one scalar Dimension now just remember scalar motion is a motion that has no s no direction or all directions no preferred Direction and um but it just has magnitude so it&#x27;s kind of like any type of unit that doesn&#x27;t have any uh any type of measurement that doesn&#x27;t have a unit it&#x27;s just one two three four five no Direction um and a scalar a a three-dimensional system you know with uh x y and uh Z coordinates they are can all be uh fit into one scalar Dimension so one scalar Dimension spans three vectorial dimensions um and so whenever he&#x27;s talking about his his form of motion uh the universe is made out of motion is a scalar motion um and a lot of his measurements are in scalar motion or scalar Dimensions um the other two dimensions of a scalar system are not things that we cannot uh directly perceive we only really can perceive one scalar Dimension at a time uh in its full resolution otherwise we&#x27;re really just looking at kind of um it&#x27;s the surface of things okay number 108 the residual Motion in two Dimensions is perpendicular to the dimension of the motion that is neutralized that is perpendicular to the electric current this provides the explanation of the unique direction of electromagnetism that has heretofore been an unexplained anomaly number 109 as the residue of the inward gravitational motion the electromagnetic motion is necessarily inward however the orientation of the scalar Direction inward with respect to the spatial reference system is reversed when the direction of the current is reversed conductors carrying current in the same direction move toward each other while conductors carrying currents in opposite directions move away from each other okay number 110. there is no two-dimensional analog of the electric current because the material system contains no negative magnetic particle but the equivalent of a magnetic current a two-dimensional motion through matter can be produced by various means such as mechanical movement of a conductor in a magnetic field this two-dimensional motion neutralizes a portion of the three-dimensional motion of the matter and leaves a one-dimensional residue if a conductor is appropriately located this residue manifests itself as electric current the process of producing a current by this means is known as electromagnetic induction number 111 as noted in statement one Motion in general is measured in terms of speed when represented in a spatial reference system the motion acquires a Direction and speed becomes velocity the introduction of Direction or directions does not affect the dimensional relations all of the previous dimensional conclusions stated in terms of speed are equally valid in terms of velocity number 112 from number 111 and uh not 96. the product of mass and velocity momentum has the dimensions of T time to the second power over space to the second power this quantity was formally called quantity of motion an expression which more clearly indicates its nature it is actually a measure of the total amount of the mass which consists of n mass units each having the quantity of motion measured by the velocity the time rate of change of velocity is acceleration the time rate of change of the product of mass and velocity the quantity of motion is force thus force is by definition the same kind of a property of motion as acceleration we would appropriately call it quantity of acceleration number 113. since force is by definition from the previous a property of motion it follows that a force cannot be autonomous so-called the so-called the fundamental forces of nature are necessarily properties of fundamental motions number 114 the same considerations apply to the electrostatic force which from number 112 must also be the force aspect of an electric motion for an understanding of this motion we return to the question as to the types of scalar motion that can exist in the theoretical universe thus far we have encountered three General types unidirectional motion vibrational motion which is linear motion with A continuous change from inward to outward and vice versa and then scalar Mo scalar rotation which is a uniform rotationally distributed scalar motion obviously there is a fourth possibility a scalar rotational vibration that is a rotationally distributed scalar motion with A continuous change from inward to outward and vice versa a rotational simple harmonic motion okay now paret has a footnote here and he says a common mechanical analogy would be the back and forth rotational motion of an agitator in a washing machine so you you know though the agitator of the washing machine goes like this and that&#x27;s a a rotational um that is a rotational vibration okay uh it calls it a rotational simple harmonic motion number 115 an independent rotational vibration cannot exist as there would be nothing to confine the progression to the rotational path and it would revert to the more probable linear status but a unit of rotational vibration can be combined with a unit of rotation the inward phase of the rotational vibration is coincident with the corresponding rotation and has no physical effect the outward phase is an effective rotationally distributed scalar motion opposing the atomic rotation in the dimension or dimensions of the rotational vibration it thus conforms to the requirement for stability as expressed in statement 58.</p>
<p>number 116 from statement 57 the rotational vibration must not be of the same general nature as the rotation to which it is applied the effect of this restriction is to Bar three-dimensional rotational vibration the added rotational vibrations may be either due uh maybe either one dimensional or two-dimensional number 117 we identify a rotational vibration as a charge and a one-dimensional charge as an electric charge inability to identify any motion connected with the electric charge is one of the reasons why the theorists have accepted the force exerted by the charge as fundamental even though this conflicts with the definition of force as noted in statement 112. the explanation as indicated above is that the charge itself is the motion okay so he&#x27;s making a distinction between the elect electron uh which is an electric current and uh the electric charge the electric current is uncharged so the electric current is a uh the electron is a rotating unit of space um the electric charge is a reversal of that rotation of of space from a number 118 from 115 the charge must have a carrier an atom or particle independent charges do not exist okay so that charge that road that vibration cannot come up come into being by itself it has to have a carrier an electron or it could be an atom uh number 119 from 117 [Music] the space-time dimensions of the electric charge are T over s that is the charge is dimensionally equivalent to energy this equivalence is demonstrated by the fact that charge and kinetic energy are inter-convertible number 120. the charge electric charges may be either positive or negative but the total displacement is smaller and therefore more probable if the displacement of the charge is opposite to that of the rotation consequently a positive rotation takes a negative charge and vice versa but in current practice the rotational combinations are designed as positive or electropositive if they normally take positive electric charges and negative or electronegative if they normally take negative charges it is not feasible to try to change this firmly established practice so the unit usual terminology will be applied in the statements that follow with the understanding that the significance at pertaining to the terms positive and negative elsewhere in this outline is reversed in application to electric charge you know just making his uh terminology even more cumbersome than it was before but again you know it&#x27;s like he&#x27;s correcting a scientific uh Legacy science mistake and he&#x27;s paying for it because uh you know they calculated it wrong and he&#x27;s correcting it but you know there is this inertia that&#x27;s involved in you know establishing practices historical inertia that he can&#x27;t really overcome because everybody has used this terminology in the past he can&#x27;t just snap his fingers and switch it he could but he doesn&#x27;t he doesn&#x27;t try to number 121 from 26 statement 26 we find that in order to represent a scalar Motion in a fixed spatial reference system it is necessary to identify a reference point number 122 the motion of a positive charge a high speed rotational vibration is outward from a negative reference point toward more positive values including the positive reference point that of a negative charge a low speed rotational vibration is outward from a positive reference point toward more negative values including the negative reference points the reference system cannot distinguish between a positive between positive and negative reference points this is another of the deficiencies of the conventional spatial reference system number 123 from 122 positive uh charges move outward from the same reference point and therefore outward from each other two negative charges do likewise but a positive charge more moves outward from a negative reference point toward all positive reference points including the reference point of the negative charge and therefore toward the negative charge thus like charges repel each other while unlike charges attract okay we&#x27;re gonna stop there uh now again just don&#x27;t get discouraged by this it&#x27;s a pretty abstract and hard to follow and you gotta listen to Larson in super super slow motion before you can get him because he&#x27;s always putting in these parenthetical phrases and these uh prepositional phrases and um you know uh using words that are you know fairly difficult to follow as well uh but he&#x27;s just building up this system so this is a reference for you for later more or less I&#x27;m just going through so they can get a sense of how he thinks and how the development goes um we will be applying this to more concrete things in more specific ways coming up very soon okay so just uh just stick with it uh we want I want to get this all kind of in the bank so that you can refer to it at a later time so that when you&#x27;re asked you know when you&#x27;re saying where did Larson get that from you can actually go back to this and find where he got it from okay uh have a great day thanks for tuning in uh we&#x27;ll see you next time</p>
