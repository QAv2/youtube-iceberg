            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>60 seconds in counting we are go for Apollo 7 at this [Music] time andle as our second speaker for today is a Private Pilot a military Aerospace historian has lectured across the USA on the unique subject of mystery aircraft and classified propulsion systems buried deep within the military industrial complex he has presented evidence that supports the claim that elements within the military industrial complex specifically than the American Aerospace industry have designed built and test uh you know saucer shaped aircraft which mimic the form fit and function of what we perceive to be extr terrest UFOs so the question is does this technology now exist actually to take you know ET home well he&#x27;s done a lot to dig out information about the black budget off black budget special access programs that have laid uh the financial groundwork for those who have been developing secret Aerospace Mega projects uh this material is really uh interesting it&#x27;s uh you know kind of fill some of the missing gaps between what we know exists and what is speculation as well so this will really kind of help to solidify the subject as well that we we heard so much about FR Mark so it&#x27;s going to be really interesting he&#x27;s going to talk to us about the man-made versus ET issue so give a big round of applause for Michael shrat well good morning everyone I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to join all of you today what I&#x27;d like to do for you today is give you a brief overview of some of the classified aircraft that have been developed within the military industrial complex I want to talk about some aircraft that might be uh considered UFOs but may actually be man-made craft I want to discuss the black budget and then I also want to talk about some crash retrievals but really I want to have some fun with this presentation and we&#x27;ve got uh quite a bit of material to go over here I thought I&#x27;d begin with this uh interesting entry that was put into a book published in 2007 called the Reagan Diaries and here on page 334 this is Reagan speaking to it says lunch with five top science scientists it was fascinating space truly is the Last Frontier and some of the developments there in astronomy are like science fiction except they are real I learned that our shuttle capacity is such that we could orbit 300 people so I want to ask all of you today uh the shuttle only holds eight astronauts how does Reagan get this 300 people going into this shuttle system how how could this possibly be true then we&#x27;ve got some interesting statements made by Neil Armstrong it says uh this is July 20th 1994 at the White House there are great ideas undiscovered breakthroughs available to those that can REM remove one of truth&#x27;s protective layers there are places to go beyond belief Neil Armstrong 25th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing then we have Above Top Secret by Timothy good interesting statement here a transaction between a scientist of an MI6 individual and Neil Armstrong and this is Page 186 so I&#x27;m not just making this up uh Professor what really happened there on Apollo 11 Armstrong it was incredible of course we&#x27;d always known there was a possibility the fact is we were warned off there was never any question then of a space station or a moon City Professor how do you mean warned off Armstrong I can&#x27;t go into details except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and Technology boy they were big and menacing no there is no question of a space station so again this is Page 186 of Timothy Goods Above Top Secret so it turns out ladies and gentlemen that there are Point effect two space programs one in the form of a public relations smoke screen organization known as NASA the other one is called US Air Force space command also known as solar Warden and that comes from Paul Viet and the hington post 127 2012 here&#x27;s another question we need to look at too did the Rockwell star raker go operational is this what Ronald Reagan was talking about when he talked about the capability of orbiting 300 people obviously he wasn&#x27;t talking about putting those people into the shuttle cargo bay this was a proposal for 1979 single stage to orbit high lift Wing orbital launch vehicle 310t length 360 foot wingspan capacity of 200,000 pounds for the cargo and it was powered by 10 high bypass turbofan ramjets three liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen rocket engine so this could have been something that we as the general public were never clued in on but Reagan may have actually been given a briefing couple of quick announcements here uh the visual aids used in this presentation are computer generated forensic composite illustrations based off the actual UFO case files and military defense trade Publications Source material was qos naikap the AO archives Aviation week space technology James defense weekly invisible residence by Ivan T Sanderson which I highly recommend uh Uninvited Guest by Richard Hall magic Eyes Only UFO news Clipper service Wendell Stevens archives and the Leonard Springfield collection I kind of want to start right here and you might be thinking why in the world am I showing a picture of a Dorito here what does a Dorito have to do with a secret space program well back in 1984 this configuration was the most classified configuration that you&#x27;d ever want to see and point of fact this configuration was so classified Engineers working on the program associated with that configuration were forbidden to bring in a bag of Doritos out of fear that the configuration of this aircraft might be revealed that&#x27;s how secret this was this is the a12 Avenger 2 also known as the flying Dorito this was a joint McDonald Douglas General Dynamics program designed to replace the A6 Intruder as an all-weather attack aircraft procurement funding for this was 4.78 billion of your tax dollars went into a full scale research development contract for General Dynamics McDonald Douglas McDonald Douglas was brought under the the contract because of their experience with naval carrier-based aircraft that&#x27;s why McDonald Douglas was actually brought on now we were going to buy the Navy was going to buy 620 of these aircraft again this is what we&#x27;ve got to show for it here with with this Dorito here but this is the fullscale mockup that was made and this is essentially all we have to show for our 4.8 78 billion because it was on January the 7th of 1991 that Dick Cheney cancelled this program and cost us all $5 billion so I&#x27;ve been looking for a couple of about a decade now trying to track where our money disappeared to since we as taxpayers have funded this program we own these type programs we have every right to question authority and this is something that we really should keep in mind uh different Publications Los Angeles Times New York Times Washington Post they talk about $7 billion jet for Navy is cancelled citing cost overruns chaining kills Navy attack planes stealth jet for Navy is cancelled so I want to give you something to hang your head on here according to C-SPAN and I&#x27;ve got all the dates here so you can verify this for yourself they said quote over 3 million pounds of material have been cut on the a12 Avenger 2 program that was July 24th 1991 so you&#x27;ve got all this material all these Hardware all these tooling type things where where did all this go what do we have to show for our $5 billion um since loed Martin bought the General Dynamics aeronautical division your point of contact is a Woman by the name of Karen Hagar she&#x27;s the public affairs person and by all means please ask her where your $5 billion portion went I&#x27;ve included her email address her telephone number is 81776 3485 okay please ask her where your $5 billion went I mean it&#x27;s unbelievable uh it&#x27;s so highly secretive that I said come on guys can&#x27;t you guys even give me a washer from the program just give me a washer they wouldn&#x27;t even do that so I commissioned our good friend Mark mandish I said Mark these guys are going to play it like this would you please put together an illustration depicting what the a 12 Avenger 2 would look like on the assembly line and this is what we came up with and it&#x27;s a really good drawing by Mark McAn and so ladies and gentlemen I believe that this is probably the closest we&#x27;re ever going to see regarding the a12 Avenger 2 program however there may actually be more to this story than meets the eye there there might be something secret going on with the a12 Avenger 2 this is a letter written to a colleague of Mine by the name of Lee Graham this is from Arman Victorian date uh December 30th 19 1992 I want to bring your attention to this bottom section down here and he says uh section A Navy&#x27;s a12 prototype was completed and flown by locked completed and flown by locked okay two other sources have confirmed from General Dynamics that right around 1990 locked basically picked up the pieces of the a12 Avenger 2 program from General d Dynamics they&#x27;ve confirmed that there were in point of fact two assembly lines running at General Dynamics one was the Navy version which was canceled by Dick Cheney January 7th 1991 and there there was a secret Air Force version of this aircraft now when Ben Rich who is the head of the skunkworks between 1975 and 1991 when his team at the skunkworks took a look at this uh edge here uh they they noticed that a single straight edge was very bad for radar cross-section so Lockheed skunkworks Engineers designed a notch into the trailing Edge they also clip the wing tips to reduce the radar cross-section and that is the ax12 Air Force version of the a12 Avenger 2 which is completely black now back in 2000 a one-third scale up version of this aircraft which is used as a stealthy troop insertion aircraft uh was actually built by locked it&#x27;s between the f117 in size and the B so there&#x27;s this interim aircraft between those two aircraft that aircraft was cited over Amarillo Texas by multiple eyewitnesses and then in last uh last month I was with Steve Douglas who&#x27;s another aircraft researcher and we were at this exhibit here this is a very interesting hanger complex that they have on the other side of the tarmac and he brought his radio with him and he overheard the term little Area 51 at Canon air force base so it appears that there&#x27;s a small version of Area 51 at Canon air force base now we&#x27;ve got the Boeing Phantom Works bird of prey this was Declassified October 2002 under the Bush Administration $67 million procurement funding from Boeing on this particular program it made 38 test flights between 1992 and 1999 basically this aircraft was the first aircraft to use low observable um stealth technology for One Piece solid construction and it also had 3D virtual reality design and assembly processes involved with this aircraft procurement funding again is $67 million it was 47 ft long 23t wingspan important point to keep in mind on the Boeing Phantom Works bird of prey is that when you have a proprietary program it ex exempt from foyer requests so you can&#x27;t get anything else on the boing Phantom Works bird of prey this is one of those proprietary programs another drawing done by Mark mandish uh talking about the Sneaky Pete also the have blue prototype and then Boeing Fantom Works bird of prey Detroit Free Press secret Ledger hides military projects Pentagon black budget has tripled under Reagan administration so I want to quote my sources Detroit Free Press February 8th 1987 they had a very interesting graphic illustration which I&#x27;ve uh redone an AutoCAD here to give you an idea now if if you look at the procurement funding on these programs in 1981 the black budget grew by just over half a billion dollar now by 1988 that figure Rose to uh nearly 9.12 two billion so you can see there&#x27;s this exponential growth in the black budget federal spending by cigor procurement spending for agriculture was 26 billion Transportation was 28 billion but the pentagon&#x27;s black budget for fiscal year 1988 was 35 billion so there&#x27;s spending more on black budget programs than they are for education so is there a mismanagement of funding here do we have Bridges breaking do we have schools falling apart that money could be put into other programs total uh spending for procurement funding of the Air Force for 88 was 51 of which 19.1 was in the black budget okay now in this article they have two quotes that I think are interesting to to keep in mind here says Thomas family a pentagon missile expert with security clearances high enough to know about some black programs said the military has three basic reasons for having them one you&#x27;re doing something that should genuinely be secret two you&#x27;re doing something so damn stupid you don&#x27;t want anyone to know about it and three you want to rip open the money bag and get out of shovel because there&#x27;s no accountability so when you talk about black programs there is no public scrutiny no congressional oversight second one one here it says in a Black Project people don&#x27;t worry about money said a 31 Old yearold systems engineer who has worked on four black projects at the space system division of Lockheed missiles and space company in Sunnyvale California here&#x27;s what he said if you need money you got it if you screw up and you need more you got it said the engineer who asked that his name not be published you&#x27;re just pouring money into this thing until you get it right there&#x27;s no incentive to do it right the first time who&#x27;s going to question it so you can see the mentality of what we&#x27;re really up against here Aviation week space technology December 24th 1990 summed it up really well eight years of the Reagan administration were very good to the black world really sums it up nicely now how do you get this information where do you go to track the black budget it turns out every January 27th of every year a public relations program in the form of this this document which is available to the general public is called rdt programs R1 that stands for research development test and evaluation programs R1 you can pick this up at the Library of Congress and in this document they list programs that are within the Department of Defense over here you&#x27;ve got the line items and then you&#x27;ve got how much was spent but when it comes to classified programs they don&#x27;t tell you anything about it for instance senior year operations forest green operations no technical details no information regarding how much procurement funding was done on the program so what you end up doing here is you take the total amount and you subtract the known and what you&#x27;re left with are the unknowns or the black programs now how can we verify this defense daily July 14th 1988 also had their procurement funding and you can see here theme Castle no information just a code name senior citizen we you&#x27;ve got Omega it&#x27;s a black program we don&#x27;t know the details so again you take the total amount subtract the knowns what you&#x27;re left with are the unknowns this is an interesting uh publication 1970 JW Fulbright he really brought it home says the greatest threat to American National Security is the American Military establishment and the No Holds Barred type of logic it uses to justify its zillion dollar existence these programs have gone Rogue uh no congressional oversight couple of quick code names I want to bring to your attention here this comes from John Andrews who&#x27;s the senior project design engineer at testers model Corporation in San Diego he was tracking these black budget fundings and he wrote this foyer request to the dod and a couple of things we want to look at here Rosetta classified program housekeeping what&#x27;s housekeeping redb bird and then the two final ones four and five rainbow and something called Snowbird which we really want to get get into groom for secrecy Groom Lake toxic burning alleged Las Vegas Review Journal March 20th 1992 they really did a good job on this article basically what they&#x27;re saying is during the stealth program vintage 1981 to right around 1988 uh according to this article Burbank Lockheed skunkworks division was basically trying to get rid of all their toxic chemicals solvents resins and they put these in 55 gallon drums and twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays an 18-wheeler tractor trailer truck hired by a foreign company called NDB would drive all the way from Burbank skunkworks to Area 51 they follow this Perimeter Road they&#x27;d go past the residential area and then these 300t long burning pits dump these 55g drums into these burn pits and throw jet fuel on it and ignite the whole thing so I ask all of you is it any wonder that our area 51 Engineers are dying of cancer when you&#x27;ve got this ACD toxic smoke burning and flowing right over the residential area so I&#x27;m zooming in to Area 51 that&#x27;s the world&#x27;s largest Runway you could put one space shuttle landing on either side and still have 5,000 ft between the two aircraft and then I&#x27;m going to zoom into this area The Hanger surface area on the bottom here are what&#x27;s known as the red hat hangers for the Soviet Mig before that they were the a12 hangers just in back of the red hat hangers are what&#x27;s known as the U2 spy pling hangers that&#x27;s where final assembly was made for the U2 we&#x27;ve also got the residential area and then up here on the corner uh we&#x27;ve got the area where it shows the burn pits right in here so that&#x27;s what we want to focus in on here&#x27;s a 1968 photo of Area 51 showing the residential area these are the burn pits here so the question I want to ask all of you this is something we really should answer who is the idiot within the Air Force Department of Defense EPA that allowed them to do this right next to the residential I mean talk about lack of planning it&#x27;s just horrible they had a sidebar article within this Las Vegas Review Journal um that I really want to talk about here and it&#x27;s talking about the bar that was at Area 51 called Sam&#x27;s Place and this is what they talked about from one who is actually there extravagant living on a secret base so these are this is your tax dollars at work here a favorite Watering Hole was building 170 The Hanger size centerpiece of the bases recreational complex it is listed in one base directory as Sam&#x27;s Place a bar named after a Central Intelligence Agency official who once ran the base set a source involved in base operations during the 1980s Sam&#x27;s Place was a dark fully carpeted nightclub with large padded chairs and a bar ring with stools that rival the largest ones in Las Vegas The Source said the club had four pool tables dart boards and a big screen the recreational complex was complete with an eight-lane bowling Alia ell a heated indoor pool four racket ball courts a basketball gymnasium with a wooden floor tennis courts saunas and a snack bar at one time a golf course and lighted softball field existed as well supplies for the base were flown in from Hill Air Force Base in Utah aboard c130s sometimes people would chip in and buy big ice boxes of shrimp that were flown specially to the base from Florida in 20 to 30 big styrofoam coolers the planes stopped only long enough to offload the shrimp and then the final one here is some Colonels he said had very extravagant tastes including one who had grapefruits flown in from Israel at $25 a piece and requested deliveries of can tuna from South America that he it cost the government $26 per can so here&#x27;s your tax dollars at work with these big guys over here at Area 51 now they drawing by Mark Mish this is the McDonald Douglas manay 18 of these aircraft were built by Desert Storm they flew along with the f-117&#x27;s as a digital real-time intelligence gathering aircraft specifically photographic type aircraft it was also carrier capable it had a u interesting arresting hook and also a launch Contraption in the front for carrier-based operations very low radar cross-section aircraft and had twin caned vertical stabilizers that you can see here orders of magnitude lower RCS than the F-117 something called The Flying artichoke has been cited at Air Force plant 42 in hullman Air Force Base it has a crew of two pilot and a weapon system operator it has a very interesting tail Arrangement here with a porest a section that absorbs sound it&#x27;s capable of carrying six 2,000lb laser guided weapons so this is the flying artichoke now right around 1989 we started hearing these reports of something called the Aurora that&#x27;s definitely not the code name that&#x27;s actually used but that&#x27;s a catchall phrase really and on 1989 August 1989 Chris Gibson who was an offshore oil drilling platform operator he noticed a KC 135 flying over head that was flanked on the left side by two f-111s that had their wings extended and then directly behind the KC 135 there was a black triangle that had a 75° swep wi configuration that he could not identify and he was a member of the royal Naval observers Corps so if there&#x27;s anyone who couldn&#x27;t identify it who should have it would have been Chris Gibson because he&#x27;s very well versed in identifying aircraft in less than 1 second so we&#x27;ve reversed the image to show you what this actually could have looked like this remains today even today a classified program now if you look in the Boeing archives you&#x27;ll see this Motif this Legacy of development regarding 75 degre swep wi configurations for Hypersonic aircraft this may be a configuration that Chris Gibson actually got to see another drawing by Mark Mish interesting backstory on this aircraft when the colonel who first laid eyes on this particular configuration when he saw it for the first time he said that that was an elegant lady and so that name has stuck with this particular aircraft it is a two-stage to orbit space plane consisting of a mother ship and a parasitic aircraft that&#x27;s launched from the spine of the uh Mother Ship each of these wing tips is estimated to be about 16 ft tall it has a pilot co- pilot and something called a launch control officer he is the liazon between the mother ship and the parasitic aircraft and he sits aft in the last seat here it has two canards that can retract for high-speed flight it&#x27;s powered by either four combined cycle pulse detonation wave engines or as Mark mentioned the scram Jets 2 now what evidence do we have for this Aviation week space technology August 24th 1992 talks about eyewitnesses who saw this in the analou valley Lancaster Palmdale area so we&#x27;ve got some good side settings there this is the model called the sr75 penetrator that was done by John Andrews who again is the senior project design engineer testers model Corporation San Diego and we believe that the mothership configuration here is about 85% correct this parasitic aircraft that he has here has the correct Wing Suite angle but the configuration of where the engines are we don&#x27;t believe that that is correct this is a photograph of John Andrews so if there was any question about this gentleman&#x27;s Integrity uh it was never challenged because he was a gentleman uh until he passed away in 1999 his his verocity was never questioned so you can hang your hat basically on information provided by John Andrews a good uh scale model of what this looked like interesting thing people who have seen this said that the configuration and color of this aircraft was kind of a light white or gray configuration with a black Leading Edge and then the air intakes on this aircraft were diagonally cut at 45° and they said that people who saw this particular aircraft take off said that the air intakes were so large that you could drive a Volkswagen right into these so we&#x27;re talking large air intakes John mcneel put this together shows you the two-stage orbit space plane system again you can see the air intakes in this location and these large winglets uh this is a top view looking down shows you the scale of this aircraft here and then we believe that this aircraft is not called Aurora but in point of fact either senior year or senior smart that&#x27;s believed to be the code name for this particular aircraft now one other propulsion system that may be associated with the mothership of this aircraft is something that Mark T Constantine who was the aerojet tech systems division manager this is 1985 he get a gave a lecture here is one propulsion system that may be associated with that two-staged orbit space plane system here&#x27;s what he said the air turbo Ramjet or ATR is a combined cycle air breathing engine which we commonly refer to as cold turbine technology by combining the rocket engine and air breathing engine Technologies the ATR can achieve static thrust to weight capability in excess of that available from our most advanced turbojet and turbo fan engines the continues to produce thrust as mock number increases which enables acceleration to more optimal Cruise altitudes of 90 to 120,000 ft at Mach 5 so this is exactly the kind of speed range we&#x27;re talking about here but then there&#x27;s a question that comes up this strange anomaly that comes up this took place uh May 30th 1991 John Andrews who we mentioned before put in a telephone call to Ben rich and this is this is something that Ben Rich volunteered he wasn&#x27;t uh prodded by John this is something that Ben Rich came up with this was published in the 1993 ofne World Almanac so I want to give you the the source of where this came from the Spanish translation to English here is if I were to use the word Snowbird I would be in jail if I were to use the word Snowbird I would be in jail what is Ben Rich talking about what could be so secret so classified so un acknowledged that Ben Rich would get thrown in jail for even using the word snowberg what what what&#x27;s actually going on here it turns out in 1982 pratton Whitney who has a long history with locked because they developed the j58 that powered the SR71 they developed something called a Magneto hydrodynamic drive also known as an mhd couple of quick points utilizes electric and magnetic fields so this is not an engine ladies and gentlemen this is a drive system there&#x27;s no moving Parts it probably is the propulsion system for snowbird developed by pratton Whitney in 1982 speeds above mach 20 so that&#x27;s way out there in the speed regime Hypersonic Aurora what could this thing actually look like that uses the mhd drive something that James&#x27;s defense weekly December 12th 1992 had a really good article about the configuration again we see this 75° swep wi configuration so there&#x27;s this Motif that&#x27;s going through the the 1960s all the way up to the 1992 article here now Wizard of Oz Somewhere Over the Rainbow is this you know is there more going on here somewhere over the rainbow this is the song that Dorothy sang in this uh very popular movie is there something more going on here or is this just just a song here uh let me bring your attention to this letter uh from Robert Jameson to John Andrews February 28th 1994 here&#x27;s what he said it says he was a military monitor on 367.8 I overheard a conversation between a KC 135 tanker at 47,000 ft calling rainbow one that they were on station approxim approximately 7 minutes later rainbow one called quote unquote big boy for a fill up the tanker returned the call but said if you would turn on your lights it would be easier to find you rainbow w told the tanker to go to secure Channel G end of transmission so if the Aurora is launched over the top of the mother ship called rainbow somewhere in the ocean west of Hawaii is it is that where we get the term Somewhere Over the Rainbow if rainbow is the mother ship aircraft it&#x27;s a possibility Aviation week space technology November 11th 1991 we&#x27;re not going to read the whole thing but just the ver the top here here two unusually loud Sonic booms heard along the west coast from San Diego to North Las Vegas uh Angeles may have been producing uh highest flying classified aircraft returning test ranges in Nevada so they were talking about air Quakes not uh earthquakes but air Quakes so I actually contacted Caltech and I said can you give me your data for October 31st 1991 and this is the actual result they call it an air a Sonic at the exact same time this aircraft flew over it triggered all these uh instruments from celtech and the GE geologic Institute so ladies and gentlemen I believe this might be one of the most conclusive pieces of evidence for a quote unquote Aurora aircraft now the most important thing to keep in mind here is that these earthquakes these aircraft flying over H Catalina Island going over downtown Los Angeles always occurred on a Thursday morning a Thursday morning at like 6:58 a.m. 7:05 a.m. repeatedly on the last Thursday of the month in during 1991 and 1992 always on a Thursday why a Thursday because in the black World Area 51 Air Force plant 42 test flights are done on a Thursday because Monday Tuesday and Wednesday are used for prep Thursday is the test flight Friday is the debrief Saturday and Sunday there&#x27;s no one there and so that&#x27;s why Thursdays are very apparent in the black world this is an article our paper that was received by Lee Graham from the United States Department of interior it says Dear Mr Graham in response to your letter of 31992 please in find en close a copy of data recorded by a seismograph at candalina island for the sonic boom of January 30th 1992 so if you look at what&#x27;s done here here&#x27;s what he says last Thursday of the month Thursday October 31st 1991 and remember these tick marks are one minute apart so boom right this is your Aurora returning from an overseas Mission now about a minute later another boom right here so you might think oh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that Mother Ship right returning along with it the Mother Ship isn&#x27;t even back yet it doesn&#x27;t even fly the same pattern so this might be either an F16 or an F-15 flying as a safety Chase aircraft so it&#x27;s not the Mother Ship flying with the parasitic aircraft again Thursday June 27th 1991 last Thursday of the month boom about a minute later another boom so this is again seismic instrument readouts uh Thursday November 21st 1991 we have another boom here and then it says Bingo it must be an American bird they didn&#x27;t want to work on Thanksgiving Day so this time it was n on the last Thursday of the month it was the week prior so you know ladies and gentlemen this is one of ours there&#x27;s no doubt about it there&#x27;s no doubt about it Catalina Island Thursday January 30th 1992 7:17 a.m. another boom and then let about a minute and a half later number two so you can see you&#x27;ve got this parasitic aircraft flying over Catalina Island wakes everybody up in the morning in Los Angeles and then a Chase plane follows it here&#x27;s the track returning to Area 51 going over Catalina Island Los Angeles waking everybody up then heading uh north of Edwards Air Force Base going into tonopa test range and then into Area 51 so I want to give you kind of a brief cross-section of what their flight pattern looks like again Catalina Island Thursday April 16th 1992 6:58 a.m. always on a Thursday always on a Thursday Mount Wilson April 16th 1992 Thursday 7:02 another one it just goes on and on the evidence is overwhelming okay so here is a typical Snowbird Mission profile flight path this came from Jim goodle I I asked Jim I said Jim what&#x27;s the flight path of these aircraft and so he said this is Jim Goodall&#x27;s interpretation of what these aircraft may be flying he believes ladies and gentlemen that this is a nuclear proliferation monitoring aircraft because at the fall of the Soviet Union they they had to figure out a way to monitor all this fishable material that was kind of loose within the former Soviet Union so he believes it&#x27;s a nuclear proliferation monitoring aircraft so what you do here is you start at Area 51 you take off from Area 51 you take up a a magnetic heading of 310° you fly over Alaska at this point here you&#x27;re still with the Mother Ship you&#x27;re at about 30,000 ft of Mach 1.7 it&#x27;s at this point you launch from the Mother Ship you pour the coals to it right here you go over Russia you make a 90° leftand turn you start heading south you&#x27;re over turkey you&#x27;re over uh Israel right in this area right here once you get down here you make another turn now you pour the coals to it right here you&#x27;re heading back at this point you&#x27;re over here now you&#x27;re near Hawaii you&#x27;re starting to make a left-hand turn now we&#x27;re heading into California that&#x27;s where we go over Catalina Island this is where we wake everybody up at 7:02 a.m.</p>
<p>right back to Area 51 so that may be the mission profile of what these aircraft are actually following now this is something I got from the John Andrews collection which I was forced fortunate enough to acquire this is 14th August 1981 letter to Ben Rich former head of locki skark Works between 1975 and 1991 it says Ben Rich your crew responsible for two very strange Birds leaving at dawn just at first light from George Air Force Base one white one gray said to be very very lipice like good acceleration good climb don&#x27;t loiter around George and not seen for the rest of the day so joh uh John included a sketch of something that may have departed George Air Force Base August 1981 now turns out that there&#x27;s some very good information from Bill Scott who&#x27;s the former Rocky Mountain editor of Aviation week space technology this is March 6 2006 talking about a program called Black Star it appears ladies and gentlemen that there are two versions of this technology there&#x27;s one built by locki that&#x27;s launched from the spine of a mother ship and then Boeing has one called Black Star which is air drop from the belly of The Craft so that&#x27;s the different kind of uh configurations that are used this is a Steve Douglas illustration with an xp70 type configuration uh is there any proof to back this up this is a US patent February 7th 1982 uh 1989 by Boeing and they include a parasitic aircraft that actually fits up inside an indented section under the belly of the mothership so we&#x27;ve got patents to back this up we&#x27;ve got eyewitnesses reported within that article that also talk about this as well then we come across this particular letter to Pete Ames from John Andrews it says uh 22nd February 1994 the place kadina Air Force Base the time the weekend of 12 13th February 1994 it says emergency call from Mann aircraft to expedite recovery at cadina Air Force Base coming from North tracked speed at Mack 4.2 diversions for other aircraft in area aircraft recovered and quickly placed in Secure hanger red three lockdown declared by base other Pilots Landing kept and slept in ready quarters uh one white gray C5 launched from hman Air Force Base 3-day locked on at base so something made an emergency landing at kadina Air Force Base um and this is the configuration per the bill Scott article they also mentioned that there was a solid rocket booster that is loaded into the AF end of this vehicle so we&#x27;re definitely talking at least Mach 4.2 for this particular configuration The Truth is Out Air Force is monthly March 1997 sep member 26 1994 was the date of of an event that has never been talked about in American Press I had to get an overseas publication for this and the the details regarding this case was a top secret aircraft believed to been a classified variant of the yf-23 by Northrup had a crew of two on the application of military power somehow the landing gear collapsed right up here on the nose gear and this thing kind of ground to a Al the pilots were fine they had to tow it back to a hanger it stayed in that hanger for two nights and it had a tarp over the midsection the F section and the forward section was still exposed so people could see what this thing actually looked like on the third day a C5 Galaxy was flown into RAF bosam down this is where this took place and as they were departing air traffic controllers and monitoring uh public on the ground overheard the transmission that this C5 Galaxy was going to kpmd so anyone who knows what kpmd is that&#x27;s Palmdale that&#x27;s the identifier for Palmdale they were flying back to Palmdale this is the configuration of what we actually believe this aircraft looks like was a a variant of the yf-23 two- seat aircraft with two inward caned vertical stabilizers other than the yf-23 version that has two outward caned vertical St izers so we get to the B2 stealth bomber $2.3 billion per aircraft more than its own weight and gold that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about here 21 of these aircraft were built tremendous amount of money I call this the 10 billion do photograph because we&#x27;ve got four b2s at the Pico Rivera plant 2.3 that&#x27;s about10 billion right there and it&#x27;s 172t wingspan the question is and Mark talked about this before is there more going on to the B2 than meets the eye Aviation week space technology March 9th 1992 had a very interesting tic article from uh people who worked at Northrup who were very upset that the technology associated with the B2 program was not being trickled down to the public industry they talk about how the B2 electrically charges the Leading Edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross signature that&#x27;s what you see in this diagram right here and then negatively charges the exhaust gases to reduce the infrared signature this is the same type electrogravitic technology that ttwn and brown had originally proposed in the 1930s so this technology might date back a lot earlier than we originally thought uh the proof about this comes from electrogravitic systems by Thomas Fone so you can back that up and then I recently came across some information from a General Dynamics engineer who had previously worked in the black world and basically he said you know I&#x27;m done with the black world I&#x27;ve been there I&#x27;m through with it I&#x27;m now a biker so he left the black World Behind and he said that according to this particular General Dynamics engineer who worked on the B2 program uh he said that for every three b2s that are built for every uh three turns out that there&#x27;s seven anti-gravity versions of this B2 that are actually built according to did this General Dynamics engineer now September 1967 a naval combat Veteran by the name of Jack picket who was really good friends with he&#x27;s no longer with us he claims that during September 1967 he was a publisher of the NCO Club newspaper and they were going down a Perimeter Road at McDale Air Force Base which is in Tampa and they got to this area right here which is called the base scrapyard and when he got there he looked over the chain link fence and saw four four of the most incredible aircraft that he had ever seen in his entire life just an incredible configuration they measured 20 40 70 the largest one was 116 ft in diameter they all had the same configuration but different sizes they had tricycle landing gear there was an air intake on both sides of the Pilot&#x27;s compartment and then this very huge vertical tail that tapered back to the Pilot&#x27;s compartment had control surfaces along the circumference of the disc so this is September 1967 this is the long range bomber version of this aircraft according to Jack he was told that this was used as a long-range reconnaissance bomber during the Cold War and so he asked a lot of questions from the general uh who was over at mcdill Air Force Base and inquired about putting together an article for the base publication newsletter he was given an authorization to write that article which was titled flying saucers for real and then he he was given 16 officially stamped black and white glossy photographs of these aircraft parked on the Time Rack in Flight uh also with f86 jet fighter interceptors f84 jet fighter interceptors as well and had a tremendous amount of information regarding this program all ready to go into this article but then it turns out uh just before going to press with this particular article there was an overflight of a VTO vertical takeoff and Landing version of this aircraft which rolls down the runway this is a horizontal takeoff bird that particular aircraft suffered a propulsion system malfunction dropped down to Treetop level flew directly over Miami at high speed and woke everyone up the next morning it was all over the newspapers all over the news and so he brought that newspaper into the General&#x27;s office the next morning and say General I think we&#x27;ve got a problem here because I&#x27;m getting ready to to declassify and release this jet powered disc that you have at the scrapyard but then you&#x27;re denying the existence of this aircraft that flew over downtown Miami what what do you guys want to do about it so that General contacted off at Air Force Base contacted the Secretary of Defense and the secretary of the Air Force and according to the Secretary of the Air Force it would be in the better interest of the Air Force to delay publication and that&#x27;s where this story died back in 1967 so we were within our hours of getting the truth about one of our classified programs brought into the public domain within hours but then it was cancelled so now we want to move on to Flying triangles they&#x27;ve been seen all around the world since at least 1974 without a doubt uh we&#x27;ve got November 29th 1989 Belgium was seen January 5th 2000 Southern Illinois Area 51 Groom Lake they&#x27;ve been seen almost in every country by every possible cult culture so it&#x27;s a worldwide phenomenon we&#x27;ve got a case uh over here of a red one with this exhaust Port here we&#x27;ve got a case in Detroit we&#x27;ve got Belgium cases so a brief cross-section of these aircraft have been seen all around the world the primary features of these triangles they usually have a white light on the corner of each of the triangle some of these are between 200 and 300 ft across this midsection is generally about 20 ft across and then there&#x27;s always this interesting structural work on the bottom and probably a red or amber light in the center of the bottom section of the craft that&#x27;s kind of the overall view of what we see here March 31th 1999 Kirby of very significant sighting and if anyone in this room is a skeptic I just invite you to look at this gentleman&#x27;s testimony Colin Sanders you can Google him he gave a really nice 20-minute lecture regarding this particular sighting a very honest gentleman I I totally believe his case he was with his family driving home at around 9:50 p.m. after dinner when they came across this particular craft he saw the AFT end of it first it was tilted up at about 15° angle of attack on the left- hand side and then he said the bottom of this craft tipped up but it tipped up from the back end and he said he used the term that it looked like it was submerged underwater that&#x27;s how this actually moved underwater here&#x27;s the view of what it looked like from the AF end he said it was totally silent and then he said it had these very interesting raised box sections on the top of the craft the exterior pictorial version of the exterior of The Craft looked like a flowing liquid mercury it was almost alive and he said that it was his belief that these extruded sections here were part of a a docking mechanism with a larger craft so as this thing flew over he could see the bottom of it it also had these raised sections as well and then as this thing flew over you can see a forward section right here it disappeared from view but then way off into the far Horizon there was a much larger ship that had a red light on one side and a green light on the other side and he said that this particular aircraft appeared to be trying to dock with that larger craft so that may be the reason for these interesting raay sections here this this thing was uh approximately 50 ft across in conjunction with a Cessna 172 that has a 27t wingspan here&#x27;s Colin Sanders here here&#x27;s his UFO model and when I saw that UFO model I said wow I want to have one of those so I took his technical blueprint and then in AutoCAD I put together this schematic drawing here which is a cardboard stock model and uh I&#x27;ve produced this for each and every one of you so you can have a black and white version of this so you can build your own UFO at home which is an actual authenticated case uh this is what the model looks like right here this is what the bottom of it looks like right here and so I have one for each one of you now November 22nd 1985 15 miles Northwest of Madison Wisconsin very interesting case because of this interesting tube section on the bottom of this aircraft but we don&#x27;t only have the illustration we&#x27;ve got the eyewitness testimony it says the underside of the craft resembled quote the back of a refrigerator like a collection of condensation pipes that ran back and forth so keep that in mind kind of as we as we proceed here I asked the question is that what you would expect to see on the bottom of an alien spacecraft I mean really I thought you aliens were a 100 million Lighty years ahead of us and yet you&#x27;re flying around in these vehicles that look like the back of a refrigerator someone&#x27;s lying to you folks someone&#x27;s lying to you I I can tell you assure you that January 5th 2000 this was the first mass sighting of triangular aircraft after the year 2000 seen by at least four police officers seen by a miniature golf owner who said that this craft looked like a two-story Ranch fly right over his golf course uh very well documented case another case for Skeptics that uh might be sitting on the fence please examine the January 5th 2000 uh over flight of Southern Illinois by these triangular shaped crafts some of these had a red and green section in the F portion always these white lights at each of the corners and then an Amber or red light below the belly of The Craft newspaper clipping service picked this up it was seen over Dupo County multiple counties within Southern Illinois not too far from St Louis May 23rd 2001 Allen Park Michigan this gentleman saw this craft fly over his tax actually uh blocked out the stars as it flew over April 3rd through the 5th 1975 Lumberton North Carolina this craft was seen by multiple police officers it had an interesting cutout Notch section in the back end of the triangle red lights along the leading section here and then a high intensity white light that was shining down a beam onto the ground seen by multiple eyewitnesses this is the Cutaway drawing here and shows you kind of an isometric View this is the row of the lights on the Leading Edge of the craft again this cutout section is another Motif that we see throughout these different craft now this is a very interesting case that I got from David maror who is the Premier researcher and triangular UFOs we don&#x27;t have a date but we know the location was Oregon according to this eyewitness this particular craft was about 180 ft across large triangular shaped craft with these rounded Corners in this a here according to the eyewitness this particular craft parked itself hovered about 20 ft above the river the little putting River in Oregon and then it started dropping down this 8 to 10 foot diameter metallic tube went right into the to the river started sucking up this water and then he noticed that right next to this tube water was coming out too so the water&#x27;s going up water&#x27;s coming down and then he said there was a blue beam of light that exited off the left end of The Craft and then he said something very interesting there was lights pulsating across the circumference here and then they what looked like these three landing gear legs that popped out of the bottom but these weren&#x27;t landing gear legs he called them overflow valves because water was shooting out of these overflow Valves and then there were three orange orbs that popped out of the bottom of this thing about 2 minutes later after this had completed whatever it was doing he said it sounded like a washer machine these orbs merged back into the craft this craft slowly took off and then when it reached about an altitude of about 1,000 ft this thing took off like a spark off a grinding wheel so that was that particular almost a Uso case enormous turban blade UFO January 24th 1997 Puerto Rico also came from the David maror files basically a primary eyewitness saw this particular craft hover near his location now if you look at the size he estimates between 500 and 800 ft across we&#x27;re talking a massive ship here uh multicolored lights along the leading portion of the vehicle then he said it had this section on the bottom that had these rotating turbine blades but it was his impression that these turbine blades were rotating far too slow to support this vehicle so there&#x27;s no way it could be the primary s of propulsion according to the eyewitness he also said that there was a strange being that had a pear-shaped head on a transparent Copa or Dome section of this aircraft 2 minutes after observing this aircraft a black 4x4 vehicle pulled up right next to him a security agent got out of that vehicle started questioning about this particular craft no sooner did that security agent start interrogating the primary eyewitness two identical craft to this first one popped out of the clouds and started following this original craft this craft at that point started introducing a h it was kind of like a smoky blue glow around this vehicle and then this thing took off the other ones were trying to chase after but they couldn&#x27;t get it so this is January 1st 1997 another case from the David maror files I put together an illustration here August 25th 1990 barnesley England primary eyewitness and her his wife were returning from a Fleetwood Mac concert at night when out of nowhere coming this strange triangular shaped craft that he estimated between 100 and 200t across emerged from a dark Misty Cloud directly below the cloud blank and he said he saw it long enough 30 seconds long enough to get some really good details it had one light on each terminating point of the triangle one light on the bottom here that was white and then he said it had this recess section on the belly of The Craft and in that recess section he could see what looked like Cross Beam and girder construction very structural construction on this bottom Point here and then there was these series of white lit back lit windows that had these humanoid figures and it was his impression that this was a man-made vehicle that&#x27;s what his impression was uh that these were actually man-made Vehicles this particular individual on the right seem to be either pointing or waving back to the primary eyewitness now North Wales triangle cited over the m56 motorway on June 1st 1997 flew across the motorway at about 100 miles hour startled people on the motorway and then zipped off at a high rate of speed that&#x27;s all the details we have on that particular case so now we move on to the everpresent ubiquitous everyone&#x27;s favorite triangle the tr3b anything having to do with the tr3b has to be credited to Edgar fuche I want to give him credit for Edgar fuche also want mentioned that Edgar fuche has no firsthand knowledge specifically dealing with this aircraft so he didn&#x27;t work on this program but he claims that he knew people at Area 51 who did I want to make that perfectly clear also want to state that uh I don&#x27;t want to divert any way shape or form or percentage from his original testimony I want to give you his straight answers to a number of questions that I P uh brought to his attention this is his response so I don&#x27;t want to divert from anything that he had to say technical specifications regarding the tr3b according to Edgar fuset there are two different sizes of the tr3b approximately 250 ft per side for the Prototype version 600 feet per side for the operational model the overall mission of the tr3b is logistic support and transportation for the secret space command if used on a planet or moon or large Outpost you would have a ready-made transportable space space station the tr3b carries a crew of four in the Prototype version the flight control system used on the tr3b kiss this of variable vectored intake and thrusters on the edges and advanced multim mold propulsion engines on each tip of the triangle two nuclear reactors serve as the power source for the magnetic field disruptor also known as an MFD the magnetic field disruptor utilizes a Mercury liquid plasma which is pressurized to 2 50,000 atmospheres and rotated at 50,000 RPM resulting in a distortion or warpage of the localized gravity field by up to 89% therefore G forces are also reduced by 89% so in effect what he&#x27;s saying is that this MFD interacts with how gravity interacts with mass so you could be doing 1,000 M an hour make a left hand turn 90° and you&#x27;d only feel 11% of the G&#x27;s that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s talking about he&#x27;s not talking about anti-gravity per se but a A disruption of the grav uh gravity field materials used to construct the tr3b consisted of Advanced composits metam Materials and titanium three prototype tr3 bills uh bees were built cost per tr3b in $1 19990 was 1 billion per craft sightings uh by Edgar fuche is 1975 high in the atmosphere at night at Edwards Z Force Base 1976 within the southern part of the Nellis range and the late 1970s groom Air Base that&#x27;s the one we want to focus on tr3b utilizes telescopic landing gear legs with teads operated by the national reconnaissance office the National Security Agency and the CIA the craft exhibits a very low electromagnetic humming noise during operation one light was located on each tip of the triangle the craft incorporates electrochromic pan used for daytime stealth operation so when you talk about electrochromic panels what they&#x27;re essentially doing is they&#x27;re electronically transferring the image what&#x27;s in back of the craft to the forward portion essentially allowing it to blend in with the background basically becoming bringing it uh invisible uh vents on the side of the craft serve as variable vectored intake exhaust depending upon which direction the vehicle is going so this is a drawing put together showing you these vents right here this is the crew compartment and then the magnetic field disruptor right here so then I asked Edgar fuche Edgar instead of you just talking about the at the tr3b can you give me an illustration of your sighting this is what he came up with this is Edgar fuch&#x27;s illustration of his sighting this would have been 1979 at uh Area 51 this is avionics building number nine the a uh AVX laboratory at Area 51 again this is the longest runway right here and he was going from the avionics laboratory to a blue blackedout windowed bus Air Force bus so was about a 100 foot walk and as he&#x27;s walking to this bus they had him wear these blacked out welders goggles so he couldn&#x27;t see anything around Edgar fuche is a pretty big guy so when he looked down there was a crack between the top portion of his forehead and the top portion of these welders goggles and he could see a crack of light he looked outside that light and saw the tr3b about 500 ft away this is according to Edgar fuche so if you look at this Runway diagram you look at the buildings remember these are the red hat hangers right here we&#x27;re talking at least 500 feet and so that&#x27;s how close he got to perhaps one of our classified flying triangles again flying triangles UFOs the estimate of the situation David Marler this is by Richard Dolan press our good friend Richard Dolan anyone who&#x27;s skeptic regarding flying triangles please look into this book and you&#x27;ll see that there&#x27;s quite a a good historical background I want to make a statement here if you thought that all triangular UFO cases were the direct result of classified military aircraft that would be incorrect now how do we know this sightings of these triangular shaped craft date back to 1890 Kelly Johnson who formed the Skunk Works he wasn&#x27;t even born yet so it couldn&#x27;t be a lockade bird right it it has to be something else now when we talk about these liquid mercury plasma engines on the magnetic field disruptor associated with the tr3b that&#x27;s the same thing we hear about on these viman aircraft that were 2,000 years before the time of Christ in the ancient Indian Sans cript text they talk about liquid mercury plasma engines with these vion type crafts so this technology might date back much earlier than we thought is that the same technology that&#x27;s used here in the pburg Acorn that was recovered in Pennsylvania December 9th 1965 is that the same technology used on the Nazi Bell 1945 they had the same dimensions the same configuration the same bumper around the bottom circumference the same strange hieroglyphic writing along the bottom both the uh Bell here it also had these insulating bricks that were associated with test flights uh also Joseph P frell talked about how plants within the vicinity of test flights of the Bell turned to goo within 2 hours scientists who were near the Bell during operation died immediately uh he also talks about how there&#x27;s two counterrotating drums that have a radioactive uh isotope of mercury called serium 525 that may be some of the propulsion systems associated with the Bell now by May of 1945 Adolf Hitler had 62 of the scientists associated with the Bell program murdered uh these were brought up in the trials after Nazi criminal war crimes were brought to public and so they talked about these 62 scientists being uh murdered associated with the Bell program my question is did SS General Hans camer who was involved in the Bell product program did he cut a deal with the Americans did he have his record expunged of any crimes in exchange for technology that&#x27;s something we definitely want to keep in mind cash Landrum incident Huffman Texas December 29th 1980 this by any other means Skeptics cannot debunk this case this case had stood this test of time for so long now and I invite anyone who&#x27;s questioning the validity of some of these cases please look at this case you&#x27;ll find that this has remained Rock Solid three eyewitnesses Betty cash Vicky Landrum Kobe land we&#x27;re driving around U 9:00 p.m. Hoffman Texas when they noticed a bright light approaching their vehicle it got brighter and brighter and brighter it got so bright they became horrified they were scared it was traumatic she even mentioned that that she thought this is the second coming she thought this is the end of the world and what she saw was this twin double ice cream cone craft that was about 90 ft tall had a series of light colored blue Port holes we don&#x27;t know if these were Port holes but they were circular outlets in this location here it was about 30 ft above the pavement here she slammed on her brakes Betty cash got out of the car started going to the forward portion of the car to see this thing as a better look and then it had these strange Flames that were blue in color that every time the flame came out this craft would bob up and then once the flame stopped this craft would start slowly settling down again this happened for about 2 minutes at that point Betty cash was just about ready to get back into the vehicle now keep in mind this is December 29th 1980 it was cold outside just about the time she was getting ready to put her hand on that car door she put her hand there and it burned the skin right off her hand the whole exterior of the vehicle was becoming very hot once they she got back inside the car they had to turn the air conditioning on it was so hot within this vehicle this craft also emitted a beeping noise as this engine produced this thrust and then about a minute after this departed there were no less than 23 double rotor chinuk c47s chasing after this craft with two uh1 Hues in Chase with high-intensity light beams like they were shepherding this vehicle like they had four knowledge of this particular flight now it&#x27;s my personal opinion that this was one of ours ladies and gentlemen now how can I back this up if you look at this hearing before the subcommittee on research and development joint committee on atomic energy this is the aircraft nuclear propulsion program July 23rd 1959 once you start looking at this document you start finding out how much the United States Air Force the US Navy the atomic energy commission spent on procurement funding on the NEPA program the nuclear energy for propulsion of aircraft combined they spent almost a billion dollars by 1960 this is a schematic drawing of an atomic liquid fueled rocket with subcritical reactor so at least by 1960 they had the procurement funding the engineering know how to perhaps build such a craft here again aircraft nuclear propulsion system different cutaways within that diagram to back this up so again we have a legacy of Technology paperwork to back this up I believe that this was a test flight of our one of our original NEPA programs it was an early Nea program there was a whole breach within that subcritical reactor that started spewing out fishable material and that&#x27;s how Betty cash and Vicky landram died from the effects of radiation poisoning regarding this so it&#x27;s important that we hold our government liable for essentially the murder of these two individuals this case was actually never heard of in court it was thrown out of court due to lack of evidence now significant statements by Ben Rich regarding Advanced Aerospace propulsion Systems and Technology Ben rich very interesting gentleman uh met with his son Michael Rich at the ran corporation uh he was very nice didn&#x27;t reveal any secrets but important to keep in mind Ben took over the reign of the Skunk Works from Kelly Johnson in Burbank back in 1975 he headed the skunk works until 1991 and I want to really bring out some points here that I think are are very important regarding what Ben rich said about the technologies that we&#x27;re talking about in this conference now according to Ben rich and you can verify all these they&#x27;ve been authentic at I invite you to check this out yourself uh we did the f104 the C130 the U2 SR71 f17 and many other programs that I can&#x27;t talk about we are still working very hard I just can&#x27;t tell you what we&#x27;re doing right Patterson Air Force based slide presentation September 26 1992 again the Air Force has just given us a contract to take ET back home we already have the means to travel Among the Stars but these Technologies are locked up in Black projects it would take an act of God to get them out to benefit Humanity there is an error in the equations what equations is he talking about there is an error in the equations and we have figured it out and now know how to travel to the stars and it won&#x27;t take a lifetime to do it so what equations is Ben Rich talking about here it is time to end all secrecy on this as it no longer poses a national security threat and make the technology available for use in the private sector it says we have some new things we are not stagnating what we are doing is updating ourselves without advertising there are some new programs and certain things some of them 20 or 30 years old that are still breakthroughs and appropriate to keep quiet about other people don&#x27;t have them yet and then it says here September 7th 1988 aiaa lecture so you can back that up too I wish I could tell you about the projects we are currently working on they are both fascinating and fantastic they call for Technologies once only dreamed of by science fiction writers according to Ben Rich what could what could that mean now these are this is a new group that maybe some of you haven&#x27;t heard of before I got this from the Huntington Library from the papers of Ben R Rich the Skunk Works is always busy it&#x27;s fortunate that we are able to turn out a breakthrough about every 10 years the airplanes that uh we are building today you won&#x27;t hear about for another 10 years anything you can think of we can do and if not maybe we have already done it I cannot talk to you about anything we are doing today or have been doing probably for at least 5 or 10 years if you saw the configurations I have on my desk today they&#x27;re mindboggling because if you can think of it we can design it at the skunkworks so that&#x27;s according to Ben rich and ladies and gentlemen I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get a better uh group of comments regarding Advanced Aerospace propulsion systems now John Andrews who we mentioned before was very good friends with Ben Rich these two gentlemen over decades played this word Scrabble game where Ben Rich would kind of submit little hints to John and that&#x27;s how he was able to design the f19 stealth model that turned out to be the highest selling plastic aircraft model of all history over one million units were sold so John Andrews wrote a letter in 1986 to Ben Rich regarding his personal opinion of UFOs even of Crash retrievals this is his original reply letter to John Andrews dated July 8th 1986 it says Dear John in response to your letter of July 1st I am a believer and so is Kelly Johnson so he&#x27;s talking about UFOs extraterrestrial technology so if it&#x27;s good enough for Kelly Johnson to me it&#x27;s good enough for me now here is the reply that John Andrew sent back to Ben Rich he wanted to get some clarification so Mr Ben Rich Lockheed Advanced Aeronautics company this is Burbank California 10 July 1986 dear Ben a short note to clarify your interesting response regarding being a quote unquote believer contained in your 8th July 1986 letter the topic is UFO I believe there are lots of UFOs I am also tending to believe there are two types of U UFOs or categories a man-made UFOs B extraterrestrial UFOs I believe with certainty in man-made UFOs I am tending to believe there are also extraterrestrial UFOs having the highest respect for both you and Kelly I&#x27;d appreciate knowing your belief in both categories so then Ben Rich sent back the letter I was able to get the actual letter lock company letter had July uh 21st 1986 Dear John this is Aon response yes I&#x27;m a Believer in both categories I feel everything is possible many of our man-made UFOs were unfunded opportunities in both categories there are lots of cooks and charlatans be cautious Ben rich so the $64 billion question is what did Ben rich mean when he talk about unfunded opportunities UFO was Ben Rich talking about programs that didn&#x27;t get funded at the Skunk Works or as some have suggested which could be a possibility was he talking about freebies or hand me- Downs that we got for others is that a possibility it&#x27;s certainly a possibility but by 1995 Ben had passed way so we don&#x27;t know the answer to that question now good friend of mine Jim Goodall uh wrote a letter to Ben Rich basically requesting uh a taped interview just go over a couple of quick points I would like to do a taped interview with you sometime in the near future so obviously Jim knew that time was getting short for Ben he wanted to get all this documented on videotape it says we would cover everything that you have ever been involved in with your many years at Lockheed skunkworks we would cover all bases leaving nothing out he also said that he&#x27;d be glad to hold on to that tape for 10 years 20 years until he decided that it was appropriate to release into the public domain now unfortunately that in interview never took place because as we mentioned Ben Rich passed away in 1995 but just prior to Ben&#x27;s passing Jim Goodall got one final telephone conversation into to Ben Rich who was dying at the hospital hospital and this is what uh Ben Rich told Jim godall over the phone just before he died he says Jim we have things in the Nevada desert that are 50 years beyond what you can comprehend if you&#x27;ve seen it on Star Wars or Star Trek we&#x27;ve been there done that or decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort so again ladies and gentlemen I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to get any better than that talking about technologies that are 50 years beyond what we can comprehend from the Skunk Works couple of uh UFO cases that we should consider here Hudson Valley Boomerang between 1982 and 1989 over 25,000 eyewitnesses reported a gigantic Chevon or Boomerang shaped craft that hovered over cities uh north of New York City about 20 minutes north of New York City Primary eyewitnesses reported uh from air traffic controllers doctors policemen law enforcement Personnel what they reported seeing is this Boomerang shaped craft with these tubes pipes and cylinders on the bottom of the vehicle a very structured Craft on the bottom also had multicolored flashing lights on the bottom as well that&#x27;s a very interesting thing to consider because it&#x27;s been repeated over and over again now March 24th 1983 tonic Stark Parkway New York this is on a Thursday multiple eyewitnesses saw a gigantic 300 feet per side flying Boomerang shaped craft with a triangle trailing Edge hover over the to conic State Parkway people pull up over to the side of the road slammed on their brakes got out of their car and looked up and saw this craft but then they said when they saw the bottom of it it had these transparent panels so you could see inside the structure of the craft and eyewitness reported seeing tubes pipes cylinders steel girder mechanical truss tube construction like a truss Bridge that&#x27;s what they reported so I want to ask everyone here does and you don&#x27;t have to answer does anyone here know what happened one day prior to this event what happened on March 23rd 1983 Reagan speech thank you March 23rd 1983 was Reagan speech he he proposed the SDI program so I I asked the question is there a connection between the Hudson Valley Boomerang and the SDI program by Ronald Reagan were they using these craft flying over large American cities as a nuclear deterrent setting up an electromagnetic umbr umbrella protecting us from uh incoming enemy Russian icbms is that a possibility I&#x27;m just throwing it out there characteristics of the Hudson Valley Boomerang sightings of The Craft came in from Connecticut New Jersey and Massachusetts the craft was virtually silent and measured between 300 and 900 ft across the UFO was seen hovering over busy expressways lakes and rivers the object was reported by airline pilots air traffic controllers doctors law lawyers local law enforce enforcement firemen computer program the crafter appear to have an industrial steel structural girder and Cross Beam internal construction like a truss Bridge so what I&#x27;ve tried to do here is I&#x27;ve Incorporated every conceivable configuration that was seen by the eyewitnesses again we&#x27;ve got this tubes pipes and cylinders that was seen on the bottom of the vehicle a triangle trailing Edge and then here we&#x27;ve got this section here showing you these transparent panels over here I&#x27;ve shown you the original configuration of the B stealth bomber this is vintage 1983 Northrop spent $22.3 billion of our tax dollars designing this B2 stealth bomber 1983 they had absolutely nothing to show for our 22.3 billion at the end of 1983 the north uh Air Force and Northrup decided that they no longer wanted to have these uh low altitude bombing platforms and they changed the wing configuration to the wble W that we see today that that cost all of us a a a billion dollars for the wing redesign now instead of me just talking about it just by myself I wasn&#x27;t there I want to give you the eyewitness testimony directly from the people who saw this crap this is Dennis Sant very uh respectable gentleman here&#x27;s his quote this is Philadelphia inquir September 28th 1984 as it hovered I could make out dark Smoky colored metallic beams underneath huge huge beams according to Dennis Sant March 17th which was a Thursday when this actually took place again Mo uh Morino mono Driscoll she SED the object on March 17th 1983 on a Thursday this is his her quote and this is her painting that she made of this craft I could see the underbelly part it&#x27;s solid it had metal type work like cross beams and tubular things hanging down here in there I was so close to it I could have thrown a ball and hit it that&#x27;s from mono Drisco this thing flew right over her head now June 24th 1984 Indian Point Nuclear power reactor uh something very significant happened on this particular night I believe it may be one of the top three UFO cases of all history according to no less than 12 nuclear regulatory committee security guards a gigantic repeat gigantic 900t wide Boomerang shape craft hovered over reactor 3 for 20 minutes so this is confirmed by 12 security guards and this is a uh westrum illustration of what this thing looked like they had shotguns pointed at this thing it shut down the security system of the nuclear power plant it violated prohibited airspace but then there was a uh one of the security guards was in this remote hanger here he had a camera a remote camera that was capturing all this on videotape and in his words quote this craft was so large that he had to pan the camera 180° across just to get the whole thing in the field of view that&#x27;s how big this craft was that videotape was later confiscated by government officials but there is a videotape of this particular event Phoenix Lights March 13th 1997 again Boomerang shaped craft it had a very small triangle trailing edge here seen by thousands of eyewitnesses uh of course the Government tried to explain it away as flares but I question how could flares start out north of Prescott go down through prohibited airspace at SC Harbor airport in Phoenix and then continued down all the way to Tucson flares can&#x27;t go that far eyewitnesses reported that the lights on this vehicle they didn&#x27;t look like just lights but they were canister or studio lights that were embedded into the lower belly structure of the aircraft Phoenix Lights we&#x27;ve also want to cover the Belgium triangle this is November 29th 1989 this is the newspaper clipping uh from the report talking about a gigantic 300t per side somei Witnesses reported that this was over a football field inside um also we have the section here where the whole entire Field section was lit up by the light that this craft emitted couple of quick reference points on this here from the Sun July 23rd 1991 we are under a sort of Siege by high-tech flying machines these craft are clearly the product of an advanced society and are under intelligent control their shape size speed and the way they move are unlike anything known on Earth these UFOs are technological Marvels they operate with a propulsion system unlike anything man has ever seen several eyewitness describe see the craft as big or bigger than an aircraft carrier or as big as a football field one witness said that while the object was flying directly overhead one could not see the front part and the end at the same time because it was too big the craft had the capability of hovering and at times would suddenly accelerate so rapidly that it would be across the Horizon in a second or two and sometimes it would flash right back in many cases people saw structure underneath the craft which included heavy metal Parts crisscross effects diamond shaped work and tubular things here and there so that&#x27;s important to keep in mind this was also tracked by two f-16s that got within 20 mi of this particular craft it also released hundreds of small objects that were on the bottom of it and then during this particular Belgium wave fly Ling squares rectangles platforms and a manray shape craft were also seen by the eyewitnesses so it wasn&#x27;t just triangles that we were seeing here here is the illustration of this F-16 attempted intercept uh this thing was going at about 250 knots accelerating to about 1,800 knots within 2 seconds that&#x27;s equivalent to about 40 G&#x27;s acceleration now under normal circumstances that would kill uh Pilots but if they&#x27;re using another type of propulsion system that may not be the case now what are we talking about is this a man-made vehicle we have the same two pipes and cylinders configuration on the bottom of the Belgium triangle that we looked at and the Hudson Valley Boomerang here&#x27;s the radar track here from the onboard F-16 targeting radar there were three independent ground radar tracking stations that also track this on radar uh I want to bring your attention to a manray shaped craft that was also seen December 1st 1989 the movement of the lights was kind of like back and forth and it looked very similar to The Night Rider TV series in 1980s night Industries 2000 that&#x27;s the movement of this light it also looked like these sylon Centurion helmets that were used in the 80s TV hit Battlestar Galactica but the most important point I want to bring to your attention here and this comes from Joseph Jones who&#x27;s another black aircraft researcher he states that it was a joint program between Lockheed Skunk Works and British Aerospace this is vintage 1984 1985 they were developing something called triangulum that was the code name for this aircraft and they were working on something called an em drive and this is part of a program called brilliant Invader that was the code name for this operation so ladies and gentlemen I submit to you that this may be in point of effect the explanation for the Belgium triangle wave 1989 1999 1990 which was the brilliant Invader joint natal Naval uh NATO training exercise night rider shows you the configuration of the lights in this location also the silon Centurion helmet here now what evidence do we have to back this up is it just uh fairy tales or do we have something to back this up James defense week September 4th 1996 has a very interesting article regarding the relationship between the UK and the US regarding stealth technology the UK&#x27;s relationship with the USA on stealth runs very deep has been going on for many decades and is extremely secret do we have anything else to back this up it turns out that by the 1960s they had accumulated so much information regarding what was done after World War II when British intelligence was basically sucking up every shred of evidence recovered from the Nazis regarding radar crosssection development that report was put in something called the Dawson report and then during a unknown date within the 60s that report was brought over to Washington DC and given to the defense contractors probably locky so the other piece of evidence here is this very interesting book called it I could tell you but then you would have to be destroyed by Me by Trevor paglin very interesting patch in this location right here you&#x27;ll note that the location of the beam of light is similar to the location of where the Belgium triangle sightings actually took place so ladies and gentlemen I hope I&#x27;ve presented both sides of this case I want to leave it to your discretion to decide who&#x27;s who what technology is actually being used my point here is I&#x27;d like to see this technology handed over to the scientific Community for the betterment of everyone on this planet and I want to thank you for your [Applause] attention very thank you thank you very much thank you very much Michael really appreciate that</p>
