            <p>so I wanted to do a quick video talking about something that has been in the news lately with the the Twitter files right people have been talking about what the FBI was doing how they were using Twitter how they paid Twitter money how they were monitoring social media how they were uh you know spying on American citizens right in this um this goes to like they were asking for location data for media Outlets like rsbn News why would they need location data for them why would they be requesting it from Twitter and of course all of that without a warrant and it got to the point where they were you know asking Twitter to censor satire accounts that had very little reach maybe like 300 followers they were watching those accounts so they had what they called a foreign interference task force and that task force ballooned in size to 80 agents that were simply using um you know they were they were silencing and censoring um Americans political opinions that&#x27;s what it was okay but it&#x27;s deeper than that and there&#x27;s an interesting connection to the um FBI is uh the fake Michigan Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping plot so I&#x27;ve been studying the case obviously I&#x27;m making a documentary on it and I&#x27;m working with a lot of people that were involved in that like I I&#x27;m interviewing a guy that&#x27;s in prison right now one of the guys facing life in prison that the government called a ringleader this is a man who um he was a truck driver he had three daughters he lived in Delaware and there&#x27;s like no he had no motivation to like try to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer because her mandates didn&#x27;t even affect him right not only that but there&#x27;s like literally no phone calls or text messages between him and his alleged co-conspirators which is very bizarre because if you&#x27;re engaged in a criminal Enterprise that like suggests that that you&#x27;re in communication with people there&#x27;s none he&#x27;s not in any of their encrypted group chats or anything so it&#x27;s very strange but there was a special agent who was one of the lead agents on the case his name was special agent Jason Chambers and uh he managed he was handling one of the lead informants big Dan Dan Chapel um and Jason Chambers is a very corrupt man you know you can look at the discovery in the case where he&#x27;s sending text messages to uh the informants saying things like don&#x27;t let the facts you know oh we have a saying at our office here at the FBI don&#x27;t let the facts get in the way of a good story things like that things where he is directing informants to run things oh bring this person and try to get this person to show up to this event you know trying to draw people into uh a plot that doesn&#x27;t exist you know as much as the FBI wanted it to so what&#x27;s interesting is that the government did not call him to testify at trial because one of the things that came out about Jason Chambers was that while he was overseeing this case he also simultaneously as he&#x27;s an FBI special agent is running a private company called exit Intel exe Intel EXA Intel exe Intel and so this company like bills itself as a private intelligence firm and claims that it does cyber security and um he tried to say that he wasn&#x27;t involved in it and that it like wasn&#x27;t his company and then it was it came out that it was him it was tracked down to the you know the business registration was obviously him but it had a Twitter account and on Twitter it was tweeting about having foreknowledge about that specific case the Whitmer case and it was saying things like watch Michigan big things to come blah blah blah uh and there there are things that came out in Discovery Number One X intel was seeking a multi-million dollar contract to advise the federal government on cases of DT while he&#x27;s overseeing a sprawling fake DT investigation so he stood to gain millions of dollars through his private company if he could get a big case like this he also is in text messages and emails to other FBI agents where he&#x27;s saying things like oh yeah I&#x27;m gonna retire and then I&#x27;m going to segue into the private sector and I need a big case to like before he leaves the FBI is the implication you know he had said something in text messages to another agent where he said like oh I&#x27;m gonna run this as a Tei whether I get the approval the approval or not a Tei is what it&#x27;s a highest Threat Level um terrorism case and it stands for terrorism Enterprise investigation and what that means if you get a Tei classification is that you essentially have access to like all of the resources at the disposal of the FBI so they spent about six million dollars trying to manufacture a fake uh T DT case is that&#x27;s what happened so um as you look at Exit Intel the more that you look into it it&#x27;s very interesting he was also trying to get Cyber Security Contracts with state governments um there there&#x27;s an email that came out about that where he was talking about oh yeah exit Intel is about to go live and he said he was reallocating resources from the FBI to a private company and then he was talking about oh yeah we&#x27;ve got this new emerging technology 3D laser modeling and how he wanted to use that to supplement his resume he had contacts in the media that he was working with also and so it&#x27;s very interesting when you look at that um and you start looking at like the cias in qtel program so in qtel is the cia&#x27;s Venture Capital firm in Silicon Valley and what it does is it invests in emerging in new technology um incutel is invested in many um social media sites right A lot of them got their funding through CIA research grants like for example Google has its Origins and a joint CIA NSA research Grant Facebook was a DARPA program called lifelog under the total information awareness umbrella uh right so like you can look at this stuff and say gee this is uh yeah all very interesting so what it appears to be what appears to be happening is that the FBI got jealous of the CIA is in cutel and their access to Tech firms and technology companies as you can see from the Twitter files the FBI was having to go to social media sites like Twitter and ask them to do things oh you know take this down or you know blah blah blah they were paying them too like the FBI had to pay Twitter or something like 3.4 million dollars and so what it looks like is that perhaps the FBI wanted to create their own in-house version of the cia&#x27;s in qtel and that perhaps that&#x27;s what they were going to do with exit Intel and um it&#x27;s it seems like that definitely could be the case and also maybe why Jason Chambers did not take the stand in his own case this was his case he was the one that got it a Tei uh you know got the Tei signed off on by uh FBI special agent Charles story he&#x27;s the one who ultimately approved the Tei for this uh sham hoax case but yeah I would encourage people to look into that look into inqutel and look into exit Intel EXE Intel because I think there&#x27;s something very interesting there where the FBI wanted to have their own domestic um version of inkutel and for domestic spying on American citizens and also to be able to engage in things like fifth generation Warfare right reality perception management reality creation you know fifth generation Warfare talks about things like instead of having to adapt to the battlefield like you create it you create reality so you can control it you know you don&#x27;t have to adapt to a battlefield that is already there like you make the battlefield and so there&#x27;s something very interesting about why they would want access to social media companies and um and why they would want the ability to maybe bypass them to have some kind of big um domestic spying but also social engineering right anyways another thing that you see in the uh the Whitmer cases like with Facebook so obviously I&#x27;m sure the FBI is doing this on Twitter as well um and I wonder if that will come out in more Twitter files but what the FBI was doing was having their informants create Facebook groups right from fake militia groups that didn&#x27;t exist and then funneling people into these groups and they were administered and run by the FBI some not just by FBI informants but actual FBI agents were managing these pages and running them and there was a lot of that going on on Facebook I suspect the same thing is happening on Twitter as well we know that Twitter was involved in helping the US Army runs psychological operations uh so this is just a lot of very interesting things and I would encourage people to look more into FBI special agent Jason Chambers he spells his name different he spells it j-a-y-s-o-n Jason Chambers and then look into exit Intel and uh look into inqutel fifth generation Warfare and things like that just something interesting that is in the news lately and I thought as I&#x27;m working on this documentary on this case this is something that we&#x27;ve been talking about and looking at and I thought I would share it with you now because I think it&#x27;s kind of relevant so if anybody learns anything or finds anything let me know in the comments below I&#x27;d be interested to hear it or you can also email me my email addresses on the about page I think of my YouTube channel so yeah I hope everybody has a good night</p>
