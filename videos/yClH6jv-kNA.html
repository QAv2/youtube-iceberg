            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel Thomas and we do educational videos on this channel uh today is the 90th video uh where we&#x27;ve been reviewing the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson uh he discovered the reciprocal system back uh way back around 1930 uh had his first inklings worked it out uh inductively over the course of the next 20 or 25 years then um came out with his two fundamental postulates the first of which is uh the most important is basically that the universe is not made out of matter the universe is not made out of energy what the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other uh kind of in the same way that three-fourths is the reciprocal of four-thirds one is the uh you know you flip them invert them uh to convert from space to time and um space and time are both in three dimensions or I would say at least three to three or four dimensions and um you know we know space is like that but uh by the reciprocal relation time is also that way what we know about time is that it&#x27;s always progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later uh and uh by the reciprocal relation therefore space also has that quality which the Hubble telescope detected in the recession of the distant galaxies uh space and time are also just come in discrete units only there are no fractional units there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time those units are very small especially the one out of time one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light the speed of light is not the mid not the maximum speed of the universe as Einstein would have you to believe but for Larson the speed of light is the midpoint or the null point or even the origin of the universe and uh that there is half of the universe that&#x27;s actually moving faster than the speed of light and half that we&#x27;re familiar with that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light the app that&#x27;s moving slower our familiar world is what Larson calls sector one or the material sector the half that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls sector 2 and he also calls it the cosmic sector and uh particles atoms from sector one uh grow by agglomeration aggregation they bond to each other until they get to their most complicated form complex form which is DNA which has a few Milli a few billion atoms per molecule per one DNA molecule and at that level the um material unit is eligible to be controlled by a cosmic sector unit from sector two and when that happens uh we get the life unit so for Larson life is a combination of a material and a cosmic unit the cosmic unit is even though it&#x27;s only a small part of the combination it creates um life it&#x27;s a control unit Larson calls it a control unit and so Life Starts from just a single-celled organism and it evolves or develops over time up into up until it reaches its most complex level which Larson sizes the intelligent human being and at that point the intelligent human being becomes eligible to be controlled overall by um component from sector three a sector three uh is kind of pointing at that origin or it&#x27;s uh as Larson says metaphysical or beyond space and time or independent of space and time uh now the metaphysical region there is [Music] um of what other people might call God and uh the spirit world and that region uh kind of comes into a competition with sector two control so sector two is based on uh Survival Life and sector three is based on good behavior or ethical Behavior or moral Behavior and so there are times when those two conflict and at that point the human being is in between and needs to be able to make decisions about which to honor and that is what you would call free will sector 3 communicates with sector uh with the life unit uh through various means such as ESP intuition religious Revelation scientific insight um visions and these are all really have the same uh it&#x27;s the same mechanism uh but we see it kind of differently depending primarily on how prepared we are the messages that we&#x27;re getting from sector three are always correct um but they are subject to Art translation and so they&#x27;re subject to our limitations limitations and preparedness especially so uh that&#x27;s why a lot of those messages turn out wrong is because we project upon them or we don&#x27;t have the proper uh way to translate them because we haven&#x27;t really developed the language okay now we are in this review we&#x27;re looking at uh Larson&#x27;s final book uh that came out after he died uh called the beyond space and time so this is really referring to sector 3 referring to that metaphysical region and uh he&#x27;s gone we&#x27;re in chapter uh 22 right here I believe it&#x27;s called humanism and he was just uh kind of talking about humanism is kind of like the uh replacement for religion for secular people um and you know he talks about how they all um tend to think that humanism is kind of like a a uh in competition with religion or threatens to replace religion but Larson&#x27;s argument is more that the humanism works with religion to kind of get rid of the chaff from the religion and um get rid of all the ritualistic mumbo jumbo and get down to the core of it but that the religion is needed at the court the core uh those religious values at the core uh which he would say are are from sector three are often um you know overshadowed by the sector two stuff that is uh on the fringes the mumbo jumbo and the the ritual so we&#x27;re gonna take over right here or let Larson take over right here uh it is quite evident from the arguments put forth by the humanists in support of their contentions that they are motivated to a considerable degree by what we may call Pride or less charitably vanity those human individuals who realize that their knowledge is limited are usually prepared to accept the assertion that they need the help of those superhuman forces to meet their most serious problems but those who have reason to believe that they are well grounded in the current wisdom of the human race have a tendency to resent such a suggestion it is disturbing to them to be told that they are in effect second-class citizens that there is a superior order of existence and that the primary objective of human life is not to savor that life to the utmost but to make some Advance toward the superior status they are particularly upset by the idea that one or more of the superior existences may be in a position to dictate the terms of life and he talks about Eric Fromm who refers to them as authoritarian religions on the ground that they require surrender to a power transcending man and um this higher power has a right to force man to worship him he&#x27;s not ready to just from it&#x27;s not ready to dispense entirely with the concept of religion but he wants to give it a humanistic character uh where religion uses the term God he says it is only a symbol of man&#x27;s own powers and then Larson says strangely enough this vain glorious attitude coexists with an unusually Keen realization of the wide margin by which the human race is currently failing to attain its full potential indeed much of the driving power behind the humanistic movement stems from a recognition of the immensity of the task involved in reaching that goal and the necessity of Greater and more systematic efforts toward Improvement if the goal is ever to be reached those who measure the magnitude of the task against the current rate of our off of progress are often discouraged and pessimism explicit or implicit is one of the problems of the humanist movement this can hardly be described as a cheerful Outlook and it has little appeal to the Common Man uh he was quoting Kurtz here uh the random occurrence between two oblivions that death death is inevitable and that there is a tragic aspect to our lives okay um skipping forward a little bit our status is not second class rather we are neophytes who have the opportunity to acquire full first class status in due course man does in fact have all of the powers he needs if he develops his potential to the utmost but the most significant of these are powers which he possesses by virtue of having an aspect of his personality that is independent of the physical universe sector three or he calls it level three when a human being exhibits uh characteristics of sector three uh and is in touch with other such independent existences some of which are more fully developed and are capable of providing him with advice and assistance this is essentially the position of the Transcendent religions whether we are in fact subject to the authority of a deity as most religions contend and humanism finds objectionable is outside the scope of this work the investigation has not been carried far enough to shed any light on this Central religious issue nor is it yet clear whether there is any basis from which to which an inquiry into the subject could be pursued the answer would have to come from a revelatory or intuitive source and as matters now stand the purported revelations in this area are so numerous and so mutually contradictory that they may that they provide nothing definite many readers will no doubt feel that lack of an answer to this fundamental question leaves the development of thought in these Pages incomplete is therefore appropriate to reiterate that this present work is a report of the results of a Pioneer scientific exploration of a field that is hitherto been outside the boundaries of science as such cannot be expected to arrive at anything complete and conclusive its aim is to get a broad General view of the heretofore Unexplained sector of existence independent of the universe of space and time to lay the foundation for additional Explorations in the future and to identify some of the means by which such Explorations can be carried out okay so he&#x27;s saying that you know we need some other people to come up and do these uh do these studies this is just the Pioneer investigation into this field and you know I I I feel Larson on this because so many people that I&#x27;ve talked to criticize Larson for getting something wrong or not presenting it clearly enough and it&#x27;s kind of like you know your larsonist is basically con competing against the entire scientific establishment you know tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people and he&#x27;s one guy and you&#x27;re like comparing the two you know obviously he&#x27;s not going to be able to come up with a body of work almost although he almost did uh you know that&#x27;s going to be able to compare with what uh you know modern science has come up with over hundreds of years uh with thousands of people being put to the task you know Larson is trying to do something on a shoestring budget by himself and he&#x27;s still you know looks favor is favorable um you know does favorably with uh against this giant you know scientific uh establishment okay now um religion back to Larson religion is the state of being grasped by an ultimate concern a concern which qualifies all other concerns as preliminary and which itself continues contains the answer to the question of the meaning of our life Paul tillich classifies all isms such as humanisms that are based on secularism as quasi-religious and he regards the attack of the quasi-religions on the religions proper as the most significant feature of the present-day religious scene today the problems which have Arisen out of this situation can no longer be neglected he says the particular aspect of these problems that is brought into focus by the findings of this work is the manner in which the substitution of the secular of secular objectives for the genuinely religious objectives impedes the progress of the human race toward the ultimate objective of its existence um we&#x27;ll discuss this point in chapter 28. at this time we will want to take note of the fact that there is also an inverse side to this picture indiscriminate and again whenever he uses the word inverse he&#x27;s you know evoking this space and time re reciprocity there is also an inverse side to this picture indiscriminate mixing of religious and secular objectives is detrimental not only to religion but to secular life as well when a religious organization takes a stand on any issue it automatically stamps that position whatever it may be as morally right religion is devoted to upholding the right and combining combating the wrong it follows so the reasoning goes that whatever a religious organization supports is right and those in opposition are either ignorant or in League with the forces of unrighteousness but in reality a large and growing number of the issues on which present-day religious organizations are taking sides and working energetically in the ensuing conflicts are secular issues even if some of these issues social political economic Etc are actually susceptible to being decided on their merits the decision can be based only on whether they are desirable not whether they are morally right desirable is you know he uh talked about that earlier this is a desirable it&#x27;s like a sector two thing morally right is a sector three thing in practice there is seldom a clear-cut Criterion of desirability that can be applied these non-religious issues are almost invariably struggles for comparative advantage questions as to who should get what the gains that are made by some individuals as a result of the final decision the gains that Loom so large to the churches when they take up the battle positions are made at the expense of others uh one of philosopher says every social reform is ambiguous it appears more just to those who profit from it than it does to those who do not furthermore the ultimate gainers or losers are not always or even usually clearly indicated for example the issue in a labor dispute is ostensibly between the interests of the employer and those of the employees in the usual case however these appearances are deceptive the employers directly affected May sustain losses as a result of the outcome of such a dispute but this weakens their competitive positions and allows their competitors to make corresponding gains seldom if ever do employers as a whole bear the burden of a wage increase or other atom added item of expense resulting from the settlement the operation of economic forces permits indeed it requires them to transfer the cost cost burden to the general public that is to all workers the church or other religious organization um that supports the labor union and the controversy is therefore doing nothing but assisting one group of workers to aim to gain an economic Advantage at the expense of another the justification for treating this as a moral issue is not apparent to say the least okay uh I was hoping to get to the end of this chapter but we got a couple paragraphs to go and uh probably too much commentary on my part but uh that is how it is and uh we will wrap up this chapter tomorrow and we&#x27;ll move into chapter 23 which is called religion re-examine all right have a great day thanks for tuning in hope to see you soon</p>
