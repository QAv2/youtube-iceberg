            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>The CIA helped start it. Governments now depend on it. And most people have no idea what it actually does. This is Palunteer, the quiet company behind the screens, the software governments use when they want answers before the question is even asked. Not search, not analysis, prediction.</p>
<p>And once you see how it works, the uncomfortable question becomes impossible to ignore. Who&#x27;s really in control here? Let&#x27;s rewind. September 2001. America is in shock. The intelligence community is panicking.</p>
<p>Everyone is asking the same question. How did we miss this? There was data everywhere. Flight records, visa applications, financial transfers, phone logs, travel patterns. It was all there, buried across dozens of agencies, hundreds of databases, thousands of analysts. The problem wasn&#x27;t a lack of information.</p>
<p>The problem was that nobody could see the whole picture. Inside the CIA, a quiet realization took hold. If we can&#x27;t connect the dots faster than the threat moves, we lose every time. So they did something unusual. They went to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Not for a weapon system, not for hardware, but for software that could see patterns humans couldn&#x27;t. Enter Inqell, the CIA&#x27;s venture capital arm, a fund designed to quietly seed technologies the government would one day rely on. And in the early 2000s, one idea stood out. What if you could pour all your data into one system and ask it questions like a human analyst? What if it could flag relationships you didn&#x27;t know to look for? What if it could tell you who mattered before they acted? That idea became Palunteer, founded by a group of PayPal alumni, funded in its earliest days by the CIA, named after a fictional seeing stone from Lord of the Rings, an object that let its users see across vast distances and occasionally drove them mad. Cute reference.</p>
<p>Ominous implication. In the early days, Palanteer pitched itself as an anti-terrorism tool. software that could help intelligence agencies connect disperate data sources. Phone records, bank transactions, social networks, travel logs, all fused into a single interface. An analyst could click on a name and watch a web form around it.</p>
<p>Who they talked to, where they traveled, who paid them, who they paid. Patterns emerging in real time. Sir, we found something. What is it? This guy. He doesn&#x27;t matter on his own, but everyone who does matter touches him.</p>
<p>That sentence became Palanteer&#x27;s value proposition. It wasn&#x27;t about finding criminals. It was about finding connectors and governments loved it. The CIA adopted it. Then the FBI, then the Department of Defense, then ICE, then local police departments, then allied governments around the world.</p>
<p>Palunteer spread quietly. No consumer products, no flashy ads, no public-f facing apps, just contracts, long ones, expensive ones. embedded deep inside state power. By the time most people had heard the name Palunteer, it was already everywhere. And it wasn&#x27;t just intelligence anymore.</p>
<p>Police departments began using Palunteer for predictive policing, feeding and arrest records, call logs, social associations, location data. The software would flag individuals as high risk, not because they had committed a crime, but because people like them had. Officer, look at this. What am I looking at? this neighborhood, these five guys. Every major incident in the last 6 months traces back to two degrees of separation from them.</p>
<p>So, we watch them. No, we watch everyone around them. The line between investigation and anticipation blurred. Palunteer insisted the software didn&#x27;t make decisions. Humans did.</p>
<p>The system just showed connections. But anyone who has ever trusted a recommendation algorithm knows how that story ends. If the system flags someone as risky, they get watched more. If they get watched more, they get stopped more. If they get stopped more, more data gets fed back into the system.</p>
<p>The loop closes. Critics warned this wasn&#x27;t crime prevention. It was probability based suspicion, a feedback machine that turned data into destiny. Palunteer pushed back hard. We don&#x27;t predict crime, we predict risk.</p>
<p>That sentence did a lot of work. But the real power of Palunteer wasn&#x27;t domestic policing. It was war. After years inside intelligence agencies, Palanteer made a bigger leap. The battlefield.</p>
<p>Modern war is not about tanks and territory. It&#x27;s about information speed. Drones, supply chains, satellite feeds, logistics, decisions made in seconds with incomplete data. Palunteer offered a solution. Their software could ingest battlefield data in real time.</p>
<p>Friendly units, enemy sightings, drone feeds, weather, fuel levels, ammo counts. Commanders could see the entire operational picture on a single screen. Where are we vulnerable? Where are they exposed? If we move this unit here, what breaks? In conflicts from Afghanistan to Ukraine, Palanteer became a nervous system for modern militaries. Executives openly bragged about it. Our software is used to people.</p>
<p>That was not a leak. That was marketing. Palunteer didn&#x27;t apologize for working with governments. They leaned into it. We work with the West.</p>
<p>We pick a side. In an era where tech companies tried to appear neutral, Palunteer did the opposite. They wrapped themselves in flags. democracy, security, civilization itself. If you criticize Palunteer, you&#x27;re not just criticizing software.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re questioning national defense. Clever move. But here&#x27;s where things get interesting. Palunteer is not just a contractor. It doesn&#x27;t sell tools and walk away.</p>
<p>It embeds engineers inside government agencies on site long-term. They help shape how decisions are made, how data is interpreted, what questions are even asked. When a general or police chief opens a dashboard and asks, &quot;What should I focus on today?&quot; The answer is filtered through Palunteer&#x27;s logic. Not orders, not commands, influence. And influence at scale is power.</p>
<p>By the time Palunteer went public, its revenue depended almost entirely on government contracts, multi-year deals, deep integration, high switching costs. Once Palunteer is inside, removing it is like trying to rip out your nervous system and replace it with a spreadsheet. Analysts inside agencies quietly admitted it. We don&#x27;t know how we&#x27;d operate without it now. That&#x27;s not just dependency.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s lock in. Meanwhile, Palunteer expanded into the private sector. Corporations, banks, health systems, supply chains. Anywhere there is messy data and highstakes decisions, Palanteer shows up with the same pitch. We&#x27;ll help you see what others miss.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, governments used Palunteer to track vaccine distribution, hospital capacity, infection spread. helpful, necessary, efficient, also unprecedented. A single private company sitting at the center of public health logistics across multiple countries. No elections, no oversight boards, no transparency obligations beyond the contract, just code. And code doesn&#x27;t testify before Congress.</p>
<p>Palanteer&#x27;s CEO, Alex Karp, doesn&#x27;t help calm nerves. He talks like a philosopher king. Warns of civilizational collapse. Frames critics as naive. says, &quot;Liberal societies need strong tools to survive.</p>
<p>If we don&#x27;t build this, someone else will, and they won&#x27;t share our values.&quot; It&#x27;s a powerful argument and a familiar one. Trust us, we&#x27;re the good guys. But history has never been kind to institutions that see everything because surveillance always starts with enemies, then criminals, then risks, then inefficiencies, then it just becomes normal. So, here we are. A company born from the CIA, trusted by militaries, embedded in police forces, expanding quietly into civilian life.</p>
<p>Most people will never use Palunteer, never download it, never log in, but it may already be watching patterns that include you. Not because you did something, but because the system thinks someone like you might. And once that stone is turned towards you, the question is no longer what did you do. It&#x27;s what might you do next? And who gets to decide?</p>
