            <p>[Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] okay I say you turn your tally light off also okay um personally speaking for me um in all honesty you&#x27;re like my hero because since I was 13 years old I&#x27;ve been fascinated with gravity I told my father that one day I was going to do something with I didn&#x27;t know what so now here you are so the the papers the research that I&#x27;ve read on the internet about you says that 1992 is when you first started this experiment or prior to that so can you can you can you elaborate how you started this I was working at Tampa University of Technology and in fact I was working with uh high temperature superconductors which are very interesting materials because they can capture the magnetic field of various configurations and they have uh pretty unusual properties at that time it was uh in the center of the attention of all the scientists of the world and I was working with rather big samples uh with a diameter of maybe uh 6 to 8 in which was unusual even at that time and I noticed uh some uh anomalous behavior of those superconductors and I noticed that uh several objects or any objects uh which were placed over the superconducting dis under uh the uh interaction with u the magnetic fields of high frequency all those objects uh lost some part of their weight uh we checked and rechecked our experiments before we were brave enough uh to publish our first article and it appeared in 1992 uh in the magazine of physic C and uh it was uh met with great interest by the scientific community and at that time uh we used the term gravity shielding uh because we thought it might be connected really to gravity shielding but later we um decided not to use that term because it was not right now we use the term uh gravity modification or to be exact it&#x27;s the modification of local gravity field and uh though to be honest we do not know exactly the mechanism of gravity we&#x27;re only beginning to understand it still we are already able to use it in different aspects and for different purposes for scientific industrial and others uh and we think that uh this direction has a big future gra you here thanks that&#x27;s great that is spectacular okay well that&#x27;s much better you just want to run over just check seeing the Suns come out just make sure we&#x27;re still good I&#x27;m pretty sure we are y dou check okay um let&#x27;s see not true colums P okay um yeah I I I pulled something off the internet here and it says that um originally now I don&#x27;t want this true or not this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever read this particular thing since I&#x27;ve reading about you it says that uh it was It was kind of an accident you were spinning a disc and smoke is is that true was it an accident or uh it was kind of an accident you there a second we just got L of this dust going in front of the lens it&#x27;s coming up on a picture yeah it&#x27;s kind of I&#x27;ll Trust I think um all right we&#x27;re good now okay okay uh you can say it was uh practically by accident because we were making our research and we were making the measurements of the weight and we were using a chist and uh we were working late in the evening so one of my colleagues came to the laboratory and he was smoking his pipe and he blew uh the smoke over the cry and then a strange thing happened because that smoke approached the cat hit some uh invisible barrier and then went straight upward it was a bit unusual but that gave us a very good idea and later uh we used a barometer in order to uh check up um the air pressure over the cry start and it happened uh so that um the air pressure in the projection area of the disc was uh lower uh than in the surrounding atmosphere and the difference was up to several millim of uh uh water or even Mercury so uh this difference could be felt not uh only inside our laboratory but on the second floor above ours and we were able uh to show that we really deal with a well reproducible and very um effective phenomenon great I&#x27;m glad I asked you that okay so let see okay so I get you to talk about the disc yes sure it looks like a weight that uh that people lift okay uh so the disc is made of uh itum barium copper Ceramics and it has two layers that is very important from uh the scientific point of view so when we put the disc over the magnets and we cool it down to the temperature of liquid nitrogen or liquid helium because of the mner effect disc is levitating over the magnets and it can be rotated and again with a magnetic field it can be rotated with big speed uh we use the rotation up to 5,000 rotations per minute but later we made a special installation which allowed us uh to use much higher speeds and uh every uh object that is put over the disc loses some part of its weight in the stationary mode uh the loss is not big it&#x27;s about uh uh uh 1% uh but uh when we rotate uh the dis and use um resonance frequencies of the electromagnetic field we can increase uh the weight loss up to 2% and if we increase also the rotation speed we can uh reach the maximum values of 5% and at some Peak values up to 9% uh the only thing that keeps us from better result is the rotation speed because the disc is a ceramic one and uh even at uh 20,000 rotations per minute we have uh very big forces which tend to destroy it so we should keep it always in mind but as I used uh magnetic uh suspension system uh because of the mner effect it&#x27;s possible to rotate it up to U rather high speeds the maximum that we used was about 30,000 uh and uh then we had to uh make some special protection made of uh plastic materials uh so that we could strengthen uh the structure of the disc in that case we get really good values and uh also we have some secrets uh they are connected with the resonance frequencies of the magnetic fields uh and special configuration of the solenoids but in general uh it&#x27;s a rather simple experiment and it can be reproduced uh in a normal laboratory at any University can you use that yeah I pulled out then there&#x27;s a bit of a mic but get Ed yeah okay Umi yeah Miami is my wife&#x27;s name by the way don&#x27;t think about it cuz I&#x27;ll forget later you got a business card just so you know okay that&#x27;s a play on my wife&#x27;s name thanks spelled differently I see yes she&#x27;s like a sweetheart okay all right so tell us if that&#x27;s okay um now now the superc conducting material if it&#x27;s a secret that&#x27;s fine uh but if you&#x27;re allowed to elaborate on basic no it is not secret uh we have uh two layers one layer is uh normal superconductor or e amarium corpor with a Formula 1 to three it&#x27;s uh well known in the world and the second layer is practically the same material but it is not super conducting it is normal conductor so uh by special heat treatment we can arrange both layers in such a way that one layer is super conducting and another is normal conducting layer when we rotate uh uh the whole disc in the magnetic field normal conducting layer produces a lot of uh electrons and they move uh to the superc conducting area and they become uh not electrons but Cooper Pairs and uh they form what we call in physics BOS Einstein condensate which has uh unusual properties uh and uh one of the main properties is that it is it has the property of super fluidity super conductivity definitely and it can also interact with subatomic particles that exist uh around all the objects and uh practically form the whole unit Universe uh and by using this interaction of um our superconducting material with uh subatomic particles we get very unusual reaction and we can to some extent change or modify local gravity field if we go to a bit deeper physics uh we can say that we have the ability to polarize space around this rotating dis and using this uh polarized um space or polarized physical vacuum we can definitely manipulate gravity I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m an expert on gravity I never was and I&#x27;m afraid I never will be uh but I want to understand gravity and to make uh experimental research in the this area because uh there are a lot of theoretical works and I&#x27;m thankful to those theoreticians who uh also studied our experiments and helped us a lot but the experimental part Still Remains uh from my point of view the key point to overcoming gravity and using it for our uh future for our purposes uh for all one needs great great um could you show me with your hands I&#x27;ll probably have a diagram and three threedimensional uh animation but I think from what I was reading that it looks like donuts is that correct yes and let let me have you elaborate on that okay go ahead uh if we speak about the magnetic field yes it goes like donuts but uh if we speak about uh the production of gravitons if they ever exist because these are still hypothetical particles we have the emission of uh gravitons which go follows the projection of this dis and it goes to space in One Direction and we can uh uh change the direction of uh the flow of gravitons or if we are not sure that these particles are graviton we can speak about um uh gravity waves which propagate in space and again influence all the objects that are in the projection area of the dis now in the disc is is is the weight loss in the center or is it r no no uh we use this configuration because we also have a current which circulates uh around the dis and it increases the effect and the increase of the effect uh is because of the fact that we should um uh create the maximum density of electrons or Cooper pairs inside the superconducting materials that is the key to success that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re rotating it with great speed that&#x27;s why we use high frequency and uh uh the result of uh this density is when a certain critical density of electrons is reached we have that interaction uh of um BOS Einstein condensate with the subatomic particles if we speak about subatomic particles what I mean uh well uh this is um a bit well it&#x27;s not an unusual question in physics usually we deal with vacuum and Vac vacuum normal vacuum is considered to be empty entirely empty still all the Transmissions of electromagnetic waves which go to space to space uh shuttles to the Moon uh they propagate in space and they propagate like waves and wave is only a distortion of the media and if vacuum is entire entire emptiness there is nothing to disturb nothing to distort and then the waves cannot propagate inside it also if we refer to Einstein&#x27;s theory he says that gravity is the bending of space-time Continuum it&#x27;s right maybe but if we want to bend something and it is entirely empty then it is impossible so we have to admit that there are particles which constitute physical vacuum this these uh particles are several magnitudes of order smaller than the electron but they constitute that physical vacuum which has a lot of energy inside and can uh to some extent uh interact with uh normal solid bodies and the theory of uh 0 point fluctuations of vacuum was created by American scientist uh Harold POF uh Bernie H and Dr Reda and uh this theory is a very interesting one uh there are a lot of debates about it but it&#x27;s the only theory that is able uh to explain uh the mechanism of gravity the mechanism of energy and practically how the whole universe was created it&#x27;s a new approach the idea of ether uh is not a new one it was it existed through centuries but now it got uh a very good expression in this Theory with good mathematical formulas and uh in my work I try to use uh this Theory so I very grateful to uh uh Harold POF and I&#x27;m also grateful to ja sarfati who is a kind of his opponent in the scientific world but uh with different approaches to the same subjects we we can have really the solution of the problem also most uh of uh the theoretical work which is behind my experiments uh most of this work was done by uh Dr jaavan modan uh who who is one of the leading European theoreticians in the U field of uh Gravity Research and uh it&#x27;s enough to say that he made his PhD um in Germany and uh his um research was in the field of general relativity and special relativity of Einstein so we don&#x27;t break any laws when we are working with superconductor or experimental gravity installations we&#x27;re just trying to follow all the rules but sometimes we observe the um phenomena which are unusual we call them animal uh and we report honestly what we find and uh we would like of course uh to attract the attention of the scientific world to all these problems and and um to organize uh a deeper research in this field because it will definitely improve our understanding of the universe of the creation process of the gravity forces or gravity field and it will allow us to use uh all um uh this mechanism for the benefits of humanity great great okay um now I was reading somewhere where and of course you mention it if the dis spins faster I guess you get more of a field around it if you were to say have a disc made out of that material and if it were possible to spin it would you I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to phrase this um and if you were to say spin it the I use is just say 6,000 RPMs this maybe say 3 ft would it actually be able to levitate more objects or or more weight or is it something else that work here well uh first of all if we rotate such big disc at uh terrible speeds it will fall apart because the materials can stand uh this load but uh to be absolutely honest now after 12 or 15 already years of research in this field uh we came to a conclusion that it is not necessary to use super conducting materials in order to modify uh the gravity field we can use rotating magnetic fields and we can turn to normal conductors which is much easier much easier and uh this method has a lot of advantages so we use superconductors just as model material because we can put different magnetic fields inside and we can freeze magnetic fields inside the material so this is just the unique properties of the superconductors that we used so it&#x27;s possible still uh to base the research on superconductors but we can go further and in order to create flying vehicles or impulse gravity generators we can use normal materials okay um have you ever tried I was reading something about NASA they&#x27;ve got an experiment that they evidently released um at least weeks ago um they haven&#x27;t released it or somehow got into on the internet that I read about it but they have something that&#x27;s 20 in wide by 48 in tall and I guess it&#x27;s like a tube from the description of it um if you were to stack those discs would you get more power uh say able to I I I guess what I&#x27;m trying to get at is could you lift heavy objects like I don&#x27;t know bricks or you know well if we put uh uh one disc over another and they can&#x27;t be put just like this we use different cryostats and we can uh rotate the dis even in opposite directions yes there is some uh gain in the weight loss so it&#x27;s POS possible the experiments that were made uh in NASA according to my knowledge uh they used the principles that uh I published in uh physic C in 1992 then uh we modify the experiment and used uh bigger discs so I consulted people from Marshall space flight center uh uh on this topic and they got some unusual results but unfortunately the whole um uh the whole project which was called uh breakthrough propulsion uh system uh it lost practically all the funding and uh uh the research was stopped at the final uh Point uh they made a cry start uh they made the discs uh very close to the requirements that we supplied and uh we were ready for the tests but the program was stopped unfortunately and that is quite understandable because uh This research is entirely new and uh by the way doesn&#x27;t require much money and usual approach to gravity problems to Rockets to shuttle [Music] programs all these things take lots of money and uh that also means that a lot of people are involved they have working places uh and the companies gets Millions from this uh but finally what we get as a result is a shuttle which is not a reliable construction at all and it was good for the 20th century but it is not good for the 21st we have better proposals we have cheaper variants and we have more efficient solutions for the exploration of space so I was always hoping uh to be able to organize the institute for the Gravity Research uh based on the best physicist of the world it might be under the guidance of NASA or European Space Agency or Russian space agency or British airspace whatever it is but it should be International because the problem is too complicated to solve it only in the United States or in France or in Russia if if you were to uh the smoke that you that the your colleague blew over that is it possible to see the actual rings that go around is there some way of looking at that no no it&#x27;s uh the smoke simply approach this area and then it goes up and that&#x27;s all and uh my poor colleague I usually I I can&#x27;t even tell his name because unfortunately and everybody knows it it is not not allowed to smoke in the lab but it was evening time and he was uh exhausted and he was going home and he was just curious what we were doing so late that&#x27;s why he so I&#x27;m always asked do you know that it is not allowed to smoke in the lab yes I know it very well we Never Smoke we usually don&#x27;t break any laws administrative or physical we&#x27;re just very intelligent people I didn&#x27;t know that so long time I don&#x27;t want to get you in trouble okay okay so what happen okay here&#x27;s something I I I was wondering have you ever I don&#x27;t know how you get the disc to to a spin maybe you got electric motor under it or something but if you were to put a pan of water maybe 2 in thick maybe 2 ft x 2 ft would it have any effect on the water would would the water I mean could it could could it possibly bring water up is that possible uh well what will happen that uh all water that is put over the disc will lose some part of its weight so if we put one liter of water it will um weigh not one kilo but uh 2% less or 1% less that&#x27;s all we can&#x27;t uh use this method for the uh turbines or for the production of energy at present but I&#x27;m sure that based on this principle we can uh later construct the installations which will be able to provide us not with entirely free energy but with the energy which is very cheap and very efficient if we speak about free energy again I don&#x27;t want to break the second law of Thermodynamics but the second law of thermodynamics is valid only for closed systems and it is well known to every physicist but they always forget that we deal with physical vacuum that means the subatomic particles that are present everywhere in the air inside this body inside human tissues and we can take the energy from this field of physical vacuum and and we can use this energy but how to organize the interaction uh with this uh physical vacuum it&#x27;s another question so there are various approaches and uh there is there are pages on the net which are called American anti-gravity and it&#x27;s a very big work by team Ventura and I uh have a small abstract there and there are different ways uh to polarized space and to have the interaction with physical vacuum we can uh create high magnetic fields we can create high electric Fields like bifield brown effect we can also uh have extra low frequencies uh and uh here it&#x27;s necessary to mention uh The Works of Professor FR quina from Brazil and it&#x27;s also possible to use uh um rotating magnetic fields based on the works of Professor surl from Great Britain we can also uh rotate uh normal uh gyroscopes and uh I&#x27;m always thankful to Professor lewe uh who slightly Disturbed the traditions of um the science in Britain but still proved that we can create gravity forces use uh special gravity forces us using usual geros Scopes and we can also uh use special geds very thin grids uh and topological effects in order to polarize space and we can of course use um superconducting materials and the properties of BOS Einstein condensate and there are also some other methods uh we know some of them and we know and maybe we don&#x27;t know all of them but uh there is a big field of um unstudied material in front of us but we can also use the combination of all these methods and this will definitely give the best results so we&#x27;re slowly moving in these directions using the knowledge of different scientists uh from other countries using theoretical material that is uh that exists in this area but uh also using intuition because we&#x27;re pioneering um this work and this task is extremely difficult because modern science it&#x27;s like whole Inquisition we can&#x27;t say we invented or we made anti-gravity by the way we never use the term anti-gravity in our Laboratory we use gravity forces which can be attractive and which can be also repulsive and by the way if uh and uh superconducting material um can demonstrate uh both repulsive and detractive forces for example if we have a superconductor and we have a magnet and we put the magnet over the superconductor and cool the whole system down then we take the magnet off and the superc conducting dis follows it and we can rotate it just by hand and it will continue rotating under the magnet so we have the magnetic field which scientists say is Frozen inside the superconductor well World Frozen the word Frozen is not quite acceptable this is a very interesting phenomena uh practically same as uh levitation uh but the mechanism of all these things and the flux and the properties of uh the electrons these things are not studied in detail they are not understood in detail and even the mechanism of super conductivity high temperature super conductivity is not established and Nobel Prize is still waiting for the scientist who will give us the direct explanation of the mechanism of super conductivity so it just uh proves that the subject is too difficult and too unusual to work alone or with a small team we need the efforts of the International Community that&#x27;s the key to success that&#x27;s great um uh NASA has uh an ion an ion propulsion system are you aware of that that that that particular system they&#x27;ve got deep space one and d space 2 yes now that are being propelled by that uh have you ever experimented uh with using gases maybe like a xenon gas um spinning the you know a xenon gas perhaps uh if we speak about propulsion systems uh I think that it&#x27;s uh better to refer uh to another step of our work which is called impulse gravity generator and this work attracted uh not only the attention of NASA but also the attention of Boeing and Boeing Phantom Works in particular they have a special research in this field uh so if we uh refer to this field uh this is a bit different but based practically on the same mechanism so we again have a super conducting dis uh which is made of two layers but uh uh thermal treatment and chemical composition is a bit different so we have different crystal structure and we organize um a a high voltage discharge through this superconductor and uh it&#x27;s a very unusual experiment I think nobody in the world ever repeated it uh so we use the principle of the vand gra generator and we have uh the difference of voltages close to 2 million uh we have superconducting material which is cooled and the whole system is in the vacuum chamber and during the discharge U again uh in the magnetic field during the discharge the superconducting material emits gravitational wave or um a portion of gravitons which propagate in space with extremely big speed and are able to uh uh provide some pressure or interact with the materials uh in the area in the projection area of this impulse so this interaction is very short in time it&#x27;s F seconds or let&#x27;s say uh 1 million over second and uh uh we have um uh this impulse which hits the subjects or all the objects in the projection area and propagates uh um further not losing any energy at least measurable energy so uh we began these experiments about 6 years ago and our first article was published uh on the net in the year 2000 and this is uh the the iCal basis of this work was done by Dr jaavan mza and this is a very serious research and uh it has extremely uh good potential because uh this gravity impulse uh is able to propagate with the speeds close to 64c which is 64 times faster uh than the speed of light but uh we have no limitations because we don&#x27;t work with any material objects uh they practically have no mass and uh this impulse is able to interact with light uh we made uh rather interesting research the results were published in the um uh magazine of uh uh the Journal of low temperature physics uh in August of 2003 and again it&#x27;s with Dr Moda so this is another application of uh high temperature superconductors uh and the discharge and uh the force of the discharge uh can be can be uh rather strong at first we uh were able only to work with the pendulums and uh just only the best thing that we uh were able to do was to push a thick book away from the table uh it was standing just a vocabulary uh but now when we studed uh uh when we were working with this program for several years and I have a very good team uh we were able uh to increase the power of this beam uh so now it can bend Metals uh rather uh thick plates and it can uh create holes in fragile materials such as bricks or cement or Ceramics uh and again uh if we uh say honestly do we understand in details the mechanism how it works not everything if not everything at all uh but we&#x27;re working on it and for the purposes of uh space research and uh for the communication uh very fast communication we can definitely use this impulse gravity generator and we should also uh study uh these effects um using different approaches and uh the most uh complicated the most uh precise equipment uh that uh we have that we have available in the world but when we were measuring the propagation speed of the impulse we used two atomic clock and we had the distance of slightly over than 1 kilometer so we repeated these results several tens of times and U I&#x27;m pretty sure that uh we got uh very exact values still knowing the reaction of the scientific Community or what we call politically correct science we&#x27;re a bit U afraid to publish the results openly but sooner or later we will have to do it when we&#x27;re absolutely sure and again I want to repeat that we have no intention to break any laws and if we sometimes people say oh Dr patlat you are trying to break uh the Einstein&#x27;s Law and I want uh even with the rotating discs and and I want to remind one more time that Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity is good when we speak about relative motion so every normal motion is relative but if we speak about the rotation about of the object around its own axis it&#x27;s not relative motion it&#x27;s absolute motion and the theory of relativity is not applicable to Absolute motion so please leave Dr Einstein aside that&#x27;s great okay um what the fure okay so obviously you&#x27;ve worked with NASA a bit um what what practical applications do you foresee uh the future for this knowledge here for instance um Vehicles instead of on the road are they up 3 ft off the ground moving around are they space travel Does this answer any questions of um black holes you know things of that nature well uh I can&#x27;t say anything about black holes uh because uh it&#x27;s a separate topic and uh again I&#x27;m not an expert on this but uh if we speak about um new propulsion systems definitely these gravity effects can be uh used uh and even at present the knowledge that we have uh if applied properly can result in uh very efficient uh propulsion systems close to what we call UFOs uh well in fact um I want to believe uh that they exist and uh I have nothing against I have never seen one in my life but uh from the experience that we have it&#x27;s possible to make uh the objects that will propagate in space using modification of local gravity field using polarization of vacuum and there are a lot of good theoretical Works in this field and also a lot of practical works but somehow this is a forbidden area maybe because uh there are some traditions in physics uh maybe because um there are some contradictions uh also military organizations are always interested in this uh and uh uh simply uh if we speak about anti-gravity platforms or lifters or whatever it is people say there are some contradictions with physical laws well there are some contradictions but if we compare uh quantum mechanics which is well established science in physics and general relativity there are enormous contradictions between these two theories which contradictions in formulas in understandings in basics and the whole scientific World closes the eyes they don&#x27;t want to mention it and but by the way this does not uh keep people from using both uh effects for example we use uh Einstein&#x27;s uh approach in atomic bombs and we use uh Quantum Mechanics for All Electronics and for our portable phones and both things work but they have contradictions in theory and these contradictions are really great so let&#x27;s not be afraid of contradictions it&#x27;s quite normal simply we don&#x27;t understand uh physics well enough and this is the science which um uh should um it&#x27;s a subject to Evolution so new ideas new understanding deeper knowledge that comes with every year and at present we have good theories and in various uh countries there are scientists who are working in the field of experimental Gravity Research and uh I think it&#x27;s good to pay attention to those works because the future of our civilization and the future of modern physics will be in this area and it&#x27;s absolutely clear now you know I like the to rep rep on camera that quote you typed me I love it it was uh you said something like um the one who controls gravity will control the world uh well there are some good sayings uh uh also gravity will set us free but freedom is only for those people who think differently and so we are trying to think differently and I think will succeed in our research and the history of science proves it because we had normal phones then uh cell phones and uh we had uh primitive calculating machines now we have computers now we go to space and practically there are no limits unless these limits are created artificially and that&#x27;s the thing which I&#x27;m afraid of and there is one more saying that um one more interesting thing uh people should approach all um new changes and all new research Fields with open mind because a mind is like a parachute it only works when open that&#x27;s great um have you maybe you guys haven&#x27;t come across it yet but and this could be like a very quick answer when I think spinning does it cause any kind of radio interference if you had a radio playe would it cre no no this uh installation doesn&#x27;t produce any bad effects but if we speak about impulse gravity generator we put a faraday cage over the installation otherwise uh all the the computers in the surrounding area will be burned so there are some still unexplored uh fields which accompany these effects and we noticed them these questions that you wrote down here you know they are specifically um I can run it one thing that I wanted to ask I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s um it might be kind of off bound as well but you&#x27;re saying that you&#x27;re using materials now um as opposed to the superc conductors like normal materials um what would they be a second you know what actually it&#x27;s fine not that out go ahead uh I just wanted to emphasize that it is not necessary always to use uh super conducting materials for the Gravity Research but these materials are very good as model materials we can uh practically create whatever magnetic fields we want and use the properties of both the Einstein condensate as far as we understand uh how the system works we can move to normal materials because uh the key to polarizing space is also rotating magnetic fields uh which work in uh a certain uh resonance cycle and uh in order to create these conditions we don&#x27;t need superconductors we just need normal materials okay I think we pretty much covered this but I was just wondering on like um this is more for like getting down on the Layman side of things um and kind of going back to like the applications and implications of your work um but do you see it um what kind of what kind of like the vehicles of the future and the weapons of the future and things like that that may come through this or uh uh well first of all I&#x27;m a scientist I&#x27;m not a military person and I try to uh keep uh the results of the research of my team and of my colleagues on the net it&#x27;s open to everyone and uh I&#x27;m ready uh to have scientific and Industrial contacts with any organization that is in interested in this uh research and in this methods in these methods but definitely uh everything can be used for military purposes uh the planes the UFOs if we build one uh gravity impulse generator but they can also be used uh for the purposes of defense and uh if we speak about different uh space bodies that approach Earth with big speed or if we speak about uh drilling um uh to very um deep uh level inside the earth if we speak about propagation system if we speak about Communications so there can be different um applications military scientific medical Tech technical uh whatever you say great great that&#x27;s perfect um I was just wondering as well um what are the general criticisms or like um I don&#x27;t criticism is necessarily the right word but what are the things you generally come up against with your peers the um with this Theory because obviously it&#x27;s a groundbreaking Theory what are the things that kind of um uh challenge people the most uh Frankly Speaking I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ve never met any serious uh scientific opposition in this field uh because first of all these results are unique at present only several Laboratories in the world tried some uh simplified approach to the same problem but uh people who worked in this uh area for uh several years or who contacted me they are convinced that uh we are not creating any new signs we just uh opening the pages which were not open before us of course some people say you go against Newton you go against Einstein and then these are usually the professors of physics and then we have a very interesting discussion and I say please uh Professor could you tell me what exactly we are talking about and after half an hour or even 10 minutes of discussion we came to a conclusion that uh most of the professors of physics they did not study the works of Einstein nor the works of uh Sir Isaac Newton uh I&#x27;m not an expert uh on their works but I spent uh several weeks at the library of the British museum in London and I studied the works of Sir Isaac in the original the language is a bit different but quite understandable and uh uh I&#x27;m not very good at German though I can read but I used all the translations from the work of of Einstein and his lectures and his books and his articles and I found that a lot of things uh my experiments the experiments of my team they prove a lot of theoretical statements that were made by Newton or Einstein and people who want to criticize me they practically um have no background in this field so um I was just wondering um it&#x27;s kind of not that direct a question but obviously um you&#x27;ve had the interest from NASA that have approached you um is this something that worldwide everyone&#x27;s interested in or are you to kind of really push the point to get people excited well yeah uh NASA is interested definitely uh British airspace uh is interested uh people in France are interested there is enormous interest from China because they have very good theoreticians in this field and uh they are building uh slowly but surely uh the research program in this field uh there are certain difficulties even for people who are working in this area because if we uh if we discuss the problems of gravity or anti-gravity it&#x27;s like a red flag people become excited uh they uh it&#x27;s too unusual to take it openly because for many years uh these topics were shown only in the scientific literature or uh science fiction and also in some films so uh now we need a very good U scientific analysis of the situation and uh we need to accept uh experimental Gravity Research as one of the uh leading fields in physics that is important even in NASA you know NASA is a very conservative organization much more conservative than British airospace a lot of people are working there they are normal Engineers rather good Engineers but they have also assistant directors and managers who would like to continue their work in NASA uh for several years more and uh they&#x27;re not flexible they try to base their research even with um International Space Station and shuttle program uh on the technology of nuts and bolts and that&#x27;s not the way to explore space and uh the president of the United States Mr Bush uh made an excellent uh program for NASA uh and um he made a interview on the TV uh concerning the exploration of deeper space everything was right but one thing was missing they don&#x27;t have the technology which allows this exploration so the the best thing to do is to concentrate on the modern aspects of physics on experimental Gravity Research and to put even five% of funding which is available for the International Space Station to This research and in that case in 10 years we can get a new flying vehicle which will fly all over the globe and even to deeper space hold on one second I can&#x27;t change my do have to change your TAP yeah yeah got I just got those was um I was just wondering if you could elaborate on um Eric leight&#x27;s gyroscopes and his um results in Mass transfer okay just a couple of yeah oh sorry uh I don&#x27;t want to criticize uh NASA people they hardworking people and they determined definitely but uh the administration of NASA uh has in my point of view poor understanding what should be done and uh I have my greatest respect for John Glenn the first American uh astronaut and the former member of the US Congress and uh he uh supported with all his forces uh the uh breakthrough propulsion system research and the research What U was begun with uh superconductors and each time he came to Marshall space flight center he was met uh with joy and with respect and people promised everything and he is a very wise person he understands what uh the future is about but then he left uh and uh the research was slowly uh stopped and now it is practically at zero point and sometimes people uh still remember John Glennon said oh he wanted this research to be continued but then mod Administration John Glenn he is a very old guy he can hardly understand what is going on it&#x27;s their mistake he understands perfectly what is going on okay um yes so um I was just wondering a bit about Bill and Eric Le weight&#x27;s Mass transfer and his linear motor how that um like especially his gyroscopes and the mass transfer how that relates to how that kind of helped your you and how that kind of related to your uh as I already mentioned uh uh he was working with uh absolute motion that is the uh fast rotation of the massive body around its own axis and it&#x27;s possible uh also to use the rotation around two aises so uh it&#x27;s a good approach uh and uh when he demonstrated his uh findings uh London uh uh Imperial College where he worked it was a sensation and everybody could see how he was holding a very heavy uh geoscope on his finger and uh the geoscope was about 25 kilos and he was holding it uh on his finger and he was not a very strong man but quite a usual professor and uh it&#x27;s a measurable effect which can be repeated which can be used uh but unfortunately I think two months after he demonstrated this effect he was fired from this uh prestigious University and they continue Their Own Line uh Professor lweight uh went to the United States but uh and he organized a nice research there but unfortunately he got ill and soon after that he passed away so uh but that&#x27;s one more uh proof that how difficult it is to work in this area modern science is like whole Inquisition that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a bit afraid my last one myself I&#x27;ll keep on having a last one uh just again for the Layman I was wondering if you could uh Describe the term zero point uh 0o Point Energy um well it&#x27;s uh uh let&#x27;s say it in simple words uh we deal with normal bodies uh body can be solid gas liquid and plasma but we also deal with subatomic particles which have the size of 40 uh orders of magnitude smaller than the electron and there are various kinds of these particles they have their own lws of energy of mechanical motion of uh super fluidity of pressure and of um let&#x27;s say coherence because uh we can speak about um scolar fields we can speak about coherent vacuum uh it&#x27;s becoming a bit complicated I understand but we can deal with these uh subatomic particles they form The Ether or the fundamental particles uh and the whole universe is made of these particles so it&#x27;s possible to extract energy from this sea from this ocean of particles it&#x27;s possible uh to navigate inside uh uh this media it&#x27;s possible um to create warm holes it&#x27;s possible to travel with a speed uh much more than the speed of light because the laws which govern these uh subatomic particles are different we are now we are now only approaching the stage where we can understand or analyze these laws they are still not known to us but nothing stops us from studying them and Gravity Research should be one of the first in this field because it&#x27;s important for our civilization important important for our future well anyway it&#x27;s good to have a flying sorcerer instead of the car just parked near your balcony it&#x27;s and it should be silver definitely okay I got a question here um okay um is there anything okay man long time ago looked to the sky and he saw a bird flying and he said I&#x27;d like to be able to do that so he had a model he had something to build or to idealize to dream about to want to fly um is there anything that you know about on the planet besides the dis that could demonstrate um anti-gravity well we don&#x27;t say Antigravity we want to say grav meditation uh there are different places on Earth where uh we have uh gravity anomalies there are some places in in the United States uh uh there are some places in Britain there are some places in other countries sometimes they are situated on the land sometimes on the sea surface and uh from time to time these areas become active well we know about Bermuda Triangle uh lots of Science Fiction uh things written about these areas but we also known about different crashes of um airplanes and uh uh they happen in different parts of the world so there are some theories which uh prove that uh some parts of our globe have um uh an have anomalies in um gravity properties in the properties of magnetic fields electric fields and uh when the Earth is rotating around itself and around uh the sun uh these areas become active in a certain order and then we have very unusual effects because uh if we turn to the statistics of air crashes sometimes when the plan plane crashes it travels about uh half a kilometer or 1 kilm about a mile on the surface which is understandable but sometimes the plane crashes and it gives the exact print on the land and it can be explained only by anomalies in the gravity field and the Earth still contains a lot of puzzles which we do not know but which should be studied so this is if we refer to nature but also we live in the artificial world and we can we have artificial means and we have even now enough knowledge to make experiments in this field and these experiments are needed because each time I see the shuttle going to space I understand that is a very big bomb going to space and a very big risk for the astronauts that&#x27;s why applying new propulsion systems and the systems which allow to operate with gravity forces we can make those trips much safer much uh easier and uh uh less expensive than the existing programs also if we deal with uh energy production these new methods will allow us to extract energy from different different sources and to stop that um the use of oil which in my understanding should be used not for the uh for the vehicles but only for chemistry uh new plastic materials or something of this kind I agree that show you real quick I was just think did you did you cover the um the way that like uh in future like Interstellar exploration obviously you use the gravitational pull of different planets uh to give you a lot of your propulsion but how would um a gravitational manipulation device work would you have to kind of like see where the nearest gravitational field is and like take planets as you go past them or I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t kind of understand if you could expand on that well uh I have some projects uh which were created in collaboration with uh and some drawings uh uh in collaboration with my American colleagues and my colleagues from U Italy from Great Britain from Russia and from China uh also from Canada sorry I forgot and uh uh it&#x27;s possible uh to use bifel Brown effect uh which is a kind of U electrostatic propulsion and uh to use uh the phenomenon uh which we call the polarization of space uh when we create the polarization of space uh in under the conditions of normal uh Earth that means that we create a kind of a gravity well and all the subjects all the objects that are close to this area they will fall fall into this well so uh we U observe this phenomena as a UFO or any flying disc which goes uh up but in fact uh speaking uh in physical terms that means that this object is falling inside a gravity well so this is about uh how we can propagate uh close to the Earth if we speak about other planets uh it&#x27;s a bit early now to discuss uh how it can be done but uh using the same principle polarization of space and uh uh a possibility uh to move in the media of um sub Quantum particles everything is possible but as I mentioned first of all I am not an expert expt on gravity second thing I&#x27;m not a magician I&#x27;m just learning maybe I will become [Music] one</p>
