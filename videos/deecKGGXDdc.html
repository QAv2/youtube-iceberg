            <p>all right hello everyone out there uh it&#x27;s a little different because I&#x27;ve been doing videos on Tree of Life for so long but uh we&#x27;ve got uh that kind of um not finished but uh we&#x27;ve got it to a certain point uh that we are able to move on to different subjects and uh today I&#x27;m just going to give just a little bit of background or maybe autobiographical information about our next unit in this course on this channel and um we&#x27;re going to be talking about the reciprocal system of theory and uh you may or may not have ever heard of the reciprocal system other than [Music] um you know what I&#x27;m uh what I&#x27;ve talked about in my videos um I actually I&#x27;ve been studying the reciprocal system for over 20 years and I have never personally ever met another person who&#x27;s ever heard of it so it&#x27;s not very there are people out there there&#x27;s a network out there there&#x27;s some websites out there there&#x27;s an organization out there or two um but it is not uh not in the public Consciousness and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to change or at least you know I&#x27;d be happy just to you know have a few people who get turned onto the reciprocal system due to um you know my channel well anyway the reciprocal system of theory uh is a theory that was originally um invented or discovered by Dewey B Larson and uh Dewey B Larson kind of first guided inkling of the reciprocal system uh back oh about 1930. and he was born in 1898. uh served in World War One and became a I think he was a mechanical engineer and but he he did a lot of kind of uh fiddling around or you know working on little side projects uh satisfy his curiosity having to do with various aspects of science I think he was working on um an equation for the inter-atomic distance of uh different atoms different atoms have a different uh when they pack together they they have a different uh you know different distances that they separate from each other in this closest packing kind of just like this geometrical grid you know um so we&#x27;re we&#x27;re down at that level of of the grid and um you know different atoms packed together in different formations and have different distances between each other in closest packing well anyway Larson was working on something like that and he was stumped he was having problems figuring it out and uh he said that he was just walking across the street one day and he almost tripped over his own feet uh when he came up with the Epiphany that you know maybe I should try to um assume for the purposes of solving this equation that time and space are reciprocals of each other and so that was kind of his start on that uh which he said said was about 1930. I&#x27;m going to go over his history a little bit more thoroughly in a subsequent video this is going to be more autobiographical but I&#x27;m just gonna start here with that and so for the next 30 years or so you know he had a day job and you know so he was making slow progress on this trying to figure out what it all added up to because once he did that once he assumed that time and space were reciprocals of each other uh he started coming up with answers that made sense and and so he you know anytime he came up against the problem he was like why don&#x27;t I try that time and space reciprocal assumption again and it would provide more answers and so he put that in his memory bank and was like ah this is an interesting concept what do I make of it well it took him really almost 30 years to um publish anything that was really related to that he I think his first book was called the case against the nuclear atom where he was basically arguing against uh there being a nucleus in an atom um now that book was not really directly related to his theory um but I guess it got him a little bit of um notoriety I think he was um he was out at Oregon State in Corvallis and um I believe he was a friend of Linus paulings and I think Isaac Asimov wrote a positive review for that that first book um but then later on that year he put out uh the structure of the physical universe and um that was you know um it was a work that was not really completed but uh it it started to lay out his theory and so then for the next 30 years or so until his death in 1990 he was consistently putting out books and articles um on everything and what you notice about the reciprocal system is that it is a system a system of theory it&#x27;s not a theory it&#x27;s a system of theory meaning that if you understand the theory you have a system meaning that if you understand the theory you can apply the theory to anything okay so that is that&#x27;s something that really caught my attention uh was that you can you can take this Theory and apply it to everything and into into other subjects and so as a result uh before the end of Larson&#x27;s life he had books on uh physics and astrophysics astronomy Chemistry by uh he had chapters of books on biology philosophy he had a couple books on economics [Music] um he dabbled into metaphysics and religion uh dream interpretation um I&#x27;m probably forgetting a few other uh subjects um but he basically was saying that if you understand the reciprocal system you can apply it to any subject okay so for me uh I&#x27;m a historian Okay I uh well first I went to law school I have a law degree I bailed out of that very quickly thank God and uh you know didn&#x27;t uh didn&#x27;t get into the uh British uh registry or whatever you know that all lawyers have to um you know bow down to uh become a British subject um you know to get uh a license to pla practice law but uh eventually I ended up going to graduate school and getting a PhD in history Okay so once I I finished my PhD in like 2001 and sometime uh for the the next year I was an adjunct uh like our lecturer uh on American history at the same University that I was um that I did my grad studies at and so I was you know teaching for a year and I was thinking about going on the job market trying to get a professor job I really didn&#x27;t want to do that because that&#x27;s not what I want to grad school for in the first place and um you know I just didn&#x27;t want to do all of the rigmarole involved in going to graduations flying around the country going to conferences um you know that&#x27;s just not the way I live my life uh that&#x27;s not what I was there for um but I was still you know considering all that trying to weigh everything out and um when I was in graduate school my dissertation was on um on a couple groups of very obscure Jazz musicians in Chicago in the 1950s and 60s uh if you&#x27;d like to get a you know if you send me if you send me 15 bucks I will send you a copy of my book there on these Jazz musicians I also have my book on tree of life that&#x27;s 10 bucks uh you can send out either one of those uh to me on cash app or venmo I&#x27;ll send you a copy of those um my dissertation is actually like probably the most interesting dissertation that&#x27;s ever been written which um you know doesn&#x27;t say much because almost all the dissertations are super dry and boring mine at least is interesting and it&#x27;s on a great topic um but that&#x27;s not uh what we&#x27;re talking about here but anyway what we it&#x27;s related in that a lot of these Jazz musicians but I had this Inkling even before all of this maybe from taking too many psychedelics or whatever but I was always interested in space and time physics and you know uh theory of relativity and and uh Consciousness studies and all of these different things um that I had no basis for it you know uh I&#x27;m a liberal arts person I took all these classes in high school you know I took chemistry and physics and astronomy I think I even took I took astronomy even in uh in college I took chemistry in college I started off in college as a chemical engineer and couldn&#x27;t hack it in in calculus second semester calculus it destroyed me um I ended up doing pretty well in the third semester calculus but I&#x27;m not um I&#x27;m not a science I don&#x27;t have a strong science scientific background um it&#x27;s I&#x27;m very good at math I&#x27;m very good at numbers but uh calculus baffled me then still Buzz um and I think that a lot of that is because it&#x27;s fraudulent but I I might be wrong about that so but uh anyway I was I had an interest in all of these subjects and so um but also the musicians that I studied that I wrote my dissertation on they were interested in these subjects too and they were also very interested in egyptology uh you know the pyramids and you know the golden ratio um you know and that&#x27;s maybe where I even got my uh start with like tree of life and everything but I read um I I was reading I was working on trying to turn my dissertation into a book and so I was doing some uh research on some of uh the musicians I was reading an interview with this guy Anthony Braxton who is a multi-instrumentalist mostly a saxophone player um and composer um I believe Anthony is still alive uh he&#x27;s got some really fantastic music some of it is you know a little bit inaccessible and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s definitely a very eccentric guy I think he wrote he wrote a um I think he wrote a cat had one composition that was for a hundred tubas so and but he and he had all kinds of uh he wouldn&#x27;t title his his uh compositions uh he would use symbols um you know you know 40 years before you know 30 years before Prince was doing it I guess but he would just use uh symbols to express his his compositions and and uh he he wrote this book also called the triaxium writings which is like 1600 pages and there&#x27;s pros in there but he&#x27;s got symbols uh diagrams um that Express all of it uh also but anyway what Braxton said that caught caught me at this particular moment was that um he said you know time has more than one dimension and uh because one dimensional time that&#x27;s just tempo but we pray we play uh polyrhythms we play syncopation those are those are penetrating into other dimensions of time and that struck me I don&#x27;t know exactly why um but I had I guess I hadn&#x27;t really considered uh time having more than one dimension and uh so I did a quick search [Music] um this was back in 2001 or maybe two so went on the internet and um I guess I probably had to go to all the way to campus just to even get on the internet but uh I was like I wonder if any physicists talk about multi-dimensional time and the first thing I pulled up was Dewey B Larson I believe the book was new light on space and time which is a book that he wrote I think about 1965. and uh started reading it and uh Mr Larson is a uh he&#x27;s a good writer but he is a he&#x27;s not a good teacher uh a lot of times he buries his his uh main points in the middle of paragraphs in the middle of chapters uh he&#x27;s hard to read I was reading Larson at you know one or two pages per hour I was just trying to get because I started reading it and I don&#x27;t know he&#x27;s he said some things where I was like I know he&#x27;s right about this that he&#x27;s he&#x27;s on to something he&#x27;s really on to something here but I don&#x27;t know exactly what he&#x27;s talking about where he&#x27;s going but it&#x27;s but there was something there that kept me going to try to figure out what he was saying even though most of what he was saying was impenetrable uh impenetrable he he he writes um it&#x27;s not accessible uh to a lay person a lot of times he uses um scientific terms and if you don&#x27;t really know what those mean you have to go back and look them up um and so it&#x27;s just a really slow sledding through Larson but I was by the time I finished that first chapter I was pretty much convinced that he was on to something I you know I couldn&#x27;t say that he was totally right about everything but I knew he was onto something so I started doing some more research on it and um I think I&#x27;ll probably leave it there right now uh and get into this part two uh part two um of the Dewey Larson uh my autobiographical experience with Larson just it&#x27;s just to kind of give you a little bit of background I guess not only into Larson but into me and why it&#x27;s important to me that uh that I teach this and uh why I think it should be important to you because um it&#x27;s had a profound uh effect on my life and um I really think it can help a lot of people um I&#x27;ll just I&#x27;ll just say one more thing about it is that I that I feel like Dewey Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system is like the great equalizer in uh in science because uh the tar I feel like the target audience for Larson is like the intelligent 13 year old who&#x27;s never taken any science classes before and if you can get them on the reciprocal system before they start to take science classes and get their minds infected with this kind of masonic uh scientific Dogma then um you know they can totally take off with it and so I feel like the the best audiences for Larson&#x27;s system are intelligent people who don&#x27;t have that kind of Science Background everybody that I&#x27;ve talked to who is like a real a real scientist kind of in the eighth sphere um categorization they pretty much reject Larson outright um I remember I went to see a physicist at at that University that I did my PhD at and I set up an appointment with her went in and kind of gave her a five minute Spiel on on Dewey Larson and her response was um I&#x27;ve never heard of him and of course you know that time only has one dimension and now it&#x27;s time for you to leave and I mean she didn&#x27;t say and it&#x27;s time for you to leave but those first two things that&#x27;s a quote I&#x27;ve never heard of him and of course you know time only has one dimension and then she scolded me and said you&#x27;re lucky I&#x27;m being nice to you because if you would have went and talked to the the chair of the of the physics department he would have like torn you a new one basically is what she said she she basically kicked me out of her office she wasn&#x27;t interested in the least in what I had to say so that also struck me um but I will uh resume this conversation either later today or tomorrow uh and we&#x27;re we&#x27;re gonna get it weight into the Dewey Larson uh very slowly uh and we&#x27;re gonna wait in uh at the on the shallow end because he does have non-scientific books on our books on liberal arts he&#x27;s got uh and social sciences he&#x27;s got a couple books on economics but especially he has a book on um metaphysics that&#x27;s called beyond space and time and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to start with first we get into beyond space and time we learn his theory and how to apply his theory and then we can get into the scientific books so that&#x27;s the order of the day again if you&#x27;d like to donate to the channel just uh hit me up on venmo or cash app listed in the description and my books are also on sale uh if you want to send a copy of my jazz book or a copy of my Tree of Life Book you can hit me up there too all right have a good day</p>
