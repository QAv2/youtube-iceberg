            <p>so yeah we&#x27;re here live from the crown plaza hotel in albuquerque um i&#x27;m joined with uh with some some people from tesla tech right now let me see if i can switch the camera there we go so we&#x27;re here with uh russell anderson and also uh lucian ionesco lucian ionesco um who presented at the conference uh did you guys present already both of you and um so we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna have uh lucian and and and uh russell anderson talk and and give us a little bit of uh an overview of what they presented so russell great it&#x27;s great to have you here you know i i should say i should say hi to russell russell i haven&#x27;t talked to you in years it&#x27;s good to see you again sir well doing doing well doing well oh well i for the last several months i i&#x27;ve been moderating the conference although uh jeremy and mark there that they&#x27;re they&#x27;ve been having most of the fun so they get to actually build stuff i i just act as traffic cop yeah where&#x27;s the serial device we want a serial device so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s yeah and so yeah i i what i&#x27;ve done is handed the feed over i&#x27;ve got it spotlighted on and i guess we can all switch things up but i&#x27;ve got spotlighted on jeremy my cell phone has a second view of the room so you can spotlight both cameras and we&#x27;ll get two views of the room um let me see marks opal i just came in add spotlight there we go now now we can have both views back is that you on your phone right that&#x27;s on my phone yeah okay you have to do a little improvising like that okay perfect yeah oh wonderful yeah actually that looks that looks pretty darn good okay i will mute myself out all right and you can uh all right so um why don&#x27;t we start with uh you want to start with um russell or mark uh russell or lucian uh [Music] [Music] what i have is some foundations [Music] using the quark model and the structure of the electric charge which gives a slight correction to what electromagnetism would give and that&#x27;s not a surprise for many of us who know that electromagnetism and gravity are connected and then um looking around i stumbled upon the theory which anticipated this um let&#x27;s say 40 50 years ago a theory of frederick alsophone which anticipated that if you orient the nuclei and the spins of the protons and neutrons then you should be able to control gravity so now this foundation based on quark structure shows clearly that indeed that&#x27;s what has to happen so in some sense we expect the experiments did by also phone to to really lead to a control of gravity so to make things simpler the main point is people should know that gravity is not a fundamental force it&#x27;s derived from um what i can i mean i can refer to electro weak theory but to just put it simply gravity is not a fundamental force it can be controlled so people should start contributes to this amazing research both theoretical and experimental if if they want to see in the next 10 years say star trek news at 10 instead of just the show as i was saying it&#x27;s very interesting that you&#x27;re mentoring quarks and really going down to the fundamentals of you know what&#x27;s inside of the atom what&#x27;s inside matter how does that relate to the alzephon experiment in theory so that&#x27;s the key of let&#x27;s say my contribution to his theory so let&#x27;s take a neutral a neutron is theoretically neutral from an electric point of view if you view it as a point wise charge but the moment you look at the structure of a neutron built out of three quarks uh down down up with a negative one third negative one third and plus two thirds which give a total of zero electric charge but the moment you look at this structure and then you take two neutrons with some spin orientations then there is a rather tensorial force um acting between the two which in first approximation is zero so in first approximation it looks like they are they are neutral but the correction which is a tiny tiny contribution depends on the orientation of the two neutrons and naturally they will orient towards minimizing the energy and that gives a tiny attraction which justifies and is the candidate for gravity so i say candidate because at this stage we don&#x27;t have a mathematical proof of the fact that this attraction equals neurons let&#x27;s say attraction and gives newton&#x27;s constant but for theoreticians this is a challenge prove that this tensorial attraction yields and one can compute the universal uh gravitational attraction of newton and that would be an amazing result so just qualitatively uh it justifies that orienting the constituents of the nuclei and let&#x27;s say the the spin of the nucleus overall would uh affect the weight and that&#x27;s the let&#x27;s say essence of alzheimer&#x27;s theory for which now we have a standard model justification so we expect the experiments to give positive results there is a statistic fluctuation involved so it temperature will definitely play a role and if the if it&#x27;s room temperature uh they are right so you can orient let&#x27;s say uh let&#x27;s say two percent ten percent of the spins but they&#x27;ll lose because of the temperature and motion they&#x27;ll lose the orientation so temperature will go against this coherent process of orienting the nuclei but otherwise if you could lower the temperature as much as you want and theoretically you could shoot for 99 of weight loss i&#x27;m shooting for 100. to make it if you make it weightless then it becomes equivalent to nothing right so i i mean at lower temperatures like superconductive temperatures we know that there is a locking mechanism of the in magnetic field so probably there will be like a possibility lock to 100 loss of gravity and amazingly if we believe in einstein&#x27;s uh and we all do that mass inertial mass equals gravitational mass as a charge then it means when nullifying the inertial mast then there is no obstacle towards some zigzagging whatever you want with a spaceship based on this new technology which we expect in the next i would say 10 years or so we would expect to go to alpha story with such technology right yes but the solar on a day trip to mars that&#x27;s a great place to go check out the environment there on jupiter so we also have russell anderson over here russell&#x27;s actually been working with us at tesla tech or are we going to jeremiah first um jeremiah&#x27;s got to go and give a presentation a live demonstration so i wanted him to just talk real quick because he&#x27;s got he&#x27;s got a live demonstration that&#x27;s coming up so i&#x27;m going to have him go he&#x27;s got to go downstairs and run so we&#x27;re going to have him go real quick i&#x27;m sorry sorry to cut you off russell man it&#x27;s not an issue of importance or he&#x27;s just uh</p>
