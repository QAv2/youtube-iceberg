            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>yeah hi everyone h s here reporting from Oakland uh today is the 20th of May 2024 just back from my smoko break and ready to do another um Talk video yes um for this one uh prob be saying every single time but really a very very interesting topic or subject is of course that of free energy um anti-gravity and other such uh suppressed inventions and um you know we&#x27;ve all heard of it before and I remember reading a lot about it when I was um younger and even sort of in more recent years and wondering about it and um you know we&#x27;ve all heard about certain inventions that were suppressed um you know usually for certain commercial interests um again don&#x27;t quote me on any of this because it&#x27;s based on things that I&#x27;ve read and that I&#x27;ve um things that I&#x27;ve heard of and I&#x27;m not entirely sure or um you know whether they really existed or if it&#x27;s just sort of a bit of hearsay um and also I&#x27;m not entirely sure of the full or the certain details but um I remember hearing it was actually a New Zealander who lived in wongi which is a smaller City in the north island of New Zealand um and it was him um living in wongi back in the 1970s he developed uh for example a motor or an engine that could run on water that&#x27;s what I heard and and um as you would expect certain things happened and he just suddenly mysteriously vanished you know and other things have happened as well um on on different levels you know um other similar events have happened um because obviously think about what they would do to the you know the all you know the all powerful oil companies obviously and and you hear other such inventions as well like I remember hearing about someone inventing basically a silver sort of um paint that when appli to building such as houses and Office Buildings when applied to buildings it would be enough to really insulate those buildings so you really wouldn&#x27;t need any other form of insulation or even heating it would basically keep those buildings warm inside and of course that could that would be very very useful in terms of saving on costs of insulation installing insulation and maintaining it and of course the cost of heating as well the constant ongoing cost of heating um we&#x27; heard about the old um SoCal you know forgotten engine of hydrogen you know um having cars run on hydrogen and that was never really introduced of course electrical engines or electrical motors have been there for a very long time in fact electrical motors were there even before petrol ones were the the petrol internal internal combustion engine uh was introduced first in the 1860s uh so to think we&#x27;re still using a tech technology based on the 1860s today here in the 2020s I mean come on surely we can do better than that and I think we definitely can do better than that and we should have of course done better than that but you know unfortunately interests get in the way don&#x27;t they and at the end of the day someone just has to make money and whether it&#x27;s at the expense of not only People&#x27;s Health in terms of pollution but the whole planet in terms of you know all life um on it not just us so um yeah so just to think electrical um murders in cars were actually there before pit ones were and now they&#x27;re making a comeback even today as I speak in 2024 they really are making a good comeback I mean I bought an electric car myself back in early 2019 and I think it was about premature because um the model I bought it it was um in the same Leaf um a very common electrical um electric car at the time I bought it in the early 2019 and it was a 2011 model so the the car was obviously 8 years old but maybe less obviously the battery was 8 years old and it was um running on technology that was 8 years old and in those 8 years the technology of batteries had really enhanced so the battery was out of dat but also having aged in those eight years the battery had deteriorated as well so it was an electric car and it was awesome that I could charg it at home but it really didn&#x27;t go far on a single charge it did a laughable poultry even pathetic 70 km on a single charge that&#x27;s all it did 70 km on a single charge and you might even laugh at this this but um when I moved up to Oakland which is um further north in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island near the top of New Zealand&#x27;s North Ireland and I moved here to Oakland from where I used to be in Wellington which being the capital city at the bottom of New Zealand&#x27;s North Ireland when I moved I um this was back in April 2021 so just over three years ago when I moved up to Oakland um obviously I had my things um transported up by truck but I drove my car and I kept my most fragile thing in the car so you know they were being transported properly without damage but obviously I had to drive my car and really in retrospect I probably should have just put it on a train and just caught a plane up because the flight time is only 1 hour from Wellington to Oakland whereas to drive up is a good sort of 8 hours because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s approximately 700 kilm 700 km from Wellington to Oakland and remember I drove the electric car right and it could only do 70 kilm on a single charge whereas what I had to drive was 700 km times that so yes you guess I actually stopped 10 times to have to charge the car and um I found the charging stations and I remember planning it as well to make sure I didn&#x27;t get stuck and thank God I didn&#x27;t get stuck anywhere I didn&#x27;t run out of charge although I came very close to some instances and I remember feeling you know very anxious about it but um jeez I had to stop 10 times to charge the car to charge the battery and each time it charge at at a fast charger it took about 40 minutes and so I started like 6:00 in the morning and got there like 11: at night it was basically 8 hours of driving but approximately or even roughly another 8 hours of just waiting for the car to be charged and I remember I just in those eight hours when I waited for it to be charged I just did everything like I I had breakfast lunch and dinner and three different occasions if I remember quickly another Char during another charge I WR up on the news on my phone during another charge I slept during another one I went out for a walk during another one I went out for coffee during yet another one I checked the email pH you get the idea just basically did anything everything I could to pass the time and it was really annoying but never knew even had that much of patience but hey at least I wasn&#x27;t travel with anyone else and sending know KS so I guess that helped but um but coming back to it um electric cars are starting to make a comeback even today in 2024 and you know ignoring back then when I bought the electric car in 2019 or when I drove up from Wellington to Oakland 700 K in 2021 electric car the technology is getting better and they also becoming more affordable um they&#x27;re able to go further on a single charge um and and all that um so certainly they&#x27;re BEC more practical but still even today they are at least from what I see here in New Zealand um they are quite expensive you do need to be fairly well off to have an electric car um the electric car I had thean Leaf I sold as you um I think around mid 2021 a few months after I moved up here to Oakland and then I in early 2022 I bought not a Petr car I really didn&#x27;t want to go back to that cuz I really wanted to do as much as I could for the environment but um I bought a hybrid I guess you know I remember someone telling me Oh basically The Best of Both Worlds and that&#x27;s what I have now it&#x27;s a Toyota Aqua 2012 model which I bought in 2022 and I still have it today and yeah Best of Both Worlds um and it&#x27;s certainly a step there but hopefully if things go well my next car can be fully an electric car and something which would be more affordable and certainly more practical than what I had before so okay electric cars making a bit of a comeback but maybe it is a bit late they really should have come back before or we should have had another such alternative as opposed to fossil fuel or oil you know and um and certain things have been proposed over time like I mentioned you had the um the hydrogen engine possibly engines that ran on water like the guy from Wong in New Zealand which I heard invented one back in the 1970s and um and I think there was another scientist that invented one in the United States an engine that ran on water if I remember correctly I think in the 60s or 70s if I&#x27;m correct um but we hear these sort of things even going further back um you know if you talk about the emission of electricity itself um and of course many people say oh who would me to that Thomas Edison and he started up General Electric and no doubt became very wealthy from it but actually more recent research has shown that he actually ripped off Nicola Tesla who did a lot of the work and you know again mysteriously suddenly Nicola Tesla has found dead in his I think New York New York apartment and a lot of his papers had just been you know had had just a lot of his research papers and his work had just disappeared and um and a lot of people believe a lot of historians believe it was um Thomas Edison who basically ripped him off and even Nicola Tesla once went to work for Thomas Edison and he did a big job for Thomas Edison and um the job was supposed to pay him about $50,000 and this was you know I think back in the late 1800s in New York and $50,000 back then would be over a million today and when um niola Tesla went to collect payment Thomas Edison just laughed him out of his office and say oh you don&#x27;t understand American humor and so Thomas ederson didn&#x27;t even pay him for all that work he did and just you know used it for himself and Nicola Tesla um still though he um he didn&#x27;t give up he continued on and he um had a lot of his own inventions and he was someone was he was someone who was very committed to his work and he really wanted to make energy basically free for all you know for for all people and um and he he still gave a lot he still contributed a lot you know to technology things today that we take for granted like I know there was the Tesla coil which went in a lot of oldfashioned TV sets that he invented and I think he invented alternating current before in terms of the passage of energy or electricity through wires it just used to be direct current you know just from one end to the other but he invented alternating current when it could where it could go back again and I think he even invented um the um radio waves that not only transport information but could even transport electricity imagine that if you could you know through radio waves transport energy or electricity as well as just information like you know like one things that what we he on the radio for example you know if it could be more than that I think Nicola Tesla did all that and um but it was very unfortunate he he put a lot into his life he didn&#x27;t even marry or have children have a family because he basically worked very hard on his inventions but hey what he did still had a lasting impact still had a huge Legacy and I think we own a lot of credit and you know also thanks to Elon Musk you know as you&#x27;ve seen he he named to his electric car company after niola Tesla as of course it&#x27;s called Tesla or Tesla so um but we hear a lot of stories like that with Nicola Tesla and what he did and how you know very likely was ripped off by Thomas Edison and we hear things about suppressed inventions like um the engine that ran on water um and there&#x27;s there&#x27;s all that um paint which could be excellent insulation and heating for a building but there&#x27;s even other things they&#x27;ve talked about um anti-gravity being able to you know manipulate gravity so you know gravity goes in one direction right and um and it&#x27;s caused by larger masses or weights but imagine if you could manipulate gravity so you could have it Go in any direction you like and um even if you still need a weight for it and of course that would help immensely you know you can not only fall somewhere but you could also go back up you know and if you had anti-gravity you could create flying machines easily may even spaceships that could go into space much more easily than Rockets today and um geez if you had anti-gravity and even free energy you could do easily do flying cars flying machines rockets that go into space and much further into space maybe even faster to other planets and all that you know what have you um and free energy is another one that heard about for a long time and the thing with free energy it&#x27;s a bit of a misleading concept it&#x27;s as you know energy is not completely free you cannot just create or destroy en it&#x27;s it&#x27;s one of the most basic um laws in physics you can only um transform energy energy can only be transformed you know or transferred from one form into another so for example when you have say energy in petrol and it&#x27;s basically what they call potential chemical energy it&#x27;s a potential energy in the form of a chemical and then you burn it and it creates you know light heat um and of course motion you know movement and that&#x27;s of course what an internal combustion engine does so energy can only be you know transferred from one form of energy to another form it cannot be created or destroyed or for example sunlight it&#x27;s sunlight energy and then through a solar panel that&#x27;s collected and transferred into electricity for example or just like the natural to do a photosynthesis how plants you know um transfer energy from the Sun solar energy and use it to produce glucose food you know that we see in the form of plants and fruit so um you cannot just create or destroy energy but the term free energy really means sort of no human input so basically energy that for us becomes free and I guess a very easy and simple example of that is or are solar panels um once you install them you&#x27;re up and away the energy is just free and it keeps collecting energy for your building or for your house that&#x27;s what solar panels are a form of free energy but they&#x27;ve talked about um even cheaper and more easier forms of free energy unfortunately the problem with solar panels is that solar panel systems can be quite expensive to install and you not only need the panels but you need to be able to put it on a roof and then you need to feed it into an inverter an inverter which you know converts the um solar energy into proper electricity or electrical energy for use in your house or building and then of course you may need a battery to store it in and all the um Associated circuits and everything um so that can be um expensive or costly to install and um and usually people don&#x27;t aren&#x27;t able to put up The Upfront cost for it but they&#x27;ve talk about even cheaper forms of um free energy even much cheaper forms and you just sort of have just one little panel and it it can absorb energy from just you know the surrounds um that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve heard of and um apparently if you look at look it up online there are um a lot of plans for free energy devices or free energy inventions even anti-gravity and things like that you probably if you look it up and if you if you research even further you&#x27;ll probably find again even plans for energy that could run on water or at least some that&#x27;s created plans for an inch they could run on water and who believes it could work or perhaps Works in under certain conditions or to a certain extent if you know what I mean um it might not be the most efficient but it might still work you know and um it might not be the smallest engine or the cheapest engine to produce but it might still actually work and um some of the um suppressed inventions for free energy anti-gravity things like that if you look up online they&#x27;ve even got pattern numbers associated with it so some people have not only made these plans um but have even patented them you know with the US United States patent office and um as far as I know um patents go for up to um patents last for 20 years uh copyrights go for up to 50 years after your dead um so that&#x27;s um copyright but patents last for about 20 years so you know you you you might think um what if if a sin patent has expired for example the other thing with patents is that they&#x27;re any valid for the country in which they&#x27;re registered in I think you can do sort of international patterns that are um that are valid in say maybe not throughout the whole world but you know through say a group of countries or more than one country um so that&#x27;s something to look into but I just always thought you know wouldn&#x27;t it be interesting if someone I don&#x27;t really have the expertise for it myself definitely not and I can&#x27;t really afford to pay for the expertise I once thought of that but if someone could look up you know these um plans for suppressed invention such as free energy devices and anti-gravity devices um and and engines that run on alternative fuels if someone could look them up and through their own physics knowledge be able to deciple whether or not that would actually work um that&#x27;s one and then see whether or not it&#x27;s patented or currently pained and if it&#x27;s not currently pented maybe you could pend it yourself and even make a fortune of it or perhaps if it&#x27;s not pented in your own country introduce it to your own country it&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve always thought about but um definitely something I can&#x27;t do on my own I don&#x27;t have that sort of physics knowledge and I don&#x27;t really have the funds behind me to do that but it&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve always thought about I mean certainly that could be possible um you know if not worldwide just in a certain country that you&#x27;re in especially if the patent does not apply to that country and you&#x27;re able to find some plans that do work and you&#x27;re able to prove that they work whatever necessary calculations or experimentation um you have to do so this is something I&#x27;ve always thought about because I&#x27;m surely there might be well I&#x27;m not saying there should be something out there but surely there very well could be something out there which is worth looking into which could really work which could um give us free energy or at least some free energy who knows maybe even anti-gravity and um which could certainly help us maybe not completely solve our energy problems but which could certainly help with them and of course help with um preserving the environment uh maybe I&#x27;m a bit off my rocker maybe I&#x27;m a bit naive on this but it&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve always thought about and I thought I&#x27;d put it into this talk video um if you have any idea yourself feel free to contribute you can send me a message you&#x27;ll find my email address um on the about page of my YouTube Channel feel free to even say something in the comments below if there&#x27;s anything or any anything you know of or any ideas you have anything you want to add or contribute let me know I&#x27;d love to hear from you and hey hopefully I do um and not too long thank you</p>
