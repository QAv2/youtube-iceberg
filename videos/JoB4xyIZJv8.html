            <p>when most people think about electricity they think about these but what if I told you you could get electricity from thin air to get this free electricity just take these few simple parts and essentially we&#x27;re going to turn them into one of these so I started with these parts and this circuit plan and made a solderless circuit like this here I&#x27;ll check the Baseline voltage of the system before hooking it up to the antenna notice there is no voltage reading next hook up the antenna the radio waves brought in on this antenna are the source of the free electricity and now let&#x27;s measure the voltage now that we have the antenna hooked up check that out this is free electricity I&#x27;ll just hold this up so you can take a closer look at what we&#x27;re getting here so what can you do with this free electricity well I&#x27;ve just hooked up this cable so I can use it in an attempt to charge up my cell [Applause] phone nothing yet oh looks like I&#x27;ve got enough voltage and there it goes so here&#x27;s your shopping list to make your free energy receiver it&#x27;s not really free because it costs $2 but if you don&#x27;t have your own antenna you can make your own with that simple antenna wire and here is a simple circuit plan enjoy</p>
