            <p>John Greenewald: Since December of 2017, we have all been told a story. A story about a $22 million secret Pentagon UFO study. And the man who ran it.</p>
<p>But now, nearly four years later, a new book has turned much of this story upside down. According to this book, those original stories were all wrong.</p>
<p>And what we thought we knew is not the case. This new book, according to page 160, anyway, aims to simply correct the record, we found a lot. But doesn&#x27;t mean</p>
<p>should we dismiss the old claims and make room for the new ones? Although not all of the original claims are being challenged, which do we choose to believe? And which do we choose not to believe? This is the story about why for the past nearly four years, the saga that has involved a tip, Asa UFOs, a</p>
<p>ranch in Utah, infested by the paranormal, and multiple former government personnel is still riddled with confusion and lingering questions, even with this new book that aims to correct the record. Stay tuned, you&#x27;re about to journey inside</p>
<p>the black vault. That&#x27;s right, everybody. As always, thank you so much for tuning in and making this your podcast or your live stream of choice.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m your host, John Greenwald, Jr, founder and creator of the black vault calm. And I know that on this channel, I&#x27;ve been a little bit quiet lately. For that I do apologize, work has been a little bit</p>
<p>crazy. And sadly, that does have to take precedence over what I love doing. And that is creating these videos and these types of presentations for all of you.</p>
<p>Now, for those who aren&#x27;t aware, sometimes I will do behind the scenes videos live. Now if you&#x27;re watching this live, welcome, it&#x27;s going to be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re watching the pre recorded version that drops later, that&#x27;s a little bit more professionally edited and cut together. Just know subscribe to this channel. That way you get</p>
<p>notified when I do the live streams. And you can take part. Any of those who are currently watching live, you may see their questions come in, super chats are open, it&#x27;s a way to support this channel.</p>
<p>And it helps me get research like this done, it always isn&#x27;t free to start digging into some of this stuff. And some of those FOIA requests do yield some high dollar price tags 100% of what comes in through those super chats, go right into this channel and the website to create this type of</p>
<p>content. So if you do decide to support, awesome, thank you for that. If you can&#x27;t, don&#x27;t worry about it, everything is still free.</p>
<p>But the biggest help that you can give is spreading the word. Now today, what I&#x27;m going to be going over is something that has been a hot topic in the UFO world or on Twitter as some like to call it hashtag UFO Twitter.</p>
<p>And that is the new book skinwalkers at the Pentagon. Now I want to show you guys this because this is a copy that I purchased, I had posted on social media that I recommend if you guys are interested,</p>
<p>support the authors, there may be some stuff that I go over today where you may question the author&#x27;s that&#x27;s healthy, I hope that I don&#x27;t offend anybody by questioning some of the information. But in the same respect, I support published</p>
<p>authors. And so I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people really start scanning and taking pictures and posting things on social media that includes full chapters and stuff like that. I don&#x27;t support that</p>
<p>what I do support are taking quotes, which is what I&#x27;m going to do. And you may see some some pages from the book, just know all of those pages are on the Amazon free preview. So I am not</p>
<p>showing you guys anything you can&#x27;t see for free on Amazon&#x27;s free preview. But again, I want to at least plug that ahead of time that I do recommend buying the book if you want to know the full story.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;re going to get it, you&#x27;re not going to get it from me because I don&#x27;t go over everything. And you&#x27;re not going to see it on social media plus, it&#x27;s not fair.</p>
<p>So I do want to give my show of support for those authors. Because what they have done, and this is what I want to kind of go over here is essentially bring one man forward that has yet to come forward since December, or</p>
<p>arguably October of 2017. But since this whole a tip story broke, now, we didn&#x27;t know about OS app until a few months thereafter. But essentially, this was the man Dr.</p>
<p>James lick, cat ski that ran a another program, not a tip, but OS app. In the Defense Intelligence Agency, he has been Mumme, up until the last few weeks since this book came out. So that to</p>
<p>me is the biggest revelation from this book, because now we&#x27;re getting somebody side that we have never heard before. But in that process, there has been massive confusion that has reigned not only with the last three, four years, since since</p>
<p>the New York Times and political broke political broke the ATF story. But this doesn&#x27;t help in the sense to clear up all of that confusion. I&#x27;m not blaming the book or the authors, but</p>
<p>rather, I&#x27;m showing you guys, everything is not cleared up as some want us to believe there are still massive, massive amounts of confusion with all of this. But then on top of that, there are still many questions that have yet to be answered.</p>
<p>So let me go ahead and bring up the presentation that I want to do for you guys. And this will go over why that confusion continues to rain when it comes to OS app at a tip and why</p>
<p>questions continue to linger about OS app and a tip. Because I see differing viewpoints here that some want us to believe everything is transparent and has been out there for years. There&#x27;s just lazy people out there that don&#x27;t want to look at</p>
<p>the facts. Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you, I don&#x27;t consider myself lazy. I&#x27;m a lot of things, as some people will tell you, sadly, lazy is not one of them, I&#x27;d love to put my feet up</p>
<p>and, and not really do anything. But rather, I dig in. And I follow as much as I can about all of this. And there is a lot</p>
<p>of it. So what I want to show you guys today is why that confusion reigns, and the questions continue to linger. So let me go ahead and get my proper PowerPoint presentation</p>
<p>here. Give me one second. Now before I dig into some of that stuff, I want to tell you guys a little bit about me personally on how I approach research, I would say the criticism that I</p>
<p>get, I love the praise, but I also love the criticism, because it helps me become better. But one point of criticism that some people don&#x27;t like me over is what they may call the minutiae of the stories, that they feel that I nitpick that I go too far</p>
<p>into trying to pick apart what people say or what people do, or, you know, whatever it might be. And for me the way that I approach these types of topics and why I disagree with that criticism.</p>
<p>And I want to kind of give you guys a little bit of a visual representation on why I do what I do, but how I do what I do. And that is why the minutiae matters. Now I look</p>
<p>into every topic, like a puzzle. That&#x27;s how I visualize it in my mind, for 25 years, I&#x27;ve run the blackbolt. That&#x27;s what I do. There are 1000s, sometimes 10s of 1000s of pieces of that</p>
<p>puzzle, and we put it together to create a picture. Now some people out there, and this is this is kind of my, I would say point of frustration sometimes and you&#x27;ll see where I do get frustrated on social media, is they&#x27;re cool with the outer</p>
<p>layers, right? They&#x27;re they&#x27;re cool putting the puzzle together. And if they see that there&#x27;s trees there, there&#x27;s some leaves, maybe a building back here. That&#x27;s all that</p>
<p>matters to them. And they feel that they have the full picture because well what&#x27;s in the middle here, you know, grass, maybe another building? Who really cares, we have enough of the picture to believe that this is an outdoor scene.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s how they approach research. Well, I&#x27;m different. I&#x27;ve got to put everything together because when you do, and you put every</p>
<p>single piece of the puzzle together, another one usually emerges a full different perspective of what you thought was there, when you just looked at the outer layer. It&#x27;s different.</p>
<p>And those pieces of the puzzle, the center, the minutiae, the little details, when you start picking apart all of the stories and how everybody talks about this or that when you put it together, a lot of times and arguably most of the time, you get a completely different picture as what you</p>
<p>see here. So you don&#x27;t have everything you think one thing, you have it all, you see something completely different. That&#x27;s how I have always approached research. And that is</p>
<p>what the black vault is all about. Now credit to this amazing artist, oh leg shoe ply IQ I probably have that pronounced incorrectly. Google him.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s got some awesome stuff. I created the puzzle out of one of his paintings. But again, that is the best visible visualization and simplistic way</p>
<p>of looking at how I approach research. Now some of what I go over maybe review for some of you who like me have lived and breathed this since October of 2017. Why I say October, not</p>
<p>December. That is when Luis Elizondo entered the scene. That was when he talked about an aerospace Threat program that was identifying these types of threats.</p>
<p>But he never said a tip in October that was not broken until December. That October press conference by to the stars Academy introduced Luis Elizondo to the world.</p>
<p>And that was where I became incredibly intrigued about what was rumored to be this secret UFO program. Fast forward, then from October to December of that same year in New York Times and political breaks the story December 16 2017, in my opinion, will</p>
<p>forever change you Philology, in the sense that it created this firestorm of publicity for this program called a tip, the reality that unidentified aerial phenomena were being investigated by the US government, or at least that&#x27;s what we were told in December.</p>
<p>And since then, a lot of stuff has happened. You see that on this channel, I try and cover it when I can, but also in the mainstream media in the last, really in the last year and a half, especially since that you</p>
<p>UAP report came out. And so that&#x27;s why I say that it will forever change, you follow G the study of UFOs. And that&#x27;s what these two articles were.</p>
<p>As we dig deeper, and look at the confusion in those questions, I&#x27;m going to bring up something that upsets a lot of people. And to be quite frank and blunt, I those that do get upset that I bring this up, I don&#x27;t care.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s why. It&#x27;s those minute details, the small details, and that was what I ate tip actually stood or stands for, in that in that New York Times article.</p>
<p>And the politico article, we were getting two different names for what a tip was. So in essence, the confusion for those who were paying attention to those small details started on day one.</p>
<p>Now some of you may not think this is a big deal. And this is one of those things that again, upsets some people that I brought up in the past, but continue to make reference to because again, this is what</p>
<p>started the snowball of confusion. It was simple as a single word in the letter, excuse me in the acronym of aerospace versus aviation, New York Times reported advanced aerospace threat Identification Program, Politico advanced</p>
<p>aviation threat Identification Program. Why does that matter? It&#x27;s plain and simple. It&#x27;s research. When you look into</p>
<p>something you need those names to be accurate. And yes, FOIA offices if you don&#x27;t have keywords, right, or full names, correct. There is sometimes an issue with that.</p>
<p>And so yes, I brought that up quite early on, because the Pentagon had said it was advanced aviation. I don&#x27;t regret that at all pushing that that point.</p>
<p>And in fact, I&#x27;m glad I did, because it really brought quite a bit more out about the reality of a tip and what it was, and according to the government, what it wasn&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you believe the government or not, it doesn&#x27;t matter if I believe the government or not, but the</p>
<p>pushing of that brought more details out, including how it was funded. And I&#x27;ll show you that in a minute. But also some other details, as well.</p>
<p>But where it really got worse and dicey was all of these different variations of the Name just beyond what politico in New York Times had reported. But as these stories were being written, all sorts of names emerged.</p>
<p>And what was concerning to me was the accuracy number one, but number two, how much care was going into vetting these stories, what you&#x27;re seeing on screen here, the sources in the main sources for these articles were the main key players involved in the</p>
<p>program. So my questions as time went on, and this confusion began to really mount was Why were there so many variations and why weren&#x27;t anybody really getting it right? Because all of these couldn&#x27;t be right.</p>
<p>So why was there this confusion when their sources were those involved was a careless journalism? I could buy that. Was it bad sources? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s why these issues were being pushed. This was one of the first declassified documents from the intelligence community that I got through FOIA. That in fact,</p>
<p>anybody got through FOIA, this is the first one ever, it as well said aviation. This comes from a system called Intellipedia. This is used by the CIA, the NSA, all of the</p>
<p>different arms of the intelligence community as a whole. They use this. So again, even internally, referencing the New York Times and the use of of an article that used aerospace,</p>
<p>they flipped it and said aviation why no one really knows. Here is the statement I got in February of 2019, it took that long for the DIA to finally say, while it was at DIA, it was advanced aerospace.</p>
<p>Now, again, I&#x27;ll say it 1000 times that upsets a lot of people, this whole name debate, some people say, Well, who really cares? My point was starting with all of that is to show you that confusion started on day one. And it has not gotten better, as it continues with the publishing</p>
<p>of this book. On top of the publishing of the book, they laid, in my opinion, a bombshell when it comes to critiquing past coverage. It&#x27;s one thing for you know, peon John Greenwald to say</p>
<p>it and harp on the New York Times or whomever that got it wrong. But when the OSS AP former director who has not been disputed by the Pentagon, when that guy comes out and and authors a book that said unquote, and I quote on page</p>
<p>156, for those who have the book, unfortunately, the ATM details presented in these articles, and news programs were actually those of Osnap. And, in fact, many of those details themselves were in error.</p>
<p>Senator Harry Reid said himself in the foreword to the book on page what is that 24 in Roman numerals, The New York Times article created enormous confusion by mistakenly linking the $22 million funding to the small, informal a tip initiative, the 22 million was</p>
<p>specifically targeted only to OS app. A tip, as used by the New York Times was not OS app, and OS app was not a tip, the $22 million was contracted through the Defense Intelligence Agency into OS app to evaluate the threat potential of UAPs, not</p>
<p>$1. Of that some went to a tip, despite widespread statements over the last several years. PAGE 160 of the skinwalkers book says one of the purposes of this book is to correct the record.</p>
<p>So they are stating quite simply, they want to set the record straight. And by doing so they&#x27;re saying pretty much everything that was reported was mislabeled and wrong. Now,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s those are big claims to make, because it wasn&#x27;t just politico in New York Times that reported it, the avalanche trickled to hundreds and arguably 1000s of mainstream media outlets around the world if they were all wrong. The</p>
<p>question mark is how were they all wrong? A lot of them were wrong because I call it copy and paste journalism. They were just taking other articles and jumbling the words and making it their own.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is just an opinion. Insert graphic, you know, that says John Greenwald&#x27;s opinion. But I believe that the book is placing blame without placing blame.</p>
<p>They said on page 156. The main source for The Times article was Lou Elizondo, who had recently resigned who had recently up I apologize, I don&#x27;t know how I repeated that. The main source</p>
<p>for The Times article was Lou Elizondo, who had recently resigned from his Pentagon position, and join T TSA and Director of Global Security and special programs. Again, that was page 156.</p>
<p>Now remember the last slide I said that all of the facts that they were saying that as reported by The Times, and those articles were wrong. So in essence, they&#x27;re saying this was the source.</p>
<p>So the question mark is, how did the source not convey those facts accurately? I&#x27;m not blaming Mr. Elizondo, by the way, that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m saying. The book is, so that&#x27;s what they say.</p>
<p>In the same section articles were wrong and this was their source. They didn&#x27;t name anybody else. So was it possible that not one but two articles that broke this story</p>
<p>from two major mainstream media outlets, both somehow mysteriously got the same facts wrong? That doesn&#x27;t make sense to me whatsoever. So there&#x27;s a lot of layers to that onion, which we you know, have yet to See, as the story continued to</p>
<p>unfold even more confusion came out. This was a interview earlier this year from with Robert Bigelow on mystery wire, George Knapp credit to him for sitting down face to face with Robert Bigelow and asking him some questions in that</p>
<p>interview. This is one thing Robert Bigelow said. I met Lou a couple of times didn&#x27;t, didn&#x27;t really he didn&#x27;t play a role in our program in any way, in terms of who we ever reported to or</p>
<p>whoever we discussed kind of things with. And then he goes on to talk about James McCaskey, not by name, but referring to him as the program manager. Now, in this interview, it is clear</p>
<p>that Luis Elizondo had no role in it OSS up and they didn&#x27;t communicate, he was not somebody that they ever reported to, or whoever we discussed the kinds of things with. Okay, fair point, right.</p>
<p>Until you start looking at what other people said to the same journalist. This for me is caused to question George Knapp in an interview back in 2018. June to</p>
<p>be exact. He sat down with Luis Elizondo, Luis Elizondo stated when George Knapp asked this interaction between you and your group and the OSS app, Bigelow bass folks, conversations back and forth.</p>
<p>You got a general idea what they&#x27;re doing. Luis Elizondo, he replies in the affirmative. He says, Of course, yeah, we didn&#x27;t do anything without talking to each other.</p>
<p>How do you have those statements from two of these individuals go hand in hand. You don&#x27;t. One who&#x27;s the billionaire who got the funding from the DIA to do their program? said Lou</p>
<p>Elizondo, sure. Nice guy. We never talked, Lou Elizondo says, Yep, we didn&#x27;t do anything without talking to each other. Those are not small details.</p>
<p>That is a major conflict of statement between two main players of this story who&#x27;s right and who&#x27;s wrong? Well, we kind of don&#x27;t really know. To add even more confusion Dr.</p>
<p>Hal put off we know him as being involved on the bass side, he was a contractor through bass. This was something that he gave to me in June of 2019. This was about the Pentagon statement that Luis Elizondo had no</p>
<p>assigned responsibilities on the A tip program. So I wrote about this extensively. Some people hate me for some of those articles.</p>
<p>Others, I think, saw the value of digging in because what happened? Well, we got Dr. Hal put off on the record as he submitted this statement, and I&#x27;ll read it in part.</p>
<p>However, I have no problem asserting that as an OS app, slash a tip contractor and senior advisor. I continued to attend meetings, provide briefings, gain access to videos, provide proposed program plans, meet with staff,</p>
<p>etc, all under the aegis of Elizondo his leadership and responsibility for maintaining continuity of the program effort and goals until he resigned. Well, that&#x27;s great. He&#x27;s now</p>
<p>vouching for him. The question mark, however, is that basses contract didn&#x27;t go after 2010 Now it could be assumed that Dr. How put off stayed on if Luis Elizondo took over in 2010 and we&#x27;ll go over that timeline in a minute Dr.</p>
<p>Hal put off then stayed on as a consultant. Okay, I can see that kind of interesting the bass is cut out, but one of their contractors stays in.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s interesting how that may have unfolded. There&#x27;s a lot of unchartered territory there that I don&#x27;t really see anybody talking about. But I responded to Dr. Put off and said hey, can you elaborate So are you saying that</p>
<p>after 2010 You as either a bass contractor or somebody who what didn&#x27;t work for bass and then later got a contract direct with the Pentagon to consult with or do whatever you know, consult with or do whatever duties you had with Luis Elizondo is a tip. Well, that could be true as well.</p>
<p>But James McCaskey said a tip was never funded. So then the question mark is who wrote Dr. Hal put off statement a paycheck.</p>
<p>So pay based on this statement? If he stayed on, there&#x27;s got to be funding from somewhere. I mean, in my opinion, and I don&#x27;t fault anybody for this.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not going to volunteer your time. So my guess is who&#x27;s paying and and and that&#x27;s where a lot of the layers when it comes to the Pentagon&#x27;s a tip side start to come into question, because if bass was out how to doctor put</p>
<p>off stay in. He never responded to my follow up to try and figure out what happened. It only got worse. We were told,</p>
<p>and we were, you know, shown documentation. And I&#x27;ll go over that documentation also in a minute, that aos app started in 2008 after it was awarded to bass. Well, in a Dr.</p>
<p>Hal put off lecture that he gave to a conference in Las Vegas in June of 2018. He said the following, people have trouble trying to get documents out of the Pentagon by saying they want all</p>
<p>documents on a tip. And they have a hard time, because that wasn&#x27;t the actual name of the program. advanced aerospace weapon systems application program is the actual name of</p>
<p>the program. But a tip was the nickname it went by. It began in June of 2007. The Defense Intelligence Agency was</p>
<p>concerned about the fact that obvious observation had shown that advanced aerospace vehicles, crafts or drones of unknown origin, were flying all over the United States over waters, in fact, globally, as was the case that you catch it. It began in June of 2007.</p>
<p>Now that&#x27;s more than a full year prior to money ever being allocated to the OS app contract in August of 2008. So what happened there now put a pin in that because when I go over the timeline, you&#x27;ll see something</p>
<p>else emerge that creates yet another question. This was also echoed to George Knapp in a mystery wire interview by Luis Elizondo, because that really wasn&#x27;t a quote, I should say, because that really wasn&#x27;t that started before I came on board,</p>
<p>and therefore my knowledge of it is a bit limited. So in essence, in 2007, the initial program was called our SAP program. It was that name for about nine months.</p>
<p>And that program was later refined, it was a bit of a shotgun approach to the phenomena. So yet again, we have a 2007 start date. But yet</p>
<p>again, documentation and all reporting contradicts that. Now despite the controversy about the Pentagon saying no Luis Elizondo had no assigned responsibility on the A tip program, let&#x27;s get beyond that and find out when he started.</p>
<p>And we all know for those who watched the History Channel special, unidentified, they went over a lot of Elizondo his background. And they said the following these are three screenshots with the official</p>
<p>transcript. These were taken, I believe, through my press access to the History Channel where they allowed us to screen ahead of time. I did not post these until after the show aired, but</p>
<p>that&#x27;s kind of the screen you&#x27;re seeing. And then since then, I believe you can view this publicly or at least you did for a while, but anybody can verify this. They said in that show,</p>
<p>which Luis Elizondo was instrumental in the narrator says in 2009, Elizondo took over the $22 million advanced aerospace threat Identification Program. Well, that&#x27;s entirely wrong across the board.</p>
<p>Based on all of the new details that have emerged. Luis Elizondo, which you&#x27;ll see in a second says, well 2010 The $22 million, according to James McCaskey never went to a tip.</p>
<p>So yet again, how did a television show that was working directly with the sources get it wildly wrong? Now? Maybe the producers just made a mistake and sure we can chalk it up to that. But was there something else? Luis</p>
<p>Elizondo in one of his interview said the offset program given the resources $22 million would never be enough to really follow each and every down each and every rabbit hole to do this conclusively, in my opinion, anyways, so it was refocused to a tip I took over in 2010.</p>
<p>So yet another discrepancy on the timeline? What is going on? All these details, by the way do mean an awful lot when you&#x27;re trying to figure out what the right story is? That timeline defines money, where the money came from, who was involved, who was calling the shots? And let&#x27;s</p>
<p>just face it, essentially, who&#x27;s telling the truth? Not everybody can be right. And all of these little details sure people can get date dates wrong. It was now what 11 going on 12 years ago</p>
<p>ish, depending upon what version you go for. So that&#x27;s cool. You know, maybe some of these are just all mistakes. But you know,</p>
<p>when you&#x27;re talking about something this sensitive, in my opinion, and again, an opinion here that I&#x27;d like to insert, we should take a little bit more care. Again, I&#x27;m not saying who&#x27;s right or who&#x27;s wrong in this presentation, but rather,</p>
<p>pointing out the huge discrepancies in the timeline, the story, the claims, the facts, and what we&#x27;ve been led to believe. In a presentation that was done to move on, this was edited to down a little bit and put on to to the stars</p>
<p>Academy of Arts and Sciences or TTS as YouTube channel slides were shown by Luis Elizondo, in one of those slides, you&#x27;ll see the highlighted purple one highlight was my emphasis 2008 aos app is formally changed to a tip by former program manager to focus more narrowly on the five observables.</p>
<p>And research of advanced physics applications. But as we know, in the book anyway, for those who read it, it was only said that it was a nickname that a tip was never anything within the DIA.</p>
<p>And that the a tip that we know it was an unfunded, unofficial and they use the word unofficial program operated out of the Pentagon. So what happened in 2008, according to Mr.</p>
<p>Elizondo two full years, or at least close to two years, prior to him taking over that a tip had already been morphed. And for us to focus in on these five observables, that is not</p>
<p>checking out with the new information that has come forward. In 2009, this kind of reinforces that in 2008, a transfer to a tip or a formal repackaging, so to speak likely didn&#x27;t take place.</p>
<p>Excuse me, in 2009, this Harry Reid letter was written, essentially trying to get SAP access or Special Access Program status for what we refer to as a tip. But in the book, it kind of shows that this was an</p>
<p>introduction of the A tip word that this was an unclassified way of referring to OS app, which essentially took the spotlight off of this program that they wanted to remain secret, and essentially created a nickname they said in the book, and again, this is from the free preview.</p>
<p>based on preliminary data, a letter had already been sent from Senator Harry Reid, to Deputy Secretary of Defense William Linn on June 24 2009, requesting a SAP or special access program for OS app.</p>
<p>As detailed in chapter 10. The decision to create the SAP was postponed but the urgent need persisted. Oddly enough, the primary legacy of the letter was the new unclassified</p>
<p>nickname, The advanced aerospace threat Identification Program, or a tip created exclusively for use within the unclassified letter. The a tip acronym was adopted much later to describe a small, unofficial effort within the DOD to investigate UAPs</p>
<p>encountered by the military. The New York Times article in December of 2017, mistakenly linked the $22 million in funding to a tip not OS app. Os app was the change.</p>
<p>Os app was the official name of the $22 million program and was never changed. A tip was not a funded program. Now that&#x27;s completely</p>
<p>contradictory to what we&#x27;ve been told about how all SAP morph to a tip in 2008. Well, the book is completely contradicting that narrative. And it isn&#x27;t right.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s interesting to point out about Harry Reid, is the shifting of viewpoints when it comes to this because in 2009, he had said in his letter that he had seen enough to try and get what he was referring to as a tip, a SAP status.</p>
<p>But years later, he did an interview and a journalist asked him, were you ever briefed on the findings of of the program? And were you staying involved? In the New York Magazine article published in March of 2018, the journalist says when the program was running, was this something that</p>
<p>you would be briefed on frequently? Were you briefed on it ever? Harry Reid said no, I left everybody alone. Nope. Journalists followed up, you were never briefed. Harry Reid</p>
<p>says that. That&#x27;s not my style. Nope. How is it that you as a senator would essentially go and fight for SAP status on</p>
<p>something which by the way, I cannot find any example outside of this storyline of a sitting US senator getting involved in a program that&#x27;s already underway, trying to request certain status in this in this manner. That doesn&#x27;t mean that it hasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>happened. That&#x27;s just kind of unorthodox. Once funding goes, Senators aren&#x27;t generally involved in the day to day business of Dia or NSA or CIA or DOD or whomever.</p>
<p>So the fact that he was involved shows you that there was something else going on. He had obviously been briefed enough, which by the way, I don&#x27;t think I pulled it but there&#x27;s a quote about them</p>
<p>briefing Harry Reid in the book Look, I think so, you know, it shows that what version of his story do you want to believe? Because as time goes on, we&#x27;re getting more and more information that is simply creating more and more confusion and generating more and more questions than it is answers.</p>
<p>In a mystery wire interview again, credit to George Knapp. Yes, the name a tip. And this is from James McCaskey quote.</p>
<p>Yes, the name a tip was a nickname for OS app for certain security reasons that we&#x27;ve put into the book. But the difference between OS app with the nickname a tip a DIA, and a tip at the Pentagon is quite distinct OS app had 22</p>
<p>million in funding it covered military and civilian UFOs, yielding a massive database. It also had a main contract and sub contracts. Now a tip in the Pentagon, as described in the</p>
<p>articles was basically zero funded, looked at specific military UFO encounters, and very important ones because they had film and it had no contract. So getting back to how did this mix up occur? I think it&#x27;s not deliberate.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not due to authors to television personalities, etc. It&#x27;s the fact that we were running not an official app, but a closed program.</p>
<p>And he goes on and on. So is who&#x27;s to blame for the confusion? I&#x27;m not really sure. But when you talk about the key players involved, none of them agree either.</p>
<p>So we can talk about the media in one breath. And that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ve done that on this channel before.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;ve made extensive videos about the horrible the horrible reporting when it comes to this topic, but now when you look at the actual statements from everybody in the storylines, and and what comes out in books like this, and you know, rumor has it there&#x27;s more</p>
<p>books coming. When you look at all of that, and nothing matches up what a we, as the general public led to believe about this was this all kosher, and up and up. And that brings me to my</p>
<p>next section, which really upsets some people. But it is something that truly puts all of this into context. Now for many years, I&#x27;ve talked about the concept of a sweetheart deal.</p>
<p>Now, essentially, in plain English. What I mean by that is the fact that that OS app was a creation, for bass, to get X amount of dollars in the tunes of 10s of millions, if not a lot more, I don&#x27;t believe that $22 million was supposed to be a</p>
<p>cap, but 10s of millions of dollars in a program that was catered for Robert Bigelow and bass. Now that happens in government and military. So I&#x27;m sorry, it just happens, right?</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not something that I like or dislike, but it&#x27;s the reality of what&#x27;s going on. But it also puts into proper context, what it is that we&#x27;re actually dealing with, and what it is that we&#x27;re actually talking about.</p>
<p>Now, one of the main things on why I get attached to this is a lot of you who are watching this are into UFOs. And you know, me as somebody who loves the topic, and I do, I preface a lot of what I do with</p>
<p>saying I believe the phenomena is real, I believe that warrant scientific scrutiny, I believe funding should be put forward to look into it. And I fully support the UAP Task Force. And</p>
<p>it&#x27;s mission to try and uncover what all this is. But in the same respect, I am a researcher, and an investigator who has dug in for decades through the Freedom of Information Act on information that goes well beyond UFOs.</p>
<p>And where I want to bring this up is this is a crossroads for me. Because I take personal biases or I try I&#x27;m only human, of course, I&#x27;m going to have, you know, something that is within me that</p>
<p>makes me lean a certain way. But I truly try hard not to do that. And this is a crossroads for me, because I want all of this to be real. And I look into it, for the reason that I believe that</p>
<p>there&#x27;s something to the UFO topic. But in the same respect, I look into a lot of government waste, and wasteful spending. And through the years have gotten you know quite a few different news agencies and media outlets to cover documents</p>
<p>that I&#x27;ve come out with on various topics. A prime example was years ago, quite a few years with one of those stimulus packages, how they spent $18 million for the recovery.gov website like how does a website cost $18 million.</p>
<p>And for it to be a disaster. ProPublica also had a lawsuit to get a lot of that stuff out. So So credit to them as well involved in those</p>
<p>stories. $16.7 million for canned pork. And so I&#x27;ve got the FDA contract on all of that craziness. $1.5 million for</p>
<p>cheese, and it goes on and on. So that&#x27;s what I do and this is where the concept of a sweetheart deal whether or not it deals with UFOs are not comes into play for me because that&#x27;s who I am as a researcher and somebody who looks into these</p>
<p>topics and looks at a $22 million dollar sign, and whether or not this truly was appropriated properly. And what if that $22 million went to the, you know, let&#x27;s say Office of Naval Intelligence for the UAP Task Force or wherever, could</p>
<p>that have been appropriated more properly, where they don&#x27;t focus on let&#x27;s say, cryptozoology stuff and, and cryptids and dyno beavers, and some other stuff that that I can&#x27;t say without laughing? That rather, if you focused on the nuts and bolts aspect of this phenomena that we know is real, what could that</p>
<p>$22 million have purchased elsewhere? So that&#x27;s that crossroads for me. But I want to deal a little bit with that sweetheart deal narrative, because for years, I&#x27;ve talked about it as a possibility.</p>
<p>And you know what, with the with the publishing of this book, and now James McCaskey on the record, truly not third hand information, but his words in a book with his name on it, I believe now it&#x27;s solidified. solidify that it is a sweetheart</p>
<p>deal. Does that take away from results? Before I dig into this? No, of course not. Where are the results? Is the question. So</p>
<p>even though I don&#x27;t believe that it takes away from the results? My big question is, where are those results? And if there was something yielded from the $22 million, where is it? And if it&#x27;s classified and heavily classified at that, then they wouldn&#x27;t be talking about us and a tip and writing books about</p>
<p>it. Because the idea concepts, and these findings and realities of dyno beavers, and man like wolves or whatever, that if that all happened, you&#x27;re not going to be able to talk about that if it&#x27;s highly classified.</p>
<p>So if it is unclassified, and they&#x27;re able to talk about it, where are the results? And that is one of the biggest questions that we still have yet to answer when we get into this concept of a sweetheart deal. Because if this</p>
<p>was truly a sweetheart deal, and the money was catered for Robert Bigelow, and he doesn&#x27;t want to share it, I&#x27;m not not saying that. That&#x27;s the reality. But where is everything? If that is</p>
<p>the reality, then we have a lot more questions than even I thought about this whole thing. So anyway, concept of a sweetheart deal. So these are some of the facts that we&#x27;ve</p>
<p>learned here in the last few years and some with this book as well. We know that Robert Bigelow, this man over here owns Bigelow Aerospace, and who created the subsidiary that we know as badass as the one that got this contract.</p>
<p>We know that Senator Harry Reid is instrumental in that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s really kind of no debating that. Robert Bigelow&#x27;s headquarters is in Nevada.</p>
<p>And when this man Senator Harry Reid, was the majority leader and was in the Senate, he was in so for the state of Nevada. So these guys were obviously in the same state and with the success of a billionaire who creates</p>
<p>jobs and creates money flowing into that state. This man here is obviously very happy. So there is motivation for the one to take care of the other.</p>
<p>Now, the other two gentlemen that don&#x27;t get mentioned a whole lot, and we just here again, third hand information would be senators Ted Stevens and Daniel Inouye, both of which are the late, they have both passed away.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s why I say most of what we hear is all third hand information. And we don&#x27;t really know the role. I&#x27;m sorry, if any that they really played in getting that we just have to</p>
<p>believe and trust the book itself. We&#x27;ve learned that Harry Reid&#x27;s connection to Robert Bigelow goes back to the knids days back to 1996, when Reed had attended one of the board meetings for knids.</p>
<p>And he was very impressed by it. Lots of scientists, lots of you know, big names, not the tinfoil hat people that I&#x27;m sure most politicians are scared of. These</p>
<p>were big people. That apparently is the root of Harry Reid&#x27;s interest in Robert Bigelow knids all things UFOs paranormal Skinwalker Ranch, and it&#x27;s routed back to 1996. Now we know</p>
<p>the connection then between Robert Bigelow and Harry Reid extended far beyond friendship There were also in the tunes of 1000s of dollars worth of donations from not only Robert Bigelow but also his late wife, Diane Bigelow, all under the banners a lot of times under the Bigelow company&#x27;s Bigelow</p>
<p>development aerospace LLC, and that probably extends farther beyond This I just don&#x27;t know all the names of everybody. But these are all verifiable contributions all through 2004. A little bit before then a couple years later, all SAP was</p>
<p>awarded. And then these 1000s of dollars of donations from Robert Bigelow, ironically, around the time that they were saying that they were cutting the OSS AP funding, which is, you know, probably just a coincidence.</p>
<p>But obviously, again, a, a relationship that extends far beyond the professions or just a friendship that there were 1000s of dollars in donations that we&#x27;re going forward. Enter James McCaskey, he, again was the DIA</p>
<p>scientist. He was a rocket scientist, who in the leaked reports, that&#x27;s really how we knew his name before but nobody wanted to say his name. He was on the</p>
<p>leaked reports as being the OSS SAP program manager. And so that also was a cause for confusion. Hey, what about Mr. Elizondo</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t he wasn&#x27;t he the manager? What is this? And in the early days, that really caused a lot of confusion since then, we got clarity, that Mr. Elizondo said hey, we were two different programs.</p>
<p>He led us at or excuse me, a tip Elizondo led a tip in the Pentagon LoCat ski was all SAP at the DIA. Dr. McCaskey says the following on page 20 For those who have the book</p>
<p>reading hunt for the Skinwalker which is by the way, the original book that was written by George Knapp and I think Colm Kelleher, as well about Skinwalker Ranch created quite a bit of hoopla many, many years ago. So back to the quote, I&#x27;m</p>
<p>sorry, reading hunt for the Skinwalker back in March of 2007. Intrigued McCaskey. I read the book cover to cover the cat ski says I was legitimately interested in this as useful to</p>
<p>the military and useful to my particular group, which was looking at possible threats to new weapons systems. That&#x27;s what attracted my attention. So that kind of gives a timeframe March</p>
<p>of 2007. Luke Caskey gets a personal interest into Skinwalker Ranch, specifically this ranch in Utah that allegedly has all of this paranormal activity. There&#x27;s a</p>
<p>little flowchart for you in 2007. This is from Senator Harry Reid, by the way page. What is that 14 In the Roman numeral. In</p>
<p>2007. I received a telephone call from Bob Bigelow regarding a letter he had received from the Defense Intelligence Agency or dia, that also timestamps it that law Caskey writes Robert Bigelow, and says I want to visit Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
<p>Bigelow immediately turns around and calls his buddy Harry Reid to kind of have everything checked out. As the story slash legend goes, if you want to call it that, Luke Caskey, visits the</p>
<p>the Skinwalker Ranch and actually has which he recounts in the book, a paranormal experience. And he&#x27;s convinced at this point that money needs to go to this research. Now</p>
<p>again, keep in mind that this is 2007. According to the book, enter Harry Reid, Ted Stevens, Daniel Inouye, that they according to Senator Harry Reid, on page 16, in the Roman numeral, quote, thus the advanced aerospace weapon system</p>
<p>applications program was conceived senators Stevens anyway, and I allocated $22 million to get the program started. A government request for proposal was put out, and Bob Bigelow&#x27;s company secured the bid was the $22 million that</p>
<p>went to bass. According to the Pentagon. This is how it was funded. The program commenced in fiscal year 2008 with $10</p>
<p>million appropriated in the defense supplemental appropriation Act. The first 26 reports were complete, completed by late 2009. The defense Appropriation Act for Fiscal</p>
<p>Year 2010, included an additional $12 million for the program, and 12 additional reports were produced. That&#x27;s quoted from Susan Goff, Pentagon spokesperson that culminated from dia statements and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m putting her name because that was the last time I received a version of it. But James could law from dia also gave me portions of that even goes back to Adria Harris from the Pentagon in early 2018. When I was communicating with her back then, Senator Harry Reid also on page</p>
<p>16, as the United States Senate Majority Leader I decided to meet in a classified location in the United States Capitol the two key members of the appropriations process. The two members of the Appropriations Committee who controlled the</p>
<p>dark money, the non public money were Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and Democratic Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii. Now I&#x27;m bringing up this because dark money has come up that the phrasing dark money has come up quite a few times when it comes to Harry Reid, and to be blatantly honest with you.</p>
<p>And I could be completely off base or missing something big. I have no idea what the hell he&#x27;s referring to. When you talk</p>
<p>about black budget program. Sure. I have obviously know what he&#x27;s referring to. Dark money is something different and really</p>
<p>doesn&#x27;t have to do with government spending, but rather, corporations, namely nonprofit corporations, and how they donate to political campaigns. Ironically, one of the biggest outspoken senators on dark money was Senator Harry Reid himself.</p>
<p>These two articles I pulled from various years 2014 and 2015. Harry Reid says dark money in campaigns threatens democracy. Another headline, Harry Reid joins call for Obama to take action on dark money. Now, I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s using the</p>
<p>right phrasing. And it completely contradicts the Pentagon and what they are documenting in these fiscal year acts in the appropriations bills on what Senator Harry Reid is doing.</p>
<p>So I&#x27;m not sure what he&#x27;s referring to if there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing, please guys, help me out. I believe that maybe he&#x27;s just erroneously referring to black budget money. But even that doesn&#x27;t make sense because according to the</p>
<p>Pentagon, they fully admit the money was on the books. And they show where it came from. On top of that Senator Harry Reid in this book said that he and the two other senators allocated $22</p>
<p>million? Well, I would politely argue that was impossible for him to do, he could get the original money, or put it in a bill somehow. But there was no cap. If you look at the</p>
<p>documentation of what OSS app was all about, it was supposed to extend far beyond two years, maybe even two, five years and beyond. But after a review, in 2009, after the DIA had started it, they felt they were not getting anything beneficial.</p>
<p>So then the funding was cut after that second year, George Knapp was the one that showed screenshots of the first contract that was signed for that first year, the total amount $10 million.</p>
<p>It coincides with what the Pentagon says, there&#x27;s, in my opinion, no way that Senator Harry Reid then could understand number one, that they would get a second year because it was an option. But number two, that it would be</p>
<p>for the total of 12 million. So Senator Harry Reid, or in my opinion, any senator for that matter, or committee, or whatever, in 2008, or excuse me, 2007. I think he said in the</p>
<p>book, they couldn&#x27;t allocate $22 million, because the bills weren&#x27;t even written yet. And that money that came from those bills, wasn&#x27;t even determined yet. So for that whole portion</p>
<p>of the story, and I know it sometimes gets dicey and confusing when you start talking about this level stuff. It shows that I believe Senator Harry Reid is wrong. And I&#x27;m sorry,</p>
<p>his use of the word dark money makes no sense to the story. But he&#x27;s used that so many times, I had to point it out. And on top of that, Senator Reid was against the true definition of</p>
<p>dark money as a whole. Going back to the idea of that that sweetheart deal. We know from a statement that I got back in March of 2019, that there was only one bidder on this contract</p>
<p>that could have potentially equaled 10s of millions of dollars, should the option go to five years and beyond the fact that no other contractor would try and bid on a public notice in 2008. Doesn&#x27;t make really any sense.</p>
<p>Now, some have argued that that&#x27;s normal, and that&#x27;s fine. Okay, so let&#x27;s get beyond it. I won&#x27;t I won&#x27;t beat the dead horse.</p>
<p>But Bigelow Aerospace was the only bidder that has never been disputed. It was reported, however, erroneously that Lockheed put a bid in that also was wrong.</p>
<p>Senator Harry Reid has said in interviews, that he put the bid solicit or excuse me that the government put the bid solicitation out, and that bass got it because they were the most qualified at the time. He</p>
<p>never said they were the only one. So what are the odds that this bid solicitation, which I&#x27;ll show you here, called the advanced aerospace weapon system applications program goes out for public bids, and nowhere, nowhere in that public bid</p>
<p>solicitation as Skinwalker Ranch mentioned, or, excuse me our UFOs or paranormal mentioned Which would make Skinwalker Ranch incredibly valuable to bid on a contract like that saying, Hey, if you want to look in the paranormal, we have the prime spot for you, or whatever.</p>
<p>None of that was in the public bid solicitation. So what are the odds that out of all of those corporations LLCs, or whomever is cleared to bid on a contract? The one person that actually bids on it strikes the jackpot,</p>
<p>because its CEO, Robert Bigelow has this invested interest in UFOs and paranormal, so we&#x27;re led to believe that all SAP when it went out, withheld some of those other details from the public bid notice, because some have argued they were classified there say that they were embarrassed by it.</p>
<p>Yeah, pick your explanation doesn&#x27;t matter. But man did Robert Bigelow hit the jackpot when he just got lucky, and was the only bidder that allowed him to do paranormal funhouse research, or</p>
<p>was he tipped off? Now? Let&#x27;s face it, he was tipped off. You can&#x27;t get around that. If if we want to believe otherwise, that&#x27;s fine.</p>
<p>But there&#x27;s no way that a DIA scientist a year prior that then a year prior to this contract being awarded calls Robert Bigelow wants to go to Skinwalker Ranch has a paranormal experience, comes back sets the deals in motion to get word to Harry Reid $22 million, comes out of nowhere,</p>
<p>and boom, this goes out for a public bid. And voila, bass is the only bidder? No, the reality is he was tipped off and this was catered to him. Another thing emerged too, while looking</p>
<p>at this book, and kind of going over the documentation. Again, this is a copy of version number three of the official notice for bid solution solicitation. Why I say version three is there</p>
<p>are three versions not a whole lot of difference, it changed a couple little details, but they really didn&#x27;t change the scope of the of the program, they just save all the revisions online, on the black vault.com. Search the search engine for all SAP,</p>
<p>you will be able to download all of the different versions. I have everything archived. But while doing this presentation, this was the date that you&#x27;ll notice here.</p>
<p>Solicitation Issue Date, August 18 2008. That&#x27;s when it went out. That is when the DIA said, Hey, we want solicitations for this bit.</p>
<p>The due date was September 5. So pretty tight, you didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to submit for this bid arguable on whether or not that standard or not, but irrelevant for my presentation</p>
<p>here. So we&#x27;ll just call it September 5. Those dates are also backed up by sam.gov or which is now the find business opportunities website.</p>
<p>Believe sam.gov has been rebranded. But this is the archived version. So September 5 was the due date. And of course, other websites as well.</p>
<p>All archives all verify September 5 was the due date. Now why do I say that? Well, because the book has September 10. So that could just be a</p>
<p>typo. But then in the appendix on page 184. They talk about the proposals that bass submitted to the Defense Intelligence Agency saying, hey, look, we&#x27;re the guy for you.</p>
<p>They were submitted three days after the due date. What happened there? I&#x27;m not really sure. But it&#x27;s a discrepancy worth noting because</p>
<p>the due date was done. So nobody else was there. What happened? I? I don&#x27;t know, I really don&#x27;t have an answer to it. But it&#x27;s</p>
<p>important nonetheless. This was the statement of objectives. This was the essentially what OS app was all about. This also is from that version three document, no mention of</p>
<p>paranormal, no mention of, you know, UFOs or anything in that genre. It was all about looking at advanced aerospace technology, and forward looking into the 40 years into the future, looking at various lift, propulsion, so on and so forth,</p>
<p>on how things essentially could progress. And that&#x27;s what this was supposedly all about. In that same document from the get go the program manager or the contracting officer was Dr.</p>
<p>James McCaskey, the same guy that visited Skinwalker Ranch and reached out to Bigelow Aerospace the year prior. So, you know, it seems like it was kind of set up and in the book goes into even more detail about how Dr.</p>
<p>McCaskey was instrumental in that. So if we haven&#x27;t really figured out that this was catered for bass and Robert Bigelow yet, I&#x27;m not sure how else to put it.</p>
<p>But this book solidifies that fact. Now here&#x27;s kind of a timeline of events. Some points are review. Some points are new, but this is how it all unfolded March of</p>
<p>2007 McCaskey read hunt for the Skinwalker. The next month. McCaskey meets in the defense warning office with Jonathan Axelrod believed to be just a nickname to talk about tales of the paranormal He is within the DWR was within the DIA or</p>
<p>Defense Intelligence Agency. Axelrod takes the to Iraq while deployed somehow that you know, gets the ball in motion that all of this was, you know real. June 19 2007.</p>
<p>McCaskey writes to Robert Bigelow on dia letterhead to ask to visit his ranch. Now, remember when I told you to put a pin in that doctor put off, quote, and then later Elizondo had a 2007 start date for OS</p>
<p>app? That was all June of 2007 when they said that it started. So is this the start of OS app? Did they did they already start putting money towards Bigelow? Did they already choose him? Why are multiple key players</p>
<p>involved saying 2007 contract wasn&#x27;t awarded until more than a year later? And according to you know, reports, they weren&#x27;t aware of it. They were just the lucky bidder. So how did all</p>
<p>that happen? And how is it connected? Not really sure, but it was an interesting date correlation when going through the book. The next month, July 26 2007, McCaskey and Bigelow fly to Utah to visit his ranch.</p>
<p>Within 60 minutes of being on the property lockouts, he had paranormal experiences seeing, quote, an earthly technological device that had quote silently appeared out of nowhere in the adjacent kitchen. It looked to</p>
<p>be a complex, semi opaque, yellowish, tubular structure that&#x27;s page 39 and 40 for those who have the book in 2007, as well, but it&#x27;s an unknown month, but we know that it&#x27;s post LoCat skis ranch visit. Bigelow briefed long term friend as the</p>
<p>book calls him, Senator Harry Reid on extraordinary history of UAPs at the UAP at the Utah Ranch, excuse me, as well on the recent astounding experience by a high level dia analyst on the same Ranch, it did not take long to connect Jim McCaskey with senators Daniel Inouye, of Hawaii and Ted Stevens of</p>
<p>Alaska. In a capitol building meeting. January of 2008. I tracked down the documentation, the documentation from the</p>
<p>Nevada secretary of state that shows that Bigelow Aerospace advanced space studies or bass, as it was formed as a domestic Limited Liability Company. In Nevada. It was reported as well,</p>
<p>Bass was set up only for OS app, the OS app contract, if that&#x27;s the case, seems like he had prior knowledge. If that&#x27;s not the case, heck of a coincidence, August 2008, offset bid solicitation notices published in the biz ops website,</p>
<p>September 5, os app bids were due September 8, bass proposal volumes one, two or three were submitted. And September 22 2008, the OS app contract was issued to bass. I know I spent a</p>
<p>lot of time on the sweetheart deal, but that frames what we are dealing with, and in my book absolutely closes the deal. When it comes to the sweetheart deal, argument, does that negate the findings? No.</p>
<p>But where are the findings? And that question still lingers to this day. Those findings could be in the reports that a lot of people are now referring to James the cat skis chapter in chapter three of the book, voluminous, high</p>
<p>quality material more than 100 separate reports as detailed in appendix one was submitted to the DIA in just over two years of the program&#x27;s existence. In addition, the 11 databases within the asset bass data warehouse, were delivered to</p>
<p>dia, while the massive holdings of the original analysts journals, data and photographs remained in storage. Now, those databases I&#x27;ll talk about in a couple of minutes, but we have yet to refer to them in this presentation.</p>
<p>In short, bass is said to have created 11 different databases, all encompassing you have UAP, UFO events, witness testimony, all sorts of material. That&#x27;s what those 11 databases are.</p>
<p>But don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll get to those. A lot of those reports are probably spelled out in that original bid solicitation notice.</p>
<p>So a lot of it I&#x27;m not sure is it being framed to be much more interesting than it is these types of reports like, you know, management plans for different tasks, travel reports, expenses, so on and so forth, all due for contracts like this. But is that what he&#x27;s talking about with the hundreds of</p>
<p>reports? I don&#x27;t really know because the only thing we do know, came through a Freedom of Information Act request. I did and I know that the federal Federation excuse me of American scientists or FAS, Steven afterGood, to be precise.</p>
<p>They as well had a case ongoing as did I have for the UN I&#x27;ll read it here all communications to and from the DIA with the Armed Services Committee in 2017 and 2018. Regarding the advanced</p>
<p>aviation and at this time when I filed that&#x27;s how the government referred to it. Advanced aviation threat Identification Program, or were referred to as the advanced aerospace threat Identification Program, or referred to as the advanced</p>
<p>aerospace threat and identification program. That was Harry Reid&#x27;s version. The result was a letter that was written to John McCain in January of 2018.</p>
<p>And this is where we discovered the reality of the direct reports. And those direct reports were the 38 reports that were created under the OSS AP contract.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m gonna read to you part of this letter because one word is key. Based on interest from your staff regarding the DIA his role in a tip, please find attached a list of all products produced under the a tip contract for dia to</p>
<p>publish. The purpose of a tip was to investigate foreign advanced aerospace weapon threats from the present out to the next 40 years. And again, we know 38 reports were given.</p>
<p>I dug it up in the congressional record log. Also in April of 2018. They also punched the published word, a letter from</p>
<p>the chief Congressional Relations Division, Defense Intelligence Agency DOD, transmitting a list of all products produced under the advanced aerospace threat Identification Program contract for the DIA to publish to the committee of arms armed services.</p>
<p>So I was able to kind of dig up that this letter was referred to in official congressional record, they received these three pages, which listed all 38 reports. So that is a breakdown of the</p>
<p>published reports through a tip, notice how the letter didn&#x27;t say OS app. Now, why not if a tip was just a nickname when it came to dia on paper, that meant nothing to really anybody, when it came to funding to a senator and so on.</p>
<p>So was this the same thing that they&#x27;re trying to keep it secret? Or is there another layer here that we haven&#x27;t really understood, but OS app was not involved? It should be noted, however, that this does kind of coincide with the Pentagon&#x27;s explanation that</p>
<p>a tip was the overall program. And the portion that was contracted out was known as OS app. Now, according to McCaskey OS app was the program a tip was kind of a nickname.</p>
<p>And then when you talk to Luis Elizondo, OSS AP was a DIA program and a tip was a DoD program. You know, quite a few different definitions Dr.</p>
<p>Hal put off also just calls it a nickname. So who do you believe on that one? Not really sure. But there&#x27;s a lot of question marks here. Just</p>
<p>kind of a quick side note about some history here OS app as a whole as a program looking at forward looking technology and what might be there isn&#x27;t anything new. I had dug up this program from 1972 called Project outgrowth, it was headed by a</p>
<p>Franklin B. Meade and run through the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory. In essence, they were looking at major propulsion developments that may occur in the next 30 to</p>
<p>40 years. It was a forward looking program very much like OS app, and essentially what they were looking for, were advancements in propulsion, one of the same exact angles of study for OS app, and how it make progress over the next 30</p>
<p>to 40 years. Ironically, os app was labeled as through the next 40 years, do the math from 1972. You&#x27;re looking at about 35 years or so after project outgrowth, that OS app was essentially</p>
<p>conceived and born out. So it&#x27;s a very interesting maybe just a coincidence correlation that this program preceded or SAP was very much looking at very similar things and had a very similar timeframe of 40 years looking into the future.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll see number nine here in the 1970s program was looking at actually how you can propel a ship using your mind or psychokinesis. They labeled it as movement of objects by mental</p>
<p>forces, although recent developments indicate small object may be propelled by this technique. Too much basic research is needed before this method can be considered for propulsion applications.</p>
<p>So they were looking at incredibly fringe areas of science as well. And so now that the Pentagon has kind of revamped their statement Did did Bigelow insert UFOs? In very much a similar fashion? And then that&#x27;s where the confusion</p>
<p>comes from, or was this that sweetheart deal? And it was something else entirely on paper? It was, yeah, let&#x27;s do some research into lift and propulsion and so on and so forth. Materials and whatever the other 3800 reports are, but</p>
<p>in reality, all that money went to paranormal, you know, cryptid research, which is bizarre. A lot of you asked about Dr. Eric Davis today, and whether or not you know, he&#x27;s he really briefed</p>
<p>in a classified setting about offworld vehicles. I&#x27;ll deal with that in a second. But one interesting thing when when looking at Project outgrowth, and Franklin Meade, as I told</p>
<p>you about, this is how tightly niched these these scientists and this research is. And this may mean absolutely nothing. But I kind of found it a little bit fascinating that this, these</p>
<p>documents and programs were separated by decades, and decades. Yet, when you start digging in, here is a ball lightning study that was awarded to warp drive metrics. That is</p>
<p>the company for this man here, Dr. Eric Davis. Now we know that he wrote five of those dirt reports I showed you all 38. He</p>
<p>had written five of them, he was contracted by his pal, Dr. Hal put off and for an untold amount of money. And he authored these five derd reports.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s interesting about this ball lightning study, though this was outside of OS apps, I had nothing to do with that was written in 2003. But was really interesting was the project manager on Eric Davis has ball</p>
<p>lightning study, which was Franklin made the same guy that did that OS app like program decades prior. And in fact, if you continue to dig, you&#x27;ll see that Eric Davis and Franklin meet, then later, would author a document together about laser</p>
<p>light craft propulsion. Now all of this is well over my head when it comes to science. But very interesting that number 31, on the 38 list was about laser light craft technology authored</p>
<p>by Dr. Eric Davis. So you can see how tightly niched all of these people and these realms of research really were. And when</p>
<p>you dig, you see that they really are connected in the most bizarre way. Now, back to your questions about did he briefed Congress about offworld vehicles. Now, for those who</p>
<p>aren&#x27;t aware I did a full video about offworld vehicle technology, and the claims made by the New York Times and that horrific journalism job that was later corrected on numerous fronts, they also made corrections that they never noted.</p>
<p>I go through that in the video. And I&#x27;ll be honest with you, I do not believe the claims by Eric Davis that he briefed in a classified setting or otherwise, about offworld vehicles.</p>
<p>He may have had a meeting, he may have sat with a senator Congressman House of Representatives, whomever, committee even and maybe had a meeting. I don&#x27;t buy that it was a class of in a classified setting.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t buy that he was really driving the point home about quote unquote offworld vehicles. Simply put, the existence of offworld vehicles would be a highly classified piece of knowledge.</p>
<p>We all know that. There&#x27;s no getting away from it. If it wasn&#x27;t an ace, a tip or OS app or whatever really did find it. And it was unclassified in nature.</p>
<p>You better bet your bottom dollar that Robert Bigelow Luis Elizondo, James McCaskey, or any one of those players would have talked about it and confirmed it by now. But they haven&#x27;t all we get are</p>
<p>these shrouded, convoluted cloak and dagger type, you know, fun stories that may allude to it, but we never get the confirmation. So let&#x27;s say it really does exist. The</p>
<p>government military has offworld vehicles. Well, let&#x27;s face it, it would be highly classified and no, they would not be talking about it or publishing it in the New York Times. And</p>
<p>the mess that became of that article with all of the corrections. I think we can all dismiss the notion and no, I don&#x27;t believe Dr. Eric Davis is as connected as some people want</p>
<p>us to believe. Wanted to address that though, because of so many questions I got today on social media about it. Those 11 databases that were created, this is one of the last things</p>
<p>that I&#x27;m going to go over for you guys and timing wise, it&#x27;s working out pretty perfect. The data warehouse that they created these 11 databases, again, was a culmination of UFO sightings and witness testimony, hopefully, you know, photos, videos,</p>
<p>whatever they may be, but just it sounds like a massive amount of data. Now where is that data? According to the book, they turned at least part of it over to the DIA. But the question</p>
<p>mark is, where is it now? Is it classified? And if it is, how can you classify something that came from the general public, which is what Dr. McCaskey said they were looking into. So if I</p>
<p>take a picture of video of a UFO, and it&#x27;s not a top secret aircraft, it is not taken by classified technology and I am nowhere near a government or military, either employee or enlistee? Can they classify it? And the question from or? Excuse me, I think the answer to that question would be no.</p>
<p>So the now the question is, where is all that data? And we have absolutely no idea. I was unaware, and maybe I just missed it.</p>
<p>That the number of databases total 11. I was only aware of one and the one database or at least the start of the database anyway, that I was well aware of that really I don&#x27;t see enough people talking about is the move on database that that has</p>
<p>collected for decades upon decades. Material and, and sightings and photos and videos and so on and so forth. Witness Testimony, but on top of that their personal and confidential</p>
<p>information, all went into this massive database that was purchased by Robert Bigelow, back around the 2008 2009 timeframe. In fact, the actual contract that Bigelow and move on signed with each other has no mention of a government program,</p>
<p>or Defense Intelligence Agency or so on. All we learned from the leak of this contract by a move on member the late Elaine Douglas. She brought this out in January of 2011.</p>
<p>Prior to ever knowing about OSS apparatus, or bass, being involved with the government, we learned that it was for the sum of $672,000 that move on got it made payable in 12 installments of $56,000. That</p>
<p>that is what Robert Bigelow got into. Now, I want to point out because there&#x27;s a lot to this story. And I&#x27;m not going to go into all of it for a couple different reasons.</p>
<p>But I will point you to this website here by Roger Glassell and Kurt Collins, I believe it&#x27;s Kurt&#x27;s website, but the article itself, the Pentagon, UFO programs, secret partner, they both authored that, and that is at Blue, blurry lines.com.</p>
<p>Look it up. They do a lot of research and a big deep dive into it, I am not going to do the same. I&#x27;m just going to brush the surface and ask you guys a couple of questions.</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of people are really not dealing with this. Now we made a we were all kind of made aware of this in 2009. And you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s kind of a blurry</p>
<p>picture. This is the best image I can find it this much younger and skinnier version of myself. I was the emcee of mu funds international symposium for about a decade.</p>
<p>At the time this man here was James carry on. He was the international director have moved on. And here we have Robert Bigelow.</p>
<p>We know Robert Bigelow had invested into move on, in turn, they created I believe this was the origin of their star team, but essentially they were looking for when those UFO reports came in, and the photos, the videos, whatever.</p>
<p>And they went into move on, which was the number one place for people to report. Guess who had first dibs on them. Robert Bigelow, but what was not known</p>
<p>to the general public at the time, was that it was just being funneled right back in to the Defense Intelligence Agency, a military run intelligence agency. So that is one of the biggest aspects to this story, that I think we should start</p>
<p>pushing on that how can a military arm of our intelligence community, the DIA want to get into watching what United States citizens see then keeping that information but never informing the general public? How much of this gets into very dicey areas? It my first guess would be a lot of it.</p>
<p>Yet I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of people talking about this. And to me, I will I will just pose this question. Did the DIA even want this? If this was</p>
<p>not part of our SAP, then what problems does this create that taxpayer money through a private corporation acquired all of that personal information? Now this gentleman right here, James carry on who I&#x27;ve known for many, many years, wrote A big expose a on this that has since been removed.</p>
<p>But you can find it here if you&#x27;re watching the video on this internet archive link, follow the magic thread was his blog. Strange bedfellows was the article.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s two things that he wrote. Mr. Bigelow did not fund move funds work for bass. Instead, quote sponsors that Bigelow revealed to John Schuessler, who&#x27;s the</p>
<p>one of the founders of move on, but not to other move on board members put up the money that sponsor the Defense Intelligence Agency. So is this alleging that the DIA, again, that intelligence arm of the United States military put money into</p>
<p>purchase all of that information? And if so, what ramifications could occur from that? Another thing you wrote during the project move on provided both historical move on files, as well as current move on case files, including witness information Tabas.</p>
<p>To cover move on legally, the move on UFO reporting form was modified to collect the witnesses permission to offer their sighting data to a third party, the only third party being vast, but what happened before that modification took place.</p>
<p>All of those other people who felt that government bad I see UFO I go to move on because they&#x27;re good. All of a sudden just had all of their information taken and given right to the United States government. How is any of that</p>
<p>Kosher or Okay? And what makes sense is that the government would not do this. Because another big problem about all of this is that none of it fits into the purview of the defense intelligence agency&#x27;s mission.</p>
<p>When you look at what the DIA does, they don&#x27;t investigate us properties in Utah that allege paranormal activity. Because that&#x27;s not what they do. They&#x27;re</p>
<p>an intelligence arm that provides mostly foreign intelligence on different types of countries, and so on and so forth. So why would they care about this? Now, they argued that it was the FBI, a domestic law enforcement agency, and they</p>
<p>tied in potential criminal activity that in turn, kind of research some of that paranormal activity. Okay, I can see that. But that&#x27;s not the story. This is a military intelligence arm.</p>
<p>That, again, is the DIA. I don&#x27;t want to go farther than that to be blatantly honest, because there&#x27;s way too much that you can get into about the purchasing of United States citizen information in relation to UFOs and UAPs.</p>
<p>And what they thought was a confidential submission to a corporation, known as move on. I will let all of you start asking those questions.</p>
<p>But I hope with what this presentation showed you is that there is a lot of unanswered questions, and I didn&#x27;t even scratch the surface. You can look at the statements, interviews, and so on, have quite a few of these key</p>
<p>players. And you can see how the stories have shifted over time. I call it like a fine wine. In some areas, the stories get better with age.</p>
<p>So what&#x27;s going on? Why are we going through this? Now, some I saw somebody mentioned on Twitter today, why does it matter at this point, you know, we&#x27;ve got the UAP Task Force, and they&#x27;re looking at UFOs. And all of that is good.</p>
<p>And you know what that part is good. And if this is what this has, has kind of morphed into, then great. I love that the taskforce is there, the phenomena deserves that scrutiny</p>
<p>and funding, as I said, but in the same respect, we have to look at the root of all of this. And we have to look at what really have we been told in the last few years, and how not only this book, but simple research, and looking into the claims by many of these</p>
<p>people makes a lot of this fall apart. Some of it are dead horses that we&#x27;ve beat for a couple of years now and will probably never have answers. Other parts of this stems from</p>
<p>the publishing of this book, and the revelation by a new voice, an old name, but a new voice that is now in the ring. And some of the claims he has made really throw a lot of this for the loop for a loop.</p>
<p>And so when we look at all of that, in the end, we have more questions than answers. We have no idea what that program discovered. Because in this book, I don&#x27;t have any I</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t see any scientific test results that shows that the DIA shows a DNA evidence of a dyno beaver or the fact that there&#x27;s some kind of portal within Skinwalker Ranch or that you UFOs and UAPs are miraculously skirting all of our coastal defense lines and somehow appearing over this ranch, I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t see that. I see a lot of speculation, I see some great scientists who are a heck of a lot smarter than me. But where are the results? Because if the United States taxpayer funded</p>
<p>this, those results are ours. And they&#x27;re ours to share and nobody owns them. This was a contract OSS app was a contract, not a grant.</p>
<p>And with that being said, there&#x27;s no rhyme or reason if it&#x27;s not classified, and it&#x27;s not a breach of personal confidential information, that we should not see it. So this is what in my opinion, should happen next, we need somebody</p>
<p>that is intimately involved in this to say that the results are classified the results. And if they can&#x27;t say that, why not? Because if they truly are that classified, we wouldn&#x27;t have ever heard about OS app or a tip.</p>
<p>And that is proven by history, over time that highly classified programs, whether it be stealth technology, drones, whatever, the mere existence of a program that encompasses top secret technology, classified technology, or whatever the mere existence of it is classified,</p>
<p>you wouldn&#x27;t be talking about it. So what is it, we need more clarity? And at this point, I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s telling the truth or not. I know who returns my phone calls.</p>
<p>I know who is nice, I but that doesn&#x27;t make them honest. But I know who is nice. I know who I found common ground with.</p>
<p>And I know who dodges me. I believe that these types of questions that I put forward here in the last, whatever it&#x27;s been an hour and a half or so these types of questions have to be answered.</p>
<p>This is not as clear cut, as some people want us to believe this is not as kosher, as some people want us to believe. And it&#x27;s not as clean as some people want us to believe it is a mess. And it&#x27;s a mess, because of the main people and players involved</p>
<p>that have come out with their respective stories. And the fact that none of them align that they all have contradicting information. And again, some of those are dead horses, I&#x27;ve beat</p>
<p>for quite some time. And some of this is new, but it hasn&#x27;t gone away. But I fall back on that one point that I&#x27;ll punch one more time before I say goodnight.</p>
<p>And that is if the United States taxpayer funded this, then the results are ours. And if somebody wants to say those results are there, but are classified, then let&#x27;s get together work as a team, and try and band together and get those results out.</p>
<p>If there are no results, then it was a waste of $22 million. Because they were running around looking at dyno beavers, and man like wolves, or whatever else.</p>
<p>That all could be very cool stuff. And I love that. But it&#x27;s not dia money. It&#x27;s just not that would be</p>
<p>better served with let&#x27;s say, the National Science Foundation or somewhere else. And that portion of the research, should there be anything to be borne out should be through those agencies, and scientific findings should be shared with</p>
<p>the general public. But instead, we get these cloak and dagger type stories, convoluted statements, and very few people want to talk but when they do talk, they only talk to a very few people.</p>
<p>And it ends up being a mess in the end. Anyway. So that, to me, is why with OSs and a tip confusion reigns and, and questions still linger.</p>
<p>And until we get some of those answers. And until some people want to talk. None of this is going away.</p>
<p>And more, I believe will come out and arise. I will say this one last time by I do believe that everybody should have all the information possible. I only scratched the surface.</p>
<p>But I hope that this motivates other people to not be afraid to ask questions. And in the last 48 hours of the recording of this video, I&#x27;ve seen some big players and big names essentially harp on people</p>
<p>like myself and others who are asking questions. Well, you know what, I mean, United States taxpayer and I deserve to know the answers if it&#x27;s not classified or doesn&#x27;t encroach on somebody&#x27;s personal confidential information other</p>
<p>than that, I believe we all should have the answers to this. And that is why I do what I do is to get those answers. I hope you guys enjoyed it. Thank you so much for sticking around.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll do a live Ask Me Anything ama video soon. But for now, this is John Greenwald, Jr, signing off. And we&#x27;ll see you</p>
<p>next time.</p>
