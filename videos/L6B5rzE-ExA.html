            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right everybody hello my name is Thomas and I do uh welcome to my channel I do educational videos on many different subjects and today I think we&#x27;re at about the 25th episode of um working with the reciprocal system of theory Theory uh system of theory developed by Dewey B Larson back in the uh you know 20th century uh from about 1930 until 1990 when he died and then uh kind of revamped by Dr Bruce Perrette Dr kbk nehru Dr Gopi Krishna and many others um at least several others uh in the 21st century and um uh we&#x27;ve gone over kind of my biographical experience with the reciprocal system Larson&#x27;s biography uh and then we went through his um his article or a speech that he gave uh called the deductive development of the reciprocal system it gives you the step-by-step approach now we&#x27;re looking at his uh his final book which was published published posthumously in 1995 uh called beyond space and time uh we are kind of like in chapter three uh I have do have a problem in that I&#x27;ve lost my copy of beyond space and time so I&#x27;m kind of going for my notes well I didn&#x27;t find a copy of the book but I did find a better copy of my notes or like slightly better notes so we&#x27;re going to work with that uh we were working here now uh the basic aspects of Larson&#x27;s Theory again is that the universe is um uh you know he he was a mining engineer he came up with uh many different um he was he was working on many different uh kind of uh chemistry problems uh in his in his uh off time uh from his job and uh this was back in the 20s and 30s and he eventually had a couple epiphanies and worked on them through an inductive process where he went from the specific to the general uh to kind of eventually figure out uh and arrive at his postulates he&#x27;s got two fundamental postulates and since they&#x27;re short I can read them again uh the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects base and time now that is his most important postulate the second postulate is um somewhat under dispute and not as important just uh kind of just as a uh things that almost almost should be obvious even though that even though he uh he got some things wrong with them second fundamental postulate the physical Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean now um it does seem you know that that would make sense but um the geometry has been uh contested uh the mathematics has been contested and the magnitudes have been contested um mainly because uh these all apply you know on Earth uh but there are other Realms where uh likes for example euclidean geometry is just a subset of a larger uh geometry like a projective geometry um that is more encompassing so euclidean geometry is kind of just a a particular um manifestation of projective geometry uh and so Dr Bruce Perrette uh reformulated that second postulate we&#x27;ll eventually get into that it&#x27;s kind of getting into the weeds right now so those are the basics of uh of Larson&#x27;s system now um I&#x27;m trying to uh find my good copy of notes here okay now um other people have come up with this idea that um that the universe is made out of motion okay um but Larson kind of uh including like Thomas Hobbes uh and I believe Renee Descartes uh maybe Arthur Eddington and um they uh you tried to go with this motion idea of the universe of motion but didn&#x27;t really get anywhere and what uh I think enabled Larson to get further than they did is that he redefined space and time uh and here he says you know space has been regarded as a kind of setting in which the action of the universe takes place a container for the material objects that participate in this action and Larson really redefines space and time as not the space as not the container of the universe but actually one of the contents of the universe so the universe is made out of uh space and time uh which go together in motion uh all motions are a relationship between space and time or its reciprocal a relationship between time and space they&#x27;re really you know the same it&#x27;s just uh the numerator and the denominator of a fraction or a relationship or a ratio um so uh what Larson is saying is uh here he says filled with a substance having the properties of a connecting medium through which the various influences are originating at one spatial location could be transmitted to a to distant locations so um he&#x27;s saying investing space with the ability to act as a transmitting medium um so this is you know what uh the 19th century scientist called The Ether uh a transmitting medium there&#x27;s got to be some kind of transmitting medium between you know for uh action at a distance um here he says time has always been more elusive than space space is assigned the properties that were formerly attributed to the hypothetical ether okay so uh he&#x27;s really saying here that uh you know the 19th century scientists used this idea of the ether as the transmitting mechanism Einstein uh used the sleight of hand to kind of get rid of the concept get rid of the word ether without really getting rid of the concept of ether okay now here he&#x27;s saying motion is defined as a relation between space and time and it is measured as speed or velocity uh speed and velocity are the same thing other than velocity is in a specific Direction whereas speed is a scalar magnitude having no uh or all directions space and time are the two reciprocal aspects of that motion space and time cannot have any significance anywhere that they do not have in motion okay so more or less space and time are illusory they do not have any significance other than when they are together in motion space and time are simply the two reciprocal aspects of motion they have no other significance uh similar in all respects time is similar in all respects to space except that it is the reciprocal aspect space does not exist alone nor does time exist alone neither exist except in association with the other as motion and uh you know there he goes with the Box analogy if you have a box uh you have three things you have the box itself uh which is the boundary which you could think of as like the speed of light again remember Einstein in Einstein&#x27;s theory the speed of light is the maximum speed of universe in Larson&#x27;s Theory the speed of light is the neutral point or the midpoint between two separate kind of sub universes [Music] um and the so the speed of light is like the uh midpoint of the Universe and everything that moves slower than the speed of light is in space everything moving faster than the speed of light is is really in time so you have the box which represents the speed of light and then you have the inside of the box which is the space part and the outside of the box which is the time part um that&#x27;s just like an analogy to to be able to think about it uh and then he goes into the abstraction that we talked about yesterday um okay he says that the general reciprocal relation between space and time this is the only Innovation that the new system of theory introduces into scientific thought um and then he goes through the postulate and he goes to the second postulate um and uh he says uh no no actual evidence to support the prevailing belief that time is one dimensional the time term in a space velocity equation is scalar not because it is one dimensional but because it has no spatial Dimensions at all whatever dimensions uh it may have are dimensions of time as a condition of becoming a scientist is therefore necessary to assume that the universe is logical orderly and rational and so this is the implied third postulate that we got to yesterday incorporating the assumption that the universe is logical orderly and rational and again he says that you know you really pretty much have to accept this as a condition of becoming a scientist now I don&#x27;t know um you know what he would think about Chaos Theory um um you know or chaos science but uh moving on he just um uh uh the conclusion is derived from the basic capacity of the reciprocal system constitute a theoretical Universe extending the development of a theoretical system whose validity we have already verified as a whole we&#x27;re able to explore not only the regions that are dimly visible but also regions that are totally invisible okay that was kind of what I was saying about time when if time is identical to space other than they are reciprocals but we we only see space we do not see time so uh but we can extrapolate we can discover the qualities of space and or what I would call the space uh time region like so if you&#x27;ve got the box as the midpoint of the universe then the outside of the box is um I guess what Larson calls the space-time region and the uh this side is the time space region the inside of the box and you know there&#x27;s a question of that terminology whether he should have it the other way around or not but that&#x27;s how he that&#x27;s how he has it and um we only are able to see this sector the slower than light sector um but what we can glean from this sector we can apply in the reciprocal to the other sector that we can&#x27;t see the realm of uh three-dimensional time uh here is the realm of three-dimensional space we can we can make measurements and and see our way there uh but we can apply that directly uh and identically except reciprocally to the three-dimensional time uh region of three-dimensional time um so that is uh something that that the theory allows us to see what he calls the dimly visible and the totally invisible so this is uh again uh something that uh is a is a scientific breakthrough um now uh again Larson uh in his deductive development he talks about how um you know where his in his reciprocal system uh 90 of Legacy science the previous you know but current science um fits into his theory you know where ninety percent of what the scientists have come up with he hit according to his deductive development if this then that if you know taking the the postulates and going if this then that if this then that he incorporates 90 of science into his theory as being correct it&#x27;s the the 10 that Larson is making the corrections on and those 10 are generally in the realm of the very very small the very very large the very very fast very very slow so you know in general you know the Newtonian universe is is Incorporated in its whole in in the reciprocal system you know so you&#x27;ve got the Newtonian universe and then Einstein comes along and he notices that okay the Newtonian Universe um is pretty much right but it gets wrong answers here on the margins you know when we&#x27;re talking about speeds coming close to the speed of light or when we&#x27;re talking about uh you know particles that are so small that they&#x27;re microscopic or where where we&#x27;re talking about you know particles are are bodies that are so big that we hardly can uh you know resolve them you know part of things the size of galaxies and so on quasars and even though quasars hadn&#x27;t even been um observed and then um you know the very very slow very very slow processes processes take that take billions of years or whatever to account uh to accomplish so that&#x27;s where Larson is is really starting he has a book that&#x27;s actually called Beyond Newton okay so he&#x27;s thinking he&#x27;s taking his theories Beyond Newton so he&#x27;s kind of saying that it&#x27;s a replacement for Einstein like he&#x27;s not even using Einstein as the basis for going forward at all he confirms Einstein&#x27;s equals mc squared but and and you know the quantum from maybe the post einsteinians but in general he&#x27;s taking uh he&#x27;s taking his um basis as the Newtonian universe and moving forward or as chapter 4 is called reaching outward and here he says in the Realms of the very large the very small and the very fast you know and I would also say they&#x27;re very slow the New Concept of the nature of time leads to a drastic reconstruction of the relevant Theory the effect of this hitherto unrecognized Motion in time that is responsible for the discrepancies we do not perceive physical objects directly that we have direct knowledge only of the sense data and that our concepts of the physical objects are mental constructs based on that data there is an external Universe independent of man an independent of any observations that he may make the physical universe is a universe of motion that is motion is the reality of which the universe is composed motions and combinations thereof are therefore real real in any ordinary sense of the word some of the unobservables of modern physics the nucleus of an atom for example Are Holy non-existence some such as electromagnetic or gravitational fields are merely special ways of looking at physical situations that is describing the relations between motions and belonging in the same category in which we place such Concepts as the center of gravity of an object or the poles of the Earth atoms uh so he&#x27;s he&#x27;s uh you know saying that the gravitational electromagnetic uh fields are merely conveniences for us to make measurements and that things like the nucleus of an atom according to him is uh non-existent uh the um the next thing that he&#x27;s talking about here um sense data are merely messages conveying this information not basic realities in their own right uh there&#x27;s another okay now this goes back to you know going into this uh three-dimensional time region um or sector there is another half identical in all respects to the material sector okay he eventually calls that the cosmic sector okay so there&#x27;s the material sector then there&#x27;s the boundary and then there&#x27;s the cosmic sector and within the material sector there is a a smaller realm and within the cosmic sector there&#x27;s also a smaller realm um so there&#x27;s really there ends up being kind of like five things the boundary the the material sector the cosmic sector and then what he eventually calls the time region and the space region uh within and those are within uh these larger Cosmic and material sectors so there&#x27;s another half identical in all respects to the material sector except that space and time are interchanged inverse gravitation of The Cat in the cosmic sector that moves Aggregates of matter of cosmic matter toward each other in time okay we&#x27;re gonna just leave it right there um I think uh I&#x27;ll be able to to to negotiate this a little bit better now that I&#x27;ve got these notes here um but uh just keep with it you know we&#x27;ll figure it out and we&#x27;re gonna work through this and we&#x27;re gonna learn to understand the system it&#x27;s very powerful once we get the gist of it okay so thanks and we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow</p>
