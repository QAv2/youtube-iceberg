            <p>all right everyone hello uh welcome to my channel my name is Thomas and I am uh dedicating my channel to educational matters and um we just got done going through uh the book beyond space and time by Dewey B Larson and that was kind of uh getting into his metaphysical theory of his reciprocal system of theory the reciprocal system of theory is a theory of everything that Larson um derived during the 20th century up until his death in 1990 and most of his earlier work is on the hard Sciences we just went through his last book beyond space and time that&#x27;s more on metaphysics religion philosophy and psychology um now we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna back up a little bit uh eventually we&#x27;re gonna take a look at his stuff that is on the hard Sciences um maybe not in as much detail uh but but in uh some good detail but today I want to uh back up or for the next few days back up and uh kind of look at the man himself and what his motivations were where he&#x27;s coming from what his background is what the context is um and what&#x27;s at stake and so we&#x27;re going to take a look at his uh 1984 interview that he did with uh Jan Sommer at in Salt Lake City Utah August 1984 and at this time Larson was already I believe 86 years old um this was just six years before he died and he was in the middle of his most productive period really uh he did his uh his great work uh the structure of the physical Universe Volume 2 um or the revised version of that which includes three books um nothing but motion which is mainly physics basic properties of matter I think nothing but motion is from 1979 basic properties of matter which is on chemistry 1987 and then uh his book on astronomy Universe of motion 1984. uh those are kind of his three major works on the hard sciences and then he did his beyond space and time uh during that same period but it wasn&#x27;t uh released till after he died um now uh again with the reciprocal system the basic idea is that the universe is not a universe of matter not a universe of energy but it is a universe of motion the uh and motion is the relationship between space and time when you use that term relationship you&#x27;re kind of implying this reciprocal relationship space and time are reciprocals of one another they don&#x27;t really exist they only exist together in motion and all of our basic phenomena of science are forms of motion and they are relationships between space and time and um you know unlike the uh kind of the uh Legacy science Viewpoint where space and time are the container of the universe we see spaces this empty thing that we are you know contained within Larson sees space and time as the actual contents of the universe the universe is made out of this relationship between space and time or motion he uses the term motion most often but but he originally started by using the term space time and that he&#x27;s also used the word change change in three dimensions because uh as reciprocals whatever qualities uh refer to one also refer to the other space and time so space we know to be multi-dimensional three or more dimensions therefore time also is three or more Dimensions we know of space we know of time to be flowing or progressing always getting later and later therefore space is also flowing and progressing always getting farther and farther apart observed by the Hubble telescope in the recession of the distant galaxies Larson calls that clock time and clock space and then with the dimensionality calls it coordinate time and coordinate space and then there&#x27;s also the discrete unit postulate time and space only come in discrete units that&#x27;s not a continuous uh thing it&#x27;s chunks they come in chunks of space and time and um one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light and so you know using that logic the space of the space and um the speed of light is the not the maximum speed of the universe the way Lars the way Einstein would have you believe but it&#x27;s the midpoint or the null point or the neutral point uh the origin even of the universe um so that is another departure and that is what kind of creates his ideas for the book beyond space and time where he says well half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light and half is moving slower and that creates uh you know two different regions which when they combine that creates life but um most of his books don&#x27;t go don&#x27;t go into that so we&#x27;re just going to be reading some of his comments here from his uh 1984 interview and I don&#x27;t even know I don&#x27;t really I don&#x27;t know that I have written down all the questions from the questioner but um you can kind of get what those questions are implied from just Larson&#x27;s answers okay the fact that I&#x27;m steering the theory away from mathematics now is not because as some might think I have a dislike for the subject but simply because I found out that you can&#x27;t get to what I was after by that route I graduated in mining engineering not because I had any intention of doing mining but because I only had enough money to get by for three years General engineering um he won an award there at Oregon State University where he uh Oregon State University where he uh went to school and he was actually a colleague or he went to school at the same time uh and was uh you know new Linus Pauling and so um you know they were both given a reward uh an award for like the brightest student or something like that and he says I don&#x27;t think it mattered anymore to him than it did to me and he says I&#x27;ve always been some of a somewhat of a rebel I got shoved into administrative work as so often happens with engine engineers and Industry and that was one of the things that contributed to my going into the research uh work on the side I wanted to tackle something specific of the rather first order of magnitude so that if I did hit something it would be worthwhile something I knew had an answer or felt certainly had an answer and yet nobody had gotten it uh then he goes on we are not changing the mathematics or the physical equations we&#x27;re changing the view of the problem uh and that&#x27;s one thing that you know is kind of missed about the reciprocal system is that uh when he when he talks about uh you know using the basic postulates of the reciprocal system to derive a universe of motion um 90 of what he comes up with had already exists it&#x27;s already out there it&#x27;s already it agrees with the Legacy scientist it&#x27;s only 10 or something that is in disagreement with the Legacy science um and that usually has to do with the Realms of the very fast the very slow the very large and the very small so on the margins uh in general um you know the Newtonian the Newtonian equations are correct when applied at kind of a macro uh but not super macro level those and that was kind of the same finding that Einstein had Einstein uh you know adjusted some of the equations using some other mathematics like minkowski and uh and Lorenz contractions but um he left alone the majority of the Newtonian mechanics it was just on the margins that these changes needed to be made and that&#x27;s kind of the same thing with Larson he he actually has a book that&#x27;s called Beyond Newton his work is not coming from Beyond Einstein it&#x27;s coming from Beyond Newton Newton is the core of this and then but Newton didn&#x27;t he didn&#x27;t get into the uh very fast very small the very large and the very slow okay so here at Larson says we are not changing the mathematics of the or the physical equations we&#x27;re changing the view of the problem uh in other in other instances he talks about how um that the uh the equations and the Legacy science you know the the science that we learned in high school and stuff um that them that the stuff it&#x27;s mathematically correct but it is not conceptually correct that&#x27;s what Larson is changing he&#x27;s changing the underlying concepts of the numbers but his his derivations where he he derives the same equations as the classical mechanics uh but it&#x27;s that he&#x27;s changing the The View he says the view of the problem or the concepts underlying these numbers okay so here he says quantum numbers are the same kind of adjustable constants that they&#x27;re putting in the equations of State each element gets a set of numbers not taken out of thin air or determined from experiment or anything like that but from Pure Theory and to the extent that we have arrived at equations such as that for inter-utom enter Atomic distance they are theoretically explained rather than quantitatively explained so he&#x27;s saying that the equations of quantum mechanics they&#x27;re correct mathematically they make sense quantitatively but they don&#x27;t have the theory they don&#x27;t have the theory uh behind it you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like they they reverse engineered the theory you know they started with the numbers and reverse engineered the theory now critics of Larson would say that he did the same thing in a number of instances and I would probably agree uh you know old habits die hard I guess but uh to a great extent he also altered the concepts underlying uh the whole situation okay I was trying to find mathematical equations in which numbers could be assigned to these different substances exactly as the rest of them were doing wasn&#x27;t going to get me what I wanted because ultimately I am going back to a number that is arbitrary what I had to do was to get something that is Meaningful to start with and work the other way uh and so now he&#x27;s talking about his his first book uh it uh first version of the first book it dates back to about 1930. okay so that&#x27;s like 60 years before he died so he&#x27;s working on this whole thing for 60 years plus you know that&#x27;s um you know inspiring dedication never got any credit never got any money out of the whole thing so that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s one of my heroes and other other also because he did all of his great greatest work when he was in his 80s you know so that&#x27;s inspiring to me thinking you know I still have a chance to do something you know in my life that uh is is a lasting contribution because I&#x27;m not in my 80s yet you know I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have to give up yet okay um now it dates back to about 1930. first chapters were probably written around 1930 and the last chapters right around 1940. uh much like digging up ancient ruins these Works were not written for publication it was written to keep my ideas in a coherent form I had no intention at the start to go into a new Theory of physics I was tackling a particular problem in a very large percentage of the cases when I got The Right View I didn&#x27;t need any mathematics a simple harmonic motion is just as fundamental as a linear or translational motion okay so like in Larson&#x27;s Universe of motion he&#x27;s really got four fundamental motions you&#x27;ve got the linear motion and then you have the um you have the rotational motion and then um you&#x27;ve got the uh linear vibration and then you&#x27;ve got the rotational vibration and these uh will come in one two or three dimensions uh and then now he&#x27;s throwing in this simple harmonic motion which is basically a combination of the rotation uh uh it&#x27;s really it&#x27;s really somewhat of a rotational vibration but it&#x27;s really um you know the simple harmonic motion is the sine wave and so the sine wave comes out of a combination of a linear motion and at the same time a vibratory motion so you got the vibratory motion going up and down up and down and you&#x27;ve got the linear motion just going straight and so when you combine those you get a sine wave or what he calls a simple harmonic motion uh simple harmonic motion is just as fundamental as a linear or translational motion you start out with motion and motion as such can occur in different forms you don&#x27;t require anything to keep it going okay so this is just uh just like Newton&#x27;s uh I don&#x27;t know which one of his laws but you know um uh you know an object in motion tends to stay in motion we we kind of have to have to uh take out friction or Gravity from the situation if you if you&#x27;re in a in in a vacuum if you push an object it goes and it just continues to go so motion is uh doesn&#x27;t require anything to keep it going motion is um you know is a part of the whole structure or Larson is saying it is the entire okay uh in the absence uh same two same is true with rotation with the in the absence of friction you can rotate forever um and so uh now he&#x27;s kind of uh he he backs up and he&#x27;s talking about um the states of matter and this is fundamental to Larson&#x27;s Theory um that there are four states of matter maybe more but four that we&#x27;re gonna talk about within this context uh you&#x27;ve got the solid state of matter you&#x27;ve got the liquid state of matter you&#x27;ve got the vapor state of matter and you have the gas state of matter now you can talk about the plasma or condensation uh condensates or something like that but um that&#x27;s uh where Larson&#x27;s coming from and uh in this and this is fundamental to his whole structure uh in the solid state of matter um basically you have zero Dimensions that are free in the liquid state you have one dimension that&#x27;s free in the solid in the vapor State you have two Dimensions that are free and in the gas State all three dimensions are free um and we&#x27;ll get into that uh what is it free from eventually but we&#x27;ll just say that for now um I decided to tackle the more complicated sub substances and work backwards toward hydrogen so he starts uh with the numbers at the top of the periodic table when he&#x27;s doing his his investigations as opposed to starting from the bottom uh with hydrogen and he also starts with I believe the solid state of matter which is a more complicated than the gas state so he&#x27;s kind of working the other way the gas laws as we&#x27;re using them uh the properties of gases are actually the pros properties of empty space the ideal gas is a gas that has nothing but empty space in it we get to the properties of the substance itself then you have to make the correction make a correction and you have to correct it down to the recognition of these things you already have in the solid to begin with I realized I had to introduce a third number uh the minute you get into three numbers in anything like this you immediate your immediate reaction is those must be dimensions and then from that you deduced the atomic structure that is the question that&#x27;s being asked of him so um that&#x27;s what Larson does basically with the periodic table whereas in for example uh oxygen is element number eight in the periodic table for Larson he boils that boils it down to three separate motions two alternating two-dimensional rotations and then one one-dimensional vibration that can be positive or negative okay so for oxygen for example oxygen is two primary two-dimensional rotations two secondary two-dimensional rotations and two negative one dimensional rotation uh okay we&#x27;re gonna stop it now we&#x27;ll take over here starting tomorrow uh pay attention I&#x27;ve got another video coming on my uh decode of the Resurrection coming up later today</p>
