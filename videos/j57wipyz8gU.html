            <p>almost all of the debunk materials on UFO and at UAP and their quote rational explanations are truly remarkable for the reason that there is practically nothing new in them for more than 70 years weather balloons airplanes Venus above the Horizon and other atmospheric phenomena most of the Academia invent any nonsense for the natural interpretation of extremely unusual things in the sky but the most important thing though is never ever mention the acute and nervous interest of the military and secret intelligence services in all such phenomena the phenomenon that is clearly the best candidate for an advanced non-human civilization and that demonstrates god-like possibilities [Music] but before asserting anything it makes sense to quote the point of view of scientists those who are seriously investigating the technological aspects of the UAP phenomenon the scientific Coalition for UAP studies is a small group of scientists whose members are actively studying the phenomenon using a scientific approach one of their special guests was Dr Hal putoff physicist that is involved in many U.S army projects including the black budget programs that were directly involved in scientific studies of UAP phenomenon in the U.S army He was discussing what from reported anomalous observations of UAP phenomenon can be addressed on the basis of known physics things like Interstellar travel if any and so on so the Wormhole is not in principle ruled out and I&#x27;m talking science fiction here I mean this is academic textbook stuff the general relativity people investigate all the time so that could handle the issue of well they&#x27;re so far away how could they ever get here Dr putoff was a member of one of the scientific groups at SRI that helped to develop the methodology of the U.S army Stargate project in one of the Declassified transcripts of the remote viewing session described an event that very much resembles a wormhole formation it was noted that at the unknown facility the event made a very strange light effect an iridescent outline of some kind the unknown source described it quote this Apparition thing was a light this was an altering of reality this was like a whole different energy format like a hole drilled through nothing he also stated that this event was caused by something that popped into our reality the resemblance with some kind of open portal or Wormhole intensifies by further statement quote connected tissue of reality there&#x27;s twisted around in a corkscrew-like fashion from a hole and it&#x27;s makes for a very strange light effect remote viewer described it like a whole different energy format from somewhere else the further similarity with open Wormhole portal effects through the space-time Fabrics continues by the notion that it had to do with time or something like the connective tissue of reality was twisted in some way pulled apart interestingly enough another source that worked on this light Apparition mentioned an object that looked to him like a flying saucer and was connected to this event apart from the distinctive sketch of that object indeed looking like a flying saucer such UFO objects are often reported as glowing or emitting very bright light Dr putoff proposed his explanation of such a glow as partly caused by the blue shift effect I mean in the rooms where you&#x27;re sitting right now you don&#x27;t see most of the the electromagnetic spectrum it&#x27;s in the infrared it&#x27;s in the heat Spectrum what we see with our eyes in the visible is a relatively small part of the EM spectrum but under the conditions in which space-time metric has been engineered to produce the kind of effects you might expect to see in a UAP you get blue shift which means first of all some of that infrared is going to be upshifted into the visible part of the spectrum and so you&#x27;d expect craft to be actually quite bright which is one of the things that in fact is reported if this model is correct then theoretically we can even imagine how our world would look from the inside of such a craft inside the craft everything is working relatively normally it&#x27;s just that when they look out they see the rest of the world in redshifted and moving in slow motion so at least in terms of detecting their environment uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty reasonable uh you know what what they would be able to see but on the other hand there&#x27;s a kind of a simple side of it and that is the people inside the craft if there are people in The Craft uh to them things are very very normal uh so even though from the outside we say oh you know why aren&#x27;t they Fried by the blue shifted uh radiation and so on well it&#x27;s that under this model uh all their atomic structure and chemical elements are also all blue shifted so relatively speaking to them they&#x27;re in a kind of a normal space and of course with this blue shift effect there is a prediction of UAP near field exposure injuries for example the visible can be blue shifted up into the UV and you get sunburn injury often reported by people who encountered a powerful craft in close proximity or if you get too close some visible spectrum that is not harmful can be shifted up to soft x-ray radiation and you get radiation injury and so it was Circa 2011 or so when some people from the CIA and an aerospace company came to me to ask me for their help on the analysis of some individuals who had been had encountered some anomalous objects they said and I mean they came to my office unannounced and then started laying out pictures and data on the table in front of me I said I mean first I thought it was a joke I mean I really thought that I was being somebody was about to put me on Candid Camera and make a joke of it but as they started showing me the data and they were deadly serious about it because they had basically said at that point people have died they were military personnel uh people intelligence agents on the ground uh a pilot a few Pilots actually um who had gotten close enough and they had some sort of effects uh objects on the ground with that were you know glowing or you know moving too fast or they were there and they got too close to it and that it just disappeared and then afterwards they get these they get these radiation Burns very often some of them have been uh basically on the skin you see this sclerosis of the skin reddening inflammation of the skin so some sort of electromagnetic radiation we imagine uh but then it goes deep enough into some of their bodies if they got too close that would cause lasting scarring within the body which is not something you ever want to have if you go back into the historical records things written by the scientists and philosophers and Mayors and kings of the day you know it&#x27;s in the record this object was seen it looked like a wheel or looked like a shield and it showed up over our battles and you know etc etc so you can go back and re-context the observations and say well as if somebody wrote that today I&#x27;d call it a UFO or a UAP as for the ancient historical references the same blue shift effect might be observed by the Egyptian pharaoh who described a miracle during the battle with Nubians when the quote Star as he described it flew in very close proximity over the heads of the Nubian Army literally burning them alive and spreading Panic between Warriors Dr Nolan mentions another group of specific damages to the brain he researched that occurred during the close encounter with UAP phenomenon it&#x27;s interesting that as was previously theorized by scientists Victor injushin and Vladimir Sedlak are bodies naturally possess cold plasma which as they believe mostly localized in our brain and spinal cord such bioplasma can provide a natural interface for psychic phenomena often induced by UAP that at the moment is widely perceived as parapsychological otherwise and it can be also responsible for brain damage of some observers after close encounters with UAP phenomenon and the Rangers were interesting because one of the things that we noticed in these individuals and this is sort of a side study which I&#x27;m working on with a group at Harvard is we notice that an area of the brain the caudate potamin in many of these individuals was over developed uh and uh that&#x27;s a whole other story but basically we figured out that this is an area where intuition happens and a lot of these individuals who we had were is called them high functioning you know you don&#x27;t get to be a pilot of a sense of craft without being reasonably smart and having intuition uh and so um just a side benefit of studying this allowed us to find a come up with a medical uh understanding of where cognition is happening in the brain and we&#x27;re following up with that in a mainstream science way with a neurophysiology group at Harvard and we&#x27;ve validated the original findings but that was sort of a it&#x27;s sort of an example of because we paid attention to anomalous data we found an anomaly that really had nothing to do with the injury in the first place but it told us something about what makes people intuitive and smart</p>
