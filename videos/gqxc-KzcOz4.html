when the programs designers inlaw Corporation accused the US justice department of stealing the software for their own foreign policy purposes this programmer testified he altered the program to create what&#x27;s called a back door to allow government spying this happened while working on Cabazon Indian Sovereign land well the parties that were involved in the distribution of this software uh were involved in covert operations and they were involved in uh uh Nicaragua and Central America and they were involved in operations in the Middle East this Us justice department Memo from 1985 shows the promise software was being sold to Middle Eastern Arms dealers and wanted no paperwork or Customs inspections to interfere even Unsolved Mysteries got on the case from the last journalist to investigate this spy Scandal was found dead in his hotel room Danny Cello&#x27;s wrists were slashed in 1991 it was ruled a suicide but his reporter notes disappeared and the book on the conspiracy he

involved in a criminal conspiracy to force inslaw a small computer company out of business the hearings ended inconclusively the promise software was allegedly altered on tribal land in India with a lack of federal oversight and just like Microsoft Windows the database program kept up with the times upgraded several times over the years but promise came back to haunt America in ways never imagined a disturbing indication that Robert Hansen the FBI man accused of spying for the Russians in what officials said at the time of his arrest was a massive security breach ended up helping Usama Bin Laden as correspondent Carl Cameron reports Hansen sold the Russians an extremely sensitive piece of us technology and the indications are that they in turn sold it to Bin Laden&#x27;s Al-Qaeda terrorist network from an office in India to foreign capitals all over the world several murder investigations are connected to this spy Scandal whether answers can still be found 27 years later

questions at this point okay you&#x27;re at part 31 of this investigation where is it going next the next part we look forward to doing is uh revealing a little bit more of the confidential information the internal documents uh very chilling information where a detective is basically saying that they cannot look uh their wife in the eyes and tell her that they are willing to risk the life of their family by pursuing this case so they&#x27;re basically asking to get off the case more on that coming up very soon why won&#x27;t the DA&#x27;s office say whether or not David mcgaan was looking into this their official stance is that David mcgaan was not looking into this that is their official stance according to their spokespeople but at this point uh there have been a lot of questions that have been asked uh friends and partners of uh David mcgallen have been asked questions about what cases he was working on before the 2005 deaths okay thank you Nathan thank you</p>
