            <p>[Music] hi today I&#x27;ll be covering the topic of vector and scaler quantities the gcsc physics in 60 seconds 3 2 1 go to understand what the terms vector and Scala mean we will first need to know about magnitude and Direction magnitude is a wave describing how bigger value is and Direction tells us which way something is traveling vector quantity are those which have both magnitude and Direction an example of this would be velocity which tells us how great the speed is and also which direction the object is traveling in whereas Scala quantities only have magnitude an example of this is speed which can only tell us how fast the object is traveling it does not however specify a direction both vector and Scala quantities will be used commonly in future topics which is why it is essential to understand the differences between the two [Music] complete if you like this video please take a moment to like comment and subscribe for more [Music] content thanks for watching</p>
