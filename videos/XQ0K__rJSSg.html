            <p>[Music] hello friends and followers this is episode 27 13th of August 2017 it&#x27;s good to see the regular visitors back watching another episode of mine it&#x27;s good to have you here and like in in commenting on the video it helps me get noticed more in this episode I&#x27;ll be covering the life work of Thomas Townsend Brown he was the pioneer on lecture graphics and gravitated device I will be covering more of the interests and aspects of his work and then I will cover some others bio history at the end the story goes that one day he noticed hell violently a x-ray tube was vibrating like it was trying to escape the equipment when it was charging that he wanted investigated further and found that the literary tube was as shown here also known as the Coolidge tube had some sort of frost when he was experimenting with them when it was charging up the plates because it uses a competant a belief Tesla was also experimenting with the same tube and that&#x27;s where he got his radiant energy ideas from which you can watch in the other episode I&#x27;ve made previously called Tesla fringe science now also Tesla had invented a anti-gravity device using some sort of alloy mix and the information on that was lost because or maybe the FBI got their hands on it because they had it all in a secret chest which they got their hands on when he died but you can listen to all that and see what I percent in a previous episode so won&#x27;t cover it here but maybe telson Brown had discovered the same thing with some anti-gravity effect of these particular high-voltage judge and capacitors and tubes x-ray tubes as it faced here the origins of literary gravity can be traced back to Nikola Tesla&#x27;s work with high-voltage shock dis judges at the turn of the 20th century and somewhat later to thomas Townsend&#x27;s Brown relatively unpublicized discovery that liquor a static and gravitational fields are closely intertwined unfortunately the electrographic effect has been for the most part then ignored by mainstream academics because the feminine isn&#x27;t incipit ated by Aoife classical literary statics or general relativity there are some original photographs of him with his models that he produced as you can see they&#x27;re very flying-saucer looking and umbrellas that sort of charged and caused a lift underneath and as you can see the umbrella is saucer shaped like a UFO as well but they had a chord counter because they had to produce high voltage from a generator or competitor and course you can only do that from a ground generator at the time of course nowadays they may have nuclear generators that generate heaps of electricity that compare these high-voltage craft so it&#x27;s all theory on what could be happening today in the secret stealth craft research or you&#x27;re fighting oh gee side of things here we see they&#x27;re using a balance where the shown that it was lifting up weights and they could measure how much force it was and they could change the direction of the charge and it would lower and go higher and they could go left and right instantly without banking and has various graphs here shown how the judges worked clearly there&#x27;s something special in the saucer half domed shape how the charges wrap around it and also the fields there was later renamed by filled Brown effect because he named after his mentor as it says here but he done the bulk of the research in experiments if the wiki here says that it creates a Island but there&#x27;s been a lot of debate whether the lift is all iron wind and not anti-gravity effect I will go more into that in a minute here they&#x27;re talking about somehow he discovered the various aspects of the phenomenon and from the files of the surfaces to the charge the high voltages used and also the mass in the how much atmospheres into the atmosphere pressure so they did a lot of different experiments to determine all the different factors here how the planks were design the distance between the plates the materials use as you can see here has research led to the idea that charge in the knees cone and also the edge of the front wings could reduce drag of the wind that is passing through because it causes a repellent effect which is used on the b-2 bomber now come across this article and I says the by Phil Brown effect involves judging a capacitor to a very high voltage and which there is a reported loss of weight involving a force that is felt by the capacitor in the direction of the positive blade this is thought to be an anti-gravity effect around the world numerous people have developed and built small devices which intended to exploit the boy Phil Brown effect with these devices being called lifters I will show a picture of some of them in a minute these devices are able to fly about sometimes tethered to the ground and sometimes flying on their own recently larger lift devices have been built some of these larger lifters fly autonomously it has been reported that dr. Brown I said the boy field effect and a vacuum in very sophisticated experiments this would suggest that the boy field effect is not to what some people call Ireland but until recently to the best of my lives no one has tested the boy field effect and a vacuum reason they lifter well this has actually been done and I will show you more information on that there was a collection of photographs of some lifters that people built and this guy goes on to say that the Russians had been experimenting with this in created free energy and anti-gravity that this is back in 2009 or 8 and still it&#x27;s 2017 and we still have no news on TV or these craft line in the sky or free energy so has it been suppressed or was it all talk we don&#x27;t know here&#x27;s a apparatus that he was using in front because he was sponsored by the France aerospace to do experiments and here they claim that he was flying too many source and a near vacuum so to discount iein wind so ever he had discovered something and hadn&#x27;t been published yet or has been suppressed we don&#x27;t really know but I found some other people experimenting up to our current time and it seems they have debunked the lifters working in a vacuum however one guy tried a different approach and this vacuum is one part of the lifter and it still would move so maybe it does work in a vacuum but in an entirely different way to help people forty had to be done also netha did their own experiments with it and here&#x27;s a side-by-side of old video on YouTube one piece spinnin which is an atmosphere and the other one total vacuum would be absolutely still so they prove that was any I and when that was moving it they using a seed that got the whole thing in a vacuum unlike the previous go that was experimented with putting only half of it in a vacuum where it can&#x27;t get our own ones because the other part of us on a vacuum so I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s very interesting maybe there&#x27;s more to it maybe people can keep experimenting and playing and trying to n vacuum there&#x27;s plenty of footage on YouTube to have a look for it but here&#x27;s a couple of samples I&#x27;ve added and lift there that songs built that&#x27;s the trying outside but it&#x27;s got a thin wire that you don&#x27;t see get into it for the high voltage because I don&#x27;t think it could ever zone power generation and lift up because they&#x27;ll be too heavy so it&#x27;s not practical in that respect and also some people here demonstrated an iron when as it spins around to sources on a balance and then some classical footage from the man himself sharing some really really old 8 millimeter tape converted to mp4 so there you can see his umbrella design that sort of lifting up it&#x27;s not too stable there and also the celebratin there so they must have got some sort of victory heaven in there and I see they&#x27;ve got a decking tube or glass that goes over top of their experiment so I can&#x27;t write about atmosphere although atmosphere so I guess I&#x27;m the iron engine would work I&#x27;d get you up to the edge of space so then you can switch to some other type of propulsion I guess if it&#x27;s feasible for lifting up heavy weights it does look like they&#x27;re adding a heavy mess underneath the umbrella design there though so they were trying heavier and heavier weights to see how much you could lift on how much higher voltage you needed of space higher voltage more rust here they took about the to the new emdrive electromagnetic drive that uses no fuel and causes a warp field that causes the craft of constantly fall into the vent space in front of it tools propulsion and also they&#x27;re talking about here the Tesla&#x27;s Aoife system and how they&#x27;d explain at all with relativity and conventional science maximum of the old science maybe the old science wasn&#x27;t wrong after all and stuff how we look at things I just want to change the wording of hell as to fit in with quantum physics and here the Chinese said they have successfully proven that the EM Drive works and they&#x27;ve also tested on a space satellite so how about that a lot of people had doubts and sort of destroyed the wiki&#x27;s on it and stuff because they didn&#x27;t believe that it was real and hadn&#x27;t been proven a human drive was totally different to the lifter idea iron drive Roy he has many patents as you can see a big list here and there is countries as well they moved around a bit not too sure if that&#x27;s because of his work or maybe some other political reasons like being treated badly by USA I only focused on a few patents from the chapters here with some figures so you can have a look of course there might then some paintings suppressed by the government and for top secret reasons of course he may not wanted the paintin everything that he had found out maybe for his own reasons but we&#x27;ll never really know that the iron thruster engine was the only thing he did and the anti-gravity work is a picture of with his wife and daughter and the reason I&#x27;m showing you this is because the daughter when she&#x27;s growing up has written in to read that and with a big letter explaining that her life of her dad and what she touched and played with his sweatshops and what he said to her got a bit of a new on the fruit there um as you can read someone&#x27;s asking overload questions which your answer I won&#x27;t read it all out by just read out some key parts from it all and expanded out see and have enough time to read what&#x27;s there that does hit the pause button because I know some every everyone&#x27;s a different speed reader now she mentions that her dad said his prototype that she played with was similar to atom ski scalloped UFO design and ESRI have found out sunset atom ski-e-o face with the balls underneath were actually hoaxes made from Jin or motor light bulbs in putts and curves and similar hears from diagrams showing how the charges would brick around the UFO the cause of the left there atom ski sculpture as he called it he knows he may had a one they actually worked with the bull charges underneath but the evidence key ones were faked so there weren&#x27;t those I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s been any other UFO sightings with balls underneath that he&#x27;s referring to that maybe they do have a prototype that works is some wiki on atom ski and his prototype model ships that hell they debunk them and saw GM written on some of the parts one could say that GM may be designed Browns UFO that these models were very small and obvious model then we&#x27;re actually real craft lying around so that beats that theory here is an interest in Article two one of that Browns life and from his early years as a kid as he grew up and worked at different places I probably won&#x27;t read out all of it that read out some paragraphs here and there here it talks about his keen interest in space travel as a younger person a kid and also talks about his interest in x-ray tubes which were already covered it goes on to talk about that he sets of experiments to study the force he had discovered and his gravity device which we probably called lifters it was about in California he goes to Caltech to study and tries to befriend professors and share his ideas to them that they didn&#x27;t accept the idea saying that couldn&#x27;t exist and they&#x27;re disciplined for current science theories so basically they weren&#x27;t interested in 1922 so he transferred to ioho University and studied study in there closer to his home this is where it gets turned around he meets professor by field which was interested in his ideas and the slid to the by Phil Brown effect theory so here it talks about how he goes into the Navy ends up in West Indies in 92 as a physicist and also deep sea expedition of 1935 later in the year depression took its toll and budget drawbacks forced him to leave the Naval Research Lab so it&#x27;s also that more of his life here they time jobs during the 30 so it did not prevent Brown from continuing his study of physics in general and I feel ground effect and particular durin available evening and weekend hours done quite a lot and his life talks about here during the war and he worked in engineering and reader and post war went to Hawaii and worked for Lockheed so you can read all that there as you&#x27;re interested in his bio history and it&#x27;s a good little paragraph there the other song I go through it says here in the end he set up his own corporation to delve more into his ideas and thus I filled affect in gravity antigravity experiments failure very interesting but in the end the government in other groups and corporations were interested in what he had to do despite many patents that he had made so other people have researched since in 2004 here some guys talking about his competitor plate judges and seeing how much force they gave distance apart probably really similar to what Townsend grounded and here shows charts in measurements of lab tests quite interesting read there you can read it all yourself and pause it and try and understand it all but you can see can cause quite a lift some of these competitors so maybe iron engine is not the only thing that charging competitors can cause weight loss on the actual competitor itself metal plates so I&#x27;ll leave it there it was probably a lot more that could be seared and explained in the probably above my understanding as well but I hope you enjoyed the episode and hit the like button in the add comments if you have more information yourself just post in the comments there and thanks for watching and I&#x27;ll see you again next episode stay safe everybody [Music] you</p>
