            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>The storm raged over Manhattan on the night of January 7th, 1943. The night Nicola Tesla was found dead in his small, cluttered hotel room at the New Yorker Hotel. He had lived in solitude for years, surrounded by mountains of papers, blueprints, notes, and calculations documents that, according to those who had seen them, held the Key 2 technologies far beyond anything the world had ever known. Hours after Tesla&#x27;s body was discovered, something deeply suspicious happened. The FBI along with a littleknown government agency called the Office of Alien Property stormed into his room and confiscated every single one of his papers.</p>
<p>They claimed it was to protect national security. But those who knew Tesla understood the truth. His work had always threatened those in power. For years, Tesla had spoken of inventions that could change the world. Technologies that could provide free energy, wireless global communication, even devices capable of tapping into an unseen power source.</p>
<p>But time and time again, his funding was pulled, his ideas were dismissed, and his biggest breakthroughs were never allowed to see the light of day. Now his most secret works were in the hands of the very people who had tried to silence him, the death ray, a weapon that could end all wor of Tesla&#x27;s most controversial claims was that he had developed a device called the Teleforce, better known as the Death Ray. He described it as a weapon so powerful that it could instantly destroy an entire army from hundreds of miles away. According to Tesla, this wasn&#x27;t just theory. He had built a prototype and was prepared to demonstrate it.</p>
<p>In 1934, he attempted to sell the idea to world governments, claiming that it could end all wars by making invasion impossible. But instead of funding his research, world leaders ignored him or worse, feared what would happen if such power fell into the wrong hands. Shortly before his death, Tesla confided in a close friend that his notes had been stolen. He suspected that multiple governments, including the United States and the Soviet Union, had taken his work to develop their own versions of the weapon. But without his guidance, they would never fully understand how it worked.</p>
<p>When the FBI raided his hotel room, no trace of the death ray plans were ever found. Official reports claim they never existed, but some believe that those blueprints ended up in classified military projects, shaping the development of future weapons. The Warden Cliff Tower, free energy for the world. Perhaps Tesla&#x27;s most revolutionary idea was his belief that energy could be transmitted wirelessly across the globe. His Warden Cliff Tower, built in the early 1900s, was designed to harness electricity from the Earth itself, allowing unlimited free energy to be distributed to everyone everywhere.</p>
<p>But as the tower neared completion, something happened. Tesla&#x27;s funding was suddenly cut off. His financial backer, JP Morgan, one of the most powerful men of the time, pulled his investment. The official reason Tesla&#x27;s system was unproven. The real reason Morgan realized there was no way to profit from free energy.</p>
<p>Not long after Tesla was forced to abandon the project and the Warden Cliff Tower was demolished. Every document related to its function vanished. It was as if the world had been deliberately robbed of an invention that could have changed the course of history. The oscillator that shook New York in the 1890s. Tesla built a mechanical oscillator, a device capable of generating extreme vibrations.</p>
<p>One day while testing it in his lab, the device began to shake the entire building, sending tremors through the surrounding streets. Windows shattered, pipes burst, people ran into the streets thinking an earthquake was underway. Realizing he had created something dangerously powerful, Tesla smashed the machine with a hammer to stop it. Later, he claimed that with the right tuning, the device could bring down entire buildings, even cities. He believed it could be used to harness seismic energy, but he also feared what would happen if it was used as a weapon.</p>
<p>When government officials arrived, they confiscated what remained of the device. To this day, no official record of its existence remains. Some believe this technology was later weaponized in secret, a classified experiment in man-made earthquakes. The suppressed inventions, where are they now? After Tesla&#x27;s death, a physicist named John G. Trump, uncle of future US President Donald Trump, was assigned to examine his papers.</p>
<p>He later claimed that Tesla&#x27;s work was speculative and unimportant, but those close to Tesla knew better. The most powerful governments and corporations had spent decades suppressing his ideas, ensuring that free energy, wireless power, and worldchanging inventions never threatened the industries that made them rich. Some believe Tesla&#x27;s notes were either destroyed, hidden away in classified vaults, or secretly developed into military projects. But what if something survived? Whispers have surfaced over the years about underground laboratories continuing Tesla&#x27;s research. Leaked documents suggest that some of his work was never lost at all, but repurposed, kept hidden from the public for reasons unknown.</p>
<p>The world Tesla dreamed of a world where energy is free, where wars are prevented, and where technology serves humanity instead of controlling it never came to be. But perhaps, just perhaps, his lost files still exist somewhere, waiting for the right moment to be revealed. What did Tesla truly discover? Was Nicola Tesla simply a misunderstood genius? Or did he stumble upon something that the world was never meant to see? And if his lost files were ever uncovered, would they change everything we think we know about science and technology? Or would those in power do everything in their control to make sure his secrets stay buried forever?</p>
