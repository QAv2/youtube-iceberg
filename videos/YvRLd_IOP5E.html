            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Whistleblower Matt Brown says, &quot;Look, disclosure might be dead in one aspect, but not really dead.&quot; What does that mean? Well, he was talking to our buddy Pavell, who has just been doing a phenomenal job. you if you if you remember the early days of this channel, uh Pavell was uh instrumental in coming in here and being a contributor and helping out with stories and doing so much and and since then he&#x27;s really just um been such a strong voice in the UAP community in general. And so it makes um and he&#x27;s a hustler man. He really is. He he he um he is very tuned in to everything going on in this community and he asked really great questions and he got in contact and had a conversation and I think on a stream with uh with Matt Brown.</p>
<p>So I want to play the exchange that they both had and then we&#x27;ll uh we&#x27;ll discuss it afterwards. So check out this clip here um with Matt Brown and Pavville. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t even know with time. Everyone my everyone last week was saying disclosure was dead. Carl Nell hopped on a on a call I forget where.</p>
<p>Um &gt;&gt; and said this cycle of uh disclosure is over basically. Um pack your bags and we&#x27;re going to figure out what&#x27;s next. Um and to that I say I didn&#x27;t hear no bell. Uh this doesn&#x27;t stop. Uh I made my choice.</p>
<p>I drew my line in the sand and I chose my team just because things are uncomfortable for certain segments. Um, no, absolutely not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is dead is deep state disclosure. What is going to live is citizen-led disclosure and uh &gt;&gt; and experiencers &gt;&gt; well citizens right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um, experiencers absolutely a big part of that. But, uh, deep state disclosure is dead. Don&#x27;t want any more of that.</p>
<p>They can go have their billionaire book clubs, have tea, and pretend that the world is getting better as it collapses around them, and then they can [ __ ] off to their bunkers. That&#x27;s how I think that the situation is. &gt;&gt; Well, you guys wanted a [ __ ] headline. There you have it. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll tell you, life has been moving at 175 miles per hour for me lately.</p>
<p>But one of the ways that I&#x27;m able to chill out, unwind is cornbread hemps CPD gummies. I mean, I really have been able to chill out, relax with these gummies. They&#x27;re formulated to work with your body. Not against it. I&#x27;m not a spring chicken, but I care about maintaining my physical and mental wellness.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to get myself uh healthy, and cornbread hemp CBD gummies, they&#x27;re a huge part of my wellness plan. They really make me relax. Cornbread hemp CPD gummies. They&#x27;re made to make you feel better. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s stress, it&#x27;s discomfort, or you just need to chill out.</p>
<p>Relax. They use the best part of the hemp plant, which is the flour for the purest and most potent CPD. All products are third party lab tested and USDA organic to ensure safety and purity. So, right now, DTE listeners can save 30% off of their first order. You got to head on over to cornbreadhemp.com/dte.</p>
<p>Use the code DTE at checkout. It&#x27;s cornbread.com/dte. Use the code DTE. I promise you, you will thank me. So, there&#x27;s Matt Brown uh kind of going scorched earth there.</p>
<p>If you uh if you will uh because, you know, he&#x27;s saying things that I think a lot of us have been talking about for a while. Uh, I did for a very long time think that it would be so beneficial and I still feel this way that if they could get their stuff together, but I kind of echo the sentiments of of Matt Brown, which is um I think it would be important for the government to really dive deep, let people know what&#x27;s going on, but they&#x27;re never going to they&#x27;re never going to get on the same page, and it&#x27;s always going to get politicized one way or another, and there&#x27;s always going to be people that are too powerful holding things back. It&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just not realistic. Uh, so you can have all your committees and hearings and task force and all that. And it it&#x27;s good in that it it lets people know that you&#x27;re taking it serious, which is which is great, but there&#x27;s just too many lies and and and just things that I just don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t believe um will ever benefit actual disclosure.</p>
<p>Now, you know, I I would love to see Matt Brown testify, and I think that that this statement kind of shows one of the reasons maybe that he he wouldn&#x27;t. doesn&#x27;t necessarily think that that&#x27;s going to make the impact there. It&#x27;s private citizens, it&#x27;s um experiencers, it&#x27;s these it&#x27;s other people who have gone through these things, but the way to really get things um out there, and this is and I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve got to see the rest of the interview with um with Pavll. The questions too, but I think one of the follow-ups there too is like what what can he say, right? Like what what is he able to say on record? What else can he do besides the interview that he gave and the things that he said on on um weaponized? What can he do with the knowledge that he has and you know the the the the program that he revealed? How do you bring that more to light um as a private citizen now, right? How do you get other private citizens? How do you get other citizens to come and um and and make things public? How do you get people who were part of that program or part of those things at that point um not fear for their um their livelihoods and these other things and and you know when um Matt Brown was talking about how David Grush&#x27;s name when spoken it was almost like taboo you couldn&#x27;t say it right uh like is that the case with his name now what is his step what is he doing what are the things that he&#x27;s actually trying to do in general. I&#x27;m very curious and wondering um how this is going to be um going to be handled moving forward.</p>
<p>So what does that mean though like when you get to the um I don&#x27;t know the I guess the meat of that conversation, right? So he is clearly saying look the deep state disclosure and what Carl Nell is saying. Yeah, sure. We don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t need you anymore. You can you can you can f off. Go to your uh bunkers.</p>
<p>You you you know you&#x27;re you know you&#x27;re you have your knowledge and you&#x27;re not going to tell us things and it&#x27;s just there&#x27;s too much BS. It&#x27;s it it is there is something very truthful to what he&#x27;s saying, right? that it is absolutely um frustrating and so annoying that there are people that are basically just standing there like this saying, &quot;Well, we&#x27;re going to fight for disclosure this way. We&#x27;ll have our hearings. We&#x27;ll do these. We&#x27;ll have this.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll do that, but we won&#x27;t really push that hard here. We&#x27;re not going to be able to get any information there, but we have other things to do here. Uh we know what we heard there. We can&#x27;t tell you.&quot; It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s it it is another level of gatekeeping that has been um pretty prominent whether it&#x27;s from the last 70 80 years it&#x27;s been prominent that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s gatekeepers one way or another. You know, there&#x27;s the gatekeepers that are on one side that aren&#x27;t letting any information out whatsoever and they&#x27;re in complete denial and holding other things and um whether it&#x27;s uh the the Lockheed Martins and other places and and that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s that.</p>
<p>Then there is also now this new formation and the people that are wanting to um help [clears throat] that just running around the same circles and just saying the same things. So what does it mean and what will it mean when you have other people who are going to these these private these citizens stepping up? But what are they going to do? What are they going to say? That&#x27;s the that if if they have footage and they have other things. I don&#x27;t think it very different though than um doing it in a government capacity, meaning you&#x27;d still have to have protection for these people one way or another because if if people just started coming out releasing stuff and all that, what&#x27;s the legality behind that? I I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not sure. But I think regardless, this is a um it&#x27;s an interesting topic to say the least.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s good that Matt Brown&#x27;s talking more. What? I know he&#x27;s been more he&#x27;s been a little bit more outspoken on on X recently. He has I think he started his own YouTube channel. Um what who who is he who&#x27;s he in cahoots with as the old-timers would say? Who&#x27;s his circle? Because there&#x27;s there&#x27;s there&#x27;s always these circles and everything too. And and and will he be doing a follow-up with Jeremy Corbel? Like what&#x27;s what&#x27;s next? I gota I got to look and see what I don&#x27;t know how long Pavvel spoke to him for, but Pavll usually asks a lot of those kind of questions, but I just wonder um if maybe he spoke to him briefly because I&#x27;d like to see him really dive deep into finding out more about what Matt Brown is doing because as you said, he quoted Rocky.</p>
<p>He said, &quot;I ain&#x27;t hear no bell quoted Rocky five, but still still Rocky movies. I&#x27;ll give it to him.&quot; But nonetheless, um, he&#x27;s he&#x27;s pissed and he put his he put his ass on the line and I think now he he he it seems like there&#x27;s a plan, but what is the plan? What do you guys think the plan is? What do you think uh this means? Does it mean anything at all or is it just uh unfortunately just words? Put your thoughts in there. Let me know. As I mentioned earlier, make sure you check out cornbread hemp, man. I told you about it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s chill. very relaxing. I likes Anyway, thanks and uh I&#x27;ll be back here soon. Bye.</p>
