            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Thanks for being here to meet with me because tonight we finally get more on this potentially incredible piece of ceramic. Something pulled out of the mesa that could be a game changer, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That it&#x27;s a perfect opportunity to sit with you two in particular because of the amount of technology and science applied and what this huge anomaly in the mesa could be. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Y. &gt;&gt; So with all that in mind, let&#x27;s start kind of at the beginning.</p>
<p>talk about the science and technology brought to bear in the command center. &gt;&gt; Matty, I don&#x27;t think we could resist the impulse to just bring our instruments to that sample. You know, we&#x27;re anxious to observe whether we see any unusual properties out right there in the field. &gt;&gt; So, Eric put it under the microscope. Yeah.</p>
<p>With my reading glasses on, I thought I was seeing a pattern on one of the pieces. &gt;&gt; Wow. I want to show you a cross-section of one of the parts and get your assessment of what in the heck we&#x27;re looking at here. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Oh, that is fantastic, Eric.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Look at that. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So, this image here, this isn&#x27;t a picture. This is actually under the microscope. This is live off of the microscope.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. You look at your crosshatches, right? The preciseness of these lines. look like they were made by laser etching or centering. &gt;&gt; So that is potentially machined. &gt;&gt; Yes, there&#x27;s absolutely a crosshatch pattern.</p>
<p>Clearly something put it there and it&#x27;s so highly improbable that it was, you know, accidental scratches. &gt;&gt; So that is something we can put scientifically into the if not definite box close to it that this is a manufactured piece. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yep. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not something that mother nature&#x27;s going to create. &gt;&gt; And what kind of manufacturing process could be responsible for etchings as you&#x27;ve seen? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a good question if it&#x27;s etchings or if they were molded that way. We&#x27;re not real certain. U it&#x27;s going to take a little more data or analysis to figure that out. &gt;&gt; So the fact that it&#x27;s even coming from the mesa no matter what the ceramic turns out to be is in itself hugely important.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Look, we have no history of humanity being inside of that messa as far as the historical record goes, right? There are stories about there being a cave somewhere that somebody went into back, it would have been in the &#x27; 70s maybe. Um, but we don&#x27;t have any evidence to back that up. And all of the aerial photographs that we have, Eric and I have been looking for caves since day one. We&#x27;ve got every aerial photograph there is of the place all the way back to was 1935, I think, is the earliest one.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s 1936. &gt;&gt; 36. Wow. &gt;&gt; Something made it. Someone made this material.</p>
<p>So, how did it get hundreds of feet inside the mesa? &gt;&gt; And then and then our our gears start turning. You know, then we start thinking about now what is the more rigorous follow-up test? Does it respond in any way to uh something as simple as a as an applied magnetic field? And in fact, the results that we got were interesting. They were surprising. Moment of truth. What? &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Can you believe that? &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re even magnetic. Like, I&#x27;m still trying to wrap my head. &gt;&gt; Aren&#x27;t magnetic. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want you to feel this.</p>
<p>Watch. &gt;&gt; Oh, it&#x27;s pushing against it right now. And I&#x27;m like, &quot;Wait, that&#x27;s ceramic.&quot; And he said, &quot;I know.&quot; And we were both like, ceramics don&#x27;t do that. &gt;&gt; I was not expecting to see that little white piece of ceramic leap into the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. &gt;&gt; Oh man.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. This reaction, this odd behavior with the magnet had you guys theorizing in the moment about a superconductor. Right. &gt;&gt; This is the fun part of the discussion. &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
<p>A superconductor. Describe that to me. &gt;&gt; Zero electrical resistance. A perfect conductor. &gt;&gt; Perfect flow of energy.</p>
<p>not wasting anything. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; So, a normal wire as you flow energy through it, it heats up and you lose some of the energy that gets from point A to point B on the ends of the wire. But if it&#x27;s a superconducting wire, it doesn&#x27;t heat up and it doesn&#x27;t lose any energy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re looking at, you know, a ceramic behaving in a way that we didn&#x27;t expect. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, as if this were a room temperature superconductor that has properties that you could use for levitation. So to fly something through space and time to have some sort of incredible spacecraft and again I&#x27;m just theorizing it might have material like this when we evolve to the point with our technology and our civilization that we&#x27;re doing star travel uh that would be commonplace.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you know what we describe as a wish today I like to think of as an inevitability for tomorrow.</p>
