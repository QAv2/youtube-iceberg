            <p>all right everyone hello my name is Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos uh today is the 64th video that we&#x27;re doing on the reciprocal system of theory uh derived by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th 20th century uh up until his death in 1990 we&#x27;re looking uh actually at his final book that is called the beyond space and time and that is this is the 42nd video of his book of this book and uh this book came out after he died in 1995 um and it is um a departure uh and some of his uh adherence uh thought it was blasphemy that uh his wife would publish this after he died because he would have never wanted this to be published because Larson uh according to them was a hard-headed scientist and he wouldn&#x27;t uh dabble uh he wouldn&#x27;t want uh his dabblings on metaphysical matters religion psychology philosophy to be uh published because all of his earlier books are on astronomy astrophysics chemistry physics uh and a couple books on economics um but uh be that as may we are looking at his final book and um the basic gist of the theory that he uh started out with his fundamental postulates back in the 50s uh and then he built a theoretical Universe from his postulates from deducing you know if this then that and then if this then that um is that the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but the universe is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between time and space time and space are reciprocal aspects of each other uh and they&#x27;re both quantized and they both have three dimensions I would say three or four dimensions it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very uh pretty minor point but um the uh so the basic idea is that if you have one unit of space and one unit of time one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light um and where Larson says that the speed of light are where Einstein says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe in Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system uh in his Universe of motion motion is always there and motion at the speed of light is in fact the midpoint or the neutral point of the universe and that um there&#x27;s half the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light which he calls the cosmic sector or sector two and there&#x27;s half the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of or slower than the speed of light and that&#x27;s sector one or the material sector that we&#x27;re familiar with the world of atoms and molecules and those atoms and molecules aggregate together over time and they um build up to their most complex level which he says is the DNA molecule and uh at that point they become eligible to be under the control of the sector 2 unit um which is just a mind which would just be a minor part such as same way as a thermostat is just a minor part of a room but it controls the environment and when the sector 2 unit controls the material unit then we have what he calls the life unit so life is a um putting together of a sector one uh component the DNA molecule and the sector two control uh and then um beyond that uh he has also sector three which is a the metaphysical unit or the metaphysical region that is actually independent of or beyond space and time and uh you know I think most people would call that God Larson calls it sector three and uh once the life unit gets to its most complicated complex form then uh which is he says the intelligent human being or humanoid then uh it becomes eligible to be controlled overall by the general metaphysical region or sector three at that point uh the human being is beset with two forms of control one is uh one is bent on uh survival that&#x27;s the life unit sector two and the other is bent on ethical Behavior or good behavior that sector three at certain times those two things work in a concert with each other and in other points they are at Cross purposes and the human being has to be able to decide uh which one to follow now uh he gets into this in the next chapter but we are about to start chapter 16 which is on dream interpretation now remember dreams are really uh they have sector three implications but they&#x27;re fundamentally from coming from sector two um which is the thinking and the memory the uh the electrical or the mental apparatus and um thinking and memory are sector two things you know where sector one is subject to the flow of time uh sector two is subject to three-dimensional time uh the reverse would be true about space where space is three-dimensional in sector one and it is flowing in sector two um and so uh the thinking and memory periodically gets out of sync with the sector one unit and has to be disconnected and rewound that is what he would call sleeping but the thinking and the memory uh rewind at different rates or they they need variable amounts of rewinding because the memory is much simpler than the thinking so the memory rewinds quicker than the thinking and so at a certain point the memory is done rewinding but the thinking continues to be rewound so the memory is disconnected uh and it just idles at that point we have what he calls uh REM sleep so dreaming is the result of the the memory being done rewinding and the thinking continuing to rewind okay now we&#x27;re going to take over here uh with Larson starting at chapter 16 dream interpretation from the beginning uh he&#x27;s gonna set the stage here from the earliest time of which we have any detailed knowledge dreams have been regarded as repositories of hidden messages and their interpretation has been a matter of great interest hidden information is presumably information that is not available or at least not readily available elsewhere and since the closed door that the human race has always had uh had the greatest desire to penetrate is the one that leads to the Future uh one of the most popular ideas has been that dreams provide a means of foretelling future events in order to discover the hidden meaning one must find the plan of concealment and the general belief has been that dreams accomplish this by representing the true meaning in the form of symbols most present-day investigators have abandoned the hope of extracting any information about the future of dream analysis but they have retained the conception that the perceived content of a dream is a symbolic representation of its true meaning quoting Freud he says the dream content is as it were presented in hieroglyphs hieroglyphics whose symbols must be translated one by one into the language of dream thoughts of the dream thoughts um in view of the prevalence of this opinion one of the most significant aspects of the results obtained from the dream study described in the preceding chapter where he went over a month worth of his dreams and analyzed them um you could watch the last couple videos to get a summary of all that or a detailed summary of that is that dreams show according him dreams show no trace of symbolism some of the objects or actions currently considered to be symbolic were present in my recorded dreams but in all cases it could easily be seen that they were present in their ordinary significance not as symbols of something else the snake that I saw in one dream was not a symbol it was a memory of a rather spectacular snake that I saw in a television program a few hours earlier the gun that appeared in another dream was not a symbol it was a direct memory of a gun that played a prominent part in a mystery story that I had just laid down before retiring in the dream record I was holding a rather peculiar long gun it seemed more like a museum piece than a modern weapon was his quote in his dream journal in the book The Gun was a collector&#x27;s item that could well have had a place in a museum it is evident from the results of this study that symbols play no part in my dreams under relatively calm living conditions this does not guarantee that they are also absent from the dreams of others under similar conditions but it does create a rather strong presumption to that effect particularly since much of my work deals with abstractions and symbols and I would seem to be among those most likely to utilize symbolisms in my dreams if anyone does the question as to whether I or others employ symbolism under highly emotional conditions also remains open but here again it seems quite improbable that operation under stress would change the basic nature of the dream process while the results of this dream study actually demonstrate the absence of symbolism only under a limited range of conditions this amount of negative evidence is highly significance be significant because it is completely in agreement with the conclusions reached in the two preceding chapters with respect to the mechanism of dreaming these findings which show that dreams are products of the normal operation of the memory during sleep the memory system during sleep cut the ground out from under the symbol hypothesis the dream is constructed from themes already in the system and it is elaborated with details drawn from the memory storage by means of the association process it has some unfamiliar aspects because it is a product of memory only with none of the participation by the thinking mechanism that characterizes the conscious activities of the Mind again he you know the thinking process the reasoning process tends to serve as a sensor that sensors out the kind of unreasonable or irrational material that can come into play through the memory because memory is based on Association so you know um a person that you um person that you work with who has um certain characteristics can be substituted for a certain uh other person that you work with who is is much much different uh and so when you&#x27;re um the memory apparatus is using the association process sometimes bizarre things can be Associated one with another uh that are out of context in the context that the dream is in or even uh you&#x27;re awake awaking um impressions are under so the association process according to Larson is where uh this bizarre uh kind of um um non-sequiturs are evident in your dreams along with the fact that you&#x27;re thinking is is still rewinding and so it&#x27;s not there to censor those uh those you know bizarre uh points okay so it has some unfamiliar aspects because it is a product of memory only with none of the participation by the thinking mechanism that characterizes the conscious activities of the mind but there is no Distortion or disguise involved the dream is an enigma only to the person who is looking for something that is not there all of the theories of dream symbolism from those of the early day prophets and soothsayers to those of the modern psychologist and psychoanalysts rest entirely on the assumption that the dreams must have some meaning of consequence since no such meaning is Manifest in the dreams as they are experienced it follows from the assumed premises that the meaning must be disguised in some Manner and the use of symbols for this purpose is a hypothesis that has been proposed it has no factual basis the present day theories of dream symbolism have no more empirical support than the prophetic theories that have been abandoned to the pseudoscientists the mere fact that someone like Freud arrives at a conclusion as to the meaning of a dream that satisfies him or that appears plausible to others does not prove anything the interpretation is still an untested hypothesis the symbolic interpretation of Dreams is simply assumption piled upon assumption um moreover uh just when he mentions assumption piled upon assumption um it reminds me of the of Prophecy as well um people uh are constantly putting this kind of symbolic interpretation on Prophecy which is nothing more in my opinion than wishful thinking and um you know it seems to be uh what you would call a confirmation bias it&#x27;s like they uh they want all these prophecies to be pointing at a specific date or time and they&#x27;re always reading uh this very vague language into what they want it to be uh you know what they want to be important and um I would argue that probably more of the prophecy is uh in terms of actual literal uh prophecy as opposed to symbolic uh if at all okay so we&#x27;ll get into that uh in a month or so once we get done with this book here okay okay back to uh the interpretation of Dreams furthermore the memory mechanism as we know it from conscious experience operates by means of straightforward Association of items that have some common feature there is no disguise or Distortion involved in order to account for the concealment of the true meaning of Dreams by means of symbolism it would therefore be necessary to assume the existence of an additional mechanism of some kind there is no physical indication that any such mechanism of any such mechanism nor do the proponents of the concealment or symbolism hypothesis seem to have given any consideration to the question as to what purpose a concealment process would serve if an appropriate mechanism did exist there is no need for any special means of concealing the existence of the meaning of dreams from other persons the dreamer has full control over the release of the information in any event he can withhold any or all of it or alter it arbitrarily as he sees fit in fact only a tiny fraction of the dreams that occur are ever brought to the attention of others and many of these are heavily censored by the dreamer thus the only purpose of a concealment process if it existed would be to hide the meaning of the dream from the dreamer himself this is the purpose implied by the prevailing opinion that the significance of the dream can only be ascertained with the aid of an interpreter again he&#x27;s looking at uh I don&#x27;t like to use the word democracy or but the democratization of these of all of these things where we are we&#x27;re continually trying to lean on and be dependent on somebody else to like a preacher uh to figure out for us or a dream interpreter to figure out for us what these things actually mean what does the bible mean or whatever holy book you&#x27;re talking about what does it mean well you know and and but that&#x27;s the whole point of the reciprocal system is that it gives you those tools so that you can figure it out for yourself you do not have to you do not have to depend on somebody else to figure out uh physics and astrophysics and chemistry uh or psychology religion and philosophy you can figure it out using the principle of the reciprocal system of theory you do not need to rely on these soothsayers uh so to speak or the guys in the white lab coats or the guys in the frocks they are Interlopers intermediaries and they muddy The Waters at best um and they might do it on purpose but if you can rely on your own resources um then you avoid all that so uh that&#x27;s it for today uh so we will look more into the lack of symbolism in dreams according to Larson and we will also look at uh some of his adherents who disagree with him okay uh we&#x27;ll catch you next time have a great day</p>
