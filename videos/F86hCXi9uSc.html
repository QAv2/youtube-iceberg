            <p>all right hello everyone uh welcome to my channel I am Thomas I do educational videos and today is the 55th video that we&#x27;re doing on the reciprocal system of theory which is a Theory of Everything derived by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century up until his death in about 1990 we&#x27;re actually uh I think this is the 33rd video on his book beyond space and time which came out after he died in 1995 his final book and uh this is his uh delving into uh the softer Sciences psychology and philosophy and religion all of his earlier books are on harder Sciences such as astronomy chemistry and physics and um the gist of Larson&#x27;s Theory uh came out in his two fundamental postulates that he worked on for many many years before developing and then he took those fundamental postulates and he went step by step uh deducing a theoretical Universe from those if this then that and so on and um we did do 15 videos uh just before this on his uh talk the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so you might want to check those out too uh and before that there&#x27;s a little bit of autobiographical and biographical information um just to set the context but now we&#x27;re looking at his final book now the gist of his theory is that where the ancient Greeks would say that the Universe was made out of atoms matter and then Einstein comes along and he&#x27;s got equals m c squared energy equals matter times the speed of light squared uh energy can be converted into matter and vice versa um then he&#x27;s so he&#x27;s saying well it looks like the universe is made out of matter but it&#x27;s underlying that is really energy it&#x27;s really energy everything&#x27;s about energy uh Larson comes along a few a little bit later and he says that if equals m c squared then an energy can be converted into matter and vice versa that means that neither of those two things can be the most fundamental thing there has to be something that underlies both of them and he says that that is motion the universe is made out of motion and it&#x27;s not exactly motion as we would think of it he he&#x27;s really at times he would call it change in three dimensions he would also call it space time uh but um but what he really says the universe is made out of emotion motion is the relationship between space and time uh and the motion is in three dimensions I would say three or four dimensions and that the they uh they are quantized meaning that there is a a smallest unit of time and there&#x27;s a smallest unit of space and if you have one unit of time one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light the speed of light is one over one uh one space over one time and uh what he&#x27;s really when he talks about motion he&#x27;s referring to scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that does not have a Direction so that would be the difference between speed and velocity speed is a you know 10 miles an hour uh velocity is 10 miles an hour west or 10 miles an hour north or whatever um and so um scalar motion is motion without a direction or with every direction you can visualize the scalar motion as if you took a balloon um which has been in the news here today and um but you took that balloon and you put a bunch of uh took a magic marker and you put a bunch of dots on the balloon then uh you blew up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other uh but they&#x27;re not really moving in any particular direction or you could think of it as they&#x27;re moving in all directions so that is scalar motion is a motion like that uh okay so he goes with that and so um you know where Einstein would say that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson given that his universe is a universe made out of motion where motion it you know is the contents of the universe uh and it&#x27;s a relationship between space and time Larson says that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and there is uh one half the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light which he calls the material sector or sector one and that&#x27;s the sector of chemistry uh and the the sector that we&#x27;re familiar with atoms and molecules and then there is a half to the universe that is moving faster than the speed of light and that uh half of the universe he calls sector two or the cosmic sector and that is an area that we don&#x27;t are not nearly as familiar with but through the reciprocal system we can penetrate this Cosmic sector because it&#x27;s the same as the material sector except it&#x27;s it&#x27;s reciprocal meaning that all you have to do is reverse the roles of time and space put um you know uh basically it would be analogous to where you have space over time relationships over here over here you have time over space relationships so you just invert the rule rolls of space and time and you can basically extrapolate um the qualities of the material sector or sector one to the cosmic sector or sector two um now we&#x27;ll get to that a little bit later but um the important Point uh then is for the purposes of the um book that we&#x27;re looking at now beyond space and time is that you have sector one slower than the speed light sector two faster than the speed like this is atoms and molecules when atoms and molecules uh progress they uh through time they aggregate they move together um they Glam onto each other and at a certain point it get to their most complex level which Larson says is DNA and a DNA molecule has billions of atoms and um at that point it becomes uh eligible to uh have to basically invite a cosmic unit to join it when the cosmic unit joins the um sector 2 Cosmic unit joins the sector one material unit they combine and the sector two unit exerts a level of control over the sector one unit and when they are both together they form what Larson calls the life unit so life is a um grouping of a material and a cosmic entity and then when you have this life unit which is governed by survival it uh can eventually uh once it gets to its most complex uh level which he says is the intelligent human being or humanoid then um it can come under the control of a sector 3 unit which he defines as a unit that is outside or independent or beyond space and time which is the name of his book beyond space and time this he&#x27;s re uh I would say that he&#x27;s really referring to uh when he says sector three he&#x27;s uh generally referring to God and uh and communication from God it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a communication and so he uh and sector three is governed by ethical or good behavior uh doing the right thing and there is no evil in sector three sector two is really where the evil is going to be coming from um so it&#x27;s a limited the evil is limited it&#x27;s principality and um so that&#x27;s where he basically gets started and then he talks about how their uh sector three can communicate with us and those Communications are variously called ESP intuition scientific insight and religious revelation and those Communications are always correct um but our ability to translate them correctly is limited uh and takes practice and takes development and takes um you know preparation okay so now we&#x27;re we just got done with his chapter on emotions and um which is more of a sector two thing but it has sector three implications and we just got into chapter 14 that is called thinking and memory and the last thing that he talked about was there are actually two battles going on a struggle between reason and emotion thinking in memory and emotion for control of the actions of the human organism and a struggle between sector two the biological or life and sector three the ethical human control units for the power to establish the objectives of these actions so really like the decision making the second of these conflicts is the one in which we are primarily interested in this work okay on this basis we will have no occasion to inquire further into the mechanism of thinking or of the advanced form of thinking known as reasoning the details of the reasoning process are still far from being fully understood but for the purposes of this work the exact nature of the thinking mechanism and its operation is irrelevant the signif significant point is that reasoning is the most advanced physiological means that the human individual has available for determining the course of action in response to the information that he receives from various sources it is an activity of the Mind part of what the combination entity the mind brain does he talked about this back in chapter 11. uh the ma what the mind brain does as distinguished from the brain uh which this entity is so the brain is and the mind does and the mind brain does both is and does the particular function of thinking is to correlate the incoming stream of messages arriving through the various information channels such as our senses and then also our intuition uh with the relevant knowledge already available um that&#x27;s somewhat our memory and to arrive at appropriate conclusions in order to enable the thinking mechanism to perform this function the information previously made available to the individual must be so disposed within the mind that it is available for reference the mental Storehouse for this information is known as memory the term memory is also applied to the process of retrieving information from storage and to the item of information that is recalled Memories the discrete items that are stored are of many different kinds some such as the motor memories that enable us to take the right muscular actions to accomplish our purposes do not have any perceptible impact on the conscious thought processes those that are perceptible may be classified as visual verbal auditory Etc but for the present purposes the significant point is that the great majority of the memories are taken into the general storehouse that are taken into the general Storehouse are memories of experiences every individual undergoes the succession of experiences during all of the waking hours of every day what he sees in the visual media is mainly a selection of experiences of others his reading consists largely of narratives that is experiences the strong predominance of experience memories is somewhat obscured by the fact that the demands upon the memory are largely for items of knowledge rather than for direct recall of experience you know we we go into our memory we we&#x27;re not generally looking for the whole experience we&#x27;re just looking for uh a a a tidbit of something that happened in that experience by far the greatest amount of this traffic is concerned with language calling upon memory for the meaning of words seen or heard and the inverse process calling upon memory for the words applying to the entities or concept with which the Mind deals but this is not the form in which entry into the memory storage occurs we see an animal of a rather distinctive appearance and we find that it is called an elephant or we hear or read about someone else having such an experience it is this experience or report of experience of seeing the elephant and learning its name that goes into the memory storage in the memory process certain information about the elephant including the name is abstracted from the experience and retained in condition for retrieval those details of the experience which have no continuing significance are then forgotten now uh Larson uses the term forgotten quite a few times uh when he discusses memory and um you know I think some of the some of us who are you know maybe more um mystical oriented um would say that you know things that he says are actually forgotten they&#x27;re not forgotten they&#x27;re still in the akashic records so to speak um they&#x27;re somewhere but they&#x27;re not uh they&#x27;re for most intents and purposes they&#x27;re forgotten but they could still be dug out um and I think that&#x27;s been shown that people can remember uh details of experiences uh from way back that through certain things like regression um that they thought that they had forgotten so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just a when he says forgotten I would say that it&#x27;s just hidden underneath another Veil it&#x27;s it&#x27;s veiled uh it&#x27;s still retrievable but it&#x27;s much harder to retrieve it is what I would say thus the output from Storage is largely bits of information but as we will see later it is important to realize that the input is in the form of experiences so memory is inputted in experiences and it&#x27;s usually retrieved and stored as bits memory is a relatively early evolutionary development even the most rudimentary type of emotional mechanism requires the existence of some kind of a memory to enable identification of the situation which calls for an emotional response uh so you know he&#x27;s really saying that memory comes along even before emotions and he had just gone through this chapter explaining how primitive emotions are um we therefore find evidence of memory even in the lower animals in fact memory experience had experiences have been performed on such unlikely subjects as cockroaches the operating principle of the memory process is Association so he&#x27;s saying the memory operates on Association the storage is so organized that each item a is associated with certain other items b c and d Etc because of this Association an attempt to recall a May reach b instead if it can be recognized that b is incorrect further effort at direct recall may be made or a may be reached indirectly by first recognizing an association BC and then an association CA but if the situation is such that the accuracy of the first recall cannot be tested then the fact that the co that conscious thought and memory utilize very different criteria of close you so close Association is very important in some applications as we will see in the next chapter okay so he&#x27;s kind of making a distinction between um Association you know which is uh you know much vager than what he&#x27;s calling close Association so you know a Association might be oh I remember that person because they&#x27;re in the same class uh as this other person maybe they&#x27;re they&#x27;re both Americans so you know they&#x27;re related through this Association but then a more close Association might say oh would they both live in Los Angeles or they both live in you know a the same neighborhood you know you can get a more and more specific more and more close with your associations and the Primitive memory operates on this kind of this vague Association like anything anything that two things have in common are an association okay uh so we&#x27;re gonna stop there and we will uh resume talking about memory and thinking here next time so thanks for tuning in hope you have a great day and please come back tomorrow</p>
