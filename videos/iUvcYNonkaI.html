            <p>quaternions are not four-dimensional objects while they do have four components we don&#x27;t say that parabolas are three-dimensional because they can be described with three components right quaternions arise naturally in geometric algebra as the even sub-algebra of VGA in three dimensions where I J and K are associated with the three basis planes in 3D space in this context they can represent three-dimensional rotations because quaternions contain objects in three-dimensional space and can represent three-dimensional rotations we see that quaternions are three-dimensional objects not four-dimensional objects</p>
