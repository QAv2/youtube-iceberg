            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>This is Dr. Ning Lee, one of the most brilliant physicists of all time. She worked under the US Department of Defense and claimed to discover the secrets of anti-gravity, but then she vanished. Did she uncover something so powerful the government had to silence her? Did she defect to China to continue her work in secret? Or was her disappearance simply the tragic result of her own experiments? This is the truth of the strange rise and mysterious fall of Dr. Ning Lee.</p>
<p>But to understand what really happened, we need to go back to where it all began. Ningley was born in Shangdong, China in 1943, but it wasn&#x27;t until she moved to the United States in 1983 where her story truly began. She settled in Huntsville, Alabama, which may just seem like a random southern city at first. But Huntsville, Alabama is a city unlike any other. Huntsville is home to NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center.</p>
<p>It is also the forefront of space and military technologies. And it is surrounded by defense giants like Loheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrup Groomman, known for the creation of the world&#x27;s most dominant fighter jets such as the F-22 Raptor and the iconic B2 stealth bomber. If you&#x27;re going to push physics to its limits, Huntsville was the place to do it, and Ning Lee was going to do just that. Ning Lee became a research scientist at the UAH during the late 80s alongside NASA scientists at Marshall. By the early 90s, she was already publishing her most significant papers.</p>
<p>first in 1991, followed by 1992, then 1993, and finally in 1997 alongside NASA. Now, I took physics back in high school, so I can&#x27;t verify whether these conversions or theories are accurate, but what I can say is that it looks pretty smart. These published papers contain tons of complex formulas and diagrams. Basically, her work proposed that a superconductor rotating its positively charged ions could generate a powerful gravomagnetic field, essentially a gravity-like force, one that could reduce or even redirect gravity&#x27;s pull. In theory, this could create the foundation for true anti-gravity propulsion.</p>
<p>Around the same time, a Russian scientist in Finland, Eugene Podclanov, was conducting similar experiments of his own. He claimed to have reduced the weight of an object by.3 to 2%, which might not seem like much, but it was proof of Ningling&#x27;s theory. However, no one could actually replicate these experiments, so he was labeled as fringe and fraud. But there were reported whispers that the US and Russian labs were quietly probing his ideas. NASA Marshall&#x27;s Grass Project aimed at investigating anomalous gravity claims and alternative propulsion concepts.</p>
<p>This proves that despite being called fringe, the government took these ideas seriously enough to test. In an article titled Taming Gravity, a NASA scientist by the name of Jonathan Campbell stated, &quot;The first thing to understand about Lee&#x27;s device is that it is neither an anti-gravity machine nor a gravitational shield. It does not modify gravity. Rather, it produces a gravity-like field that may be either attractive or repulsive.&quot; Ning Lee called this AC gravity. Now, a breakthrough like this could change everything.</p>
<p>Imagine fighter jets that could maneuver without drag or inertia, being able to pivot instantly, bombers that could fly without fuel, or spacecraft that could leave Earth without a rocket. Ningly would later leave Vahh and co-found her own company named AC Gravity LLC in 2001. Now, it is worth mentioning that her work up until this point was still only theoretical, but even then, she would co-found her company with a man named Larry Smallley, who was a former chairman of UAH, proving that her work was seen to have serious potential. Together, they were looking to raise several million dollars to build what they refer to as the induction motor. Lee was quoted saying, &quot;Inves investors want control over the technology, but this is too important.</p>
<p>It should belong to all of the American people.&quot; However, her stance on this would later change because later that same year, her company would be awarded nearly half a million dollars by the Department of Defense. And this was the moment that anti-gravity went from science fiction to national defense. And it was also the moment Ning Lee disappeared from the public eye. After 2002, there were no more papers and no more interviews. For a scientist who had once been so open, her sudden silence was shocking.</p>
<p>But there was one clue. In 2003, she was listed at a MITER Corporation conference. Now, MITER is a nonprofit think tank that works closely with the Department of Defense on highly classified projects. Her presentation, Measurability of AC Gravity Fields. It proved that she was still working, but inside the classified world of Redstone Arsenal, an army facility in Huntsville.</p>
<p>But this would be the last direct tie to her existence for the next two decades. To the outside world, it was as if her anti-gravity research floated away into thin air. But in truth, her silence wasn&#x27;t the end of her story. Years later, a journalist would discover what really happened by stumbling upon Ningley&#x27;s obituary. Her silence created a vacuum and into that vacuum poured the speculations.</p>
<p>The only other confirmation of her whereabouts came from a man named Tim Ventura, an American engineer/ techie who in the early 2000s ran the site American anti-gravity. He managed to track down Podclanov, who had essentially vanished after the backlash from his 1996 impulse gravity beam publication. Ventura was able to confirm that Pclanov was still pursuing his impulse gravity generator, that he was also working with the Russian defense labs, and confirming that Lee was not missing as rumors claimed. He claimed that Lee was still working under Redstone Arsenal, but her work was moved to the classified realm. Now, this raised speculation that she was then silenced by the US government.</p>
<p>Lee had publicly said that she wanted her work open to the people. A very close source that will soon be revealed even noted that publishing papers was a great passion of hers and the government secrecy was really bothering her, causing a noticeable change in her demeanor. If she resisted military control or was planning to release her work to the public, could the Pentagon have shut her down permanently? Around the same time, an American theoretical physicist gave an interview saying that the Department of Defense was searching for Ning Le&#x27;s whereabouts, fearing that she defected to China to continue her work. One of the key scientists in this electrogravidic superconductivity sort of stuff is a Chinese woman named Ning Lee and uh she has disappeared allegedly going back to China but she&#x27;s disappeared for several years. The people at the Pentagon who had were in touch with her cannot reach her anymore and the Chinese uh red Chinese are putting a lot of money into these exotic projects.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; While there isn&#x27;t direct evidence of this, China was indeed pouring billions into exotic propulsion research. Reports surfaced in the 2000s of Chinese labs attempting pocknov style experiments. Could Ning Lee have been recruited to accelerate their progress? Or perhaps she was committing espionage and secretly passing breakthroughs to the CCP. After all, she spent the majority of her life living in China. Could her loyalty had still been with the CCP this entire time.</p>
<p>If true, this would make her story less of a mystery and more of a national security scandal, leading to people theorizing that she was then silenced for her betrayal to the American people. Each theory had fragments of evidence, but the truth was far stranger. It wasn&#x27;t until 2023 when the Huntsville Business Journal published an article confirming the obituary of Ning Lee, who passed away in 2021. In the journal, it confirmed that Ning Lee was in a car accident in 2014, causing permanent brain damage and leading to Alzheimer&#x27;s. For years, she lived quietly.</p>
<p>Her once brilliant mind fading into silence. A woman once known for precision and insight reduced the loops of forgetfulness. her life&#x27;s work erased from her mind, but hopefully not erased from mankind and that close reliable source. It was her son, George Men, who had been caring for her since the accident. He claimed that she never left the United States and she never defected back to China and that she was working for the Department of Defense the entire time, just under classified clearance, which obviously meant that she could no longer publicize her work and explains her silence.</p>
<p>He also explained she changed after her clearance. She became quieter, more withdrawn. And the rumors of espionage, well, they had partial truth, but not in the way you think. In 2008, the CCP did reach out. They invited Lee to return to China to continue her work.</p>
<p>However, Lee refused. In retaliation, she was banned from ever going back, even to attend her mother&#x27;s funeral, which really troubled her. No defection, no assassination, no espionage, just secrecy and tragedy. Still, her story leaves questions. What breakthroughs did she achieve under classification? And to be honest, we&#x27;ll probably never know.</p>
<p>But maybe there&#x27;s some clues hidden in plain sight. In 2017, the Pentagon released footage of the tic-tac-shaped UFO, a craft with no visible propulsion, moving in ways that defy physics. Some say they&#x27;re alien, others suspect advanced human technology. But what if this is just the result of the technology being experimented on in the &#x27;90s based off of Lee&#x27;s work? And then there were mysterious drone sightings over New Jersey, sparking speculation. An alleged whistleblower made a bold claim that they were powered by a gravitic propulsion system from China.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What we have been seeing with drones, he puts that in quotes. He says, &quot;Drones, is the operational use of gravidic propulsion systems powered aircraft by most recently China in the east coast, but throughout history the US. Only we and China have this capability.&quot; Now, these drones were later debunked by the government, denying any hostile or foreign origin, and they were likely just FAA sanctioned flights. If true, would this just be a product of Chinese breakthroughs? Or does this trace back to the theories that Nelink was working on decades earlier? Going back to Pacinov&#x27;s impulse generator, allegedly, it could fire a gravity-like pulse that could knock objects over, cause electronics to fail, or even pierce materials. And with the recent increase in multiple mysterious aircraft crashes, you have to wonder if this is coincidence or the work of Ning Lee and Pacquinov being used in vain.</p>
<p>Now again, none of these are proven. This is all speculation, but it makes you wonder. Question everything. [Music]</p>
