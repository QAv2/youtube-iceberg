            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>from a respected Insider even if you call them nhi and UAP how could such nhi travel to earth in the first place and go undetected by the general public grush says the craft may not be doubling through space as we understand it it is a well established fact at least mathematically and based on empirical observation and Analysis that there most likely are physical additional spatial dimensions and you can imagine on four and five d space where what we experience is linear time ends up being a physical dimension for in higher dimensional space where if you were living there you could translate across what we perceive as a linear flow so there is a uh possibility that&#x27;s and this is a theory here I&#x27;m not saying this is 100 the case but uh it could be that this is not necessarily extraterrestrial and it&#x27;s actually coming from a higher dimensional physical space that might be co-located um you know right here what can you tell me about these craft these Technologies why do you know it&#x27;s exotic uh based on the very specific properties that I was briefed on you know isotopic ratios that would have to be engineered for it to be at those levels but also just extremely uh strange heavy Atomic metal you know high up in the periodic table Arrangements that we don&#x27;t understand you know what the emergent properties are but there&#x27;s just a very strange mix of um elements so you&#x27;re absolutely sure that the materials that these craft are made of are clearly not of this Earth yeah they&#x27;re sophisticatedly engineered certainly not by humans and while grush says the US has gleaned some insight from these materials for military use so much more could be done if Academia and the private sector had access it&#x27;s totally nuts that humidity as a whole especially you know a citizenry on hold they&#x27;re not even benefiting from broad research on this to solve you know propulsion energy issues novel Material Science that can prove people&#x27;s quality of life it&#x27;s just totally nuts how it&#x27;s been protected and inhibits progress if you&#x27;re right if you&#x27;re telling us the truth everyone the entire American public has been lied to for decades yeah there&#x27;s a sophisticated information campaign targeting the U.S populace which is extremely unethical and immoral coming up how long has this been going on a lot of the things I was briefed on were very shocking [Music] aesthetic and I&#x27;m really happy with the results because they&#x27;re very subtle and I feel like I look like myself but just less

starting at twenty dollars Consumer Cellular so let&#x27;s start from the very beginning you say it&#x27;s a 90-year cover-up just about yeah 90 years 1933 was the first recovery in Europe in uh magenta Italy they recovered a partially intact vehicle it&#x27;s long been known that the regime of dictator Benito Mussolini documented numerous UAP during this time this internal Memo from the Italian secret Services includes crude drawings of the uaps it&#x27;s true it&#x27;s real yeah that actually happened Italian government moved it to a secure air base in Italy for the the rest of kind of the fascist regime until 1944-1945 and you know the Pope Pius the 12th back channel that so the Vatican was involved yeah and told the Americans what the Italians had and and we ended up scooping it so let me be very clear about this you&#x27;re saying that the Catholic Church the Vatican they know about the existence of non-human Intelligence on this planet certainly grush says shortly after the dawn of the atomic age another major crash recovery took place you&#x27;ve probably heard of it what can you tell me about the Roswell craft fortunately those details were not approved for me to talk about right now this much we know in 1947 an object crashed in the New Mexico desert near the town of Roswell the Air Force recovered material described as metallic and rubbery though the government changed its story as to what it was calling it a flying disc at first then a weather or spy balloon it just read ridiculous to me that the U.S Air Force had changed its story yeah and they added additional elements over time and and tried to conflate additional programs to explain some of the events why are these things crashing yeah you know some some are landed some are crashed and I think that&#x27;s an interesting discussion that&#x27;s come up you know as advanced as you know we are you know as humans right you know planes crash cars crash just because you&#x27;re some Advanced sentience that has advanced technology doesn&#x27;t mean um some small percentage of your I&#x27;ll use the Air Force term like sorties um you know meet an unfortunate operational conclusion as we might want to say most people would tell you the Roswell incident has been thoroughly debunked in fact the Air Force published this report in 1994 to put the issue to rest once and for all grush has read it that analysis they did was a total hack job and even anybody with analytical skills if you read it you can you can deduce that they&#x27;re conflating multiple situations with Crash Test Dummies and then Mogul balloons and they&#x27;re just saying that the townsfolk who personally witnessed it were totally imagining things they concocted that whole report just to disinformed so the reason for the secrecy exactly is what um feudalistic dominance who can have um both asymmetic asymmetric technology for it seems like just fueling the war machine grush says that through the 50s and 60s encounters with the nhi continued as did the cover-up one incident in 1967 about which multiple Air Force veterans have gone public involved uaps tampering with the nuclear missiles at Malmstrom Air Base in Montana they saw a craft appearing to be intelligently controlled hovered over a nuclear weapons Silo and shut down 10 nuclear ICBM missiles it certainly looks like they want to understand how far we&#x27;ve advanced in our nuclear fizzle kind of Technologies at the very least I mean it looks like Preparatory probing activity it might be innocent kind of scientific Gathering could be I ISR probing meanwhile grush says the crash retrieval program continued and while he won&#x27;t reveal where the downed craft are stored he does say that the people working with the technology have been putting themselves at risk you know a lot of them you know were injured looking at some of this stuff you could imagine the nuclear radiological biological risk to looking at an unknown unknown and a lot of them have literally suffered physically because of their service but as we know anyone who&#x27;s come forward claiming non-human intelligence is Behind These incidents has been dismissed as delusional or deliberately deceitful if you&#x27;re right if you&#x27;re telling us the truth everyone the entire American public has been lied to for decades yeah there&#x27;s a sophisticated disinformation campaign targeting the U.S populace which is extremely unethical and immoral coming up new evidence and perhaps New Attitudes in a new age of uaps the American people need and deserve to know more has the U.S government changed its tune who do you guys think came first the chicken or the baby back rib baby back ribs chicken tenders all the way baby chicken dinner baby back ribs on

and the pain in the back of your eyes forcing bad words from your mouth it&#x27;s not too late for another treatment option to learn more visit treated.com that&#x27;s treat ted.com um is not just delivered [Music] these are the videos that started it all footage captured by Naval aviators on military-grade cameras that defied all prosaic explanation Dave grush has investigated this one shot in 2015 off the east coast by fighter pilots from the USS Theodore Roosevelt there&#x27;s an industry of debunkers out there on the web who say oh they&#x27;ve got this all wrong it&#x27;s a jet exhaust at a distance and the aircraft&#x27;s turning give me an answer I had some Optical engineering experts look at that and the Raytheon at flear system based on the pixel saturation and apparent size it&#x27;s certainly something that&#x27;s not a jet it might be some kind of natural phenomenon that&#x27;s quite strange but it&#x27;s not as simple as a jet he has even stronger opinions about this UAP now known to history as the Tic Tac shot in 2004 in the Pacific by aviators off the USS Nimitz and the Tic Tac truly anomalous absolutely uh technical vehicle physical and that&#x27;s absolutely uh something that we didn&#x27;t make not of this world most likely yeah the videos were leaked in 2017 then officially released by The Pentagon in 2020 at the time it seemed the Pentagon may have finally abandoned its obsession with secrecy and decided to do what other countries have been doing for decades establish a properly funded publicly accountable team to investigate reports of UAP Dave grush was part of that team this is a Hunt mission for what might somebody be doing in our backyard that we don&#x27;t know about the task force set about investigating these incidents including more recent events like the odd encounters that took place during Naval exercises in 2019 off the coast of San Diego this video shot on the USS Omaha and later leaked to documentarian Jeremy corbill has received particular attention it either zooms off so fast you can&#x27;t see it or it sinks into the ocean but it seems to drop what do you know about it it was truly anomalous but grush says the promised new age of government transparency is a fallacy for starters he says the videos that have been released are just the tip of the iceberg there are many videos that are totally fair to release through a declassification process and I find it I&#x27;m very concerning from a transparency perspective that all that the department has Declassified were those three famous videos there are more concerning videos that left me with a lot of questions yeah he says there are credible Witnesses who could testify to Congress about spacecraft big spacecraft a lot of them were very large very large yeah like a football field kind of size and I remember interviewing these Personnel I&#x27;m like either these people are lying to me they&#x27;re having a psychotic break or this is some crazy but true stuff that&#x27;s happening and I have no good explanation that&#x27;s prosaic at all for this because this is not explainable by you know swamp gas St Elmo&#x27;s Fireball lightning etc etc I mean this is like tangible technical craft they&#x27;re seeing um up close and personal in some cases when I interview people and at the center of it all the crash retrieval program the government has never publicly acknowledged a program rush says that&#x27;s included at least one private Aerospace company that is storing alien craft is that true that is how a lot of these relationships are well I I don&#x27;t want to name the specific companies and government elements but to overall you know the government has been the custodian of a lot of this right and they&#x27;ll hand recede it out to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis which I find highly unethical you have basically a sole source Arrangement and you allow certain private corporate elements to look at this develop but a potential insight and then sell it back to the government for profit and I think that&#x27;s totally unethical the problem you&#x27;ve got is to have been categorical denials from high-level officials in the U.S government even presidents that what you&#x27;re saying is true unfortunately some elected officials were not brought in only a few weeks ago 19th of April the head of the pentagon&#x27;s UAP investigations program Dr Sean Kirkpatrick told Congress Arrow that&#x27;s the pentagon&#x27;s UFO investigation body has found no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity off-world technology or objects that defy the known laws of physics while a large number of cases in our Holdings remain technically unresolved this is primarily due to a lack of data associated with those cases was that a lie well I know Dr Sean kirpatrick I&#x27;ve known him for about eight years and you know I expressed some concerns to Dr Kirkpatrick about a year ago and told him what I was starting to uncover and he didn&#x27;t follow up with me and he has my phone number he could have called me I hope he ultimately does the right thing he should be able to make the same um investigative discoveries I did it it&#x27;s totally crazy if he doesn&#x27;t so the implication here is that the head of the very body that Congress has ordered to tell the American public the truth about uaps is possibly misleading the American public do you think the American public is being lied to well they&#x27;ve been lied to over the years and I&#x27;m hoping that the lies stop coming up it gets even scarier the UFO whistleblower says the nhis aren&#x27;t all friendly have human beings been hurt or killed by a non-human intelligence and guess who they might be working with and we&#x27;re in a competition with their adversaries to understand this and it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a multi-decade cold war that has been under our nose for so long [Music] as news Nations Brian Manson hosts a live rapper right after the Special Report with exclusive behind the scenes Insight from the interview we have multiple expert panels covering every angle next on news Nation in the movies the aliens are often portrayed as peaceful even cuddly [Music] right here it would be nice if that were true but Mr grush says it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s the common interpretation from some commentators is that there is a non-human species and it&#x27;s incredibly benevolently well disposed to the human race yeah yeah I think that that the logical fallacy there is because they&#x27;re Advanced they&#x27;re kind will never really understand full intent in that because we&#x27;re we&#x27;re not them whatever them is or are but I think what appears to be malevolent activity has has happened based on not only nuclear site probing activities witness testimony I think at least if we look at it through a humanistic lens it does appear negative at least to us I&#x27;ve been told that there have been attempts to bring down craft that we&#x27;ve acted offensively against non-human craft there have been instances and there are certain techniques have human beings being hurt or killed by a non-human intelligence while I can&#x27;t get into the specifics because that would reveal a certain U.S classified operations I was briefed by a few individuals on the program that there were malevolent events like that now I&#x27;m scared people have just heard you say non-humans May well have murdered human beings that seems to be the case at one point yeah and there&#x27;s more grush says the United States is not the only country that&#x27;s encountered nhi and their technology he says our geopolitical Rivals have their own crash retrieval programs which they are are also secretly exploiting for military purposes we&#x27;re in a competition with their adversaries to understand this and it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a multi-decade cold war that has been under our nose for so long and you know there is no good way to level the playing field and hold other nation states accountable if they&#x27;re doing unethical or illicit activity as it relates to the subject and I think the obtuse secrecy is actually putting us in a very dangerous position where a country might make a breakthrough let&#x27;s say we um it&#x27;s an adversary of ours and it is so destabilizing you said it&#x27;s been a cold war behind the scenes with Russia and China there has been a cold war against our with her with her pure adversaries yeah why hasn&#x27;t Russia or China come out and spoken publicly about this I think they&#x27;re in a similar you know pickle as us where it&#x27;s um they understand maybe the some of the socioeconomic destabilization factors in their own Society but if there&#x27;s non-human intelligence is so Advanced and at least some of them are malevolent why haven&#x27;t they destroyed us already perhaps some fragile yet combustible day taunt has been reached Crush has written an internal document about his discoveries that refers to agreements that risk putting our future in Jeopardy and it&#x27;s quite clear that you&#x27;re talking about agreements between America and non-human intelligences have we made agreements with non-human intelligences that&#x27;s the kind of information I really hope National leadership is able to get to the bottom of I need to pin you down on this are there agreements between non-human intelligences and the American government I think that&#x27;s a question that I would like to know all the details of as well we do know of at least one agreement among humans that&#x27;s worth noting this 1971 agreement between the U.S and the USSR on measures to reduce the risk of nuclear war whether or not you believe Dave grush this document proves the two superpowers were aware that UAP existed whatever they were if you look at article 3 of that treaty it talks about unidentified objects near nuclear facilities are interfering with Communications and that is a treaty that has been used from what I understand to notify uh each other if there&#x27;s a concerning event and that&#x27;s a way of saying to the Russians hey don&#x27;t shoot at us it&#x27;s not us yeah I mean that&#x27;s certainly a concern because this secrecy it has there is an environment where you could have almost like a false flag where true non-prosaic UAP situation could be constrived as you know a provocation of something from a nation state and we want to de-escalate that if true if the stakes are so high if the fate of the human race is at stake perhaps it&#x27;s no surprise to hear grush say the U.S government will do anything to keep these secrets safe can I put it to you that crimes must have been committed at the very least I saw substantiative evidence that white-collar crime was committed have people been killed to protect the secret uh based on the people I talked to that was an ongoing concern yeah unfortunately I&#x27;ve heard some really Un-American things I don&#x27;t want to repeat right now so you have a strong suspicion that people have been murdered to protect over the years yeah coming up a reality check is it possible that you&#x27;re deluding yourself it&#x27;s time to put our whistleblowers credibility to the test everybody watching this right now is looking at your face they&#x27;re going it&#x27;s this guy for real shop let&#x27;s talk about what Dave grush doesn&#x27;t have he doesn&#x27;t have Smoking Gun documents or photos he doesn&#x27;t have official confirmation of his claims he he&#x27;s just a guy talking on camera and a lot of his answers to our most pointed questions sound like this can you comment unfortunately I cannot so who is this guy really I don&#x27;t want fame or Fortune I&#x27;m just here to provide public leadership on an issue that I uncovered and I thought it was totally outrageous news nation has confirmed through multiple sources that Dave grush is who he says he is an Air Force veteran from Pittsburgh who worked in Military Intelligence and was part of the UAP task force maybe he&#x27;s just a confident well-spoken ex-military intelligence officer who just happens to have lost his mind do you have any kind of mental illness no have you ever had a psychosis a delusional is there anything in your medical history that might be capable of being interpreted as a reason why you might be confabulating making things I&#x27;m not a disgruntled employee I resigned on my own accord because I thought altruistically it&#x27;s more appropriate to show thought leadership on the outside on this now um because I you know hit and impasse within the government to try to right this wrong so I&#x27;ve got to be blunt about this you&#x27;re not making this up this is not a lie no absolutely not because everybody watching this right now is looking at your face they&#x27;re going it&#x27;s this guy for real I am for real and I&#x27;m you know I&#x27;m sitting here at Great personal risk and obvious professional Risk by talking to you today you&#x27;ve told us that we really are not alone even though you believe what you say is true you haven&#x27;t been fed disinformation it&#x27;s a common thing in intelligence for governments to mislead yeah I was very sensitive that fact um you know was this some kind of ruse against me uh am I being used in any kind of way and I took about four years being very methodical before I filed my my whistleblower complaint to be absolutely certain of these basic facts so take me through the process of how you convinced yourself that this is real um well based on the the credential people that came to me some of these subjects provided me sensitive foreign intelligence to read a sensitive program documents and photographs to evaluate and then described in very specific detail how all this worked and they were telling me that the exact extremely specific details um that all it all checked out yeah the other thing I have trouble with it&#x27;s the fact that my experience as a journalist is it&#x27;s very hard for governments to keep secrets most things leak your government leaks like a sieve why hasn&#x27;t this leaked well I&#x27;ve certainly been the recipient of a lot of U.S government secrets and I can tell you they&#x27;ve never seen the light of day um that&#x27;s for sure and I guess ostensibly this is leaked Legacy for decades but it was a very sophisticated disinformation that campaign where you know they have allowed some of the truth to come out um through some of their their trade crafts but they&#x27;ve disenfranchised people they&#x27;ve stigmatized it they made it like a total like wacky thing to talk about so anybody who may come forward with that kind of information has looked like a you know total tinfoil hot guy because because it&#x27;s a perfect amalgamation of disinformation to just make it look crazy the best reason to believe Dave grush may be this document remember that whistleblower complaint he filed it would seem it hasn&#x27;t fallen on deaf ears so the Inspector General of the intelligence Services of the United States has the information you&#x27;ve got yes and more importantly the Inspector General made a determination about The credibility of your complaint they found after interviewing myself in the subjects and other subjects that I&#x27;m not even uh cognizant on who they were they found my complaint urgent and credible for the intelligence committees the word credible is important you appreciate so an official investigatory body of the United States government has determined that your allegations are credible correct coming up if it is true then what what are we going to do if the biggest secret on the planet is now out in the open and what are they going to do how will the non-human intelligence react this is one of the gravest Constitutional crises for your country ever absolutely give me some hope here there are good people there are very good people and I want that message to be Crystal Clear um let&#x27;s not demonize holistically the US government there&#x27;s a whole Army of people that want change I am one of tens if not hundreds of individuals within the government on these programs that would like a change what kind changed as David grush want as he said here tonight he wants the nhi technology to be shared so the rest of the world can benefit from it and I use nuclear weapons or Nuclear Physics as an example makes it acknowledged program we have nuclear weapons you don&#x27;t get to know the designs but Nuclear Physics holistically is unclassified Academia studies it and why would you suppress basic astrophysics astrobiology other hard and soft Sciences broadly it&#x27;s totally nuts Crush has left the government he wasn&#x27;t part of Arrow during the most recent Congressional hearings when still more UAP were revealed including this one captured by a drone in the Middle East in 2022. there it goes his whistleblower case will take months to conclude in the meantime he says he&#x27;s starting a scientific foundation and he&#x27;s willing to speak to any one in Washington who has the clearance and the desire to hear the classified information he could not share here I make myself available to secretary Austin dni Haynes who is a recipient of my complaints I&#x27;m happy to further brief elected officials on the specific ecosystem of secrecy down to the fine details whoever they are how will the non-human intelligence react to the Revelation that human beings now know they&#x27;re here yeah I mean obviously the non-human intelligences have been around for a while at least multiple decades in modern history and they&#x27;ve allowed ourselves to annihilate ourselves genocide War famine Etc so at the very least I think they&#x27;re kind of neutral on what humans decide to do with their Free Will and as for how we the human race will react to his story here grush evinces that quintessentially human characteristic optimism I don&#x27;t have this utopian ideology that this is going to you know solve real problems stop War entirely but all I want is a moment of pause and to see if the subject unites us as we&#x27;ve obviously become more divided over the last couple decades because if anything else what you&#x27;re revealing May mean we all start thinking of ourselves not as American Australian Russian Chinese that is human human family I think that&#x27;s uh totally the right term yeah foreign wow okay so now we are going to attempt to process this all together hey everybody I&#x27;m Brian Anton I&#x27;m live at the news Nation headquarters in Chicago whether you are a UFO believer a skeptic or someone somewhere in the middle which I think is most of us we know that that conversation with the UFO whistleblower it was a lot</p>
