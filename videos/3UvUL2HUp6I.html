            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>The ceramics unearthed on Skinwalker Ranch suggest something beyond current human technology lies buried deep in the mesa. So that begs the question, whose technology is it? Now you&#x27;ve taken ceramic material to the lab and you&#x27;ve got other experts to weigh in on this and how compelling that is. &gt;&gt; Well, I got to tell you that Dr. Patrick at the Utah Valley University was very accommodating and not only that, he was very interested and intrigued &gt;&gt; in in what this material was doing. And I really appreciated his very open-minded approach to the topic.</p>
<p>His willingness to say, &quot;Wait, I haven&#x27;t seen this before.&quot; &gt;&gt; Open-minded, but skeptical. Yes, Dr. Pageant is a man after my own heart. I mean, this is one of those people who&#x27;s willing to be caught red-handed in the act of learning, unlike so many of the academics you might encounter. Not dismissing um the exotic interpretations out of hand, just taking the data.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You&#x27;re there with Dr. Patchet. You&#x27;ve got his preliminary kind of reaction to this ceramic material and then you&#x27;re using SEM. What were the thoughts behind that? &gt;&gt; Scanning electron microscopy. Well, that&#x27;s really the go-to instrument in a lot of these cases with material science.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re looking for elemental composition. We can learn what is that surface made of. So, going into the SEM lab, we&#x27;re just looking for data. &gt;&gt; But what we came away with was stunning. &gt;&gt; I zoomed in a little bit.</p>
<p>I can see some clearly defined like holes right now. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Are those holes getting bigger? &gt;&gt; Yes, I think so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What? It is. It&#x27;s opening up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What in the world is going on? &gt;&gt; Holy crap. Look at that.</p>
<p>What if it&#x27;s the electron beam from the microscope that&#x27;s causing this? Let&#x27;s turn it off. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we can do that. &gt;&gt; All right, here we go. &gt;&gt; So, that does not look as porous. &gt;&gt; No, as it was.</p>
<p>Not nearly. Uh, I have the old screen grab. Look at that. This is healing. I&#x27;ve never seen anything that is capable of doing this.</p>
<p>This stuff is fixing itself. &gt;&gt; Yes, it&#x27;s healing. That&#x27;s exactly right. Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; When we started getting data returns from the scanning electron microscopy, Dr.</p>
<p>Patchy&#x27;s eyebrows were raising and he&#x27;s well, I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this. What is what&#x27;s happening here? So, he makes a uh statement while we&#x27;re looking at this. And he says that I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;ve used too much power in the electron beam and I&#x27;ve blown holes in it. So, he turns the power off. And then he says, &quot;Oh my goodness, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s healing.&quot; So, think of like if you had a piece of paper and you shot holes in it with a BB gun and then suddenly the paper started fixing itself.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what he was thinking was happening. &gt;&gt; Now, does that fit in the normal parameter of a piece of ceramic? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, the ceramics that I have experience with are what we would call ultra pure ceramics. So, they may not have all of the things um embedded in them that you would find in a ceramic that&#x27;s just been pulled out of a mesa, right? So, you know, we&#x27;re dealing with this material that has been embedded in that messa potentially for either tens of years or or even millions of years. We don&#x27;t know. So, what we just described to you, Maddie, was the appearance of the change.</p>
<p>You know, that&#x27;s the eye candy. Now, the brain candy part of it is what we got out of the elemental analysis. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; All right. All right.</p>
<p>So, this is a purely interior scan. We&#x27;ve got oxygen, silicon, uh there is some magnesium, there&#x27;s a calcium line, we&#x27;ve got potassium, some iron, a lot of aluminum this time. No carbon this time. So, the interior doesn&#x27;t have carbon in it. The interior is clearly a different material than the exterior.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; This material is a lot like a sponge or maybe an umbrella. One material on the outside for protection with another one on the inside for some different purpose. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I get it. &gt;&gt; And to what end? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it could be the exterior hole or protective layer of something, you know, to to protect it from a harsh environment.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I keep coming back to this is a lot like the ceramic tiles for the space shuttle. So, I&#x27;m wondering where you both stand right now given these incredible tests both in the field and at the lab in terms of one end being this is a possibly explainable piece of ceramic to this is otherworldly. We don&#x27;t have this technology. Well, you hear intriguing possibilities, but the truth is we&#x27;re both researching possible explanations.</p>
