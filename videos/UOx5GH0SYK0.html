            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In a year when governments, scientists, and military insiders can no longer deny the reality of UFOs, everything is about to change. A bombshell new documentary, The Age of Disclosure, is about to drop. And in [music] it, government officials go on the record with one reality. UFOs UAP are real. For the first time ever, The Good and Trouble Show brings together 18 voices from across the disclosure landscape.</p>
<p>From Congress, Eric Berles, Kirstston Gillibrand. From the Senate&#x27;s inner circle, Kirk McConnell from National Media, Marik Van Renamp from Disclosure Foundation, Jordan Flowers. from public safety. Keith Taylor from America&#x27;s campuses, Sri Tata from finance, Eric Zidak from global astronomy, Beatatric Vioale and Ay Lobe from academic science. Kevin Kenuth from biotech and intelligence research.</p>
<p>Gary Nolan from classified physics programs. Hal Putoff from cognitive neuroscience. Julia Mossbridge from Navy NASA research. Lawrence Foresley from historic military encounters. Robert Salace.</p>
<p>And from around the world, journalist Ross Coltart and intelligence analyst Sarah Gam. 18 people, one message. UAP disclosure isn&#x27;t coming someday. [music] It&#x27;s happening right now. [music] Hey everyone, I&#x27;m Matt Ford and welcome to the Good Trouble Show.</p>
<p>Tonight we&#x27;re taking you inside one of the most important moments in modern history. For decades, the topic of UAP, otherwise known as UFOs, has been shrugged off, dismissed, or buried under layers of bureaucracy and denial. But the people closest to this issue, from Congress to the labs to the military, they aren&#x27;t staying quiet anymore. And with the premiere of the bombshell documentary, The Age of Disclosure, the conversation has officially crossed a point of no return. This isn&#x27;t speculation.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t rumor. This is data, testimony, policy, science, and a growing chorus of voices demanding transparency. And here&#x27;s the thing. No one has ever brought all these voices together in one place before. Not the media, not Congress, not the government.</p>
<p>But tonight, we are. 18 leaders from politics, academia, science, national security, and investigative journalism. all on this show, all in one night. In the middle of this global shift towards disclosure, that alone is historic. So tonight, we&#x27;re breaking it all down unfiltered.</p>
<p>From lawmakers to scientists to former officials to researchers to witnesses, each adding a piece to a puzzle our government has pretended well just doesn&#x27;t exist. This is the most comprehensive UAP cross-section ever assembled on one show, and we&#x27;re just getting started. Helping me break all this down tonight is someone you&#x27;ve seen on this show before. A brilliant strategist, a deep tech leader, and a force in national science and innovation policy. She is the founding partner of American Deep Tech, a deep technology and AI investment firm, having previously led investment recommendations that led to 20 billion in total company valuations and work in infrastructure transformations at the trillion dollar level.</p>
<p>She previously co-chared the US national research agenda in digital assets with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and led the US space economy and commercialization inter agency working alongside NASA under the White House OSTP. She also served as a program director at the National Science Foundation leading national science portfolios in space tech, energy, digital assets and AI and clean tech. and she recently joined the board of adviserss of the Disclosure Foundation. Please welcome my co-host for tonight&#x27;s special, Dr. Anna Brady Estabz.</p>
<p>Anna, welcome to the show. How have you been? You&#x27;re back. What is this your I think your third time back on the Good Trouble Show. &gt;&gt; Well, I always like to engage with leaders like you, Matt. I mean, it&#x27;s amazing to see what&#x27;s going on with Disclosure, and I really appreciate all you and the other guests today are doing to really bring this forward to people.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for joining us. Uh, this is going to be really, I think, a historic episode. And Friday, what I think will be really one of the most important films ever shown to the public will premiere. It&#x27;s called The Age of Disclosure. This premieres in select theaters across the country Friday, November 21st, and on Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s watch. &gt;&gt; This [music] is the biggest discovery in human history. It has so many beneficial impacts [music] including clean energy. &gt;&gt; This one breakthrough can be the key to interstellar travel. &gt;&gt; We can talk more about teleportation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; How can we use these technologies and all the capabilities that might come from it not to fight a war but to increase our standard of living? &gt;&gt; If [music] the capabilities that exist become known to the world, it might very well be that it is to the benefit of mankind. This is really going to be an amazing film. What do you think of the folks that are going on record on the age of disclosure? &gt;&gt; I think these are tremendous people. I mean, I know most of these people personally from my time in the government. So, I&#x27;ve had that access to be in these rooms and to be able to talk to people both in the private sector and in the US government.</p>
<p>And these are people who have served and these are people that are taken very seriously. So I&#x27;m I&#x27;m very interested in hearing what they have to say in the movie. We&#x27;ve also been privileged to more broadly and more publicly here. So many of these people have dedicated so much of their time uh years of their life really to sharing information on this and working uh you know in some cases in these programs decades. So I&#x27;m I&#x27;m looking forward to what they have to say and also just acknowledge that I think this one of the reasons this movie is so exciting and so important is that these people and others have catalyzed a much broader disclosure.</p>
<p>And I think when we look at the movies that were taped three years ago, four years ago now, and when we contrast that with the conversations today, I think you&#x27;re seeing people are very relaxed. This is moved into that this is happening. This is acknowledged. There are so many people across the country that, you know, if they just want to tune in and learn what&#x27;s going on, um they&#x27;re in the know. &gt;&gt; I absolutely agree.</p>
<p>And tell our viewers at home sort of how this special episode came together and what the response was like. Well, we just realized there were so many people who have been active in disclosure and what we&#x27;re going to hear from these leaders in the movie is very much anticipated, but also so much has happened in the last year. And so really we wanted to take a look at what has happened in disclosure. What do experts, what do people across, you know, different parts of society, what are they thinking? What are they sharing? So we had the opportunity to bring this out to a number of leaders in the UAP space and experts across fields. These are people in many cases with very different backgrounds and everybody we reached out to I mean this was literally within a couple days ago.</p>
<p>So everybody responded really quickly which I think just speaks to the commitment that people have to to sharing this information more broadly. &gt;&gt; I was really blown away by the response that we that we received. Absolutely. And I think uh it it just speaks to how important this subject is really becoming and that it is a true national security issue of our time. So uh that being said, let&#x27;s jump into this.</p>
<p>So before we dive into sort of the science and the sidings, we&#x27;re starting with the people who actually make the laws, the folks in Congress. These are the lawmakers who&#x27;ve been pushing the Pentagon, writing legislation, and dragging this issue out of the shadows, which we know that that has needed to be done for quite a long time. And uh kicking us off is Congressman Eric Berles. He is a sixthg generation Missurrian, software guy turned lawmaker, and a member of the House Oversight Committee who&#x27;s been pushing, I mean like really really pushing with Representative Anna Pelina Luna, the government hard on UAP transparency. Here&#x27;s what he has to say.</p>
<p>This week marks an important milestone in the efforts to bring disclosure to the topic of UFOs and UAPs because the Age of Disclosure documentary is coming out this week and it will bring the vast majority of the American people into the awareness of something that many people who are enthusiasts have been paying attention to for the last few years and that is that we&#x27;ve had repeated credible witnesses come forward from the first hearing in 2023 with Ryan Graves, David Grush, and with David Fraver. That was an explosive hearing. It was followed up with a hearing with Lou Alzando, Rear Admiral, Admiral Galidet, and Michael Gold. And then just recently, we had the hearing we had Jeffrey Nusatelli, we had Chief Wiggins, as well as Dylan Borland come forward. all very credible witnesses to the to the effort and to the to the situ everything that they&#x27;ve experienced.</p>
<p>The fact that so many very credible witnesses who have been at some of the highest ranks in our military and our military intelligence community have come been willing to come forward is very compelling evidence that there&#x27;s something there there and that&#x27;s why I think that it&#x27;s important that we continue this fight. Today is just a milestone, but there&#x27;s more to come. Okay. Representative Eric Berles. I have to say I think I love this guy.</p>
<p>I met him at one of the UAP Disclosure Fund functions, which is now the Disclosure Foundation. But certainly Eric Berles is one of the leaders in UAP transparencies. He&#x27;s a lot like Tim Bchett and Anna Paulina Luna. guy just he has no fear and really believes you can tell to his core that the [snorts] public deserves to know about this. What are your thoughts? I think he&#x27;s been a complete champion for this.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just amazing to see the transformation uh where, you know, I remember watching David Grush back into the summer of I think it was 2023, you know, and seeing him really speak to having biologics, the United States having biologics and just some of the shocked looks on a few of the lawmakers faces versus today lawmakers and leaders like Berles are saying there have been so many highquality witnesses and testimony. So, Congress has been catalytic, but Burles has been so active outside of those official hearings as well. I mean, I I&#x27;ve been in conversations with him. I&#x27;ve been in briefings with him, but he&#x27;s he&#x27;s not just listening to the type of witnesses that you&#x27;ve seen because there&#x27;s a much broader diversity of witnesses. He&#x27;s listening to farmers.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s listening to to entrepreneurs, to inventors, to investors. the amount of time and listening and and really just bringing getting this to ground. You know, he he&#x27;s out there hunting and he&#x27;s got a lot of a lot of insight on this topic. So, we&#x27;re grateful for his work and other lawmakers. Uh certainly Burchett and Luna have been tireless and they&#x27;re they have great colleagues in the House of Representatives and in the Senate as well.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, next is Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. She came on uh on the good to trouble show, one of the very first episodes I did. Uh so she is literally one of the fiercest advocates in Congress for accountability and transparency on UAPs. She sits on Senate Armed Services Committee and she sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee and she&#x27;s really been, you know, sort of leading the bipartisan charge to drag this conversation into the sunlight. Here&#x27;s her message.</p>
<p>Our government has a history of obfuscating, deflecting, and retaliating when it comes to UAPs going back for decades. It&#x27;s essential for Americans national security that we investigate and get answers on every documented UAP. And we have to change a culture where our brave service members are fearful to report what they see in our skies when they don&#x27;t know what it is. This is not a partisan issue. It&#x27;s common sense and we need to know what is in our skies and who is behind it.</p>
<p>I will continue to work with anyone to bring transparency and answers that we deserve and need for our domain awareness and national security. &gt;&gt; All right, Senator Gillibrand, I mean, she she really has been at the forefront and and one of the first senators that I&#x27;m aware of that really took this thing seriously and said, &quot;Hey, we need to write some legislation on that.&quot; &gt;&gt; It certainly is. and knowing uh many people who have worked with the senators, she she really has she&#x27;s exceptionally well informed. Uh I I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve known people who&#x27;ve worked with her for, you know, pro before she was a senator. And so to see her positioning on transparency and accountability, um it&#x27;s a major leadership move that she&#x27;s really pushing this towards transparency and and the US government towards accountability.</p>
<p>And I think one of the things that I really respect about Senator Gillibrand is you can tell she takes standing up for the men and women that wear the uniform that that sacrifice for this country. And you know, she has spoken about the retaliation that folks in the military and elsewhere that work for the government have received, folks that have come forward to try and speak up about the UAP issue or or just say flat out, hey, you know, when when we&#x27;re on these Navy training flights, we&#x27;re encountering these things. uh just that how much h how seriously she takes that whole aspect of it in protecting the folks that work for the US government and saying you know what these folks do not deserve retaliation um it&#x27;s &gt;&gt; very much an issue in uh across the country but certainly in New York I mean it&#x27;s been misnamed the Jersey drones because it was happening you know across the country But, you know, when we think about some of the leadership coming out of New York with Senator Gillibrand and also Senator Schumer, you know, has been very forward on this topic over the years. &gt;&gt; Speaking of Senate, we have heard from Capitol Hill. Now, let&#x27;s go inside the machinery itself, the staffers, the analysts, and the insiders who actually helped draft the legislation, brief Congress, and shape US national security.</p>
<p>We have Kirk McConnell. He is a former senior staffer who spent nearly four decades on the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. I mean, this this guy, he has the clearances. He&#x27;s seen the classified product. He helped shape the very UAP legislation that forced this issue into the open.</p>
<p>Now, he was not able to provide us with a video uh clip, but he did provide us this statement. I spent 37 years as a committee staff member in Congress, Senate Armed Services Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee, and House Intelligence Committee. After the New York Times revelation about the OSAP program and the Navy&#x27;s encounters with UAP, I was involved in Senate investigations of the UAP phenomena and drafting legislation pertaining to disclosure of government information on UAP. There&#x27;s more than one significant recent development in my opinion that warrants acknowledgement. One is the discovery by Swedish scientist Beatatric Voriel of numerous highly reflective objects orbiting the earth at high altitudes before the launch of the first artificial satellite Sputnik in 1957.</p>
<p>Her research has been published in respected peer-reviewed journals which in itself is a significant example of a barrier surmounted. Another is the release of the telepathy tapes which adds to the already hefty weight of evidence supporting the reality of so-called paranormal capabilities which are a central aspect of the UAP story. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The evidence of non-verbal autistics conducting rich interactions telepathically lends support to the reported experiences of so many people communicating with intelligent nonhuman beings telepathically. &gt;&gt; So Kirk is one of the highly knowledgeable people in this space. So he&#x27;s served on the committees, the Senate Armed Services Committee, uh the Senate Intel Committee.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really interesting that he&#x27;s been such an advocate for transparency, has been working pretty hard on this for years now, but also that he&#x27;s broadening the scope. So he&#x27;s moving beyond just the NATS intel angle and he&#x27;s focusing on the broader historical record of proof and data points. He&#x27;s also focusing on other aspects of phenom anomalous phenomena such as the consciousness angle and you know there have been decades of work you know demonstrating some of these advanced communications or telepathy but where this over the past year the telepathy tapes achieved a breakthrough in terms of just the way people received the knowledge. So I it&#x27;s also very interesting to see that how knowledge is conveyed makes a huge difference. I mean that that went so mainstream that work with the telepathy tapes as Kirk has noted.</p>
<p>And one thing that I would point out, what is important for lawmakers, so folks like Senator Kirstston Gillibrand, she sits on both the Senate Armed Services and Senate Intelligence Committee, for lawmakers to have a complete understanding of the UAP special access programs and how it&#x27;s how it&#x27;s been run, where these these classified buckets sit. It sits on both the armed services side and on the intel side. a lawmaker or anyone that&#x27;s working in policy in DC, if if they are only on armed services or they&#x27;re only on intel, they only see half of the picture, the whole picture. For any lawmakers that are that are watching this, you need to be able to see both buckets. You need to be able to see the armed services side and the intelligence side.</p>
<p>Then you can fully understand how the government has kept this hidden from our lawmakers. All right, up next is Mark von Renenamp. He is a former Obama administration official, national security analyst, and sharp political columnist whose reporting has pushed the UAP conversation into the mainstream. Here&#x27;s what Marak had to say. Hey everyone, my name is Mark von Renincamp and I cover the UAP topic as an opinion contributor for The Hill and I also host the soul briefing which is the Soul Foundation&#x27;s monthly roundup of all things UAP.</p>
<p>Matt, thanks so much for getting us all together. We made it. It&#x27;s finally here. The worldwide premiere of The Age of Disclosure is finally here. Congratulations to Dan Farah and the cast and crew and everyone who made this remarkable, extraordinary and and certainly unprecedented film a reality.</p>
<p>Congratulations. Um, of course there are about 3 million and one analytic rabbit holes we can go down and and profound uh questions that we can ask ourselves after watching the age of disclosure. Um but I just briefly briefly want to highlight um how remarkably bipartisan this topic is especially um at a time when we are deeply deeply divided politically, socially and culturally. Um the UFO UAP topic brings together the likes of Chuck Schumer and JD Vance. um Marco Rubio and Kirsten Gillibrand, Adam Schiff, Mike Rounds, uh the list goes on.</p>
<p>John Brennan, John Radcliffe, um very highlevel senior individuals that uh are could not be further apart politically um and yet they are saying some pretty remarkable things and putting some pretty remarkable things uh into legislation. So um I find that uh uniquely fascinating. Um and uh you got to hand it to the UFOs. They uh they pulled off the impossible. They uh it appears they united uh politicians and government officials uh of vastly different political stripes.</p>
<p>So congratulations for for bringing uh folks together. Uh and Dan, congrats on a a fantastic film. &gt;&gt; All right. I absolutely love Mark. I met him uh over at the I think it was the first Soul Foundation conference that I went to.</p>
<p>But you know, here&#x27;s this guy. He has consistently been putting out just incredible journalistic work on the UAP topic, especially in in the Hill. He&#x27;s a a real forwardthinking individual on this. And and I have to say he he he called it right on the money. Just the fact that you have people on both sides of the aisle in such a a a sort of politically split reality that we have right now between the left and the right.</p>
<p>There are lawmakers that are coming together because they understand that this is a significant national security uh issue and this is something that has been hidden by past administrations both Republican and Democrat. &gt;&gt; Definitely. And it it&#x27;s both a national security issue and also an abundance and innovation and economic opportunity. And I I really appreciate that he called out just the the successes in terms of bipartisanship. I&#x27;d like to see more of that really across a wide range of collaboration to really push the nation forward.</p>
<p>So I think this is a high point from from that standpoint. And I I think sometimes, you know, when you listen to it closely, he&#x27;s also he&#x27;s not softpeding this. He&#x27;s actually attributing it to the UAPs and the phenomena. So I I think that that is interesting to that we&#x27;ve reached a point where he just says thank you phenomena. So that&#x27;s a perspective but interesting to hear from him.</p>
<p>[clears throat] &gt;&gt; It it it is really cool to see how people have come together on this and um it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s something we do need to see more of and I suspect that we will. Again, I I really think that this movie is going to move the needle and I think lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are going to say, you know what, this is a bipartisan issue. Let&#x27;s come together. We know it&#x27;s the best thing for the country and uh let&#x27;s really kind of write this wrong. Okay, moving on.</p>
<p>Next is Jordan Flowers. He is the executive director of the Disclosure Foundation, which is uh formerly the UAP Disclosure Fund, which I was the director of strategy at. Uh anyway, uh he is a longtime expert in finance and organizational turnarounds. He&#x27;s one of the people working to build real infrastructure around UAP research and public education. Here&#x27;s Jordan&#x27;s message.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Jordan Flowers. I&#x27;m the executive director at the Disclosure Foundation. What do I think are the most important developments in Disclosure and what am I proud of? Uh I would break that down into um a component for the disclosure foundation and then for the broader community. At the disclosure foundation uh we&#x27;ve organized classified briefings to disclose information to the house oversight committee&#x27;s task force on transparency. [snorts] We facilitated access to information described as legacy program names and the names of senior officials uh purportedly having direct access to such programs.</p>
<p>Uh we have provided members with lists of specific alleged UAP records locatedable within the DoD and the IC. Um and then we&#x27;ve also authored a legal policy brief analyzing why lawmakers may receive classified information in a secure setting without permission uh by the executive branch and why whistleblowers and others may provide that information uh free from prosecution. Uh but perhaps more importantly, I think for the broader community, what I&#x27;ve seen that I&#x27;m proud of and grateful for, um I&#x27;m grateful for the people that have come forward. Um I&#x27;m grateful that we seem to have more unity in this field. Uh I think together we&#x27;ve dramatically lowered the stigma associated with this topic, whether it&#x27;s in the halls of Congress, um the ivory tower of academia, in Silicon Valley and Wall Street, or at home at the dinner table uh with our loved ones.</p>
<p>we&#x27;re able to discuss this topic with more credibility and more open minds and ultimately I think this will allow us to get closer to the truth uh to learn more about the phenomenon which is also I think uh ultimately to learn more about ourselves that was Jordan Flowers of Disclosure Foundation. Uh the folks over there they&#x27;re really doing some important work. Uh when I was a part of the organization we were holding events over on Capitol Hill. your thoughts on Jordan&#x27;s comments? &gt;&gt; Well, I I I appreciate that he&#x27;s sharing some of the concrete actions that the Disclosure Foundation have taken and and I&#x27;ve served as an adviser to them as well. And you know, so breaking down what he&#x27;s said, he&#x27;s saying that they&#x27;ve shared legacy program names.</p>
<p>Now, why does that matter? Because you know some of these cases and un acknowledged SAP you know you really even lawmakers they need to know what the name is to even be able to ask for it. So providing that visibility of here is the program names here are the senior officials that you can go ask to get the information. There&#x27;s a lot of a here is precisely where you need to look to get access to the classified info and various types of information. There&#x27;s also uh we shouldn&#x27;t assume I mean so so from my and I&#x27;m not speaking about inside the SAPS right now but from what I see in any organization and certainly when I worked in in other agencies in the government there&#x27;s a breadth of what you know just like in society you know how forward people are or not so we also shouldn&#x27;t even assume that the people in the inside these programs are necessarily authorized to release information so we&#x27;re all We&#x27;re also when I hear Jordan I&#x27;m hearing structural transformation carving out those legal paths because many would say some of these structures that were put in place the siloed the classifications some of those date back decades to the Cold War. So they&#x27;re they&#x27;re saying here&#x27;s the way to disclose to Congress doesn&#x27;t matter what the classification is.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s legal. Here&#x27;s how you can do it. So Jordan has been very active in that. &gt;&gt; Up next we have Dr. Keith Taylor.</p>
<p>He is a former NYPD emergency service unit officer with deep expertise in weapons of mass destruction response and homeland security. He&#x27;s trained alongside the FBI, FEMA, and some of the nation&#x27;s top crisis teams. And he brings a hardnosed perspective on the UAP issue. Here&#x27;s Keith. &gt;&gt; My name is Keith Taylor and I&#x27;m a public safety professional.</p>
<p>34 years ago, I swore to defend this country&#x27;s constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, as a member of the NYPD, which included responding to the 911 World Trade Center terrorist attacks and subsequently devoting the rest of my career there, responding to weapons of mass destruction incidents as a supervisor in the SWAT/heavy Rescue Emergency Service Unit. It is because of those experiences that I have taken the unidentified anomalous phenomena issue very seriously and engaged anyone who can help with developing training technology and policies for public safety professionals to protect against injuries and safely respond to UAP incidents. I urge anyone watching this video to download from Amazon Pride, the age of disclosure documentary and watch it with your friends, family, and colleagues to understand the current reality of the world we live in, as well as the dangers of not acknowledging very real and potential threats to it. Regarding non-human intelligence, I compare what life was like before the creation of the microscope. tiny [snorts] life forms all around humanity that could not be seen with the naked eye and yet could have either beneficial or disastrous results upon contact.</p>
<p>Night vision, thermal imaging, infrared technology are examples of today&#x27;s equivalent of microscopes, allowing humanity to realize that we share this planet with a variety of nonhuman intelligent life forms or species that are not necessarily visible with the naked eye. [clears throat] This realization should awaken humanity to break down the artificial divisions created to dominate or subjugate. We are single human species. Nothing more, nothing less. See your humanity in others and love and respect it.</p>
<p>I I think it&#x27;s really helpful to hear Pim both as somebody who&#x27;s defending the public public safety but also looking towards the normalization of he he&#x27;s sharing with us that he recognizes a wide variety of life forms and a diversity of life, you know, is really seeing this as an opportunity for for unity and bringing people together. So, he&#x27;s kind of merging two very important parts of the disclosure process. He&#x27;s also a researcher. So he&#x27;s somebody who&#x27;s dedicating observational resources, I believe, with the Tedesco brothers as well. So he&#x27;s he&#x27;s really trying to work to understand what&#x27;s out there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Up next is Sri Tata, a Yale PhD student in mathematical physics. Uh both two subjects I didn&#x27;t do too well in in college, and one of the organizers behind the Yale Student UFO Society. It&#x27;s one of the first studentled UAP groups in the country and hopefully there will be a lot more to come. He is there pushing this conversation into campuses and inspiring a new generation to take it seriously. Here&#x27;s Sri.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hey, this is Shri with the Yale Student UFO Society. Uh we&#x27;re yeah really happy to be part of the conversation in this really amazing time. We&#x27;ve got age of disclosure coming out. We&#x27;ve got all this transparency legislation. Like we&#x27;ve already hosted a lot of events.</p>
<p>Like people are really, you know, happy to engage with the academic community. They&#x27;re really happy to um, you know, come to campus. And we&#x27;ve had like really reputable people like Tim Galedet, Ryan Graves, a lot of congressional witnesses. Leslie Kane is coming in a couple weeks. We got a great event with Anna just, you know, this Thursday, the 20th.</p>
<p>Um, you know, and it&#x27;s not just about, you know, creating stump speeches and speaking to campus. It&#x27;s also about finding out you&#x27;ll like if you start organizing for this, you&#x27;ll start learning that there&#x27;s people on every campus that have had these experiences. Um, we&#x27;ve been lucky enough to even connect like really credible case to the House Oversight Committee through um, our work. we&#x27;ve like been able to connect a Connecticut legislator who wanted to get some UAP legislation done to some legal advocacy organizations and um you know and you know it&#x27;s kind of tough being the only um institution that&#x27;s covering this like you like a lot of people are interested but a lot of people also don&#x27;t want to participate and I think now is the time to like people are on the edge like you you notice that there&#x27;s a lot of people that come up to you saying I know a lot about this topic But I&#x27;m too nervous to come to meetings and now is the time where that Overton window is shifting. &gt;&gt; Okay, that was Sri Tata from Yale.</p>
<p>Uh your thoughts? &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s just such a great opportunity for people around the country and you don&#x27;t need to be a student and this is all about lifelong learning that can move faster than we can kind of normalize into the academic process. So yes, as Sheree says, set up your clubs, your book clubs, your university clubs, your your corporate clubs, whatever it is around the country. It&#x27;s great that Sri is doing that at Yale. I&#x27;ve got to say, coming out of Yale, cuz I was a PhD at Yale, uh, graduating around 2009 2010 time frame. And there was a lot of knowledgeability of UAP at Yale back then.</p>
<p>So I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the case on every university, but the Yale networks have known about this for a long time. And uh I would highlight Chris Melon is a Yale and we&#x27;re really looking forward to what he discloses in the age of disclosure. So that&#x27;s an example of one of many Yalies who that movement to really push this out of whatever environments they&#x27;re in to broad access across the country I think is very important. &gt;&gt; All right, next is Eric Zidc. He&#x27;s a strategist who&#x27;s been tracking the intersection of UAPs, advanced technology, and global markets.</p>
<p>His work looks at how disclosure lines up with AI, energy, and the biggest technological shifts of our time. Uh he&#x27;s he&#x27;s really amazing. He he&#x27;s been on our show as well to sort of talk about how UAP potentially represents a sort of black swan event. Now, he is another one. He wasn&#x27;t able to provide a video, but he did provide us with this statement.</p>
<p>continued UAP and drone incursions over military airspace, peer-reviewed scientific publications, including Beatatric Valale&#x27;s paper on transients, and ongoing whistleblower testimony on Congress, have all helped shift the conversation for more people toward asking what UAP truly are, and what their systematic presence means. We&#x27;re living through what could be the most consequential convergence of technological and disclosure events in human history. Disclosure is accelerating alongside with the race toward artificial general intelligence, a global energy transition, and the most aggressive infrastructure buildout of the 21st century. The possibility that disclosure reveals breakthrough principles beyond the limits of known physics and engineering and reveals in even consciousness itself has profound implications for global financial markets, geopolitics, and humanity as a whole. &gt;&gt; Eric&#x27;s an exceptional strategist and he&#x27;s an investor.</p>
<p>So, he&#x27;s really bringing it up to the macro of how does this tie into what matters for business. So he&#x27;s he&#x27;s driving us, you know, and this this is important for business people and also for Congress to understand in terms of what it means for resilience and economic growth. So what he&#x27;s saying is AI driving so much more need for energy and oh by the way, you know, we had last November the disclosure in front of Congress of Immaculate Constellation. Well, with AI, with all these cell phone cameras, individuals have so much material on their phones. So, disclosure is happening.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s happening through data. AI is going to be showing us these technologies as well in that iteration. So, he&#x27;s really showing us the speed with which things can move forward. And I I think it&#x27;s very interesting that as an as an asset manager and I and I was speaking recently, you know, a number of investors, but also David Door, you know, I think we we have this perspective of you just can&#x27;t ignore things that are happening from a technology standpoint. So some would say you know even if you think something is 1% 10% 30% likely to impact the future to impact your business non-action is itself an action and a choice that people are going to be accountable for.</p>
<p>So Eric&#x27;s really pushing on you know opening our eyes and see how this impacts a number of these areas and can also advance humanity with highly efficient energy you know and space tech as well. And folks at home, go back and watch one of the previous episodes where Eric Zidc was our guest. And really, Anna, what he what he spoke about at length is how the UAP issue is really a a black swan event. And if this is not handled in a proactive planned way from the government as opposed to a reactive way, the potential really kind of negative downstream second and third order consequences of this just being popped out on the public all at once sort of a a um a catastrophic disclosure. The the impacts on the world financial markets, the negative impact cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>So his message is we need to get ahead of this. So sorry, say that again. &gt;&gt; I was going to say he was very thoughtful at that time and brought up some really good points and I know that because I I spoken to Eric subsequently and I I do think he sees you know as a good investor he sees multiple paths forward to how this can roll out. So um there&#x27;s been a lot of good steps since you know that taping last year in terms of I I I would take the view that we&#x27;re not moving towards catastrophic disclosure. There&#x27;s been a lot of a lot of momentum.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s move into science. The hard data, the peer-reviewed research, and the people pushing the frontier of what we actually know about anomalous phenomena, UAP, flying saucers, whatever you want to call them. Uh, so uh, next up, we have Dr. Beatatrice Vioale, an award-winning Swedish astronomer whose research uncovered unexplained flashes in pre-sputnik sky plates. This is just mind-blowing.</p>
<p>You have to watch or look at what she&#x27;s written about this. She leads the Vasco project, hunts for potential alien probes in the solar system and is one of the boldest scientists pushing this field forward with real real data. Here&#x27;s Beatatrice. &gt;&gt; Hello, I&#x27;m Beatrice Verel. I&#x27;m an astronomer.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about what are the most important recent developments and of course I would say it is actually the congressional hearings about UAPs that have been happening in the US Congress. I think these things are extremely important for everyone on the planet, not only for United States, but also for us in Sweden because we learn about the phenomenon about um the authenticity of it uh with all [clears throat] these really brave and courageous whistleblowers that bring the information to the Congress and to everyone. The dstigmatization of the topic is very important as well as the increase in the research activities because now there are more scientists who dare to do this research and who dare to uh explore the UAP topic even if they&#x27;re still a little bit shy about it very often. I have personally also contributed uh with some research. For example, I have been doing studies or I am doing studies into uh [clears throat] flashes that you can see in presutnik plates which means like photographic plates of the sky that were taken before the first human satellite.</p>
<p>And we can see tens of thousands of these flashes that are um having a systematic behavior like correlating in time with uh nuclear bomb tests with UFO sightings and they also vanish in the earth&#x27;s shadow indicating that these flashes originate from uh solar reflections solar reflections on u artificial objects. So yes, it&#x27;s super exciting and I think there&#x27;s a lot of data there that is going to show you what these phenomena actually are. &gt;&gt; That was a great video from Dr. Beatatric Voral. Your thoughts? &gt;&gt; Well, I think that her work is so important as marked by the fact that two other people already have referenced it in the show.</p>
<p>So I think that&#x27;s really a point of appreciation for her work. I I think it&#x27;s also important to just encourage more scientists to get in there and do the work. And that&#x27;s the transformation that we&#x27;ve really really been seeing over these last two years is scientists I it&#x27;s become um it&#x27;s become more reputationally challenging to not show openness to engaging because it&#x27;s almost an appearance of hubris to for scientists to say they know something isn&#x27;t something because that&#x27;s actually not something you can really prove. So it&#x27;s been a tremendous transformation really in the sciences I would say over the last couple years and it was certainly something that the National Science Foundation was very open to NASA parts of DOE, NIH, Space Force, inter agency really across the board there was a lot of openness and certainly the private sector researchers and scientists. &gt;&gt; Up next is Dr.</p>
<p>Kevin Kenuth, a former NASA scientist and now a physics professor at Sunni Albany, where he leads research into exoplanets and UAP. He&#x27;s published over a hundred scientific papers and is one of the most credible voices calling for serious transparent investigation on the UAP phenomenon. Here&#x27;s Kevin. &gt;&gt; 2025 was a very exciting year in the field of UAP studies. There have been many major developments and the most important to me is the fact that scientists are beginning to pay attention.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re paying attention. They&#x27;re treating the topic seriously and they&#x27;re interested and in some cases even getting involved which is really a fantastic development for us here at the University of Albany. We are pleased to be able to tell you that we have published two peer-reviewed academic papers on the topic of UAP. this summer. Both were published in the highly respected aerospace journal Progress in aerospace sciences.</p>
<p>The first is um a review paper that I that I authored with 32 of my colleagues from around the world. It&#x27;s a review paper that describes what has been done to study UAP scientifically. Um it&#x27;s goes through the history of UAP studies and um major results and summarizes what&#x27;s known which is really a great place to jump in if you wanted want to learn about the topic. The other paper we publish is important to us at UAPX. Um first authored by Professor Matthew Shadagis, myself and Ben Kuclioski and Professor Cecilia Levy.</p>
<p>It is a paper that describes our initial results from our first field expedition to study UAP over the Catalina Channel. And if this wasn&#x27;t exciting enough, we got news this fall that a local businessman, Mr. Tony Gorman, made a major donation to our university to support our work on UAP studies. So this is this donation is being used to set up an endowment which is going to fund our UAP studies in perpetuity. So for us UAPX this is transformative.</p>
<p>UAPX is going from a nonprofit organization to a university supported project university at Albany project X and we are here to stay and this has really been a wonderful year. &gt;&gt; All right that was Dr. Kevin Kuth. All I have to say is that had I had him as my physics professor in in college, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have failed physics. So anyway, absolutely loved what he had to say.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t know about you, but one of the things that really stuck out to me when he pointed out the number of scientists that he was collaborating on on these individual peerreed scientific papers. What do you think? &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s foundational. I mean and I will say that while we talked about the potential for AI, I mean those peer peerreed kind of literature review unfortunately it&#x27;s the way a most AIS are working today. It&#x27;s very hard to get at the UAP information because often times you know it&#x27;s it can be what&#x27;s the next token what in AI what&#x27;s the most highly probable thing to show up. So the importance of guiding with these this these literature reviews but the thing that&#x27;s most exciting to me is that they&#x27;ve got re they&#x27;re getting their [clears throat] entity at their university funded and for universities that don&#x27;t have that it&#x27;s going to be an issue you know so we see how sometimes these universities speed ahead you know in different industrial sectors you know and really lead the research and so they&#x27;re well positioned to do that And I would just encourage other universities to go down that path as well because the reason scientists are pursuing this is it&#x27;s believed that we&#x27;re looking at the potential for extraordinary materials advances or materials that already exist and have been you know taken out of these craft or these programs.</p>
<p>uh highly advanced energy propulsion, space technologies, biotechnology impacts, quantum AI, and then there&#x27;s just the consciousness angle which is feeding into so many levels of innovation and accessing information. So, I just want to congratulate them. This is going to be very exciting to see the progress ahead and we&#x27;re we&#x27;re really excited about engaging with scientists and entrepreneurs. So, congrats. Congratulations are in order indeed.</p>
<p>Next is Dr. Gary Nolan, a Stanford professor, prolific inventor, and one of the most influential scientists studying anomalous phenomena. He&#x27;s published hundreds of papers, holds dozens of patents, and co-founded the Soul Foundation to bring rigorous research and transparency to the whole UAP issue. Here&#x27;s Dr. Nolan.</p>
<p>What I find most compelling about Dan Farah&#x27;s new movie, Age of Disclosure, is the caliber of the individuals that he&#x27;s brought to narrate the discussion over what&#x27;s been going on around alleged UAP and the so-called legacy program of the last 40 or so years. He brings individuals who have direct knowledge of these matters. He brings individuals from government who&#x27;ve made decisions around what to do with this kind of information. And while none of them will admit directly on screen because of their secrecy commitments, they point a way for, I think, the public at large and our policy makers to make decisions in the future about what should be done about this information. Is humanity, is America ready for this? I think they are.</p>
<p>I think we&#x27;ve seen quite a lot over the last few decades. And I think this is just one more new way to look at the universe and Dan Farah&#x27;s movie opens the door for us. &gt;&gt; Anna, do you agree with Dr. Nolan that humanity is ready for this? &gt;&gt; Definitely. And I would say that Gary has been ready for this with for this for quite some time.</p>
<p>You know, as shown by this is somebody who has I think a science publication, you know, in something like this. He&#x27;s highly regarded in the academic community and was actually somebody that the inter agency which was right under the white house which I co-chared alongside NASA the US space economy working group when we brought together top technologies across sectors in space technology Gary was one of the people who was invited and he was one of the people who really spoke to the importance of bringing research into this field of UAP and he he spoke to how it has been challenging at some points in the past. So I would just say that while he speaks to the credibility of others in the movie, I would just say that he is himself highly credentialed, highly respected, not just as a researcher, but also as a businessman. I mean, he&#x27;s had unicorn level successes in his companies. So really that&#x27;s a path that more people can go down that path and be like Gary Nolan, you know, at the total vanguard of checking out what&#x27;s real and and more and more people are wanting to go down and do that research.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s tremendous levels of excitement in the scientific community and we need the funding for it honestly because one thing is want to do the work but these researchers need the capital to get the R&amp;D done. Up next is Dr. Hal Putoff, a physicist with a Stanford pedigree who&#x27;s spent decades working inside some of the most sensitive US government programs on advanced technology and UAP. He&#x27;s advised the CIA, DIA, and multiple Pentagon efforts. And today, he&#x27;s pushing for more openness and collaboration in this field.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from Hal Putoff. Decades ago, reports of quote flying saucers were met with ridicule and stigma. Over recent decades, however, our Air Force and Navy jets and carriers have been equipped with vastly upgraded sensors. Their reports today mirror those of decades ago and are now taken seriously by the defense and intelligence communities. Pilots report that what they observe is way beyond our physics.</p>
<p>Right angle turns at Mach 2 or three and then out of water. However, we physicists have been able to show that in fact such observations are not necessarily beyond our physics, just beyond our engineering for the present. Now, I&#x27;ve had the privilege of being involved in highly classified programs on the UAP topic. So, one might question why I&#x27;m promoting more openness and disclosure on this topic. Perhaps best said in a speech by Edwards Teller, father of the Hbomb, he pointed out that during the highly classified Manhattan project on development of the atomic bomb, we and our adversary at the time, Russia, moved ahead nearly step by step.</p>
<p>However, in electronics, which we did not classify, we shot ahead like a rocket, leaving them in the dust. This for me constitutes an argument for more openness and collaboration between elements of our high-tech government contractor structure. Hal &gt;&gt; Hal has been so important in terms of bringing so much of this to light. Uh and just his leadership and what he&#x27;s been involved in in technology is extraordinary. So kind of as a backstory, we had a group of people NASA, DoD, NSF, SBA across the inter agency looking at exotic technologies and we brought in Hal.</p>
<p>He gave us a tremendous briefing. Instead of just having knowledge, we said, could this be sharable? Howal went on to do a series of briefings that were made public that these were three and a half, four hour briefings where you have somebody coming out of a program sharing much of what he can and just the way people responded to that was extraordinary. He went on to go uh later on to Rogan. So there&#x27;s I would just say go into the materials that Hal has shared. He&#x27;s got publications and he&#x27;s also just saying that that there&#x27;s a real needs here and real opportunities and it&#x27;s a race, right? He&#x27;s saying that he wants to see the US be able to lead as opposed to be surpassed in these areas.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s one of the reasons that he&#x27;s really pushing for openness, but he&#x27;s also very much speaking to, you know, to what these tremendous, he calls them physics advances. Others might say that you know maybe the engineering can be done but I would say go into Hal&#x27;s work and we feel very fortunate to work with Hal. &gt;&gt; All right. Up next is Dr. Julia Mosbridge a cognitive neuroscientist who studies consciousness precognition and human potential.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s a senior distinguished fellow at the center for the future mind and founder of the institute for love and time connecting sigh research directly to the UAP conversation. Here&#x27;s Dr. Mossbridge. &gt;&gt; My name is Dr. Julia Mossbridge.</p>
<p>I am a cognitive neuroscientist and author of Have a Nice Disclosure. And why I think we are at the moment that we are at is because of decades of change and then sudden transformation. Decades of change meaning people taking seriously other people&#x27;s experiences even if they didn&#x27;t have those experiences themselves. decades of change in recognizing that regardless of what administration is in charge of US policy um secrets actually don&#x27;t get kept very well and decades of change that have to do with recognizing that the power of disclosure of of the truth actually coming out is something that we can handle only if we have each other only if we have compassion connection unconditional love and support from each other. There&#x27;s organizations all across this country and all across the world that have joined together to move towards disclosure, not in a political way, not in a blaming way, in a sort of truth and reconciliation way.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re headed. I think we&#x27;re starting to become more humble. As a scientist, I can say the scientists I know are be are starting to become more humble. and I&#x27;m grateful. So, I&#x27;m really excited about the age of disclosure coming out because it outlines not only the truth but the importance of connection and compassion and regard and respect for each person on the planet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Julia is Dr. Mossbridge is somebody that we also feel feel very fortunate to have worked with and learned from and she&#x27;s somebody who&#x27;s active across so many fields. So, UAP, AI, quantum, precognition, consciousness, remote viewing. And so, what her move the moves she&#x27;s saying is the move towards that consciousness and this she she&#x27;s always talking about unconditional love and she&#x27;s brought that into some environments where that wasn&#x27;t always the core of the culture. So, I think that, you know, just if you look at how relaxed Julie is as she talks to us, she and so many other people are just really invested in let&#x27;s move forward.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s move forward in positivity, in abundance, you know, and and coming together with people. So, I just really appreciate what she&#x27;s contributed. &gt;&gt; Coming up next is someone that I&#x27;m sure everyone at home has seen on the news as of late with the whole three atlas thing. It&#x27;s Dr. Avi Lobe, Harvard astrophysicist, best-selling author, and head of the Galileo project.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s one of the world&#x27;s most published astronomers, and has become a leading voice, arguing that we should take the search for extraterrestrial technology seriously. Here&#x27;s Avi. &gt;&gt; Over the past decade, the first objects from outside the solar system were discovered. They move faster than the escape speed from the sun and they are called interstellar objects. Remarkably, two of them, the first one named Omua Mua and the most recent one named three Atlas appeared anomalous MUA because it was pushed away from the sun by some mysterious force without showing any cometary evaporation.</p>
<p>No gas or dust around it. It was most likely flat like a pancake. And three Atlas because of its huge mass, a million times more thanuam mua. We would have expected a milliona muas before seeing such a giant object. And also 3i Atlas is moving in the plane of the planets around the sun as if it is on a reconnaissance mission.</p>
<p>Comet experts called both of them comets. They called omuamu a dark comet because there wasn&#x27;t any signature of a comet around it. And that&#x27;s understandable because they are trained on data sets of comets. So just like AI systems, they say things based on their training data set. And what I&#x27;m suggesting to them is to add to their training data set all the technological objects that we launched to space which cohabit the uh inner solar system together with the rocks that were left from the formation process of the solar system.</p>
<p>And so my hope is that over the coming decade, the Reubin Observatory in Chile will discover dozens of new interstellar objects. And some of them might be technological in origin. And we could tell that because they would maneuver or they would emit some artificial lights or have some transmission of a signal like a radio signal or we would get a close-up photograph that beyond any reasonable doubt will demonstrate that they are technological. So the future is bright as long as we are open-minded enough to seek the evidence. All right, that was Dr.</p>
<p>Avi Loe. Uh Dr. Loe&#x27;s been on our show uh twice and I have to say one of the things that I really admire about Dr. Loe is this guy, he he&#x27;s fearless. He doesn&#x27;t care what his critics say.</p>
<p>He doesn&#x27;t care, you know, what these debunkers say, what not. He is all about the science. He is all about looking at the at the outliers, you know, looking at the things outside of the box and what those might represent. What do you think? I think it&#x27;s great that AI is taking that approach and it&#x27;s so and this is a major opportunity. So Avi is taking the opportunity approach and he&#x27;s using his capabilities and his credentials and his ability to do research and rather than being cautious based on what he&#x27;s built previously, he&#x27;s staking that reputation on the next thing.</p>
<p>And I see plenty of other people doing that as well. more. That&#x27;s an opportunity. If you have a reputation, if you can make things happen, go make things happen. And Aby is also one of the people we we briefed Congress in the congressional briefing together in May.</p>
<p>Uh very few people have asked for a billion dollars, you know, to go into this space. Obby says it&#x27;s a billion. I think it&#x27;s hundreds of billions of dollars. He&#x27;s saying we need to we need to look at what&#x27;s coming in. By the way, there there are broader pushes where hundreds of billions of dollars are expected to be put in play such as Golden Dome that has a space situational awareness component.</p>
<p>So, I think we&#x27;re going to be learning much much more as we have more space situational awareness, more AI, and and this push for disclosure with with people like Avi. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he&#x27;s he&#x27;s something else. It&#x27;s uh and I don&#x27;t know where he finds the time. I I honestly don&#x27;t think the guy sleeps. He He is He is one one busy uh one busy scientist.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Did you sleep, Matt? Come on. I know you&#x27;ve been You&#x27;ve done amazing things bringing this show together. And uh &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s Yeah, I I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll sleep for about a week of following this whole thing. Okay, next is Larry Forsley, a pioneering nuclear physicist working with NASA on lattice confinement fusion, whatever that is, and advanced propulsion concepts. He spent decades at labs like Liverour, Rochester, and the Naval Research Lab, pushing boundaries in energy, fusion, and space exploration.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s Mr. Forsley. Hi, I&#x27;m Lawrence Forsley. I am the chief technology officer for Global Energy Corporation. I&#x27;m also uh associated with the naval surface warfare centers as well as NASA where I&#x27;m PI for a variety of projects including lattice confinement fusion fast fishing.</p>
<p>Uh, I actually became interested in UAP, what was originally known as UFOs, uh, during Project Blue Book when I was still in high school. And, uh, maintained that interest for a number of years. But it was, uh, when the Navy contacted me about 8 years ago for means by which they could determine whether or not our aircraft coming off of aircraft carriers, off the land, uh, if they should encounter these, um, craft could determine whether or not that had happened. And one of the means was to see whether or not the uh flight recorder time base had changed in the time between when they left the aircraft and they then landed again. Uh presumably if there&#x27;s some type of spatio uh gravitic change that this may show up as a change in the time base.</p>
<p>uh the rest of the work that I&#x27;ve done [clears throat] is exploring technologies and my colleagues and getting to know a number of the people who have observed these uh both in space uh in air and on the ground. So I&#x27;m convinced of their existence. Uh in truth I refer to these as the out oftowners. Not because they are necessarily out of town but they&#x27;re really out of town. um that covers the ground whether they&#x27;re Russians, Chinese, Iranians or way off the surface.</p>
<p>Uh my interest in this is basically finding the technology, reverse engineering it and if possible licensing it from the out oftowners. So I wish everyone well and we&#x27;ll see where this goes. &gt;&gt; Wow. The way out oftowners that was Lawrence Forsley. I&#x27;m pretty blown away by that whole thing to be honest.</p>
<p>Um wow. Well, well, Larry actually played a core role in in really catalyzing, you know, the the scientific engagement. So, he was one of the people that brought to together that group of folks across the inter agency and, you know, also we we brought in entrepreneurs. And so, he&#x27;s he was also on those NASA ecosystemic futures podcasts that that we did together and he was on almost everyone. So he&#x27;s talked a little bit, you know, in the past, but I think this is new disclosure in terms of the details because I I&#x27;ve been in all those conversations.</p>
<p>He kind of says, you know, I got pulled in, you know, I was in these, you know, classified briefings and then but here he&#x27;s being specific where he&#x27;s saying that he was being asked to deter, you know, determine with the sensing, you know, is there a time effect? So he&#x27;s So this to me feels like new information as somebody who knows Larry and works with him very closely. I feel like this is new and he is also it&#x27;s kind of interesting that you know for some people they&#x27;re disturbed by the fact that there might be reverse engineering. I would be disturbed if there&#x27;s not reverse engineering. I mean for engineers this idea, you know, it&#x27;s like you go to a restaurant, there&#x27;s this really great meal, you&#x27;re a chef and you don&#x27;t try to make it. every engineer and every scientist if you get an idea or if you see something cool you know the people break apart motors as kids.</p>
<p>So Larry is saying, &quot;I want to reverse engineer this stuff. License me the tech.&quot; You know, you know, he thinks it&#x27;s offplanet. You know, the offplanet, you know, we want it. The on planet, you know, if it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s adversaries, if it&#x27;s us tech, bring us the tech. Bring us the business.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s honestly how I feel about it is let&#x27;s build this. Let&#x27;s see what can come out of these programs. And it&#x27;s entrepreneurs and engineers and scientists should be extremely excited about this and you should be banging on these doors saying we want to build this. We want to see what you&#x27;ve built. We&#x27;re excited to learn about what you know these really smart people haven&#x27;t been able to share.</p>
<p>And if you have I mean think about if you&#x27;re an inventor, you&#x27;re a scientist and you&#x27;ve built things and you can&#x27;t publish it, you can&#x27;t share it, you can&#x27;t have that interaction. So Larry&#x27;s saying give us the technology, you know, and also, you know, let&#x27;s we&#x27;ll enga we&#x27;re excited about engaging with the out oftowners. So I I but I appreciated that he gave new information that I have not heard him say. &gt;&gt; I have not heard that either. And you heard it for the first time here on the good trouble show.</p>
<p>So &gt;&gt; I just want a little disclosure. We wanted new disclosures in this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. There you go.</p>
<p>We we uh we got a little &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a few other new there&#x27;s another new disclosure coming too. &gt;&gt; All right. And now we&#x27;re stepping into one of the most serious chapters of the UAP story, the long documented history of UAPs interfering with nuclear weapons systems. Up next is Robert Salis, former US Air Force captain and missile launch officer who witnessed one of the most famous UAP related nuclear shutdown incidents in US history. Here&#x27;s Captain Salace.</p>
<p>between uh September of 1966 and March of 1967. Uh that included my incident which I&#x27;ve discussed many times. There were 40 40 nuclear missiles operational that were disabled by UFO encounters. Now this is of many many incidents involving UFOs and nuclear weapons. I&#x27;ve identified about 13 in my latest book, but there have been many more than that that have not been brought forth with enough emphasis.</p>
<p>However, they could be brought forth uh with the right intent and emphasis. Uh these witnesses would come forward. There have been a multitude of such incidents. In each and of these incidents, there was no damage done to equipment um missile equipment or the warheads. And there was no there were no injuries as [clears throat] a result of these incidents.</p>
<p>So the conclusion I have made from my research is that uh our nonhuman intelligence visitors NHI are trying to send us a message and what is that message? I think um their message is we ought we humans ought to make an effort to abolish all nuclear weapons. &gt;&gt; That was Captain Robert Salace. And one thing that I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve said continually on this show time and time again is is that I think the fact that UAP UFOs have been tampering with our strategic nuclear uh deterrent going back literally decades and it continues to happen. Uh we&#x27;ve had interference with the Minute Man 3, a land-based ICBM. Uh we are seeing it with the uh Trident ICBM on our sea launch sea launch ballistic missiles on our Ohio class submarines.</p>
<p>This is something that has gone on for literally decades. These systems being disabled. Uh there are instances of the warheads being retargeted. This has been going on. This continues to go on.</p>
<p>And in my opinion, this is really kind of one of the key reasons for the cover the cover up. The the United States government does not want Congress asking questions about this. The fact that really one of the the the crown jewels of our nation&#x27;s defense is being degraded or tampered with. It upsets nuclear stability. uh when you have uh degraded force readiness um and the fact is that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s nothing that that the US Air Force can do about it.</p>
<p>It it is something that really there&#x27;s there should have been a Senate hearing on this yesterday. What are your thoughts? &gt;&gt; Well, I think this really does cut to something that everybody would agree we have to pay attention to. So while there are other things where you might say well do you care if there&#x27;s a a 30% or a 10% or an 80% or 1% chance on on the nuclear side people certainly agree you know we need to focus on this uh interestingly enough this has also been something that has in some ways brought nations together. I mean, so this is something that, you know, I think it it was publicly I haven&#x27;t watched the full clip or maybe I have, but you know, uh when when uh the US and the Soviet Union when our leaders got together and we&#x27;re talking about, you know, just really aligning on sometimes this isn&#x27;t us, you know, so don&#x27;t think that we&#x27;re attacking you. So, so it&#x27;s actually this this technology that&#x27;s been utilized that to that can uh disarm nuclear is is something that has actually led to much higher nuclear vigilance.</p>
<p>This is so important that this is really there&#x27;s many reasons people should pay attention to this, but I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s anybody that would think we can pretend something isn&#x27;t a thing or look the other way when uh nukes are at stake. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Uh one of the things you you may not know what you were just referring to that was a a document that I discovered a while back. the the US-Russian nuclear hotline is called uh Molink uh Moscow Link and this is a number of really kind of I think it was right before David Grush testified but I was doing some some search uh some research work on Google and I came across what was the uh the operating agreement on on this on this hotline how it operated and essentially what was what happened was there was a a an agreement between that you referenced between US and and Russia was called the accidental war agreement. And in this agreement they they lay out in this operating document that I found they laid out a series of coded messages.</p>
<p>So uh one was a code word and one was a number. So first one the code word was atom a to o m and then there was a number associated with it and these were pre pre-agreed upon that that came out of this uh out of this treaty with Russia a pre-agreed upon list of coded messages that would rapidly get get the message across to the other side. Two of those messages appeared to be related to UAP. Uh, one essentially said, uh, we&#x27;ve detected unknown objects that could be mistaken for for nuclear missiles. Uh, those are not from us.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re not in initiating a nuclear attack. The second message was dealt with that uh uh is early warning systems appeared to be being tampered with by uh unidentified objects. So, I found this document. It was remarkably unclassified. I immediately sent it to David Grush and some others and uh I&#x27;m really grateful that it it made it into the congressional record.</p>
<p>But I think the important part that was important work, &gt;&gt; you know, thank you. I&#x27;m couldn&#x27;t believe I came across this thing. Uh and I think everyone else was was really kind of flattered that this thing was even out there. But what it tells you is that there is a a clear concern or was and I&#x27;m sure it continues to be a a clear concern of UAP mimicking a nuclear attack and making sure that that these vehicles showing up on on early warning systems on either side that they&#x27;re not mistaken for an incoming nuclear attack. So they had the forethought and this actually this actually occurred uh during the Nixon administration and I actually spent a good bit good bit of time over at uh at NAR digging up these uh these old notes on this particular agreement that was struck during the the uh the Nixon administration.</p>
<p>But I mean if that&#x27;s not proof enough that that this is a serious serious national security issue. so serious that two countries lay out two pre-desated messages as part of their hotline that appear to be related to UAP. I mean, I don&#x27;t know what else screams national security issue. &gt;&gt; There was an actual I mean, I think there was an actual video of them talking about it, you know, or something or it was something along the lines. It was more if aliens were going to attack humanity, you know, you would, you know, you would we would help each other, right? And the answer was yes.</p>
<p>You know, the US and the Soviet Union would help each other. So, you know, so there was actually even some collaboration. I mean, I don&#x27;t want to call it collaboration, but you know, it it&#x27;s interesting to see how that&#x27;s all played out. And and I I I think you had also heard back from Robert Hastings who and I didn&#x27;t read the full book, but you know, for those that are listening to this and saying news to you, you know, as it was to me and to all of us when we find out about it, Hastings has a book that&#x27;s about this thick that it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s called UFOs and nukes. It&#x27;s just it&#x27;s dense.</p>
<p>I mean, there&#x27;s so much that has happened with UFOs and nukes that he&#x27;s documented. So just one of you know I want I don&#x27;t want to push it as the reason but one of many reasons that people take this topic very seriously and it&#x27;s irresponsible not to. &gt;&gt; I couldn&#x27;t agree more. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s this is again something Congress should immediately hold hearings on in my personal opinion. It is a a serious national security issue as uh I believe Dan Farah actually has said this in a recent a recent interview regarding his movie.</p>
<p>This is not pure history. This continues today. UAP tampering, disabling with the strategic nuclear deterrent of the United States of America. There is no greater threat to national security than the degradation of our strategic nuclear arsenal. We &gt;&gt; do have other capabilities and we hope, you know, most people don&#x27;t have the expectation that nukes would ever be used.</p>
<p>So maybe at the end of the day, &gt;&gt; this is not as big a deal because what humans would want to use nukes against humans in today&#x27;s day and age. So we&#x27;ve got plenty of ways and weapons capabilities. So the United States has plenty of ways to defend herself. Does not need nukes to be that one and done. Uh but very very important.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Next, we&#x27;ve got a powerhouse duo. Ross Coltart is an award-winning investigative journalist whose reporting on David Grush and secret UAP programs helped blow this issue wide open. And joining him is Sarah Gam, an astrophysicist and former intelligence community imagery analyst who worked with the UAP task force and the Pentagon as a nuclear capability strategist for the Air Force. Together, here&#x27;s Ross and Sarah. &gt;&gt; Hello, good trouble show.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s Ross Koulart and Sarah Gam coming to you excitingly from Machu Picu the ancient Come around this way Sarah so people can see the ancient whatever you call it temple ruin &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s for &gt;&gt; megalithic structure behind us &gt;&gt; and this is in Peru of course way way up in the Andes and to add to the mystery we&#x27;ve also been looking at pridactyl beings which we&#x27;ll be bringing you a special story about very soon on reality check. Great for you to give me a plug there, Matt. Good on you, mate. But the um the the reason we want to talk to you is because of course Matt and Anna have asked us to give you a take on what Sarah &gt;&gt; on what our opinion is on the best parts of disclosure over the past year. Any other UAP thing or what our you know maybe our favorite moments have been.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What&#x27;s yours? &gt;&gt; Um I would say by far the advancement of the spiritual world. So, a year ago, Ross interviewed me and I talked about a blue bean that was in my bedroom and &gt;&gt; I thought you were very brave, by the way. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I was very terrified and &gt;&gt; But did you feel positive afterwards? &gt;&gt; I did. There were so many amazing stories that people shared with me of their experiences and some people that they&#x27;ve never told their whole lives.</p>
<p>So, how incredible is that? like the you we know from how many people are coming forward now sharing their experiences that you know we&#x27;re way past are we alone because now we need to know who are they &gt;&gt; we do need to know who and how many there were I mean there there is a real possibility you know and it&#x27;s funny it&#x27;s um Brian Foster the guy who&#x27;s leading us around this part of Machu Picu he just said quite openly to me that he thinks it&#x27;s quite entirely plausible that this was built by a non-human civilization &gt;&gt; yeah He did. &gt;&gt; Well, what was your favorite part this year? &gt;&gt; My favorite part, and it may sound like I&#x27;m a Trumper. It&#x27;s not a statement of political support. It&#x27;s the fact of the significance of the election of Donald Trump for a second administration in light of his commitment to UAP transparency. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I think we&#x27;ve now got for the first time in 80 years, we have a serious possibility.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t fall over that one. Just so you know, we are currently perched because there&#x27;s thousands of people coming in here. We&#x27;re perched on the edge of a thousand foot drop. I&#x27;ll show you. &gt;&gt; This is Sarah trying to avoid falling into this valley here and we&#x27;re literally on the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p>[laughter] So, forgive us if we are being a little nervous. I&#x27;ll just bring it back again, Sarah. So, yeah, I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m actually very interested to know what&#x27;s going to happen next in the Trump administration. &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Because we have we have an opportunity for the first time in 80 years for a United States president to do what Donald Trump has pledged to do, which is to take on the deep state. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we know there&#x27;s a deep state &gt;&gt; and he&#x27;s already been doing that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we&#x27;re we&#x27;re in a position now where you&#x27;ve got uh Tulsi Gabbard as DNI, the director of national intelligence.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got Cash Patel at the FBI. And we know there is an FBI investigation ongoing. You&#x27;ve got um what&#x27;s his name at the CIA? &gt;&gt; Who&#x27;s at the CIA? Uh help me here. &gt;&gt; No, words aren&#x27;t good right now. Altitude.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. [laughter] &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re going to blame it on LO too. &gt;&gt; Um well, I wanted to say another favorite part of mine, too, is the international outreach that&#x27;s happening right now. Um it&#x27;s not just the US and it&#x27;s not just Australia. And you know it&#x27;s been incredible being a part of so many international things and um documentaries.</p>
<p>So at soul I know the UK and Italy were filming documentaries at the conference uh sorry the soul conference in Italy at Lake Nar. &gt;&gt; Actually that&#x27;s the other issue too is that mainstream media not just Ross Koulad at NewsNation mainstream media is now starting to engage. I think they&#x27;re slowly waking up from this stuper. Um, and it&#x27;s becoming, I think, not fashionable, but it&#x27;s certainly becoming acceptable to cover the issue of UAPs. You&#x27;re worried about being left behind by the &gt;&gt; I totally am.</p>
<p>[laughter] I still see us. I still see our people. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we&#x27;re still here. But, um, we need to go and have a look at the Temple of Three Windows in a few seconds, but before we do go, I I I think I just want to conclude what I was saying about Trump. &gt;&gt; Trump has a mandate from the American people to do the right thing on UAPs.</p>
<p>he can take on the deep state. The people who have in breach of the constitution failed to properly oversight Congress about what has been going on in a legacy UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program. &gt;&gt; And so we&#x27;re now in a unique position to be able to get something done about that. &gt;&gt; So exciting. &gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s my take for 2025.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. I think that&#x27;s been an amazing summary. So as little progress as people think that we&#x27;ve had on disclosure it&#x27;s been monumental. So when you think back a year ago spirituality wasn&#x27;t really a thing and now it is and more people are believing more people are looking up and more people are sharing their experiences. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually that&#x27;s the other issue too. There&#x27;s a growing recognition that it&#x27;s not just about little green aliens from Zika reticular. It&#x27;s about human consciousness. It&#x27;s about connection. It&#x27;s the idea that those two eternal mysteries are connected.</p>
<p>Who are we? Where do we come from? Why are we here? And are we alone? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re not alone. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re not alone. &gt;&gt; In fact, Sarah, I&#x27;m not here. &gt;&gt; UFOs. &gt;&gt; UFOs are real.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; See you later, Matt and Anna. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Goodbye from Machipu. &gt;&gt; Okay, that was Ross Coltart and Sarah Gam. I don&#x27;t know about you, Anna, but I think they have us both beat as far as being in a a really really beautiful area.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m I&#x27;m in a studio and &gt;&gt; don&#x27;t think this place is [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I I think we would both &gt;&gt; This is pretty nice. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they&#x27;re in what? Matcha Macha Picchu. Is that right? Um &gt;&gt; any Well, thanks for joining us and thanks for really being my co-host on on this really, I think, really great uh wonderful uh wonderful episode.
