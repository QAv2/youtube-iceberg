            <p>[Music] what&#x27;s going on guys so what I&#x27;m going to attempt to do in this video is discuss with you what&#x27;s called the reciprocal systems theory of Dewey B Larson and it&#x27;s super interesting stuff because it really helps to theoretically explain exactly how free energy systems can create energy out of nothing and how things like anti-gravity and time travel all work but the reason I say attempt to discuss is because this can get to be a very complicated subject if you&#x27;re coming at this with the understanding of conventional science because let&#x27;s be real conventional science these days is just bad foundations built upon bad theories built upon a bunch of confusion right and all of these scientists are trying to find their unified field Theory but since they have all these bad foundations that they&#x27;re trying to work through it&#x27;s very difficult for them and the cool thing about this theory is what this guy right here did dwey B Larson now Dewey B Larsson was a a scientist in the mid1 1950s who was really into almost everything he was into engineering he was into cosmology and physics and chemistry so what he did is he basically um admitted that&#x27;s a key word there admitted that there was so many little pieces wrong in conventional science so he took a step back and he tried to piece it all together and he came pretty darn close to a um a working unified field Theory and I&#x27;m going to try to explain that to you guys and here&#x27;s the cool thing as well is that you know as I&#x27;m doing these YouTube videos I&#x27;m basically like vlogging my research so I&#x27;m not claiming to understand exactly how all of this works I&#x27;m still working to piece it together but I just want to Simply offer it to you guys and then you know as I do more videos on this subject and a whole lot of other subjects it&#x27;s just going to get more and more refined so it&#x27;s really it&#x27;s really fun stuff but anyway let&#x27;s get into Dy B larsson&#x27;s physics now funny enough as well dwey B Larson he was actually the roommate and like best friends with the Nobel Prize winner lonus Pauling when they both went to Oregon State University so he is in some pretty good company of the brains that he was um acquainted with so extremely intelligent guy and when he took a step back and he started piecing together a theoretical unified field Theory of physics this is essentially the postulate that he came towards and this is the name of one of his primary books explaining his theories and that is nothing but motion and one of his primary postulates was that motion is what makes up the universe it&#x27;s not actually matter cuz if you think of our um material world is you know everything is 99.99999% empty space I&#x27;m touching this whiteboard here but all of these tiny little atoms with their particles flowing around it is pretty much just all vacuum and bringing that back up to here when you think of everything being motion it kind of makes sense because not only are we moving through time right now but we&#x27;re also moving through space we&#x27;re moving through space constantly and that&#x27;s never going to change and it&#x27;s always been that way because we have our Earth that&#x27;s rotating that&#x27;s spinning around our star this star is spinning around you know another star which is spinning through our galaxy which is spinning around our universe and that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s always been always the way it&#x27;s always going to be so it&#x27;s motion that makes up everything motion is space time remember SpaceTime is that stuff that um Quantum scientists are kind of scratching their head at these days trying to piece together well SpaceTime is motion it&#x27;s the same thing and you can then boil it down to different equations based upon this idea of motion speed is simply space over time you&#x27;re you know dividing an amount of space you move by the amount of time it took you to do that and that speed you have energy which is time over space you have acceleration which is space over time squared and then it just goes on all you do is uh mess with the integers that you&#x27;re um powering it to and that&#x27;ll get you different um physical equations so that&#x27;s pretty much it I mean when it comes down to like testing memorizing these equations becomes so much easier than many of the equations that science is doing these days and that&#x27;s a big interesting point is that science is so complicated these days because of the fact that they have you know very questionable foundations all built upon each other so then they have to you know create these new mathematic formulas and problems to uh talk about this over here but then that leaves all this questionable stuff over here that they make new formula for so it all just gets so confusing but again if you unlearn all of the weird stuff that&#x27;s thrown at us and begin to build back your thought processes upon that um it becomes pretty simple and then let&#x27;s get into uh space and time and the reason he calls it the reciprocal systems theory is because space and time are reciprocals and I have the yinyang symbol drawn up here because that&#x27;s basically how um dwey B Larson saw it and it&#x27;s so I mean again it&#x27;s so simple but it&#x27;s so profound in that all we have is just two Polar Opposites and they work with each other to create essentially a unified field and that those two opposites are space and time so right now you and I are residing in What&#x27;s called the material sector or space overtime so this m material sector that we reside in is um could also be known as slower than light motion because you and I are the material the matter essentially the we&#x27;re made up of is moving slower than light so this is why we reside in what&#x27;s in threedimensional space and onedimensional time so think of it you know we have three dimensions left right up down forward back and time is fixed so in the Co in the material sector time is the fixed um the fixed reciprocal because time just goes One Direction one dimension and time is flowing in space moves so you can move in space but time is the only thing uh that&#x27;s linear then the reciprocal of space and time is time and space so this is when you get into the co what&#x27;s called The Cosmic sector or faster than light motion and what dyb Larson says is that light speed is the base unit so what he says is light speed is one one is Light Speed when you&#x27;re below that that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re again in the material sector and stuff is Right material when you move past the speed of light that&#x27;s when you enter the cosmic sector and you&#x27;re in time space um this is when again everything flips everything reciprocates so you then get into time being three dimensions and space having one dimension okay again this is very these are very abstract Concepts and it&#x27;s very difficult to kind of piece your mind around at first first but as you kind of start scrubbing your brain of all the false conventional ideologies of uh mainstream science these days and you know start to piece all this together and research more into it it kind it begins to make sense so when you&#x27;re in the cosmic sector space is What flows and time is what moves okay so what I mean the best example I could offer you right now um that I can make an analogy with is consciousness our our metaphysical reality sometimes I think of it this way the material sector is your physical reality the cosmic sector is your metaphysical reality what is in the Met metaphysical reality right now your thoughts Consciousness so Consciousness essentially moves in three dimensions you can think of the past you can think of now you can think of the future time is a moving moving constant when it comes to your thought processes space is What flows okay so uh and again this is very difficult to kind of piece together but when you&#x27;re when you&#x27;re thinking thoughts it&#x27;s the space that&#x27;s flowing and the time that&#x27;s moving and when it comes to for instance time travel this is um how this whole process kind of works you get your object whether it be a craft or a person or whatnot you get the material that they&#x27;re made up of to move faster than the speed of light which is not that difficult I&#x27;ll get to that in SEC but once they do once they start moving at faster than unit speed or faster than the speed of light um space begins you could say space begins flowing and they can then move either forward backward or essentially at a different point in um space at the present time so this is how for instance when you look into like the Philadelphia Experiment right when they took the giant boat they created an electromagnetic field around it and they Tred to uh jump that ship in time it gets very freaking difficult because with space continuously flowing if you&#x27;re trying to move in time you have to be very precise at the space that you&#x27;re going to pop out at or you could be in some place completely different and have no idea where you are and you know I won&#x27;t get too far into that because I could talk about like lay lines and Vortex points on the earth and dematerialization and portals and whatnot but wrap your mind around all this right it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty simple you have yin and yang you have time and space you have space time which we&#x27;re in right now and then time space which is faster than the speed of light or that um Cosmic sector so you know space and time same damn thing just two reciprocals of each other and then we get into gravity and radiation and gravity and radiation are are reciprocals of each other as well so gravity can be thought of as an inward motion with radiation being the outward motion so I have here what&#x27;s called a Taurus and this is a tus is the natural shape of energy flow in the universe when you look at radiation Fields this is how uh this is how they move so how electromagnetic radiation moves how motion essentially how motion moves for a double or a repetitive statement there is that we have the middle of the Taurus which is the uh Singularity point and we have the inward Force compressing into that Singularity and then the energy or the movement is coming out of it and expanding again compression and expansion yin and yang that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called the reciprocal systems theory and it&#x27;s so freaking beautiful but simple at the same time so complex but so simple at the same time so gravity is inward motion gravity is that compression of force that&#x27;s moving into everything to create it so gravity is literally the creating Force that&#x27;s the force that&#x27;s going into everything at every single point and creating it radiation is the energy that&#x27;s emitting from it now for instance I have a the example I was going to use for this is a you know you could say a UFO or some man-made anti-gravity vehicle and I&#x27;ll explain this so how they essentially make these craft anti-gravity is with the use of rotating electromagnetic fields so like I said up here when um it&#x27;s actually not that tough to get matter moving past the speed of light and that&#x27;s because is like the example I used earlier we&#x27;re all already moving all the time we&#x27;re moving on Earth it&#x27;s moving around the star that our star is moving around another star so everything at all times is already pretty darn close to the speed of light so it doesn&#x27;t take that much to move you and I and craft and things like that past the point of speed of light it&#x27;s pretty easy to do all you have to do is uh rotate electromagnetic fields rotate energy around yourself and that&#x27;ll get the particles within you then moving past unit speed so for instance this triangle craft that I have drawn here what they do is they rotate electromagnetic fields you know however they do that whether they use um you know rotating counter rotating water counter rotating Mercury um and whatever they need to do to create that uh plasmic field around the craft so they rotate these electromagnetic fields it moves the craft or you know whatever is within that area that&#x27;re rotating into the material sector and it counteracts gravity so once they move this craft and whatever is inside of it into that material sector these reciprocals also flip so gravity then becomes that outward Force thus anti- anti-gravity it&#x27;s not really anti-gravity you&#x27;re just flipping it you&#x27;re you&#x27;re uh making gravity um you&#x27;re making gravity that outward push instead of an inward motion and then radiation becomes um the inward so they just flip so that&#x27;s you know use some counter rotating electromagnetic fields and then you can make gravity flip and then that&#x27;s why whenever a craft begins to go into the material sector it looks like light it looks like just a big glowing thing is because light is being created and emanating from it when they&#x27;re rotating those electromagnetic fields and bringing everything past the speed of light within those fields so again it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really I mean it sounds way freaking out there but once you delve into this physics it makes a whole lot of freaking sense you just have to think of it with your right brain you know we&#x27;ve been so conditioned to be left brain thinkers for so long in our Educational Systems that um it&#x27;s still very tough for us to think of these abstract Concepts which is why I say there&#x27;s a lot of unlearning we need to do and then relearning back upon that with right brain learning instead of uh left brain so I invite you guys to look into dyb larsson&#x27;s physics a little bit more I hope the way I explained it wasn&#x27;t completely over your head but I&#x27;m doing my best to um teach this as much as I learn it so I&#x27;m going to get better at learning these Concepts I&#x27;ll get better at teaching these Concepts um but I feel personally that this this physical Theory here is one of the most important for us to learn if you really want to understand you know how the new physics or the new science of the future is going to be I think that you know once we once it becomes a mass effect of people realizing that all the most of the science that we&#x27;ve been taught is completely BS this is going to be one of the theories that replaces that so you know get on the get on the train now of learning new physics and new science and I&#x27;m trying to understand it all so I can be one of the ones that teaches it in the future which I think would be pretty cool but um yeah you know check into dob lawon check into these reciprocal system physics I&#x27;m going to link down below a couple neat PDFs and websites you can check it out with and uh keep checking back for these videos because I&#x27;m only I&#x27;m going to get better and more congruent with teaching all this to you guys so done w [Music]</p>
