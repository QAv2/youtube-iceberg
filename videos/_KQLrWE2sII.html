            <p>materialists love to throw rocks at idealists both figuratively and if given the chance literally if Consciousness creates reality they argue then why does a rock remain a rock whether you believe in it or not a fair question a rock is only a rock because your mind has trained itself to see it that way before humans existed there were no rocks there was just an amorphous mass of vibrating ATS utterly indifferent to labels before Sant zupi would become a writer he was an aviator in the French Air Force and so one day he was tasked with flying mail from France to South America a journey that at the time was very very dangerous by an unfortunate Twist of events his plane went down in the Sahara Desert he was stranded without water in one of the most inhospitable places on Earth as Sant exupery wandered through the sand dunes he had what can only be described as a profound Vision an interaction that seemed more like a dream a young boy who appeared to be not of this world approached him the boy spoke to him about the nature of Consciousness and the importance of the invisible as Sant zuper later mused it was in fact the vision of a little prince though the story had not yet been written and the boy had not yet come to life on paper through this surreal ordeal s zup&#x27;s perspective shifted from a desperate battle against the elements to something far more profound an intimate dialogue with life itself he stumbled into a revelation seeing existence not as a cruel test but as a strange wondrous riddle next day he saw bedan Caravan and this time it was not only a vision later santic superi remembered seeing the Caravan as an act of imagining a desire of life into reality Consciousness doesn&#x27;t need a brain to exist you see it in the way a flower blooms toward the Sun how a river is carving its path through mountains in a way everything is constantly aware of its environment adapting and adjusting responding and reacting we have to become free from the limiting idea that Consciousness is only human or that it&#x27;s confined to our minds it&#x27;s not about whether things have a mind of their own but that everything from the smallest grain of sand to the largest mountain is participating in the same vast interconnected awareness the rock is a habit reality is a habit your entire experience of life is an accumulation of assumptions so deeply ingrained that you forget you made them in the first place the world is not made of things the world is made of stories and stories are made of perception if if enough people believe in a thing it takes shape Nations currencies Traditions laws all mental constructs made so solid by Collective Agreement that we forget they are not tangible objects they are spells cast by Consciousness in jordano Bruno&#x27;s cosmology reality was not a static thing but a vast infinite living mind for Bruno the universe was essentially a giant mind field where thoughts interacted to shape reality Consciousness isn&#x27;t some ghostly spectator hovering over reality it&#x27;s the ink in the pen rather than creating reality as isolated experiences Consciousness simultaneously creates and is created your mind resonates with others Minds around you like nodes in a cosmic thought Network the universe constantly reconfigures itself based on the mental States and thoughts of its conscious inhabitants creating not only personal real ities but our Collective worlds Thomas Nagel in his famous essay what is it like to be a bat argued that Consciousness includes a subjective aspect the qualia or in other words what it is like experience according to Nagal there&#x27;s an inherent limitation to human understanding when it comes to Consciousness even if we understand the physical processes of the brain we can never fully know the subjective experience of other creatures like a kabat because Consciousness is not reducible to objective facts Consciousness is what makes the Mind Body problem really intractable it is the most puzzling feature of the universe qualia is the subjective experience of things the taste of a fruit the sound of a bird singing the color of the sky all these are elements of the perceptual field created by Consciousness what we often forget is that these are not external objects but the experiences created by the Mind Consciousness filters and interprets sensory data to produce a coherent reality we are not passive observers we are active participants in the construction of our experience of the world the reality that you perceive is not a neutral reflection of the world it is shaped by the Mind therefore Consciousness is the architect of reality not merely its Observer take Jon of Arc a teenage girl claiming to hear voices from Celestial beings convinced an army of hardened Warriors to follow her into battle the question isn&#x27;t whether the voices were real it&#x27;s whether reality ever had a choice but to obey them if belief is the engine of reality then Joan didn&#x27;t hallucinate she created but to actually see in the depth of Consciousness rather than seeing it as something distinct from the physical world we ought to think of it as Inseparable from reality itself neuroscientist Carl pribram worked many years on a theory that the mind is a hologram think of a hologram every part of it contains the whole image in the same way every part of your brain holds a blueprint of the entire universe so Consciousness isn&#x27;t confined to a single location in your brain it&#x27;s distributed all-encompassing and constantly interacting with the larger reality around you this means that the world isn&#x27;t something outside of you waiting to be perceived the universe and your Consciousness are intertwined in a continuous loop each shaping and reshaping the other there is no such thing as a self in the world and there is no such thing as Consciousness in the world either the self is is a story and Consciousness is the stage upon which it plays out what we call you is simply an experience arising within this vast interconnected field of awareness and what we call Consciousness is simply the backdrop against which all experiences unfold in essence there is no isolated self and no contained Consciousness ancient philosophers have flirted with the idea that the self and Consciousness are not singular separate entities the vidic tradition in Hinduism suggests that the self or Atman is ultimately identical with Brahman the universal Consciousness that permeates all things there is no individual self outside of this larger Consciousness it&#x27;s an illusion a reflection of the whole in the talmud sacred Jewish text Raba yahoshua Ben Levi explains that every individual should see themselves as as if the entire world was created for them the world was created for you he says this is an intriguing almost paradoxical statement it suggests that the entire world with all of its complexity and vastness has been created for the sake of one individual&#x27;s Consciousness this is not a statement of selfishness but rather one that emphasizes the personal relationship each individual has with the universe many who stumble or trip spectacularly into deep Spiritual Awakening report an unsettling realization they are alone in the world not in a conventional social sense but in a way that suggests that their Consciousness is the only certainty Mystics and philosophers throughout history have Circle this understanding like moths around the flame they all have encountered this Eerie yet liberating understanding that the world in a strange way is themselves when one peels back the layers of conditioning the realization Dawn there is no external reality independent of perception this is why many who awaken describe a sensation of being utterly alone not in despair but in the recognition that there is no other only Consciousness dreaming itself into form the world was created for you yet you are but dust and Ashes this contradiction is Central to Human Experience we are both insignificant specks of dust in the cosmos and yet the center of reality from our own vantage point a mystical interpretation suggests that reality itself is projected through each observer&#x27;s Consciousness meaning the world literally exists for you but also for everyone else before you even had the thought to watch this video re ity was already conspiring not in the paranoid shadowy sense of government&#x27;s Whispering behind closed doors but in the far more Insidious Cosmic sense a Grand Illusion assembling itself around your awareness so is this good news or bad news the great Bard Shakespeare who may have been more of a magician than a playwright gave us Hamlet muttering to himself there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so a perfect distillation of Consciousness shaping reality that wretched breakup or that job rejection are nothing but interpretations painted and repainted by the brush of Your Mind through deep states of awareness and an Altered States Of Consciousness we might access these other Realms and consciously shift timelines or dimensions of existence this world is like a corridor before the world to come a linal space where one refines the their soul before stepping into the real reality this aligns with so many esoteric Traditions which suggest that physical reality is merely a school for Consciousness an initiation rather than an end in itself Consciousness does not end with physical existence this world is merely a threshold a preparatory state but if reality is consciousness-based what is this world to come the cabalists speak of alamaba the world to come not as a distant afterlife but as a condition of perception the more one aligns with truth the more the next World becomes visible even here the world to come is not a different world but a deeper vision of this one Consciousness is the thread that runs through it all the corridor the world to come the illusion of separation and the unveiling of what was always there show me your original face before you were born asks the old story and what is this original face if not Consciousness itself [Music]</p>
