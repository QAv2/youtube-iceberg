            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In 1901, Nicola Tesla claimed he built a machine that could pull limitless energy straight from the air. He called it the radiant energy receiver. Witnesses said it powered a small city block without a single drop of fuel. But when Tesla tried to reveal it to the world, his lab mysteriously burned down, and the investors vanished overnight. Soon after, government agents seized all of his notes, calling them a matter of national security.</p>
<p>To this day, the original blueprint for that machine has never been found. Was it destroyed or locked away forever to protect big energy companies? What do you think? Scientific miracle or hidden truth?</p>
