            <p>this next one&#x27;s going to be a little bit weird it&#x27;s you may even pause the video to want to Google this to say this can be right in 1951 the US enacted The Invention secrecy act what is that allows the government to legally classify and keep certain inventions secret if deemed a threat to National economy or security how what could be a threat to National economy if you&#x27;re able to figure something out that&#x27;s 220 mil per gallon you think it affects the oil industry a little bit maybe inventions under a secrecy order cannot be discussed exported or sold outside of military channels violations of secrecy order can result in imprisonment for the inventor over 6,000 patents today are kept by the US government in secret they didn&#x27;t allow the people to go out there and sell it I wonder what those 6,000 patents are a lot of people want to be like when you become a president I want to go to Area 51 a lot of us capitalists want to find out what these 6,000 patents are</p>
