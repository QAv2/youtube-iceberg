            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I&#x27;m Tim Ventura here with Russell Anderson from applied electrogravitics Russell has worked on a number of projects in the last few years including up to a 9ot size beam ship device and his current project a glass Ser effect generator Russell can you hear me okay yeah I can hear you fine Tim go ahead oh okay well why don&#x27;t you tell me a little bit about your beam ships now your largest is 9 feet in size right yeah largest is 9 feet and uh mostly I use the six-footer as my largest one uh the 9-footer is marginal on slight uh with the power supply that the commercial power supply that I uh I use for the most part for testing because it has metering for uh current as well as voltage but mostly I fly the six-footer the nine-footer is just too large to fly indoors and uh Outdoors you have to you have to disassemble oh and uh that sort of thing but each each of the panels yeah it&#x27;s 9 foot okay well and and I remember seeing a video that you&#x27;d sent me a while ago and it&#x27;s actually one of the most impressive videos that I&#x27;ve seen strangely enough you actually had I believe it was the six or 9f footer in your apartment with a Stadium size six the six-footer yeah the sixf footer 9 footer is just too big and and you had have too much delicate stuff and the field just blows out Electronics after a while all solid state electronic starts it&#x27;s not good for them now you you had a you had a fog generator going also and that was the thing that really yeah yeah that that&#x27;s suggest the cheap old radio Shack uh concert fog machine yeah so in in the video that I&#x27;d seen there was the there was the lifter flying or the beam ship flying and then just roiling clouds of smoke just drifting through the apartment I was waiting actually it almost looked like a scene from a movie so but but that it was very it did in in one scene I&#x27;m flying my uh 5 foot beam ship variation five and I&#x27;m shining laser beams on the axis of uh the lifter uh actually beam Shi uh side above and below the wire to detect ion any uh air movement ion movement above or below the wire and there is some there is some but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a very weak down watch it can barely feel it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just amazing oh okay and now um W with these lifters you&#x27;ve also been demonstrating them for groups of people in the fields of Pennsylvania beam ship Tim sorry to interrupt uh beam ships uh lifters oh I&#x27;m sorry implies a totally different methodology I call my craft beam ships well what what would the real difference be between a lifter and a beam ship well a lifter from what I&#x27;ve seen is either a very small test device or a large multicellular device my devices just use a large single cell for efficiency and then inside the cell are structural struts and reinforcements a framework cabin section and a central payload tray on top for experiments yeah you know one of the things that really impressed me about the beam ships and I should apologize if I get that wrong from time to time but the the thing don&#x27;t apologize the thing I thought was was highly impressive about those is that when the rest of the world was working with devices maybe three 3 and 1/2 ft on each side you were busy with a 9f footer that you can actually disassemble store in your car and then assemble for testing you know in pretty much any given location so that was that was one of the things that impressed me was just the size when everybody else was working with these smaller devices um right right and once you get above four feet you really can&#x27;t carry them in a car anymore without disassembly and the whole idea is uh you know say you&#x27;re a hobbyist a hobby Enthusiast radio control model airplanes Etc you want to take it down to the field and fly it or out to the Flying Fields and I got that idea from uh seeing uh Flyers fly right down the hill for me Valley Forge flying field and they have these huge uh airplanes some of them scale some of them not and they have the the wings in uh two and three sections sometimes and of course the wing separates from the fuselage with nylon bolts and that sort of thing so and everything&#x27;s all modular but that&#x27;s the only way to transform transport them rather uh but yeah that&#x27;s what the Flyers do and I&#x27;ve been into model aircraft and uh radio control flying for about 32 years well your your new project though which is kind of a a big step away and in some ways kind of return home because you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve been a Ser fan for a long time is a glass scg right could you tell me a little bit about GLG I&#x27;ve been a Ser fan uh since I first uh heard about his work in late 1986 got the anti-gravity handbook that&#x27;s compiled by David Hatcher Chris and uh I was like wait a minute anti-gravity has been done already sir Sur effect what is this device so I just started looking up articles and uh went right to the bibliography of that book and just started ordering papers and going to the library and and uh the internet really wasn&#x27;t up at that time but I just called information from everywhere I ordered uh books papers I went to the library and Xerox stuff and uh I started to learn oh okay and uh went to Rex research and got some important papers and then finally got information right from the source in 90 I guess early 90s 93 well had the book him by John Thomas for for the for the glass SG I I that&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ve never seen a photo of but can you describe it a little bit and and what you expect to have in terms of in terms of results once you fire it up yeah well the glass scg is simply a permanent magnet motor and uh that Motors itself it&#x27;s uh very similar to other permanent magnet motors that I&#x27;ve seen uh including the manado motor the Howard Johnson&#x27;s patent for his permanent magnet motor uh there&#x27;s another motor out that I also built that having a little trouble running but I have to switch Magnus on I call the MX loo uh permanent magnet motor uh but basically it&#x27;s a glass or plexiglass disc that has a hole in the center and uh it rides on a shaft and a bearing and then it has all these disc magnets uh like eight of them mounted uh about uh 3/4 of the way into to the center of the disc and then it had has an arm either one or two with the dis magnet mounted on the end of the arm and there&#x27;s a spring uh it&#x27;s kind of soft tension spring that is able to pull the arm back up and on the disc there are cams and they can be made out of anything really and they just basically have a point where they rise up and it pushes the arm down just at the edge of a passing magnet which of course the repulsion causes the magnet to push away and then the whole disc pushes away then just after that point the uh spring pulls the arm back up then another magnet comes by the process is repeated and so on and so on and so on um it&#x27;s a little tricky but with meticulous placing of the magnets and proper setting up of a cam design it can be done and work quite well uh on S site uh if you join the site there is a section which shows the glass scg in full color I first saw it uh when I first got s book law of the squares book for seral truth tables uh the uh seral technology and uh that has a picture on page actually I&#x27;m looking at it right now I pulled a page out of the book page 407 of that book uh says dream one States uh and there&#x27;s a picture of the GLG that was built in Germany in 1989 oh okay okay and with now with the the glass seg this is only part way on the quester anti-gravity right this is a just a power device and a larger verion this is just a device to show that you can get continuous rotation simply from magnetic repulsion and the device works by mag simple magnetic repulsion not attraction simply repulsion oh so so this device itself probably won&#x27;t lift off but a larger version with maybe no this this device like the domestic scg if you mount smaller magnets on the periphery of the rotor and have a coil or coils mounted on say various places around the edge of the disc you can generate free Power it&#x27;s uh just the same thing you would do as if you dipped a Paddle Wheel in a stream oh okay as long as long as that stream is running you&#x27;re going to get free electrical energy if you hook that Paddle Wheel up to a Dynamo you could think of the constant Flows In magnetic fields has a similar kind of river that you can if you&#x27;re smart about it if you&#x27;re a little genius you can tap that the same way but it&#x27;s a little tricky and a lot of people just give up but I have a book by Paul monus on permanent magnet motors and it shows how to set up permanent magnet motor generators and it&#x27;s really you know this technology is real eye opener some people say well you can&#x27;t get work from permanent magnets because the force cancels out I say no I disagree if you take two ordinary ring magnets and have one on a pencil and put them on a pencil shaft put another one with a light polarity down on it those magnets won&#x27;t meet the other magnets getting pushed up and just hangs there just hovers there doing work basically because it&#x27;s working against gravity it&#x27;s not being pulled down by gravity it&#x27;s just hovering there the only thing holding in place is a pencil so you are really getting work from those magnets funny thing about magnets the force of magnetism and the force of gravitation are very very very similar where you can have uh in fact tamper py knob has that gravity beam where you can either have a beam that attracts or a beam that repels matter uh they did experiments where they levitated a frog in magnetic fields and that sort of thing so really what uh gravitation is from all my study are converging ether currents uh magnetic fields are simply ether currents also uh really that&#x27;s what you have in the basic final analysis is a curvature of SpaceTime or The Ether currents either of those analogies you could make work mathematically yeah I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m tending more towards uh since the last 15 years toward the ether Theory which was I think discarded prematurely but if you look in some more research Einstein is quoted as saying there are and I quote directly from Einstein there are weighty arguments to The Ether Theory in fact the harmonics of general relativity could not exist without The Ether said relativity without ether is Unthinkable unquote and that&#x27;s Einstein who a lot of people rever oh definitely definitely yeah but he also said if one problem is is found with either special or general relativity you must discard the whole structure you cannot you know make tiny little adjustments the structure will not stand the house of cards will fall this is a quote directly from the man so I think people you know don&#x27;t do enough research and uncover those quotes and uncover you know certain little things that lead us to believe that there&#x27;s more out there than than we&#x27;re being taught and in fact whatever science can&#x27;t explain can be explained you just have to rework the theory and a lot of people including scientists are just too intellectually lazy the the job seems you know too you know daunting too Monumental but it&#x27;s not we just have to go about it that&#x27;s the only way we&#x27;re going to advance and we need to advance right now and I think we are yeah you&#x27;ve definitely done you&#x27;ve definitely done a lot of work in terms of demonstrations for the public and also in terms of hobbyist kits and I think both of those things kind of help the popular Consciousness to to realize that these these devices are out there this technology is on its way into the mainstream but um now how would you say your hobby business is coming along because I know that you were selling beam ships for a while as kids yes I&#x27;m selling them uh it&#x27;s a little slow right now I just have to concentrate on more advertising more awareness uh more print advertising more uh website advertising and I have to update my website get it more professional looking but the kits are out there the power supplies are here I&#x27;ve got them ready to sell and you know imagine you know taking a 4 foot UFO to science class or science fair I helped three Dearborn Michigan high school students win the science fair with my beamship last year 2003 DET T Metro science fair with beam ship variation one yeah that was the Gibbs class wasn&#x27;t it from the yeah Russ Gibbs yeah yeah I met him he&#x27;s a a great guy and he uh really you know does great things with those kids and helps motivate them to do really incredible things and you know that&#x27;s what I was trying to do and so now I can say that beam ship is an award-winning design oh definitely well and in in addition to selling the kits um oh I guess I I should probably ask what the price is on those just just to get it on record um do you have any kind of price range yeah price range you can get a kit and power supply for around 200 250 that sort of thing um I mean you can get the price on the web uh which is a bit more for the combo kit but if you call me on my uh my cell phone number which is also my business line you can get a better price than what you see on the web so give me a call don&#x27;t hesitate I&#x27;ll answer any questions you have about this and similar Technologies oh well I should probably probably get a copy of your number then uh yeah my number is 484 2551 072 okay okay and yeah and uh and also the website is triple W.P l i d e l e c t r o g r a v i t i cs.com or applied electrod gravitics dcom and I was just starting getting this research in &#x27; 87 um my dad uh who&#x27;s a very learned man is an orthopedic surgeon retired sent me a book a college textbook called applied electromagnetics and uh most of the math in there I I sorry to say is quite Beyond me I&#x27;m not a mathematician I&#x27;m a theoretician and Builder but uh I said well you know we&#x27;re doing electrical Vidics I&#x27;m doing electric Vidics but I&#x27;m applying it I&#x27;m not just theorizing I&#x27;m applying it to model aircraft I think the model aircraft people are the the ones to approach first with this technology number one it&#x27;s a way of quote unquote sneaking it through the back door before anybody can you know shut it down not like I think anybody&#x27;s going to shut it down I think we need we live in a new enlightened age in this 21st century um but also that the model airplane people are the first to snap up any new or perceive new and uh revolutionary technology whatever that might be because that&#x27;s the nature of uh model aircraft and the full-size aircraft industry uh I think the model aircraft industry it&#x27;s a lot less money involved so things tend to be snapped up quicker fact the first uh aircraft were model aircraft before man flight took uh took over well have you uh have you made any progress or or have you given any thought to um moving towards selling the pzo electric onboard power supplies because I know that a lot of people one of the complaints about about beam ships and lifters in the past has been that you have to run wires out to them while they&#x27;re flying and right well now we know exactly how much with the power to weight ratio we&#x27;re getting right now about one watt per gram or slightly under with the p Electric power supply running at 12 volts uh actually the input power 12 volts at uh 1 milliamp or slightly over one milliamp um we need 200 KV at 1 milliamp or 200 watts of electrical energy continuous well and and that&#x27;s not bad at all that&#x27;s not bad that that&#x27;s no no no that&#x27;s not bad at all and that&#x27;s only because our beam ships are so efficient we use a large spark gap so there&#x27;s more power being uh being used by the ship if the if the Gap was smaller you&#x27;d have number one more ion wind and number two you&#x27;d have less electrogravitic thrust which is uh you know kind of knocks the ion wind Theory out of the uh the lifter and beam ship argument if uh if ion wind was responsible it might raise the spark gap uh and get less iron wind there should be less thrust instead there&#x27;s more thrust and less power consumption according to my meters on my commercial Supply well and and I that go ahead oh I I&#x27;m sorry in in comparison to my lifters I can definitely tell you that um with the additional weight of your struts and the struts are just there as low bearing members they&#x27;re not actually supporting weight like the the actual lifting cells are uh you&#x27;re able to lift um considerably more payload I you know my my largest pay load has been a pound but I&#x27;m using a lot more power than you are and I&#x27;m also dissipating a lot more energy through the lifter so you&#x27;re able to use one exactly yeah a lot of power is being wasted that would otherwise be used for propulsion and even more payload capacity if we want to if we want to eventually have onboard power that&#x27;s the direction we have to go obviously I mean great we can lift a lot of stuff with a lot of electrical energy but we know that I mean basically you could think of sir&#x27;s uh uh generator flying generator as a big lifter yeah definitely the power is the power is immense immense with that thing uh I mean you know we&#x27;re talking 10^ the 12 volts at 1.5 milliamps that&#x27;s the uh nominal flight voltage I think of that much electrical energy in a small space you&#x27;re going to bend the heck out of SpaceTime and of course that&#x27;s what gravitation is so with that craft I mean they had it uh they had uh generators and craft uh that were tied down with Moorings that were had tins that were supposed to hold 16 tons they failed every type of moing device has failed oh okay you have it in inside your house it will you know punch through the roof until it gets out and then the house is no longer livable which happened to sir&#x27;s landlady&#x27;s uh first land lady&#x27;s house yeah hit with the neighbors of course I I&#x27;m familiar with that story ology is is you know weight is not a factor when you&#x27;re talking about that much uh electrical energy in one space and the unique configuration of it is the geometry of the field is you&#x27;re producing a secondary gravitational field where the Earth Fields a primary field uh just like German research you&#x27;re producing a secondary gravitational field and that will basically you know the Earth repels a vehicle at that point and this is what sir says you&#x27;re not lifting against uh the Earth where which is what the beam ships of lifters do and producing Universal Force if you flipped the igv or C generator you know upside down it wouldn&#x27;t make any difference the field would still the Earth field would still repel the craft so what they do to keep the craft on the ground is bfield brown fashion they charge up the upper and lower holes which are isolated electrically and they charge up give a positive charge to a lower hole and the upper hole gets a negative simply to hold it on the ground while the scg is still running oh okay it takes takes more energy to hold the thing on the ground than just to let it go shooting off into space this a lot of people don&#x27;t understand the the story that I&#x27;d heard also and and I actually like to use this as my reference for for real anti-gravity as opposed to the smaller scale devices that I&#x27;ve been working with um yes yes that I would consider s real tic gravity what the small scale devices that we work with is simply a unidirectional Force yeah definitely which is which is definitely inertia free and could probably lead to a really nice space drive but ideally we want to shoot for the C drive for obvious reasons well and and you know I like to think of it as real anti-gravity not only does it take off it takes the workbench with it and the sirl device actually did that or at least that&#x27;s what the reports claim uh sirl has been telling stories that his first I think he&#x27;d mentioned it um when he was renting the house was apparently destroyed as the thing flew up through the ceiling yes that was his first land lady&#x27;s house yeah yeah the generator and all attached parts become inertia free at uh flight voltage you know this is this is just an incredible technology and it&#x27;s really going to change a lot of things uh it&#x27;s been said before and I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll just reiterate Electronics was the science of the 20th century electrogravitics and anti-gravity is the science of the 21st century and probably this decade more likely you know early part of the next decade we&#x27;re going to use an electromagnetic Drive such as the seral drive to go to the moon in you know like s said in like 2 minutes go to Mars in like less than an hour or a couple hours probably the nearest star because you know when we&#x27;re talking about electrogravitics we&#x27;re not talking rocketry where you have uh mass diation and the mass keeps building up building up building up building up yeah we have the electronics the electrical field cancels out all inertial mass you still have gravitational Mass but you don&#x27;t have any more inertial mass so in effect you&#x27;re shielded from Mass dilation well shielded just as your craft is shielded from frictional skin heating by the same bow wave actually 64 bow waves from the 64 flight cells at the rim and also the new designs have 64 Rim needles and you know electrical charge escapes very readily from pointed surfaces so you want Electrical uh negative ion ejection from The Rim the generation the generator has a configuration of uh pretty much the Faraday unipolar Dynamo positive at the center highly negative at The Rim well are are you worried at all when you fire the glass SG up are are you worried about the potential consequences especially living in an apartment and presumably doing some testing there are you worried that that it may no no not at all because the power generated by the glass scg depending I mean you can I mean there&#x27;s no power generator if you don&#x27;t have magnets at the rim of the device and coils it&#x27;s just going to rotate there like a pin wheel in the wind you know I I&#x27;ve heard I&#x27;ve heard interestingly one of the reasons that um this actually came up when I talked to John Thomas he said that the thing that actually made the secg take off was sirl was trying to limit it by putting a high resistance on it and apparently at least sir&#x27;s claim is that the high resistance is what made it take off it actually sent the superconducting sent the SG I&#x27;m sorry into a superconducting mode um so so possibly uh it seems like you&#x27;re saying the same thing where if you let it free rotate scg is that unlike a conventional generator when when you load up a conventional generator in other words when you put more load on a conventional generator it&#x27;ll do two things it&#x27;ll get hotter and it&#x27;ll slow down yeah definit is totally different when you put a load on it the more load you put on it the faster it gets and the colder it gets eventually you put enough load on it if it&#x27;s just allowed to pour its power out into the atmosphere that could be considered a load um it&#x27;s going to get really really cold around 4° Kelvin the generator and all parts all parts attached to it become inertia free and the materials that the generator is comprised of lift in this world of of very very cold but neodymium which is the core element the central element of all the plate magnets that&#x27;s the Rings and The Core element of all the rollers becomes a superconductor at that temperature and a lot of weird things happen with superconductor especially rotating superconductors as we know now the minimum speed of the inner rollers is about 200 milph so you can imagine you know the incredible speed of this thing but throughout there&#x27;s no noise no heat no vibration no consumption of oxygen I mean it&#x27;s just you know one could power blocks of houses but you&#x27;d have to make sure you don&#x27;t put too much load on it of course or it&#x27;ll tear free of any moing and you know you lose it forever definitely happen you know one of the things that I thought I I&#x27;ve had this idea for a while that these devices because theg isn&#x27;t the only device that runs cold and it&#x27;s not the only device that that seems to bend space uh I did a correlation study well you have a sweets VTA that&#x27;s Floyd Sparky sweets vacuum triode amplifier and that operates the same way which Tom Bearden was witnessed to these experiments uh where you put a load on it the same thing you put an increasing load on it it gets colder and gets lighter yeah and you know the interesting thing is now that we can correlate these like like I done in my study we can look on the internet and comparing claims uh from a variety of different devices um we can see that these groups of people who had never had access to each other&#x27;s research or at least had very limited access in the past uh not only do the major effects have similarities but a lot of the side effects have similarities and and that&#x27;s really one of the big pluses for the SG um you know I i&#x27; actually written off theg a while ago and came back to it and the reason that I came back to it and had to take another look was really because you know I had seen this correlation study um when I completed that I started to see side effects between these different devices and it was more than just have the same correlations and the same or similar side effects oh yes yeah yes they&#x27;re tapping into uh uh neg entropy the river of an energy the durx SE the fery SE uh The lumeris Ether they used to call it in the 19th century uh this is a a field of energy that&#x27;s fundamentally beyond all the fields of energy use in our everyday lives but yet it&#x27;s fundamentally unknown in our uh science and is not taught in our institutions and that&#x27;s a shame and uh I think that&#x27;s going to change after we uh finish some of the work we&#x27;re going to be finishing later on this year Well Russell I I actually have to wrap things up but I appreciate your time and uh I definitely like to interview you again if if we get the chance um anytime okay say when well have a nice evening yeah you too man thanks again okay bye</p>
