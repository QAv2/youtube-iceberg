            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel where we look at uh esoteric and obscure varieties of theories of everything in general all -encompassing theories that would really benefit your life if you knew about them but they are so far on the margins that you probably don&#x27;t and today is our 275th video on the reciprocal system of theory which was authored by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he died in 1990 after 60 years of working on the reciprocal system about the first half of that time was spent ironing ironing out the uh The Kinks in his mind with the process of induction uh until he uh wrote down his two fundamental postulates uh in basically two sentences and then um once he did that he went through a process of deduction um and he derived an entire theoretical Universe about how the universe operates we wrote some books on chemistry and physics and astronomy and metaphysics and economics uh astrophysics uh and some other subjects and his followers have continued on after his death to move it into even even more fields and we&#x27;re going to be looking at one of those today which is from Dr Bruce Perrette who started studying the reciprocal system I guess back around in the 80s I think Larson was still alive I don&#x27;t believe he ever met Larson but uh he more than anyone except for possibly KV Dr kbk nehru has done more to uh update the reciprocal System since Larson&#x27;s death uh and kind of work out some of the mistakes some of the rough rough patches that Larson Left Behind Larson [Music] was adamant that his theory was correct but he did admit that he the way he applied the theory was subject to error and that those errors would become obvious over time and so that&#x27;s kind of what happened and so Dr perett has come up with something that&#x27;s called rs2 reciprocal system two the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system unfortunately Dr peret also passed away about three and a half years ago and uh so now again we&#x27;re trying to pick up the pieces and move the theory forward um and it&#x27;s being done with very very very little support or on knowledge by anybody that&#x27;s kind of outside of the um kind of original group that was that is aging and um there are very few people that and in fact I&#x27;ve been studying the reciprocal System since about 2001. and I have never met anybody personally who knows anything about it never met a single person who&#x27;s even heard of it before uh there are people out there and I&#x27;ve met them um you know by uh internet I met some and uh I&#x27;ve informed many others but I&#x27;ve never met a person um you know that has learned about it independently you know of me okay now uh the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe that is made entirely of motion not matter not energy but motion and motion for Larson was the relationship between space and time space and time are two components of a fraction that is motion uh so motion is a fraction or a ratio that um contains space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator the sets up a reciprocal relationship between space and time now that whole thing is clouded by basically three caveats that come from his first postulate uh one is that space and time both are coordinate meaning that they both have three or more three or four I would say p says three uh I say four because of Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s tetridial coordinates but um we&#x27;ll say three uh three dimensions XYZ coordinates and spacer time both have their clock aspect meaning that they uh they have a scalar motion emotion that has a magnitude but no particular direction like a clock the clock is always getting later and later and later but really in no particular direction and so that is what Larson calls clock time but then there&#x27;s also clock space which means that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no particular direction which you can Envision using a balloon with dots on it that you blow up you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other the Hub of telescope also observed that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other these are the progression of space or the flow of space clock space and then space and time also only come in discrete units they are quantized there is a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space and if you don&#x27;t have a full unit you don&#x27;t have anything or you don&#x27;t you know you don&#x27;t have that thing so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you don&#x27;t have space and actually if you don&#x27;t have space then you only have time and uh also if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light Larson calls that unit speed and unit speed is the neutral point of this universe of motion and there&#x27;s half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and half of that he calls it the cosmic sector and half of the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light that he calls the material sector and that is the sector that we&#x27;re more familiar with and that is a sector of coordinate space and clock time but if we cross over cross the boundary over into the cosmic sector then the relations of space and time Flip or invert and when we go to the cosmic sector we have coordinate time and clock space and that shows that reciprocal relationship again anytime you cross that boundary you have to invert the space and time relationships and that also uh creates powerful extrapolation procedure because the Legacy scientists know a great deal about the material sector and they know pretty much absolutely nothing about the cosmic sector um Einstein&#x27;s dicta was that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe so he was only concerned with the material sector and and did not know anything about the cosmic sector but uh according to the reciprocal system what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector is exactly the same as what&#x27;s going on in the material sector except that the relations of space and time are inverted once you cross over that boundary um okay now that&#x27;s just kind of a short version of that&#x27;s really the first postulate the second postulate is not as important and paret has had uh issues with it but it says that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute in its geometry is euclidean euclideans like XYZ coordinates but peret says that the universe is actually projective of which euclidean is a small subset okay now um we have been reading this particular article from uh Dr peret Who writes under the pen name of Daniel Phoenix 3 in times where he&#x27;s writing kind of more speculatively and this article is called time and timelines and um this is the fourth episode of that article so if you want to go back to the start uh go back a few um a few episodes on this YouTube channel and this section here is called Project Camelot video Dan burish I have some comments on the Project Camelot Dan burrish video where he is talking about the Orion Cube looking glasses and timelines the Orion Cube was the core of the Montauk chair used to direct temporal experiments okay the other thing I didn&#x27;t say is that Daniel Phoenix 3 uh his pen name is a character who was said to be uh one of the young computer programmers back in the in the early 1980s who was working on the Montauk project which was a government top secret Black Ops time travel project okay so the Montauk chair uh I believe was a uh reverse engineered um capture from some alien craft and they uh used it for their own temporal experiments okay so the Orion Cube was the core of the Montauk chair used to direct temporal experiments the cube is actually the navigation computer from a an SM or saurian men or Spaceman spaceship probably one of the smaller Scout vessels consider that in order for a spaceship to travel faster than light without time dilation it must be able to successfully navigate through coordinate space and coordinate time simultaneously essentially the cube provides a window into both realms for the pilot to navigate with now one point that peret makes that he&#x27;s not making here is that um basically the material sector and the cosmic sector both exist in the same space and time simultaneously but they are out of phase like 90 degrees out of phase so they both are there but you really only can tune in one at a time or I I suppose you can tune in both of them at the same time but they they operate a lot along different lines and they are it&#x27;s like they are um transparent to one another but they um but you have to basically learn how to uh how to understand both of them at the same time um generally our Consciousness only picks up the material sector but we through various trainings especially through dreams we can also inhabit this Cosmic sector also death we can inhabit this Cosmic sector and under and learn uh you know operate along those rules as well okay um essentially the queue provides a window into both realms for the pilot to navigate with what happens with faster than light travel is that as you pass the speed of light um the spatial dimension in the direction of travel shifts into the coordinate time Realm as speed is a reciprocal relation between space and time cross the barrier and you start having a temporal Dimension instead of a spatial one but since time is 3D and not a 1D vector you have to keep the ship going straight in the coordinate time realm which means you need to be able to see the realm to properly navigate it um just trying to read his footnotes here to make sure that um that there&#x27;s nothing that you need to uh know urgently in the footnotes his footnotes are are useful some of them are humorous but they&#x27;re not always you know completely relevant for at least for educational purposes okay um but since 3D time is not not a 1D that is 3D not a 1D Vector you have to keep the ship going straight in the coordinate time realm which means you need to be able to see the realm to properly navigate it this is what the Orion Cube does upon transition to faster than light velocity the volume of the ship has been altered to two spatial dimensions and one temporal Dimension which means that in space it appears as an area not a volume usually a flat disc or saucer shape depending on the faster than light speed it gets flatter the faster it travels beyond the speed of light again the reciprocal relation more time less space and vice versa in time it is cylindrical or jet like like a meteor streaking through the temporal landscape that needs an accurate flight path so it arrives at both the correct location in coordinate space and in coordinate time in the Phoenix 3 project they still had all the bits of the chips nav of the ships navigational system the cube interface and the pilot seat the Mantra the Montauk chair setup described by Preston Nichols Al bilik and others that&#x27;s what we ended up hooking to the IBM mainframes which were essentially a simulation of the responses of the spacecraft though they didn&#x27;t tell us that they knew the ships traveled faster than light so they knew the device could somehow affect time and the project was built upon that principle they were able to fool the navigation system into thinking the craft was accelerating past the speed of light so it would open the temporal navigation window The Vortex even though it remained fixed in space of course that created a few other problems as occasionally happens with simulations versus reality like the Oddball wall disappearing and Strange Behaviors of animals in the vicinity it appears they either had other cubes from other craft or pulled the one from Montauk prior to the abandonment of the project in 1983. I&#x27;d bet they just placed the room full of IBM mainframes with a PC these uh these days probably a lot more computing power than we had back then which was which made the device much more portable from what uh burish related it doesn&#x27;t look like things changed much they&#x27;re probably still using my original chair driver code I wrote for the IBM I don&#x27;t know what they did for the interface as the chair required a person with psychic ability or psiotic ability to use it I&#x27;d guess they reverse engineered some sensors to pick up the general psycho emotional activity in the immediate area to control the projection into coordinate time uh without some kind of pilot it would be random and useless the Looking Glass is not the same technology it has all the properties of the sun disk of moo so I still believe it was reverse engineered from that artifact now probably a lot of you who follow that 17 um I have heard quite a bit about Looking Glass Technology and so this might be relevant to you from um one of the people who claims to have uh have been there um okay now um I assume they disbanded the Looking Glass Technology not for the sake of humanity but because it stopped working the original sun disk according to the Peruvian records of the Elder race made use of the naturally occurring gravitational null nodes also called The Vortex dead spot or in conventional science a wormhole or Einstein rosenbridge this allowed simple access to the coordinate time realm through the use of vibrational control song chant Mantra and instruments but as our conventional technology became more and more based on electromagnetism with the corresponding strong electromagnetic fields of power distribution it literally pushed these nodes off the surface of the planet though they do continue to occur in the upper atmosphere and nearby space without a nearby node to lock onto the looking glasses stopped functioning of course if something were to interfere with the power distribution on a planetary scale then these devices would once again start working regarding the timelines we are still on the Montauk generated timeline which is called tib83 that has just about collapsed The Detour in the temporal landscape is rejoining the original Road along with the time lateral imposed by the confederation many years ago when both of the those routes terminate which should be by the end of this year and he was writing back in I think 2012 so um but when both of those routes terminate which should be by the end of this year we will be back on the natural timeline okay just looking over these footnotes again um this confederation he also calls them the Divine Council or the andromedan council in other words we&#x27;ll be walking on the road to where evolution is supposed to take us through three-dimensional time a timeline zero t0 timeline one T1 and timeline two T2 are both artificial detours with different groups erecting barricades and Detour signs in the temporal landscape trying to direct the population down these paths the timeline one detour signs are environmental disasters that are designed to increase the global temperature by several degrees this is the new world order&#x27;s preferred route what the timeline is structured to do is to First increase the global temperature through the induction introduction of hydrocarbons into the atmosphere not from flatulent cows but something on a much larger scale say something way out in left field puncturing the Earth&#x27;s crust where it is very thin at the bottom half of the Gulf of Mexico to allow almost Limitless hydrocarbons oil and gas trapped in the asthenosphere to escape into the atmosphere and cause a massive greenhouse effect not that something like that could ever happen right the petrochemicals will raise the gulf temperatures substantially alter the natural course of weather systems in the Northern Hemisphere and raise the global temperature two to three degrees Centigrade which will actually give the Northern Hemisphere a rich growing season for a while at the expense of the southern hemisphere which will be ecologically devastated of course Land There will get really cheap and be bought up by the Big Oil folks how much of Chile and Argentina has bush company bought or bush Corporation but one more accidents in quotes in the northern hemisphere to kick the global temperature up another two degrees and the Northern Hemisphere becomes a wasteland with few residents while the southern hemisphere will flourish of course all the powers that be will be nice and comfortable in their new southern hemisphere Paradise easy solution to get rid of the third world undesirables first then reduce the world population significantly as the bulk of the population is in the northern hemisphere timeline 2 runs into a major storm in the temporal landscape due to the solar transition both Time Zero timeline zero and time one timeline one just catch the edge of the storm timeline two runs right through the middle of it this is when the earth experiences a core flare that people have been interpreting as some kind of Galactic or solar micro Wormhole event it actually has to do with the solar magnitude solar magnetic ionization level not wormholes which will take a significant hit as our solar system crosses the galactic magnetic sheet if you know in the timeline one and timeline two scenarios time traveling humans are present designated p24 p45 and p52 um by burish take a close look both groups are still third density and no longer on Earth this should tell you something about what T1 and T2 are designed to do in the long term to put mankind back into another third density cycle rather than to advance to Fourth density which is the era which is the route of timeline zero okay uh that is the end of that section uh again you know take it for what it&#x27;s worth you may understand some of it you may not uh you might want to look at it a few times um to see if you can grasp it and um the next section is called the realm of coordinate time and we will be tackling that one starting tomorrow but thanks for tuning in today and have a beautiful day</p>
