            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[music] What&#x27;s up humans and welcome to a new sequo. Happy Thursday everybody. So something happened yesterday. I was made aware of a new interview that John Burrough gave on a channel called Saucers and Saints. Um it doesn&#x27;t have many views but to me uh this is a very important interview that John Burroughs just gave.</p>
<p>He is finally rolling out the second book. Uh the first one I already told you guys about. I&#x27;m going to leave a link in the description to it and I&#x27;m going to leave a link in the description to the interview I did with John and Toby Martinez who wrote together the first book. This one uh John Bose I believe he wrote it by himself if I&#x27;m mistaken. I&#x27;m sorry, Toby.</p>
<p>Uh, if you helped him write it, uh, I&#x27;m sorry, but I think he did it by himself. And apparently, there are some news new things that he&#x27;s going to talk about in the book. So, I was made aware of this interview because there&#x27;s some things that he discusses here that I&#x27;d never heard him discuss before. And the the first time that I caught wind of this topic specifically about his DNA and about uh bloodlines that uh people like Dr. Gary Nolan uh Dr.</p>
<p>Keller, Dr. Kit Green are looking for according to John uh was during this interview uh from seven years ago on the World UFO News Network. So, I&#x27;m going to play you that piece of an interview from seven years ago first so I can refresh your memory a little bit and then I&#x27;m going to play you the new stuff where he specifically talks about what Dr. Gary Nolan, Dr. Colm Keller, and Dr.</p>
<p>kid green are actually looking for when they&#x27;re studying experiencers in DNA from people who have had experiences like him like his injuries uh from UAP stuff like that. These doctors have been investigating this and uh I would add Dr. James Lacatsky to the people who are privy to this because of the statement that he made a little while ago on weaponized with George Knap and Jeremy Corbel where he discusses our true potential and how that is really the secret to all of this. I just want to say before before [snorts] I play you this, I think that John is the most pragmatic person that I&#x27;ve listened to in this topic. And all of these people that I mentioned to you, the people that are part of the control disclosure movement, uh the people that are part of age of disclosure for example, they don&#x27;t pay attention to John.</p>
<p>Even though I think he basically is some level of disclosure because he suffered an injury from what seems to be a UAP. He saw lights in the sky. In the new interview, he speaks about uh entering a gravity bubble, a place where spacetime was different. Um he has no memory of the two events where he [snorts] apparently goes into this place and then there was a lot of studies in his uh physiology and his DNA that these doctors ran. To this day, his medical records are still classified.</p>
<p>They haven&#x27;t declassified them. He did get his disability alongside another gentleman who also suffered injuries. If it wasn&#x27;t for Senator John McCain who signed the disability uh that confirms that John Burroughs was injured by a UAP, this would have been buried a long time ago. And something that is very frustrating for John and I get it is that when people try to tell his story, they never tell it like he experienced it. They tell it to fit their own narrative.</p>
<p>Um there was a certain moment where a certain really no well-known journalist uh from this space attempted to get John&#x27;s uh disability records which are held by John right now. And John wanted to tell his story in this big network, but all they wanted was his documents. Didn&#x27;t want him telling his story as he lived it because it doesn&#x27;t fit the narrative that they&#x27;re trying to push. And more importantly, I think it doesn&#x27;t fit the uh actions that they&#x27;re engaging with because this study about people with strange DNA uh bloodlines even I think it&#x27;s being done but in the download and there is a lot of stigma attached to it. The telepathy tapes uh case has a lot of stigma attached to it.</p>
<p>I already uh saw a bunch of comments and my most recent video about the telepathy tapes where people uh outright just dismiss what uh Kai Dickens is saying. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know. I I speak to Kai quite often and I just don&#x27;t see uh her trying to [ __ ] people and also taunting the CIA. Why would she do that? That&#x27;s just stupid. Um, she&#x27;s talking about this because she feels a responsibility to say it out loud.</p>
<p>And I can already see a bunch of deniers talking about this. You can see uh that the stigma is strong. Uh there is obuscation going on because for me this is what they&#x27;re trying to do. Out of all the things that seem like are happening and let&#x27;s be pragmatic like John is, right? because I don&#x27;t know if there are many races of extraterrestrials. I have no idea.</p>
<p>I need to see proof of that. But what seems to be real according to reports that are historical is that people see lights in the sky for thousands of years. Um they&#x27;ve been reported consistently. There are different shapes according to the times. There are sometimes when people just see lights in the ancient world, people saw angels.</p>
<p>People saw the Ezekiel wheel. people saw different different shapes. Um there&#x27;s this really interesting painting from 1561 I think from the Nuremberg event that has a big black triangle and a bunch of other different shapes of objects in the sky that a lot of people apparently saw back then. So there are lights in the sky, black triangles, uh the airship phenomenon from the early 1900s. Um, now we got the orbs, which a lot of people want to say that they&#x27;re satellites, but some of them aren&#x27;t.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the reality of it. There&#x27;s videos of people filming these things that are like erratically moving. They&#x27;re not just slowly moving like satellites do, you know? So, that&#x27;s one. People have seen lights and objects in the sky for millennia. That seems to be the case.</p>
<p>There are a few crashes and contact events and landings that seem to have happened as well. The Zimbabwe case, the Virginia case, those seem to have happened as well. And people report seeing beings. The morphology seems consistent as well. I don&#x27;t know what those gray beings are.</p>
<p>I have no idea. I have no idea if they&#x27;re even real, but people report on them and different accounts from different people from different time uh periods from different parts of the world report a consistent shape. So, what are those grays? What are those beings? Abductions also seem to be real. Um there&#x27;s a lot of reports about abductions and contact experiences and people who see shadow beings as well. those seem to be consistent as well.</p>
<p>So what is going on there? I think that we need to focus on the things that people have reported experiencers and try to investigate that. And whenever you hear stuff like Ashtar Command or the Galactic Federation or or you know the more fantastical stuff, you need to pause a little bit and ask yourself, is this really solid information? And if not, why are they telling it to me in this way? Because they want to offcate. Because they want to confuse you. Uh somewhere in there, there is the truth. There is But there&#x27;s just so much around the truth that it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint.</p>
<p>Other things that seem to be consistent is the people throughout millennia have displayed some sort of abilities uh that deal with precognition, environment manipulation, manifestation in some really extreme cases, levitation, healing, psychokinesis, stuff like that. In the ancient world uh there are people who displayed these characteristics and they were deemed saints because of the uh religious background at the time. Those things sai phenomena also seems to be consistent throughout time. Near-death experiences they are also one of the really strange phenomenons that seem to happen and uh I have one and I don&#x27;t know what that is. I feel like I spoke to something when it happened.</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s a lot of people that have different yet strangely similar experiences when they go through a near-death experience. So, that seems to be uh worth investigating as well. So, when it comes to John, I just want you to listen to what he&#x27;s talking about here and what he probably doesn&#x27;t believe, but it allows him to look at the narrative from the outside because he&#x27;s very objective, you know. So, let me show you the clip. I&#x27;m sorry for the long- winded explaining, but I just want you to like try to remain objective into what we&#x27;re investigating here and not fall for the traps that are constantly there.</p>
<p>And yeah, uh, age of disclosure was really good to get people interested in the topic, but there are so many other things that people need to pay attention to. So, let me show you John and his interview from seven years ago. So, here it is. &gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s some of the issues I have. They they talk about hybrids, right? I mean, people talk about hybrids and okay, &gt;&gt; DNA and there&#x27;s other people that are from somewhere else.</p>
<p>the antenna theory which is I had a a a discussion last night from this Chris Chris Wolfford is the guy that you&#x27;ve had on Chris is a great guy &gt;&gt; talking about this well I said do you understand what this means oh yes I understand it&#x27;s best what&#x27;s best for mankind I don&#x27;t understand that okay we can&#x27;t get along with each other we fight wars on religion money [laughter] you know &gt;&gt; by the way back then Chris had a very different outlook to what he has today I&#x27;ve been speaking to Chris and he now understands what all of these doctors have been doing in the download. And he doesn&#x27;t think uh that this is entirely positive anymore or and he understands that there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that a lot of these people are doing and they&#x27;re not saying they&#x27;re not telling people that they&#x27;re doing them. So keep that in mind &gt;&gt; and all this other stuff. We go to battle all the time over this. It&#x27;s me me.</p>
<p>So now let&#x27;s just say they introduce or give the hint that there is another species out there or something that&#x27;s different. What&#x27;s that going to do? How&#x27;s that going to affect people? Do you know what I mean? How&#x27;s it going to affect the religious people? They claim some of these battles going on internally have to do with these religious people inside the government, the military, and these agencies. So if they start dropping hints out that some of this is real or existed based on these studies, I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s such a smart idea in my opinion. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Especially when you can&#x27;t verify it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, yeah. Just not that I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a subject change, maybe it isn&#x27;t, but you had mentioned something earlier I want to follow up on. Uh you had talked about them providing you with sort of a like a psychic workout program and that type of thing. uh have you done it and what do you if you have uh what are the results? Uh uh do you think it&#x27;s helping you? Is it uh is it improving or is it an interesting exercise? What do you think? &gt;&gt; Well, what I can tell you is this. Okay, the programs they asked me to work on are ancient that there&#x27;s really nothing to follow on most of it.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a little bit out there on a couple people that are that you know go back and have studied this ancient these programs and understand this so you can do some research and have I worked on it a little bit yes and yes you can see some results that&#x27;s best I&#x27;m going to say there is something to there is no doubt there is something to meditation and all this and different things that you can do with the mind I don&#x27;t dispute that at all But again, that&#x27;s another problem. If you don&#x27;t educate people the proper way, in other words, if you don&#x27;t explain it, back it up with um documentation and testing that can be verified, you leave it open to a huge mess, which is what eupfology really is. You&#x27;ve got all this stuff [laughter] going on and you&#x27;ve got hints and pieces and glimpse of what it could be and what it couldn&#x27;t be, but it&#x27;s all open to interpretation and it causes this big fight and and mess that goes on. Now, if they do this the same way with the study and these experiences and everything else, to me, that&#x27;s not a good thing. I don&#x27;t like it and I and I&#x27;m not very comfortable with it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. Understood. Understood. But as far as using a little bit of this uh uh psychic stuff uh yourself, uh just uh um you you feel like there&#x27;s some benefit to it. You&#x27;re enjoying it.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re getting something out of it at least a little bit. &gt;&gt; Um I don&#x27;t know if I enjoy it um or what the benefits are. It&#x27;s I it&#x27;s eyeopening. Let&#x27;s put it to that way. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s eye opening what we&#x27;re capable of.</p>
<p>Now again, let&#x27;s get to that little uh caveat. Does that mean everyone can do it? And there&#x27;s nothing special about any of us. I don&#x27;t know. You know what I mean? If people start researching this and try it, it may be everybody can do this, which means everybody&#x27;s the same, right? The problem I have is it&#x27;s been it kind of hinted at that there are people that have that are different. Do you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That that is something that never goes bodess well with people. You know what I mean? And &gt;&gt; okay. So based on this and this is like the major problem that John had seven years ago.</p>
<p>He expanded on on this and I just want to remind you guys uh what Dr. Dean Raiden said uh when he did that study on DNA and the correlation he found between the inquisition and the absence of the these genes that are indicative of SI abilities. &gt;&gt; And so we have identified a uh genetic sequence on chromosome 7 of of the of DNA which was the opposite of what we thought originally. We originally thought there&#x27;s some special gene that makes people psychic superstars and and we&#x27;re going to we&#x27;ll find what that is. And so we got people who are psychic from psychic families and controls who are not psychic from non-sychic families and did a a standard case control study which is which is what you do with genetics.</p>
<p>So we found this difference between the two but the difference was that uh it looks like most people who are uh quote average normal average people they have capacity for psychic ability. It&#x27;s these other people uh still a pretty large proportion of the population we think maybe 40% we don&#x27;t know exactly uh who don&#x27;t have this particular gene and by not having it their capacity for having these kinds of experiences is much much lower than the average person. So, this is kind of backwards because we&#x27;re we&#x27;re basically saying it looks like everyone can have these experiences except this group of maybe 40% who end up being extremely skeptical because it&#x27;s not part of their experience and they don&#x27;t know how to make it part of their experience. Uh, and so one of the people working with us is a uh specialist in sociogenetics, which is a discipline I didn&#x27;t even know existed until he started working with us. and and what it&#x27;s about is looking at the genes of a population and how that uh orients a population towards certain kinds of beliefs and certain predilictions.</p>
<p>So he did this analysis and found a very strong correlation between uh the and this is a negative cor correlation. We were originally saying, well, maybe the Druids have, you know, that portion of of Northern Scotland or Ireland, maybe they have more psychic ability because they have legends about such things. We found the opposite. We found a place that has a deficit of people with psychic talent. And from a socioeconomic or sociohistorical perspective, it turns out to be Christianity.</p>
<p>So we&#x27;re thinking this is Holy Roman Empire plus or minus a couple of countries over time. There&#x27;s a deficit of this particular genotype basically. &gt;&gt; So you mean the geographic birthplace of Christianity. You don&#x27;t mean Christians around the world in general. &gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like the the the birthplace and then high density is going to be near that birthplace.</p>
<p>So we&#x27;re talking about probably Italy, Spain, a few countries around there which are still heavily Catholic. there&#x27;s a deficit of this gene of this sequence. And so in thinking about that, we&#x27;re trying to to figure out to get rid of a gene in a population first of all takes many generations, but also something has to happen. I mean, evolution does things because there&#x27;s a need. The need could be that the environment changes or could be uh endless wars.</p>
<p>It could be all kinds of things. In this case, what all we could come up with as a speculation is the Inquisition. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going to say that people were persecuted for displaying anything like this. They were accused of witchcraft and so on &gt;&gt; and so those genes were not passed along. &gt;&gt; Interesting.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, so that this is the speculation at this point except that the correlation is pretty strong. &gt;&gt; So, Dr. Dean Raiden uh did this and then he recently spoke about uh interacting with Dr. Gary Nolan and talking about this. Do you follow? So, it seems like Dr.</p>
<p>Gary Nolan is deeply involved in investigating uh whatever is happening to people&#x27;s DNA and how they may have these abilities. But John expands on this a little bit more on the recent interview that I told you guys about that I&#x27;m going to play for you right now. So, this is from Saucers and Saints. &gt;&gt; I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s followed me. What? Because what Nolan and and Green were interested in, this is this is how they laid it on the line.</p>
<p>They feel that certain people and bloodlines trace back in time &gt;&gt; that may deal with what we&#x27;re encountering &gt;&gt; and then they feel the big question was when you have an encounter is it because of that or when you do does it modify you and they never were clear on where I stood. Okay. They they they got my stuff to when they did the VA heart surgery, I found out. Then he came back later and got a a a saliva sample. He wanted to put me in that 100 person program.</p>
<p>And then he did some DNA testing on myself and my son, but they um they feel that I think and again I don&#x27;t like how they talk about my case because no one&#x27;s been disingenuous. He did come and try to get my DNA, but I never gave it to him. They got it through my surgery. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And then I gave it to Green through to put off.</p>
<p>Right. &gt;&gt; But the thing is is that when I went to Skinwalker, we had stuff happen out there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When I lived in Sedona, I went out where and Did you ever go up to Bradaw Ranch? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Out in that area is where all the stuff happens, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I went out there on two different occasions and a bunch of stuff happened both nights.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Like what? What type of stuff? &gt;&gt; Stuff was in the sky everywhere, flying around, coming down at us. Um, and Skinwalker, it it there was freaking out. The two guys that were with me, it was coming down. So, the one guy with me, Toby Martinez, thinks that I I&#x27;m a magnet. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what I was driving at was the fact that it seems like it&#x27;s uh um you&#x27;re you&#x27;re picked somehow, whether it&#x27;s your bloodline or something, but it&#x27;s not &gt;&gt; Well, if you go off of what those guys say, it&#x27;s a bloodline. &gt;&gt; Okay. And &gt;&gt; it goes back back to ancient times. &gt;&gt; And as a point of clarification, just for the viewers, uh Nolan did uh claim that he was he got a he got a sample of your blood, but he actually got it through the VA, right? &gt;&gt; Well, well, yeah, cuz here&#x27;s how it went. Him and Keller Green met with my attorney and I um in Sedona, and he tried to sell me on doing an MRI on the brain and DNA.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#x27;t do the DNA because I said, &quot;How I said, how are you going to test this?&quot; what are you looking for? He said, &quot;There&#x27;s only two labs in the world that could do it.&quot; Blah, blah. So, let&#x27;s say I just said, &quot;How would I know if what you&#x27;re telling me is true or not?&quot; Anyway, so I I declined the DNA. We we&#x27;re going to talk more about the MRI, but the next thing you know, he called Pat back that evening and sent Keller and Nolan down and met with us in Flagstaff the next day. And I refused. So, they went back.</p>
<p>So, he he brought a labotamist and everything. They were going to take the blood. So, he didn&#x27;t get it. Then when I did the surgery, I found out well there were two things. Alexander told me they did it, but there&#x27;s stuff that I got proof of that there was a DoD doctor following me around everywhere.</p>
<p>They were taking all my tissue, my samples, and he had blood drawn from me that went off site. So that&#x27;s when they got the initial DNA, the blood, the blood and the tissue. They got not only they got blood, but they got tissue, including the valve that was damaged. M &gt;&gt; and then the second time is I gave a saliva sample to green. Now he could say that he got it through green, but I gave it to Green.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t give it to &gt;&gt; to Nola. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Well, let me let me ask you this before for the last part uh here before we move on to what you&#x27;ve been doing and some of your your uh your creativity, which I think is really cool. Um what do you think you stepped into that night in Rendlessham in your mind? time dial time dilation bubble &gt;&gt; and non-human intelligence.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could say that. Here&#x27;s where it gets real sticky, and this is what makes me nervous, too. There clearly is an intelligence. Kondan admits it. This UAP is intelligent.</p>
<p>It does things. And the question is is under a hypnosis I did way back in the early late 80s to try to remember if I can remember what happened when I got into it or close to it. It says that&#x27;s the life form. I don&#x27;t believe it. Look how small it is.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just there though. It It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s calling to us to come to it. We&#x27;ve got to go to it. It&#x27;s telling us to come to it. We can feel it.</p>
<p>Yes. Can you feel it? Yes, I can feel it. We&#x27;ve got to get to it. We&#x27;ve got to get to it. We&#x27;ve got to know what it wants.</p>
<p>It wants us. It wants us. Let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s go.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go. Spread out. We&#x27;re getting into some more woods again. How could it move? How could it? &gt;&gt; And so it clearly is a life form. The question is, is been brought up.</p>
<p>Is it just us from the future, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we evolve to that or is it something else that&#x27;s here? Because if you remember what Bigalow said on 60 Minutes, he said they&#x27;re here. They&#x27;ve been here forever. But he didn&#x27;t say it was biological beings. He just said they&#x27;ve been here. That is clearly, I believe, what he was talking about.</p>
<p>That is clearly what they&#x27;ve been studying. If you go back to Green and Mirage, man, he said that what we&#x27;ve been fed is not real. What what eventually we will find out a lot of what really is taking place and it won&#x27;t be as serious as they&#x27;re coming to eat us or anything like that. But it still goes back to bloodlines. And then then you could go back is there ancient stuff that was came here and was seated and they&#x27;re not 100% their evolution was different than the rest of humanity.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. No. Great. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s all really sticky stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That they will never clarify. &gt;&gt; They always go around the fringes. They drop little hints and stuff, but at the end of the day, there could be a bloodline that was created that can interact with UAPs. And possibly because they wanted to study the brain, it could be that that leads me to wonder if it&#x27;s how we evolve later &gt;&gt; or because the mind we only use 10% about 10% of what we can. So, there&#x27;s a lot of whatifs and these guys aren&#x27;t aren&#x27;t being coming, you know, making it clear on what it actually is or isn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It poses so many questions and I mean, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s mind-blowing. Um, well, let&#x27;s do this. Before we wrap, I want to uh give you a chance to talk a little bit about uh some of the new stuff you&#x27;ve got coming out and your own creativity. The floor is yours. Let us know what you got going on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. I&#x27;ve got a book that just came out. It&#x27;s available. You can order it on Amazon. It&#x27;s called Baracos Obscura Echo Protocol and it&#x27;s called um True Lies.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s part of it Latin. It&#x27;s True Lies. And the it goes into some of what happened to us that I&#x27;ve never talked about because no one would believe me. It was just like when I dealt with Green and those guys. Everything went on behind the scenes and was kept quiet and they said they never were going to go public with it.</p>
<p>Then Green went on live top secret and talked about what my injuries were and everything and said it was real. I was tied to SAP programs and all that. Then they did a Annie Jacobson&#x27;s book where they talked about some of the DNA and stuff. So it was all supposed to be kept quiet. So I never said anything partly because no one probably believe it anyway.</p>
<p>So then it was made public. There&#x27;s even more that went on that still hasn&#x27;t been made public. So I&#x27;ve tied it into this book and we&#x27;ve been doing it. It&#x27;s a 22 chapter book. We&#x27;ve been putting on KGR every week in animation and stuff, but now the book&#x27;s out and it&#x27;s available on on Amazon, but it ties in to the that we&#x27;re being fed a bunch of halftruths.</p>
<p>Things are being left out. We&#x27;re not being told the truth all the time and everything else and including it&#x27;s in people that understand the case will like it. It&#x27;s a 22-part series, but you can read the book. And then shortly, hopefully in early December, I&#x27;m gonna have called Project Rendlesome Crossing the thresholds. And it&#x27;s going to go into everything that&#x27;s happened to me and all the possibilities of the weapons that have been developed are being developed, what&#x27;s going on, the interactions I have with these people, and everything else.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s going to set the record straight because so many times it just gets totally twisted, turned around, and is not factual on what happened. So, it&#x27;s going to be laid out exactly what happened. And I think the hardest thing for people to understand, they just do not understand how far advanced we are and the ramifications of the power that the people that have this technology have over us and what they could do to us. &gt;&gt; That gives me chills. Um, so I just go back to um when Jake Barber talked about Rendlessham and how important this case is to euphology in general because it has everything and it really does.</p>
<p>And I wonder what uh people like Dr. Nolan or Dr. Kid Green would think about John saying this and talking about this and how it feels like there has been a lot of misinformation even from uh some of the people involved in the disclosure movement that they&#x27;re doing it because they have to because whatever they&#x27;re investigating, whatever they&#x27;re looking at has to be in secret according to them for some reason. But it&#x27;s coming out. I think that uh John&#x27;s contribution to this is going to be essential because I know I know his case and I know what he&#x27;s been experiencing and I really do think that when he comes out with the information he has I&#x27;m going to report the [ __ ] out of it first of all and it&#x27;s going to play down uh a lot of the misconceptions that have been taking place in this whole movement and I&#x27;m happy for that because people really have been exper experiencing things, but it&#x27;s not like the science fiction tropes would tell you.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not like a lot of these official narratives would tell you. It&#x27;s a lot weirder than that. And it&#x27;s definitely linked to us and to consciousness not being local. And I hope that we can be more uh upfront with a lot of this stuff. and there to be fair there&#x27;s a lot of people that are like experiencing this since they were children and they already sort of understand uh what&#x27;s going on with them.</p>
<p>It can be a really personal process. You know, I&#x27;m glad that John is talking more now. He gave more details of what apparently Dr. Nolan, Dr. Keller, Dr.</p>
<p>Kit Green are trying to investigate. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve arrived at a conclusion yet, but you can see the work Dr. Gary Nolan is doing, the discovery in the cottipment, other stuff that are probably very secret that he&#x27;s not talking about. You can see where this is going. I think so.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think. And yeah, I know that there&#x27;s a lot of people that want for this to be more science fictiony and want for there to be 40 races of extraterrestrials or uh you know, stuff like that. But I think we need to ground ourselves a little more and try to be more pragmatic like John. That&#x27;s what I think. But let me know what you think.</p>
<p>What do you think about John&#x27;s overall experience with people like Dr. Gary Nolan, Dr. Col Kellaher, Dr. Kid Green? Have they been trying to investigate his DNA because he apparently survived entering one of these bubbles? And what do you think about John&#x27;s fear about being different? What I think in this case is that yeah, there are certain families or bloodlines, you could say, that are more prone to have this interaction with SAI phenomena, but I do think that the majority of us can do it. And I think that Dr.</p>
<p>Dean Raiden&#x27;s study and correlation he found in the Inquisition and it&#x27;s happened in many other cultures uh throughout history that sort of ethnic cleansings have happened and many of those families that are no longer with us had a bigger predisposition to s phenomena and sensibility to cy phenomena. So that&#x27;s why I think not everybody is that way or that&#x27;s why I think not everybody has that sensibility more awakened but I still think that even those people could go through some sort of experience that can trigger that again. I really do. And I think that maybe John differs from me, but that does make you think, why would somebody want to make it like we&#x27;re different? Because you know how race has been a major component of division and conflict throughout history, differences. Why would they want to keep it that way? You guys know why.</p>
<p>But and and I I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the case. I think I really do think that uh everybody has these sensibilities and some of them do more than others. Yeah. Because it&#x27;s I just see it like any other sport as a sports journalist. Some people have more talent than others and some people are not born with a talent but they&#x27;re born with a passion and they develop it and they can get to the very top equally.</p>
<p>Um the best example for this is Messi and Ronaldo. Messi was born with it. Ronaldo probably wasn&#x27;t as much, but they both reached insane levels because Ronaldo gave it his full dedication. Messi also did, but Messi, you can tell he&#x27;s more natural. I think it&#x27;s the same way with um these sigh phenomena and sigh abilities.</p>
<p>And yeah, I I think that these people are investigating those families that have a bigger sensibility, a more acute sensibility towards this phenomenon. One has to wonder what the hell is going on. Why are they being so secretive about it? And what are they really investigating? So many questions. Let me know yours in the comments. Let me know what you think about this in the comments.</p>

<p>You can also become a member of Patreon which I just opened yesterday and it has uh different tiers. So, it&#x27;s a more personal experience on Patreon uh where you can talk to me a little more and I&#x27;m going to be doing constant posts there that I&#x27;m do that I don&#x27;t do anywhere else. I&#x27;m going to give you guys a heads up of what&#x27;s coming. For example, this video I&#x27;m going to do a post about what I&#x27;m doing so you guys can find out the information that I&#x27;m gonna share with everybody and you get you guys can see the final product on YouTube. The YouTube content is not going to change.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to keep doing it the way I&#x27;m doing it. the Patreon. I opened it just so I can do some different things that are not necessarily linked with videos, but I&#x27;m going to be doing posts so I so you guys can have like a different thing and not just the same thing in in both places or you can also support us through KG who are my friends. Uh John is part of KG by the way. And that&#x27;s it for me today on this video, but I&#x27;ll see you guys in the next one.</p>
