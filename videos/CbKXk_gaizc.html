            <p>I&#x27;ve done better than that you&#x27;d think you&#x27;d know his name every time you switch on a light or turn on your radio his contributions are as far-reaching as those of Al Einstein Isaac Newton or even his Nemesis Tom Edison this mysterious tall dark Serbian invented alternating current Wireless communication the Modern Electric Motor basic laser and radar technology x-rays neon robotics remote control and cellular technology and even Star Wars tactical Warfare all all over a 100 years ago yet today who&#x27;s ever heard of Nicola Tesla how could history Overlook such an incredible Legacy during his last moments on Earth he no doubt asked himself the same question lying in a forgotten hotel room alone and penniless now 86 years of age this is where our Story begins on that final night in January 1943 Nicola reflected on his life in near delirium the flashes of light I never had control over the flashes they are so tormenting Unstoppable images would flood his mind accompanied by powerful flashes like countless times before due to a strange lifelong condition of his when the word was spoken to me the image of the object would appear vividly and sometimes I was unable to distinguish whether what I saw was tangible or not this caused me great discomfort and anxiety in the murky light of the hotel room he&#x27;d speak with ghosts from his past Phantoms waiting for him to [Music] succumb he remembered triumphant moments when he was struck with the vision of his world transforming electric motor the same design that&#x27;s used everywhere today like a flash of lightning in an instant the truth was revealed he was so sure of his breakthrough that he felt compelled to share it he sailed for New York City the seat of the modern world soon he&#x27;d become the quintessential American success story transforming himself from a penous immigrant into a legend of his time the glitterati of New York&#x27;s finest would flock to his laboratory to witness the spectacular high voltage demonstrations notables such as Mark Twain John mure Sarah burnhard Stanford white and Teddy Roosevelt and many others attended but one person not present was his ruthless competitor Thomas Edison Nichola would recall the war of the currents AC versus DC power at the time the electrification of the world was a stake alternating currents too damn dangerous he&#x27;s using tens of thousands of volts DC only uses hundreds sure you can see the danger Tesla Tesla Nicola Tesla a man who could never take a joke there was only one kind of power system that could feed cities all over the country that would allow Edison&#x27;s incandescent bulbs to burn brightly and Nicola had it Tom Edison fought against it tooth and nail hell there are no rules here we&#x27;re trying to accomplish something the bitter Edison would even resort to electrocuting stray animals including a rogue elephant to incite public fear of Tesla&#x27;s AC system but Tesla would ultimately triumph over Edison by electrifying the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893 it was a smashing success then he and partner George Westinghouse created the world&#x27;s first hydroelectric system at Niagara Falls it was an incredible gamble at the time and no one was sure it would work except Tesla the man of the hour Nicola was now at the peak of his glory he took to wearing formal clothes and wearing white gloves when starting experiments he was a Mystic who wrote and recited poetry and could speak six languages yet he couldn&#x27;t help his idiosyncrasies people had no idea that he battled hallucinogenic episodes daily I have seen all the air around me filled with tongues of living flame their intensity instead of diminishing increased with time he was also described as a maniac for cleanliness and would avoid handshakes and fought an array of deep-seated phobias and compulsions all repeated Acts or operations I performed had to be theis ible by three and if I missed I felt impelled to do it all over again even if it took hours he learned to control his runaway mind with Supreme discipline Tesla&#x27;s unquenchable fire drove him onward Nicola would soon engage the biggest fish in the pond while undertaking his greatest Venture Warden Cliffe this fantastic structure was the very culmination of Tesla&#x27;s Vision to create a worldwide communication system for sending sound and pictures the primary goal was to beat Marone for the honor of delivering the world&#x27;s first transatlantic Wireless signal by no accident Tesla&#x27;s Grand project was to be financed by the Devil Himself JP Morgan you&#x27;re a strange man indeed Tesla after the papers are signed you may draw upon the house of Morgan but it&#x27;s important that I remain a silent partner you do understand what that means means don&#x27;t you Mr Tesla but Nicola had a secret the system could also Electrify the world Warden Cliffe would provide Limitless free energy everywhere for everybody when JP Morgan found out about this leap of Technology he wouldn&#x27;t tolerate it he knew Tesla could deliver and the banker Overlord couldn&#x27;t put a meter on it a man always has two reasons for doing anything a good reason and the real reason mid construction Morgan would cancel the contract and blackball Tesla th excluding him from any other investor Mr Morgan are you going to leave me in a hole I&#x27;ve made a thousand powerful enemies on your account in a 100 years from now this country would give me much for the first honor of transmitting power without wires Warden Cliffe faltered and Marcone said sent his transatlantic signal Tesla would suffer his second nervous breakdown and never again would he regain his momentum as before but despite his cruel fate Nicholas stayed the course decade after decade would pass and he would bring forth new Fantastic inventions in transportation airflight and even Warfare his death beam as he intended would bring an end to Warfare an inventor to the end all he ever wanted was to uplift the condition of humanity but now in his hotel room time was drawing short he&#x27;d finger newspaper clippings and recall some of the smaller moments of his life his table for one walking the streets of New York haunting Grand Central Station or feeding his many pigeons no one could begin to imag imagine what great secrets this mad scientist kept locked inside his head no one except Jay Ed goua and his gmen they waited patiently for the great man to pass and were ready to take everything that Nicola Left Behind the story is about a man whose powerful ideas live on as much of his work is still classified and used in the most esoteric projects imaginable today Nicola Tesla single-handedly Che changed the world for the benefit of mankind yet has been rewarded with obscurity it&#x27;s time to bring his story out of the shadows and into the light with his last breath Nicola gently smiled let the future tell the truth and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments the present is theirs the future for which I have really worked is mine would they only have listened [Music]</p>
