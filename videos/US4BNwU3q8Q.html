            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>You say you also had uh reports on bodies on alien bodies. &gt;&gt; I had Yeah, that came from uh Walder Reed. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s one of the most popular episodes we ever did, the clips from Kil Corso. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s right. Cuz you did a number of interviews with him and we chose clips of of his testimony from from one set of interviews, but you had a whole another huge interview that the public hasn&#x27;t seen before.</p>
<p>So many of the things that Corso talked about are exactly right at the heart of the questions that people are asking today. &gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s a this is a cross that was left on the floor. The actual picture of it with a chapel. &gt;&gt; Now you had mentioned uh also that uh NSA was picking up uh signals from space. I mean did they &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, they were say they were intelligent fig signals given out by an intelligent source.</p>
<p>They couldn&#x27;t identify the source or break the code though. &gt;&gt; How far back was that? &gt;&gt; Oh, this was in the 50s. &gt;&gt; I was at the White House. &gt;&gt; NSA was picking up signals from space that appeared to be from an intelligent source. &gt;&gt; But did they specifically say it was uh extraterrestrial? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>[Applause] [Music] This is weaponized. I&#x27;m George Nap, hunkered down in the Las Vegas UFO bunker, joined by my friend and colleague Jeremy Corbel, who&#x27;s probably lounging in a luxurious Southern California mansion. Jeremy, how&#x27;s it going? &gt;&gt; Pretty good, man. Trying to get some rest. &gt;&gt; Seems like I just saw you, you know.</p>
<p>Seems like we just saw each other. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right, man. I hear that. Um, we were in Vegas together. And you know what happens when we&#x27;re in Vegas together? &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s not tell anybody about it.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, suspense is kind of building, excitement building right now as we await and anticipate a new public hearing to be held by a congressional committee in early September. Uh, Jeremy, what can you tell our audience about where things stand, how far along the preparations are? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you know, there have been some public announcements about the upcoming congressional hearing and, you know, it&#x27;s confirmed. It is the the 9th. I&#x27;m not saying anything that that&#x27;s not already public.</p>
<p>So September 9th, you&#x27;re going to have a new hearing. It was also confirmed that there&#x27;s at least three confirmed witnesses. Uh and I can say that that is fact. Um you know, there maybe that will be it. Maybe there will be more.</p>
<p>I I think a lot of it is still being kind of finalized and debated. Now, the nature of those witnesses, I I did hear people, you know, make some comments in in public about it. I&#x27;m not exactly sure that&#x27;s going to end up being accurate. Um, this is kind of like a moving target. I know we&#x27;re getting closer.</p>
<p>So, they&#x27;re they&#x27;re kind of making their final decisions, but it&#x27;s going to shape up to be an awesome hearing because everybody they had to select from had something unique to contribute. So, um, yeah, that&#x27;s all I can really say at this time. Just everybody&#x27;s working hard on it and I&#x27;m very optimistic and um, it&#x27;ll happen on the 9th. &gt;&gt; You know, we we both know how UFO world operates. I I think it seems doubtful that anyone in UFO world will be happy no matter who is chosen to testify or what they might say, but I think that uh you know they&#x27;re always going to demand more.</p>
<p>We want to know more and we want to know it now. Understandable. But I think the the hearing in itself is a really big deal. the fact that members of Congress continue to push the ball down the field trying to get to the bottom of the stories that we&#x27;ve all heard for years, that they&#x27;ve heard for years about crash retrievalss and reverse engineering and programs that largely escape oversight uh by Congress carried out in ways that leave even Congress in the dark. So having a hearing to dig into cases, experiences, encounters, uh, glimpses of secret programs or unknown technology are a big deal.</p>
<p>And and even if we don&#x27;t have, you know, an actual technician who&#x27;s personally working on taking apart a flying saucer or who&#x27;s managing the bodies or the biologics, if you want to call them that, the hearing itself is a big deal. Would you agree? &gt;&gt; Yeah. on record. Congressional testimony is is a big deal and it takes a lot for people to be able to do that, especially if they&#x27;re current service members. There&#x27;s extra steps that have to occur, but just anybody going up and and willing to do that.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s an entire process that gets to that point. Um, not just vetting, but also just getting people to that point where they can logistically do that. That there are of course a lot of briefings and hearings that people don&#x27;t get to publicly see. And this is something I&#x27;ve always been fighting against, but there&#x27;s a certain limit to it. You know, people might not ever really find out how much testimony has been given in the classified setting behind closed doors.</p>
<p>I I love it when they when they tell that it&#x27;s been done, but it leaves people unsatisfied. They want to hear it, too. And I guess just some of the information is so crosswired with national security issues that a lot of those are just done, you know, in skips and behind closed doors. And sometimes people in this gift, they&#x27;re not even fully able with their clearances to hear the the whole shebang. So that&#x27;s the dance, man.</p>
<p>What we can get public on historic record. Remember, we&#x27;re coming from a dry spell of over 50 years of not having UFO hearings. So this is a big deal and I am very optimistic. So um yeah, let&#x27;s just see where it goes from there. I I will say the thing that I&#x27;ve been fighting for the most right now is to make sure to have inclusion of at least a whistleblower and to to go with witnesses, right? And and that&#x27;s been an uphill battle.</p>
<p>I I still don&#x27;t know. I still don&#x27;t know where that&#x27;s going to land. You know, a lot of people have been asking, you know, is is Matthew Brown going to testify? Well, Matthew Brown is willing to testify. Um I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s going to be selected or not at this time. That&#x27;s the truth.</p>
<p>But uh he did speak a little bit today. I just got a notification on my ex. I&#x27;ve been encouraging him as well as a lot of other people have. Hey man, a lot of people want to know how you&#x27;re doing. They also want to know a little bit more about what it feels like to be a whistleblower to go through that process.</p>
<p>And then he&#x27;s done it. So he&#x27;s created uh I I guess it&#x27;s a substack. Um he he posted it on his ex account which is son of Abraim and I don&#x27;t abs of the word and he we&#x27;ll put it on the screen or something and then his substack is the same name or the same word plus substack.com. So people should go read that because he talks about what it&#x27;s like to come forward as a UAP whistleblower and I suspect we&#x27;re going to hear a lot more from him as people have been asking for. You you know these days UFO folks, we&#x27;re among them.</p>
<p>We want all the information. People on social media platforms will say every single day, &quot;Come on, whistleblowers, you got to come forward. Tell us what you know. Spill the beans. There&#x27;s no way they would dare to prosecute you.&quot; easy for people to say as they sit at their in their home in their basement typing on a you know word processor or whatever.</p>
<p>Go ahead and risk everything. Risk your life. Easy for them to say. It&#x27;s a different matter for whistleblowers themselves. They got to worry about can I be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Uh I&#x27;m not sure if they would be prosecuted, but they have to think about it. It&#x27;s their ass that could land in prison. Uh unlike the the people at home urging them forward or they got to worry about their livelihoods. They worked in classified programs their whole general careers. Uh that having a security clearance is how they provide for their families.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s out the window. You go before Congress and spill some beans, you&#x27;re not going to work in classified programs ever again. Then then there are all the other things that come along with it. The death threats, uh the people who speak out, people like Dave Grush who get slimed, dirty information about them, uh gets leaked and roughs them up. There are breakins in people&#x27;s homes.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of really bad things, extra legal things that happen to people who try to become whistleblowers or witnesses. So, it&#x27;s really easy to say, &quot;Go ahead and do it. Risk your lives in your career and testify because we want to know.&quot; Well, one of the uh most famous, most highranking whistleblowers of all time is someone that we covered in the early days of weaponized and that I have covered for a couple of decades. And his name is Colonel Phil Corso. Uh he didn&#x27;t have to go through Doppser to get approval as far as I know to get approval for what he revealed.</p>
<p>Uh he didn&#x27;t have to dodge Arrow and its influence and trying to stifle witnesses and try to discredit witnesses in cases. He just let it all out. Uh you had told me that basically that&#x27;s one of the most popular episodes we ever did, the clips from Phil Corso. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s right. because you did a number of interviews with him and we chose clips of of his testimony from from one set of interviews, but you had a whole another huge interview that the public hasn&#x27;t seen before.</p>
<p>And I think it&#x27;s important because he talks about the craft, the bodies that they knew it was extraterrestrial. They talked about the dissemination of the reverse engineering technology in the industry. I mean, all the stuff that people find most fascinating. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re talking about this today, cuz you&#x27;re going to be able to show people a bunch of those clips that have never been out in public. That&#x27;s part of why we do weaponize so we can put out stuff people haven&#x27;t seen before.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s important. &gt;&gt; So many of the things that Corso talked about are exactly right at the heart of the questions that people are asking today. And I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll set the stage for who he was for those who don&#x27;t know. Back in 1997, it was the 50th anniversary of the Roswell crash. Corso released a tell- all book the the day after Roswell bestseller in which he claimed that he&#x27;d been personally involved in handling the Roswell wreckage.</p>
<p>He helped distribute it to private industry and to national labs to see if they could in essence reverse engineer the tech and then duplicate it. Didn&#x27;t tell them it&#x27;s from a UFO crash. He implied, I think, that it was from a Russian vehicle and asked them to see what they could make of it. You know, those same kind of claims are being made today. And my involvement with Colonel Corso started uh 5 years before anyone in UFO world ever heard his name.</p>
<p>There was a journalist named Mark Solder working in Seattle who we knew each other and we had both been covering issues related to prisoners of war that had been left behind in Vietnam. Mark Solder gets in touch with Corso who had made these claims in years in previous years. Not only that America abandoned some of its soldiers in Vietnam, but did the same thing in Korea. He was ridiculed for this. People said he was a liar.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t true. He went before Congress and testified and turned out Colonel Corso was right. Uh even though many people dismissed him as a cook or a liar, they did the same with him on UFO matters. So, as Mark Solder is talking to Corso about PS, Corso just happens to mention his work on UFOs and his familiarity with the Roswell crash, Mark calls me up, puts me in touch with Corso, and we started a conversation that lasted for a couple of years. At one point, as I think I I told you, I had met him in 1992.</p>
<p>At one point, he asked me to write his book, what what became this huge bestseller that came out in 97. and I agreed to do it but was l later uh kind of squeezed out of it by a publisher. Um four years later NIDS gets created the National Institute for Discovery Science, Robert Bigalow&#x27;s UFO uh think tank. In essence, he put together this amazing group of people well-known names in the UFO field and science and technology academics, former intelligence folks, put them together and they were looking for things to do. for a while, couple of months, I was a consultant to them and I came up with the idea, maybe you want to talk to Corso.</p>
<p>And at that point, I hadn&#x27;t talked to him in more than a year. I reached out to him um and saw asked if he&#x27;d be willing to meet a group of people from NIDS. He said yes. So, Bigalow gave us his jet. We jumped on a plane.</p>
<p>We John Alexander and I left for Las Vegas and and picked up Hal Putoff in Austin and on we went to Florida where Corso lived. get to Florida and he starts talking. His family, in particular, his son, was very nervous about him saying too much before the book came out a year later. So, we slipped out of the house. We went into Corso&#x27;s Wnebago, an RV of some kind, and started talking and and I was the cameraman.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll see how bad the photography is in this, but I have to admit to being the cameraman, and I recorded every bit I could. Um, we had a subsequent meeting with Corso, but I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll just leave it at that. This is part of what he told us in that amazing conversation. &gt;&gt; The following is part two of the Lost Tapes interview with Colonel Philip J. Corso.</p>
<p>[Music] &gt;&gt; This is all the White Sand area. This is the White Sands headquarters here. This is Red Canyon or my headquarters was here. Here&#x27;s a This is a cross that was left on the floor. an actual picture of it where the chapel and white red canyon is right there where that X is.</p>
<p>This is Trinity site. My debris area was over in this area. Financed that particular thing. It was our money. &gt;&gt; But did they specifically say it was uh extraterrestrial? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What year was this within the 47 48 time frame? &gt;&gt; Uh when I did the autopsy it was in the &#x27; 50s, early 50s. &gt;&gt; Oh okay. No, later 50s. Later 50s. That&#x27;s another report.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You had said that um that the material had sat in files for like 13 years and then you looked at it. I mean, was nothing done with it that time period or &gt;&gt; nothing as far as I know. There was these reports in there. See, I scr this material out in 1960. I started to scrunch it out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You hadn&#x27;t You weren&#x27;t really familiar with it before then? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. I didn&#x27;t do this at the White House. The White House. Uh I mean I got it was raw information on this particular subject cuz the White House for example I was in charge of the policy group on giving aid to Turkey. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh I had to fall to Freedom Corp. I don&#x27;t know if you know what that means. What that is President Eisenhower gave me handed me that personally and said get this going. What it was there was a we were going to take all the foreign groups like labor service groups in Germany &gt;&gt; Mhm. and put them in uniform of their own c their own military, their own countries and arm them and give them their own flags and everything &gt;&gt; in Germany and Kennan and Bolan killed it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But anyway, Eisenhower gave me that. They said that uh they the president got sick went to Colorado some place and he got that had that heart attack and they convinced uh Secretary of Defense and some other people that uh Anhar didn&#x27;t want it. later on told Charles Kirsten&#x27;s congressman that he thought that was a great thing. They lied &gt;&gt; and the thing that Secretary of Defense just sat on it nothing ever happened.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Stalin himself gave orders to give the the Roswell material. &gt;&gt; We knew that. I never gave any discuss with CIA. Only one man a CIA.</p>
<p>Did you ever hear named Frank Hand? Mhm. &gt;&gt; He was lay on between CIA, the White House, and Department of Defense. &gt;&gt; Guy, &gt;&gt; you discussed it with him? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he was good friend of mine now. But he and I sparred. He used to sit at the White House, you know, on some of the group working groups because he was CIA.</p>
<p>We sparred for about uh eight or nine months before we became friends cuz we didn&#x27;t trust each other. I was military and he was CIA. He was getting paid by CIA cuz he was a lazison. When we say it disappeared, is it something that we as humans made disappear or some something else made? &gt;&gt; No, I suspect that they made it disappear. I see uh I have to explain this to you.</p>
<p>Now, this is a drawn out thing. Uh when I the u the crash at St. Augustine and there when I looked into that my radars were picking up some some things out mysterious things out there. &gt;&gt; Mhm. Well, I tell you about the church after.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s White Sands area. The White Sands Missile Range is a low gravity area. There&#x27;s supposed to be last almost gap up through there in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic fields. My headquarters was right here. Here&#x27;s the White Science Missile Range.</p>
<p>This was my headquarters of Red Canyon. This is Trinity, &gt;&gt; right? Mhm. &gt;&gt; It was a low gravity area. You see the block wall makes zero up through here. And Goddard used this.</p>
<p>Los Alamos was not set up by accident. Bon Braun knew this and so did Obert. That&#x27;s a for one of a better name, it&#x27;s a low gravity area. Mhm. &gt;&gt; And missiles can disappear in these areas.</p>
<p>I discussed this with Wilbur Smith. Once a month, I&#x27;d send out trucks on a scavenger hunt. They got parts of our cast, parts of missiles that look good to you and bring them back. And they would. This boy told me that in one particular case when the missile had disappeared in this gate and then there was another time there was an explosion to see because what we do here&#x27;s the way we operate.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if you know the way Nike Ajax operates a Nike it doesn&#x27;t we don&#x27;t fire these at slant range &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; they fire up this way and then they dive &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; uh the moment the big radar locked on the plane it would transfer to the acquisition radar the one look like a tub &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; the acquisition radar now one of the target track radar would be locked on the missile standing up on it launcher The acqu the other radar would lock on the target pencil beam that would lock on the target. The acquisition radar would transfer it automatically in a computer to the then the boy would put that in a gate and when our missile would dive in it was supposed when get in the gate that&#x27;s when the explosion there was the computer would and I trained my boys I told them now man the moment that missile take off I want you to drop your hands because they could adjust with a little now drop your hands let the computer do I made the first perfect missile shoot. It worked. Don&#x27;t try to put any human that computer is better than you are. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And it and it worked. But then there were some strange things that happened. He told me in one particular case they found one of the missiles and all the holes were like the screws had been taken out. The the uh the engine looked like it had been taken apart by hand. Now strange thing happened.</p>
<p>I saw a report on Bokeandor. Bokeanor in Russia. UFOs came over the the air drrome. And the next day they found a tower was fell apart. All the rivets and everything fell out of the holes.</p>
<p>They were all clean. Now this happened to me at at Red Canyon. The parts that that we picked up were clean like somebody had taken them apart and not there were no jagged edges on it like it had been ripped. Now &gt;&gt; what time frame are we talking about? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m talking about 57 57 58. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>So uh and my theory is now you remember Brazwell said that there was a terrific thunderstorm and it kept lightning and lightning and lightning. I discussed this with Wilbur Smith. that looked like this built up a pillar and when the UFO came through one of them must have run into and they found out that&#x27;s the one was at the Brazwell ranch all the parts and the other one I think it came through the time frame and one was a little bit ahead of the other and they hit &gt;&gt; but I mean do you think the program ended when you left it or or was there some kind of continuation? &gt;&gt; I think it I think it ended. Remember it took the driving force of Trudeau behind it. As I told you when I wrote a proposal so I discussed something what he did with it I don&#x27;t know some of it became I know became went the industry who he passed it to who he discussed it with I don&#x27;t know you don&#x27;t go ask the general who&#x27;d you talk to I mean that&#x27;s just like asking the president I who did you talk to who&#x27; you tell you don&#x27;t ask I don&#x27;t ask a lieutenant general that &gt;&gt; you had mentioned for example the chip it went to Bell Laboratories and later to Rockwell &gt;&gt; yes I knew But I mean, you gave it, you hand it over to Bill.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, I didn&#x27;t hand anything into industry. That wasn&#x27;t my job. I drove proposals. There was set up in R&amp;D to do that type of business. They would follow up the proposals and the thing and then they would call me though.</p>
<p>I would go visit the the production models. Then I would call an industry to do. &gt;&gt; Well, how how did the the was it your charge chip and your file that ended up at Bell? for this say my proposal that Trudeau would get it and then it would be written in terms of R&amp;D without my comments and that would go to Bill Do that we had an actual there was 3,000 people in R&amp;D, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They had sections that did exactly that. That wasn&#x27;t my job to do. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>But I&#x27;m but what I&#x27;m trying to trace back to is did Bell Labs actually get a charred ship and wondered &gt;&gt; Yeah, they did. They did. Now that I knew things like that, &gt;&gt; but how did that happen? Do you know how it &gt;&gt; Well, the general the general will send it out as an assist and they thought we we stole it from the Russians. &gt;&gt; So, so &gt;&gt; we didn&#x27;t say one thing, anything about it. Let them think as they want to.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, what you did was to write what we call a request for proposal. &gt;&gt; I I&#x27;d write the proposal. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The comments was you wrote the proposal or did you write the request for proposal? Something that they would then respond to. But putting out enough information to steer them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, I would write only a proposal on all the facts with the headings on and hand to the general. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He would hand it to other people to put in the form to go to the industry. Okay. &gt;&gt; That was his that wasn&#x27;t my job.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I I I wouldn&#x27;t go that far. But then I would get instructions on him to follow things up which I would go like I went to the lab on the night viewing and I&#x27;d go to Rockwell TRW and places like that on his instructions. Now &gt;&gt; now you mentioned that there was a uh fabric found that was couldn&#x27;t be x-rayed through. &gt;&gt; No, not it couldn&#x27;t be x-rayed through.</p>
<p>It couldn&#x27;t cut it. &gt;&gt; Well, couldn&#x27;t cut it. &gt;&gt; Where did that come from? &gt;&gt; From the UFO fingers. So that was on the bodies or something. &gt;&gt; No, no, it was separate like debris.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Now you had mentioned uh also that uh NSA was picking up uh signals from space. I mean did they &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, they were say they were intelligent fig signals given out by an intelligent source. They couldn&#x27;t identify the source or break the code though. &gt;&gt; How far back was that? &gt;&gt; Oh, this was in the 50s.</p>
<p>out at the White House. I used to get NSA intercepts congressmen, senators calling overseas. I would actually get those. I had access to those at the White House. They would actually send them to me.</p>
<p>I had their clearance, too, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow, man. So, look, that um when I was watching that for the first time, that&#x27;s testimony. That&#x27;s visual recorded testimony.</p>
<p>It it&#x27;s so much of what you know Lazar said back in the day, we now have a different way to look at it and so much of what Corso said back in the day, we now have a different way to look at it. So, it&#x27;s really cool that you got that, you know, whistleblower or witness testimony on camera and can now finally share some of that publicly. It was great, man. &gt;&gt; Um, you know, the the NIDS guys, Hal and and John, they didn&#x27;t quite know what to make of it. Holy cow, is this for real? Uh, but they were impressed.</p>
<p>And if they could confirm some or part of of what he had said, it would be a really big deal. So John Alexander, I I remember, went to DC and spent a couple of days over there going through archives and then we asked Corso would he be willing to come out to Las Vegas and tell the same story to a slightly different audience, meaning um again Hal Putoff, but also with Dr. Jacques Valet and with Robert Bigalow and me in the room over at NIDS headquarters and he said yes. So, you know, uh what what happened was, uh John Alexander had gone to DC to check into the records, and sure enough, Colonel Corso really did work at all the places where he said he worked. And he really would have been in a position to handle Roswell type wreckage, physically handle that stuff, if in fact that wreckage was under uh the program ran by a guy named General Arthur Trudeau.</p>
<p>It all looked like the story he was telling, as fantastic as it was, was true. Now, in the years since then, there have been a lot of criticism of Corso for stretching it a little bit and inflating the roles that he had, claims that he has made about how that alien technology from the Roswell crash uh was what inspired and led to all kinds of amazing technology. Now, uh fiber optics for example, night vision goggles uh for example, and and and other things. He comes out to Las Vegas. He goes through several hours of grilling by Jacques and Hal and Bigalow and I think maybe Colum Keller was there as well and by me.</p>
<p>And again, I the the u the camera work is not all that great. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s my handiwork, but uh it was great just to get it on on camera. And then we had a third interview after he came to Las Vegas the following year when his book came out, but we&#x27;ll have that for another time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the the thing that really strikes me is he&#x27;s talking about back then when that, you know, kind of the testimony is pretty pure. He&#x27;s talking about bodies and he says extraterrestrial bodies, alien bodies, reverse engineering. These are the things that people are most interested in right now. You know, we&#x27;re getting kind of spoiled. We hear all these people come forward and talk about what it is that they&#x27;ve encountered, but he&#x27;s talking about the biologics, the beings.</p>
<p>You say you also had uh reports on bodies on alien bodies. &gt;&gt; I had Yeah, that came from uh Walder Reed. &gt;&gt; Were they pretty I mean they they definitely said not that these were genetic humans or something. &gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s what uh the report the thing that I was mostly interested in in the report was the two loes in the brain. &gt;&gt; There are two loes there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And this movie showed part of that. They didn&#x27;t know what they had though. Um, you know, some of the things that he said that really stuck out to me is is he confirmed with his words that the the Roswell incident, you know, was considered extraterrestrial because we&#x27;ve always debated, you know, where are these from? But within our military, our government, that was his assessment of their assessment is that it was extraterrestrial in origin. Now, he&#x27;s going through all of this, I think, 13 years after um these files were were kind of written.</p>
<p>And I know he said something about that, but um that the story remains consistent that there was some sort of transfer and handling of these materials at a high level within the military where I think you said that they were um transported to Bell Labs and and Rockwell. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a couple of places where it went um Bell Labs for sure. And then there was I&#x27;m I&#x27;m off the top of my head I can&#x27;t remember the other ones, but um he said that they they arranged for that to happen, which would make sense. I mean, that would that would be probably how you would handle it because the program he was part of was pretty small. It was only a couple of guys.</p>
<p>He was number two in it. They didn&#x27;t have the personnel to take that stuff apart and figure out what it what it could do and and what we could be able to build from it. So, yeah, they shipped it out, were very vague about where it came from, implied that it must be from some Russian super secret uh crash retrieval program, and and uh and off they went to the races. Now, I know that a lot of people don&#x27;t believe that we made technological breakthroughs based on Roswell stuff, but I think it could have actually been used to inspire those scientists and technicians back then to figure out what it might be used for. The other thing that&#x27;s that&#x27;s remarkable about Corso is he talks about there were two vehicles that came down to Roswell.</p>
<p>Sat Augustine is what he calls that crash. And then in his discuss he mentions Wilbert Smith that was a leading Canadian scientist looking at UFOs who had referred to being in touch with Americans who knew about this top secret program. The idea that that Roswell tech sat in file cabinets for 13 years and nobody did anything with it drives you crazy, doesn&#x27;t it? And then Corso talking about the bodies, the biologics I guess is the current term, uh how they were handled and moved around. In addition, in the first interview that we aired on Weaponized, he talked about meeting an alien, a live one, uh, during his time at White Sands, which is a pretty intriguing uh, story all it all of its own. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And in this section, he talks a little bit about something we&#x27;ve heard about, which is when there&#x27;s manipulation of like uh, after you deploy some artillery or something like that. We heard about this um Commander Fraver relayed a story I believe on the Rogan podcast where there was um an ICBM shell or something that they had deployed and it and there was a team that went in a helicopter and tried to pick it up out of the water, the shell or the casing of the missile and it was it was sucked down by some spherical or uh discshaped object that kind of became became uh surfacing and it&#x27;s like as if it took part of our machinery. Well, Corso also talks about at White Sands Missile Range, this kind of weird thing how they had shot these artilleries or something like that and then all these screws had been perfectly taken out of them. It was just this off-hand story he was telling. But then he also said that it happened at um Beuru Russia I think Beuru Russia and that they had similar accounts of kind of dismemberment of these uh warheads or missiles which is something you&#x27;ve heard a lot about which is that um there&#x27;s some interference with our uh military programs.</p>
<p>Yeah, it very much is consistent with what the work that Robert Hastings has done about UFOs and nukes, uh, the visitors, these craft wherever they&#x27;re from, interfering with, demonstrating their mastery of our most powerful uh, military technology. Nuclear missiles are disabled, taken offline, sometimes, as in the Russia example that I&#x27;ve uh, investigated before, they&#x27;ve been fired up and and are out of the control of the Russian military. It&#x27;s pretty spooky stuff. He talked about Nike Ajax missiles. That was the name of the missiles that he was involved with testing there at the White Sands Proving Ground.</p>
<p>And um and again, they they whoever they are, they&#x27;re making a point. We can take these apart in unique ways and they don&#x27;t impress us all that much. One of the weirdest things he said towards the end was that of the clips that I was just recently looking at today, I think it&#x27;ll be in the episode, he said something about how the NSA was picking up signals from space that appeared to be from an intelligent source, but the code could not be broken. Can you imagine that? If they if that is true, if that was true and remains true and they told the public about that, that would have been incredible. I don&#x27;t know if he ever told you more about that part of his story.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Not that I can recall. What I do recall is uh what he said about CIA though and um I think you picked up some of that in these clips that we&#x27;re showing in this episode. There were other clips that we&#x27;ve made public before and Corso makes it clear in his book he did not trust the CIA. He felt that they were a rogue agency back then and he battled them for pretty much his the entirety of his military career. He must have had his reasons, I guess.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, he probably had his reasons. Well, listen, man. I&#x27;m glad you got this footage out. I think it&#x27;s really um a good time for it because we are going to see people uh testify to the UAP and UFO reality when it comes up on the 9th of September. Um I don&#x27;t know what the final picks are going to be and I couldn&#x27;t tell you even if I did at this time.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not my position. It&#x27;s Congresses. I don&#x27;t know when they&#x27;re going to announce that, but I&#x27;m bursting at the seams excited. So, let&#x27;s just see how that goes. But thanks so much, George.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. Thanks, Jeremy. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re going to be there for this hearing, right? Oh, you know, I&#x27;m gonna sit there, you know, looking all angry and stuff. I gotta smile this time. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll be the birth of a thousand memes. A thousand Jeremy. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Probably. &gt;&gt; Talk to you soon. &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
