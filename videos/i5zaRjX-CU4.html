            <p>[Music] welcome back to inside personal growth this is greg voycen the host of inside personal growth and tom as i do every time i come on my show i have to thank the listeners that come from around the world because we really get them from everywhere uh we&#x27;re on with tom palladino and tom is an interesting gentleman with a interesting what do we call energy concept that we&#x27;re going to be talking about called scalar energy now for many of you out there if you go type it in the inner and you go type it in the internet you&#x27;re going to see it pop up if you go to amazon and type it in you&#x27;re going to see all kinds of products around it but tom is the real deal and here&#x27;s why tom is a researcher and humanitarian seeking to make a difference in the world by providing people with the education and tools to restore optimal health and by helping enhance our quality of life tom began research with scalar energy during the undergraduate years after developing a deep admiration for the father father of scalar energy research on nikola tesla he was also able to study the work of a man hieronymus who continued research on scalar energy and hieronymus major contributions including unbinding the rna and dna bonds of microbes plaguing the agrocultural industry rendering them harmless the existence of such energy not found within the electromagnetic spectrum fascinated tom inspired by these findings he pursued a course of independent studies seeking to better understand and subsequently harness scalar energy through the development of an instrument called scalar light if you go to tom&#x27;s website scalar lite s-c-a-l-a-r-l-i-g-h-t dot com you can learn more about tom you can learn more about what he&#x27;s doing but during this interview you&#x27;re going to learn a lot about scalar energy and why tom was so passionate about uh doing this so tom let&#x27;s just start off with that um you know you and i have spoken once before and i was really taken by what you&#x27;re doing and i&#x27;m interested in how did you get so entwined in this that it it just became like your this is your life&#x27;s work it is it is that&#x27;s that&#x27;s well put it is my life&#x27;s work why because god has called me to this and i i feel that i have to do this i must do this this is the path that was chosen for me and i do it to honor god and i do it to help people it has been a lifetime of research it&#x27;s a lot of work and you you have to have that disposition that you you really want to help to see mankind prosper and that&#x27;s always been my my angle i&#x27;ve always wanted to see the world benefit from technology and this technology scalar technology it&#x27;s a new and emerging science but it&#x27;s going to help mankind so what was your undergraduate work in what is it that got you from where you were to really diving into this and i know you said you were called by god to do it and i appreciate that um and i understand that when you get those kind of callings to be of service to mankind you can&#x27;t just turn them off you you&#x27;ve literally you just keep digging in and digging in and digging in until you find solutions but what was it that you were doing that kind of trip the trigger for you at an early age i read about nikola tesla and even though as as an 11 year old and a 12 year old i was not a physicist nonetheless i knew that this man was on to something and i devoted my academic career to trying to follow in his footsteps the great inventor nikola tesla and it&#x27;s always occurred to me that tesla was working with scalar energy although the role doesn&#x27;t consider that later in his life he discovered scalar energy and many of his inventions were scalar energy instruments and with that in mind i said well electricity is fine but really that&#x27;s not my proclivity proclivity is to study a different energy which is scalar energy it&#x27;s not electricity and really with tesla as that watershed event in my life i decided to make a career out of scalar research yeah and that you&#x27;ve done so when my listeners you go to scalarlite.com you&#x27;re going to see some of the instruments that tom&#x27;s been i want i wouldn&#x27;t say tinkering with but inventing and doing all kinds of things so let&#x27;s let our listeners know tom where does scalar energy originate and kind of describe its nature because you know we&#x27;re all here about energy all we are is energy that&#x27;s all day long and it&#x27;s how we expend our energy that really is the most important thing i also want to get into this space-time continuum that you talk about within this because i find that very interesting but let&#x27;s talk about us as physical beings in us uh there&#x27;s always been this saying tom about are we spiritual beings in the physical world are we physical beings in the spiritual world and there is a crossover here for you you know um and i want and i want to look at this concept of where it comes from the energy and describe the nature of it sure so if we look at this concept of scalar energy and that&#x27;s the term in vogue today now some people might call that prana or chi or zero point energy so these are synonymous terms for that other energy if you will so where does it originate from it&#x27;s it&#x27;s obvious from the stars all energy in the universe originates all light originates from the stars look at the universe take take a really good macroscopic view of the universe it&#x27;s the stars that are the powerhouses the storehouses of this energy and the biggest star is the sun well it it&#x27;s not the biggest star but closest to us well the one that we get most of our light energy from correct so or all of it i should say yes yeah and that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m tapping into the sun&#x27;s energy the energy of the stars so this is really the the what i consider the quintessence of the universe this is the the primal force in the universe scalar energy and i&#x27;ve always said this electricity and magnetism is a derivative it&#x27;s an offshoot if you will of scalar energy so when i really want to work with nature and control nature and command nature that&#x27;s what my instruments do i work with the control of scalar energy which allows me to have constant control over nature so what&#x27;s the difference between what you&#x27;re doing and i&#x27;ve been doing a little bit of research and i went on amazon and i typed in scalar energy and there&#x27;s a guy that&#x27;s got a can with tesla for 600 and something dollars and there&#x27;s people with pendants and there&#x27;s you know and people have been talking about how our cell phones emit you know these various things and how we can protect ourselves tell us the difference between what it is that you&#x27;re doing with this energy to heal people versus what you might consider and i might consider would be some dubious items that people could buy off of the internet which probably don&#x27;t do anything yeah um uh let me just concentrate on my work okay as a scientist as a researcher i&#x27;ve devoted 40 50 years to this topic and i learned from the masters there&#x27;s two men tesla and hieronymus and i&#x27;ve studied both of these pioneers in scalar energy research and specifically to hieronymus i&#x27;ve copied his instruments in many ways i&#x27;ve copied his instrument so that is my foundational uh understanding of scalar energy i learned from the masters now i shy away from making any comparison to what i&#x27;m doing what others are doing because my instruments simply are unique now when did hieronymus die uh 88 1988. i was born in the 80th okay okay he was born in 1895 actually wow and he he lived a rather robust life a great a great man i never met him but i met his wife and i learned from the hieronymus family and what what is that so important well he&#x27;s one of the few pioneers who ever captured this energy and controlled it you have to harness capture this energy and then work with it and experiment with it so he&#x27;s one of the few experts on the planet he&#x27;s deceased obviously yeah and that now you&#x27;re the expert well i i would i would like to say i&#x27;m following in his footsteps thank you greg for that but this is it&#x27;s so crucial to understand science is infinite and you have to really narrow your focus and this is what i&#x27;ve done with scalar energy research i&#x27;ve narrowed my focus to this new and emerging science and i&#x27;ve learned from my predecessors the the experts that i would call them and i followed in their footsteps so now i&#x27;m i&#x27;m continuing on with their work so with that said my work is unique because it goes back to hieronymus his work was unique and we don&#x27;t deviate from that path because what works works right so let me ask you this what is the difference between the scalar energy and electromagnetic energy it&#x27;s very simple the our sun the stars produce scalar energy at the very core at the very center of our sun and stars i believe it&#x27;s divine energy is scalar energy and therefrom you will have a degradation of that scalar wave it&#x27;s a double helix and the degradation the collapsing of that scalar wave then manifests as electricity and magnetism so simply stated scalar energy is the primary energy of the universe and electromagnetic energy electricity and magnetism is the derivative well that brings in a scalar light you say scalar light you can turn on the ability to form our own nutrients so you&#x27;re using this to heal people let&#x27;s go to the main reason for your existence which is why you were given this calling is to use this how does this energy work to help my listeners heal ailments let&#x27;s say they&#x27;ve got arthritis or they&#x27;ve got back problems or they&#x27;ve got heart issues or they&#x27;ve got whatever it might be how can they harness scalar energy and especially because we&#x27;re going to say you&#x27;re mention you&#x27;re going to give 15 free sessions yes everybody who&#x27;s listening we&#x27;re going to put the link and that&#x27;s quite an offer i want to say to my listeners tom&#x27;s being quite generous because he wants you to actually do this and he uses pictures so i want you to kind of explain the process as well okay so let me distinguish again with scalar energy this is not electricity so it&#x27;s a different technology how do i work with people i work with people by way of their photograph you will visit our website find the link for the 15 day free trial then you will email us your photograph all i need is a photograph of your your face so i work with people by the quantum dimension which is a energetic dimension and why is a photograph important because i can access your energetic dimension by way of your photograph so this is the new technology that we&#x27;re experiencing now that you don&#x27;t have to visit a masseuse you don&#x27;t have to visit a health practitioner you send me your photograph i work in the quantum realm because your photograph carries your energetic signal and what i&#x27;ve discovered with a photograph it&#x27;s the exact mirror-like image of a person so if you sent me your photograph today greg i could i could pinpoint what type of bacteria and fungi you have in you by way of your photograph so your photograph is the real-time reporting agent as to your health as to your your constitution and with that said with these instruments working remotely by way of a photograph i&#x27;m able to identify viruses bacteria and fungi and then break down or disassemble those viruses bacteria and fungi so there&#x27;s a lot of there&#x27;s a lot of people out there tom that are probably listening right now and and they&#x27;re saying hey and i&#x27;m thinking to myself are you the only one that can do this because the reality is if if you learned from the father of this yes there probably aren&#x27;t a lot of other people that took into his footsteps so so how are you duplicating the ability to actually meet the demand of the number of people that might want to have this happen i know that sounds like a weird question but it&#x27;s really not because you have to start teaching other people how to do this it&#x27;s pertinent it&#x27;s pertinent and let me go back to the history i i met the hieronymus family in 1993 close to 30 years ago i myself i&#x27;m 61 years of age and the people then that i was working with they&#x27;re all deceased greg nobody&#x27;s taking this out they&#x27;re they&#x27;re deceased so as i understand and looking at the internet i think i&#x27;m the only person in the world that&#x27;s doing this i don&#x27;t think i have anybody else who&#x27;s followed in the footsteps of tesla and hieronymus duplicated their instruments and is now duplicating the results i would say that&#x27;s true because i did a quite a thorough search and looked all through the pages and i just see a lot of products i don&#x27;t see people doing what you&#x27;re doing no no you won&#x27;t find my track record anywhere on the internet either right i&#x27;m a result-driven researcher i believe in performance and i&#x27;ve waited 30 years to bring forward my my research and my results because i i wanted to perfect this this protocol this technique and after 30 years i can guarantee people it works this is a repeatable an instrument that can repeat this function it&#x27;s a repeatable function and in so doing we have a great deal to offer mankind so let me ask you a question you&#x27;re a christian yeah when you look at chakras and you look at all the things from the eastern philosophy clearing energy of a chakra because we talked about this before how do the two of these kind of relate because christianity and people who are muslim right or hindu you know it it wasn&#x27;t like yes or similarities everybody&#x27;s trying to get a path to the highest path to reach god right but tell me how this is working because i think it&#x27;s a fascinating endeavor to say you&#x27;re super strong christian you want to heal all the people in the world if you can&#x27;t through scalar energy yet on the other hand a much of this energy that people talk about through your chakras or whether you&#x27;re getting let&#x27;s just use this for an example acupuncture acupressure all these eastern philosophy things where does that cross the point is to unify mankind right the world is too divided and when we use a term such a chakra or a meridian well god created the chakras the meridians right and you really cannot pigeonhole the term chakra to one philosophy one religion if god created it it&#x27;s universal and that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m trying to get at with with my research not only do i want to treat the world but i want to unite the world okay we&#x27;re too divided and it many of these encumbrances are man-made many of these divisions are simply are are doing which is wrong so let&#x27;s bring down these walls and let&#x27;s work together so when i work with people around the world by way of their photograph people email me photographs it&#x27;s it&#x27;s universal healing and what do i see with this we&#x27;re going to eventually have a universal language and a universal understanding that we are united we we should help one another we&#x27;re all from god we&#x27;re all children of god and that would be one of my my my my focus is moving forward to unite mankind and if scalar energy will be the the means to unite mankind then let&#x27;s do that well there might be many things that work but scalar energy could certainly be uh one and obviously like i said a minute ago you have to duplicate yourself to be able to reach 7.7 billion people on the planet because tom can&#x27;t do it by himself so what is the future of scalar energy and how will its acceptance serve to change the world for the better well let&#x27;s look at the by way of analogy let&#x27;s look at the computer 100 years ago there wasn&#x27;t a computer right and over the past 50 years we&#x27;ve really developed computers and we see this trajectory it&#x27;s just incredible and how computers really mandate our lifestyle right now they really are in control of our lifestyle let&#x27;s just face it and perhaps scalar energy will follow a similar trajectory first comes awareness education then acceptance and then we&#x27;ll take off just like the computer okay all right so because you know when you approached me and i got your email i didn&#x27;t know anything and i&#x27;m pretty well exposed to lots of philosophies and beliefs and books and people that are written all kinds of things and even in your case you haven&#x27;t written a book we&#x27;re doing this interview 98 of the people that come on the show are authors and i was so intrigued that i wanted to do it so tell us if you would we&#x27;ve talked a little bit about it but you have people that have testimonials the other thing is is i want you to be able to if you can if you&#x27;ve got other than the videos at your website if you&#x27;ve got something at youtube i want you to be able to tell our audience about that tell us what you&#x27;ve experienced when working with this with people as far as their healing their mental frame of mind i mean you might find people that send you their picture and they&#x27;re depressed right i would assume that this works quite well for things like depression yes yes it does why does scalar energy why does a scalar energy session help people with depression or or say some psychological issue because the mind functions on scalar energy and if i can download scalar energy into the mind into the seven meridians then that&#x27;s a reboot that&#x27;s a reprogramming of our brainwaves our reprogramming of our seven chakras so i firmly believe that we think and that thinking is a function of scalar energy so as a thought is really a scalar wave it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a scalar thought and we perform a chakra balancing for one hour every day and many people say that this downloading of scalar energy now always by way of their photograph a chakra balancing for one hour will allow people to achieve a state of tranquility peace harmony some people say that this has lifted their depression so i believe that the the pathway to human health in the future specifically mental health will be by way of scalar wave technology we will use energy to reprogram our mind to reprogram our seven chakras so is it coming through the crown crown i mean this may be a silly question but when you think about it when people meditate the role that they&#x27;re trying to do is get closer to god get hot get connection with god coming through the crown chakra many eastern philosophies will say that&#x27;s the inner point then through the spine right obviously thus the posture that people are supposed to hold and the way that they hold their body is is yours kind of a similar i mean do you you don&#x27;t ask people to sit and meditate you obviously take their picture and you do something so how does that uh how does that enter the body right or the cells of the body cellular transmission when we observe this sun energy or star energy it&#x27;s ubiquitous it&#x27;s everywhere so when i place a photograph inside my instrument that person is babe is is if you will overwhelmed with scalar energy and in so doing we don&#x27;t pinpoint one point on the body because scalar energy is a blanketing if you will it&#x27;s okay some might say the matrix of the universe so i don&#x27;t pinpoint the crown chakra to the contrary your entire body is suffused with this light and and that that bathing of of this light allows all of your cells to participate in this light which is non-physical so working with scalar energy non-physical light i can impart this energy from head to toe so to speak every cell in your body including your mind right your your subconscious starts to participate in this non-physical paradigm so um you explain if you would because this was an interesting question about how scalar energy is the cause of time i mentioned 10 minutes ago we were going to talk about that why is that scalar energy is the cause it is light is the cause of of the universe what do i mean by that well if we look at scalar energy then it has to be the cause of time if you you look at the nature of scalar energy in composition it&#x27;s a double helix now if you rotate that double helix in one direction time moves forward so as scalar energy moves that&#x27;s the progression of time to reverse a scalar wave time would move backwards creation is always simple it&#x27;s from god god is simple creation is simple it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the effect it&#x27;s the downstream effect that becomes complicated but at its very root it&#x27;s the rotation of a scalar wave that creates the forward movement of time if you stop a scalar wave time will stand still if you reverse a scalar wave time will flow in reverse there&#x27;s a great russian physicist and he he wants um kazarev he once described time as the flow of energy and he&#x27;s right the flow so if you really want to look at time it&#x27;s a flow of energy that energy can flow forward or it can flow backwards so here we are these spiritual beings inside these physical bodies the physical bodies are what are carrying us around to do the work we&#x27;re doing explain if you would you know we&#x27;re seeing people live longer um obviously scalar energy if people are working with it and it does what you say that it will do it should have effect on people&#x27;s longevity yes um i don&#x27;t know what the oldest person was i think she was 123 actually um but in essence to live a good long life and to live a healthy good long life which is kind of what you&#x27;re saying is hey we want to use this to help heal people but not only help heal people but actually have them have a more productive and engaged life uh explain if you would um how that how this is helping people with with all of not just ailments but their longevity because i look at you you said you&#x27;re 60 what one 61. okay and i&#x27;m 66. so looks aren&#x27;t deceiving i mean you look at people today and you go hey they&#x27;re in their 60s they&#x27;re still like they&#x27;re in their 40s the good point so what what is it about scalar energy that can lead to our longevity to sound health we are slowing down the aging process i believe i&#x27;ve slowed down my aging process considerably now consider if scalar energy is the cause of time and if my body is now bathed in scalar energy then i&#x27;m slowing down the degradation i&#x27;m slowing down what we could call free radical damage i&#x27;m slowing down the the biochemical processes that lead to aging that lead to disease so once you&#x27;re in this different paradigm you&#x27;re no longer an electromagnetic paradigm i work with myself 24 hours a day so i am being bathed in scalar energy 24 hours a day and because i&#x27;m in a different paradigm i&#x27;ve slowed down my decay my my degradation i&#x27;ve i&#x27;ve eliminated disease it&#x27;s a different dimension that i&#x27;m in when i&#x27;m in in this scalar energy instrument 24 hours a day i am slowing down aging i&#x27;m slowing down time if you will so what are some of the things people have said who&#x27;ve worked with you i go on on record by stating a scalar energy instrument the ones i&#x27;ve developed at least will allow me to control the molecular structure of a pathogen a germ and i&#x27;ve developed a process that is i think unique to my work in which i can guarantee the destruction the breaking down the disassembling of viruses bacteria and fungi now if i can by extension of that comment if i can prove that and i have been proving it then i&#x27;ve discovered the easy way to eradicate pathogens from people and animals so yes yeah yeah i&#x27;ll go on record by saying during this pandemic the people that have worked with us and our subscribers they&#x27;re they&#x27;re all healthy nobody&#x27;s succumbed to covet so you know look there&#x27;s obviously fear is a very very very um detrimental thing and we&#x27;ve seen this country millions of people worldwide gripped with fear the fear of getting coveted you know if you were to remove that fear with scalar energy from a mental standpoint right um do you believe that a transformation of the way in which society sees these pathogens would would occur yes yes and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the end game greg thank you that&#x27;s the end game that&#x27;s why i want to heal the world it&#x27;s not only to to alleviate pathogenic disease but it&#x27;s to introduce a new way of thinking i don&#x27;t want people to live in fear i want them to be confident right right well there&#x27;s been a lot of obviously sphere so and explain to our listeners you ex how scalar energy assembles and maintains all physical forms because that&#x27;s a pretty big statement yes it is yes it is if you look at the universe you have order out of chaos well what order is the universe it&#x27;s god god&#x27;s divine mind the logo so what is the logos it&#x27;s scatter energy so light starlight and sunlight produces the intelligence to hold together all matter so what is my point i am looking at this paradigm scanner energy and i&#x27;m saying this provides the geometry not only of the stars not only of the planets but also molecules and i can prove that in a microscopic sense because microscopically i can break down the geometry of viruses bacteria and fungi and when i break down the geometry of microorganisms they fall apart how do i break apart the geometry the molecular structure of microorganisms with my scalar energy instrument and i can do that readily it&#x27;s a simple and proven dependable process so with scalar energy working at the microscopic level i have mastery over germs microbes now if i can provide that mastery over germs then eventually by way of extension we should be able to master the physical universe scalar energy should give us control over all atomic and molecular forms but remember the animating force is always scalar energy so whether it&#x27;s the molecular structure of a virus or the molecular structure of a galaxy it is all undergirded by intelligence scalar intelligence so an off-the-wall question but last time we talked you mentioned in one of your comments about the cabal and i think that obviously however this came about this virus has created tremendous fear and now you see the vaccinations and you see a lifting of fear whether it&#x27;s a placebo or it&#x27;s not a placebo it doesn&#x27;t make any difference the reality is somebody infused so much fear in so many people now i&#x27;m going to say somebody but i don&#x27;t know i don&#x27;t know the origin that literally we ended up with a frozen state of economy of the world order of everything that&#x27;s happening what&#x27;s the big picture there in your estimation i believe why do you think this came about i believe covet 19 is a man-made genetically engineered virus and you have to ask yourself why would you engineer a virus and um but besides some type of prophylactic measure i would say that the design is to control the world yes i agree with that yeah so um explain how scalar energy is not bound by time or difference or distance i should say yeah again looking at this energy scalar energy if it really is divine i believe it is directly from god then god transcends time and space and once again going back to our earlier discussion at scalar energy like a river it&#x27;s a river flows and with that you have a flow of water and likewise with scatter energy it&#x27;s a flow of time well if that&#x27;s the case then scalar energy is the cause of time and if scalar energy is everywhere then scalar energy is the cause of all space so to speak so this this paradigm this this supreme paradigm scalar energy transcends time and space because it&#x27;s the cause of time and space and when you are the cause of time and space you&#x27;re no longer subject to time and space time and space are subject to you so what am i saying scalar energy the mind of god it holds holds everything together in the universe it&#x27;s responsible for the molecular geometry of the universe and it&#x27;s also responsible for time and space so again tom one of the biggest concerns i would say most people walking the face of the earth have is death and obviously for many people there&#x27;s a finitude it&#x27;s a finality it&#x27;s the end um what is it that scalar energy might do to help somebody relieve that fear both from a spiritual standpoint and from a physical standpoint i&#x27;d say from a spiritual standpoint once people realize that scalar energy this this all-encompassing energy of the universe is from god they&#x27;ll realize that they&#x27;re going back to god that there is really a truism behind the notion the alpha and the omega what comes from god goes back to god so this this world this is a pilgrimage as a christian i firmly believe that and we&#x27;re only here for a short period of time you know a hundred years at best that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a short snap snapshot in in history so we are going back to god we&#x27;re going back to our source going back to the creator so one thing we should really be to take hold of and really be enlightened about is that scalar energy this this all-encompassing principle of god it&#x27;s going to give us a ease to go back to god death is not is not the end death is the beginning of your your supernatural spiritual life in heaven so i i myself as a christian you know i have a finite time but i do want to go back to god so christianity normally doesn&#x27;t have a belief well where hinduism does and and muslims and some of the other really buddhism about reincarnation um do you have not that this is so important but do you have a personal belief in um that happening to people or not i believe in one life no i don&#x27;t believe in reincarnation and i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary you have one life to live and i don&#x27;t think god is going to punish us by by having us live multiple lives and i believe the ultimate goal is to go back to god i firmly believe in the alpha and the omega i believe we we were created by god and at death we go back to god this earth is simply a pilgrimage you have to look at the universe in its fatality or as best you can we&#x27;re just a snapshot in time so if you would um you say that there&#x27;s these seven major chakras in the meridian points how does scalar light help balance those you know the chakras have been uh identified by curling photography and i&#x27;ve seen those photographs so they are indeed present and when we photograph them they are scalar energy centers so our seven chakras are seven scalar energy centers they&#x27;re not electricity so when i have a high powered scalar energy instrument i can interface i can download into those seven chakras so the best way to balance your chakras besides prayer meditation is with the scalar energy instrument and in so doing many people tell me that after i balance their their brain waves and their seven meridians that their sleep is improved or they are of a more tranquil disposition they&#x27;re more peaceful they&#x27;re happier now all that is done by way of a photograph so you can realize that i am not uh i&#x27;m simply working with instruments it&#x27;s the instrument that is the animating force this is not my my ability as a as an operator because i&#x27;m only working with your photograph yeah and i find that working with the photograph that if if you&#x27;re picking up the energy and then putting it in to the devices that you&#x27;ve created that it&#x27;s providing uh exactly as you say the ability to transform um the i&#x27;m going to say the structure molecular structure uh of an individual as a result in my all my listeners whether you&#x27;re a believer or not a believer it&#x27;s probably worth taking these 15 free sessions that tom&#x27;s willing to give you which again i say is a very generous offer and where you can get those is if you go to scalar scalerlight.com and then you&#x27;ll see a sign up page we&#x27;ll have a direct link to that sign up um all you need to do is put in your email address and your name um and then i presume tom you&#x27;ll be in touch with them is that how it works that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s right all we ask is that you upload your photographs email your photographs you may include family members we&#x27;ll allow you to send as many as seven or eight photographs of family members and include your pets your pets will benefit i have a saint bernard and i treat my saint bernard on a daily basis and i have a very healthy saint bernard well you know saint bernard i have a little uh terrier mix from the border so i&#x27;m gonna send a picture of her when i send mine in because i&#x27;m going to do it and see how it does tom what would you like the people um to leave this show with if if you were to leave them with three points you&#x27;d like to make because we&#x27;ve talked about a lot during the last 40 minutes but i want to just give you an opportunity to kind of summarize it sure so my work as a researcher scalar line i&#x27;ve i&#x27;ve really looked into and i&#x27;ve peered into the very mechanism the very uh the very cause of the universe which is god so what am i going to leave the audience with what i&#x27;ve discovered through science through through discovery you can discover and you can find by way of prayer by way of meditation you don&#x27;t need a scalar energy instrument and what i&#x27;m trying to inculcate is scalar energy is that pathway that pathway to god prayer meditation is that pathway to god and there&#x27;s many ways to god i found one of those ways is by way of this light scale or light and what i&#x27;m trying to to accomplish is to show everybody that that united this world will do so much better than what we&#x27;re doing now there&#x27;s too much confrontation that there are answers out there that we have to think outside the box and i would hope people would would open up to prayer and meditation and perhaps you&#x27;ll see that the analog to pran meditation is scalar light well i would also think that people doing this it&#x27;s going to be people talk about oh i have a hard time meditating or i can&#x27;t go beyond 10 minutes because i have the monkey mind but i think scalar light would be much more expeditious in their journey to reach that one source whatever you god whatever they want to call it because i have all kinds of faiths listening to this show so the reality is is that whoever that is whatever that is for you scalar light is going to make the process i say more expeditious because of what you&#x27;re actually doing with the chakras and the alignment and the everything you&#x27;re doing with their energy field so i think that&#x27;s great so for my listeners we&#x27;re going to have a link to tom&#x27;s at scalarlike.com we&#x27;ll also put a link in so that you can go directly to the page to sign up for those of you want to know more there&#x27;s a couple of videos there you can see tom with his equipment you can learn everything you need to know tom it&#x27;s been a pleasure having you on inside personal growth sharing your experience with this your years and years of study hieronymus nikola tesla and i think it&#x27;s worth people exploring um so you know give it a chance what do you have to lose right 15 free sessions you have nothing to lose so thanks so much tom thank you great thank you</p>
