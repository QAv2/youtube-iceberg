            <p>I bet you don&#x27;t think we can find the area of this rectangle the information given isn&#x27;t always the only information we know for example the base of our rectangle is 8 cm and we&#x27;re told that because we have 1 2 3 four radii stretching across now as for the height that is going to be way more difficult to figure out so what we&#x27;re going to do is we&#x27;re actually going to draw a little triangle here from the midpoint of these two circles to the Center of this circle and then out again to the midpoint of our top right circle now it may seem like we only know one of the sides of our triangle but we actually know two of them and the reason for that is is that we have a radius here and we have a radius here and 2 + 2 is 4 so we know how long our hypotenuse is the Pythagorean theorem so we&#x27;ll have 2^ 2 + x = 4^ 2 or 4 + X2 = 16 or X2 = 12 or X = &lt; TK 12 or X = of 4 * 3 or x = 2 * the &lt; TK of 3 so that&#x27;s how long this line is right here 2 * theun of 3 but is that our height no we still need to add on two and two for the other radi lengths so we&#x27;ll have 4 + 2 * theun 3 and that will all be multiplied by our base which is 8 so what&#x27;s that going to equal 8 * 4 is 32 Plus 8 * 2 * 3 is going to be 16 * 3 and this will be our final answer this is the area of our rectangle</p>
