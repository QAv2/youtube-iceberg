            <p>good morning my name is Bruce pirouette and I&#x27;ll be presenting an introduction to the concepts behind the reciprocal system of theory my focus here is on the reciprocal relation between space and time and how it defines a more complete view of the universe in which we live for some background the reciprocal system of theory was created by Dewey Bernard Larsen a chemical engineer back in the 1950s encouraged by exchanges his friend classmate and fraternity brother linus pauling washington documented his initial thoughts on the universe based on a concept of motion the reciprocal relationship between space and time and his first book the structure of the physical universe he self-published it through no specific publishers a company owned by himself and his wife Dorothy they sent out hundreds of free copies to universities and researchers across the globe despite all the claims of scientists looking for a theory of everything when confronted with one that did not fit their existing paradigm well scientists did what they often do get out their crosses with mistakes silver bullets and light the funeral pyres Washington&#x27;s theories were met with outright rejections but that didn&#x27;t stop him Larson continued his research through the late 1970s eventually deciding to stop his research and document what he had discovered an expanded edition of his first work not published in four volumes the first volume nothing but motion describes general theory basic atomic physics and general chemistry basic properties of matter which is a collection of papers documenting how material properties could be derived directly from the structure of the atom without having to take measurements and curve fit solutions in it he addresses concepts like inter atomic distance heat in thermal motion basic electrical relations magnetism electrostatics isotopes and radioactivity the universe of motion is Larson&#x27;s venture into astronomy and cosmology demonstrating the general applicability of the reciprocal system to different scales what he discovered was that the evolutionary processes of conventional astronomy were backwards because of an error in understanding and the stellar combustion process which he documents as age limit vision not fusion having a good idea of the natural consequences involved in creating a physical universe Larson notice that there were things that just didn&#x27;t fit in things like life ethics and paranormal ability his final volume beyond space and time is a venture into those areas using the same concepts he developed for the physical structure but taking it outside the physical realm of time and space Larson wrote a number of other books during his research years documenting and summarizing some specific cases new light on space and time a general theory of atomic structure beyond Newton and focusing on what gravity is and what it isn&#x27;t the neglected facts of science good start a book that addresses some of the common problems of science and how easily a reciprocal relation resolves them the case against the nuclear atom focuses on the problems with the nuclear structure and a far easier way to express it as rotational systems Larsen was the first to admit that a system is far from complete and it would be up to others to continue development of his initial concepts the first among these was a young professor from a university in India one kvk Nehru who had extended dialogues with Larson proposing alternate and often better interpretations of concepts Larson had put forth there were many controversies over the simplistic nature of Washington&#x27;s photon model and Niro had found a unique solution that solved many of the behavioral problems with Larson&#x27;s model out of the concept of by rotation rather than light being a vibration it was a combination of opposite rotations shearing to formal vibration this concept explained things such as the Zeeman effect stark splitting and polarization I have found that as a general rule these days people do not like to change because if they change they might actually grow as usual neighbor whose concepts involved a fundamental change at the root of Washington&#x27;s reciprocal system the photon so they were not well received the basic premise of the reciprocal system is that we live in a physical universe that can be completely defined by just two concepts space and time existing in a reciprocal relationship to each other this ratio is Washington calls motion relation of space to times such as miles per hour is our everyday concept of speed the inverse of speed time to space is what we refer to as the mechanical concept of work it took me three hours to push that car a quarter mile time related to distance is energy one of the big complaints people have about Larson&#x27;s concepts of motion is how can you have motion without anything moving that&#x27;s just a misunderstanding based on a poor choice of words by Larson motion is just a generic name you pick for the ratio of space to time any ratio of space to time so you can think of it this way you can have a ratio without any rationing a direct consequence of using ratios the multiplicative inverse is that your origin of measurement is unity not zero as used by conventional science it also infers that the minimum quantity you can have of anything is one which is an agreement with nature in nature you cannot have none of something this unit origin of measurement is referred to as the natural datum of the reciprocal system in the reciprocal system essentially all is one because unity is the default condition for something to exist it must be offset from that unity Washington calls these offsets a displacement and all structure is created by displacement from unity interesting philosophical considerations here so what exactly is unity well it&#x27;s the one thing that is common to every reference frame the speed of light when the speed of light is taken in natural units rather than the conventional units defined by man for distance in time and as the value of one unit of space for one unit of time very simple in Martians 1959 book the structure of the physical universe he discusses the concept of natural units as a consequence of having only two units to deal with space and time all the conventional units of measure feet meters seconds grams pounds Newton Pascal&#x27;s you name it there&#x27;s about 240 of them can be expressed as a simple power relation of space to time or time to space in the reciprocal system we don&#x27;t have need to assign a name to every possible combination of space and time or assign multiple names to the same relationship as conventional science does for example we have these basic concepts distance or length space duration air time time T velocity or speed the relation of space to time energy the Joule the relationship of time to space your basic quantity of work acceleration space divided by x squared force the Newton time divided by space squared the conjugate not the inverse momentum the Newton&#x27;s second is the relation of time squared divided by space squared mass and grams kilograms or pounds is time cubed divided by space cubed pressure in Pascal&#x27;s atmospheres PSI other measurements of pressure RT over s to the fourth all adjust a ratio of space to time with different exponents natural units are of general applicability which means that mechanical electrical and any other system of measure can be expressed as a ratio of space to time as such similar concepts can be identified by similar ratios for an electric example power in watts is 1 over s the dipole moment and many of the folks who are going what the heck is that is nothing more than an amount of time electric current the ampere is simply s over T a speed the electric charge in joules is T over s the same as work or energy resistance not so futile is the ohm with the odd-looking units of T squared over s cubed until we realize that resistance is nothing more than mass t cubed or s cubed per unit of time if it didn&#x27;t take time to push something we would have no resistance pole strength in Weber&#x27;s is simply the magnetic version of momentum inductance having as the same units of mass t cubed over s cubed capacitance T cubed over T is just a volume per unit of time a rate of flow like gallons per minute the use of natural units in equations helps to develop consistent equations if the space and time aspects don&#x27;t add up then there&#x27;s something wrong the basic equation of motion is velocity s over T acceleration is velocity divided by time s over t squared force is defined by mass times acceleration having energetic units of T over s squared the same as energy per unit distance on the electrical side voltage is the product of current as a speed and resistance mass per unit of time energy equals mc-squared parallels the electrical version of equals to I squared RT where current like the speed of light is a speed and RT is conceptually the same as mass by using natural units these conceptual relations become obvious rather than hidden natural units both validate and simplify physical quantities take for example the concept of pressure pressure is measured in Pascal&#x27;s with the units of T over s to the fourth in a 3d universe we normally don&#x27;t encounter fourth power expressions so this is a composite of two things going on in this case there are two examples first is that of the pressure cooker where the energy of steam t over s is being contained in the volume one over s cubed second is that of atmospheric pressure which is the force T over s squared being exerted on an area of the ground one over s squared the natural units explain what is going on conceptually and again this is of general applicability the Wikipedia lists the units for the permittivity of free space Leslie Coulomb squared per Newton per square meter or amps squared times seconds to the fourth power times the inverse of mass per cubic meter or in the simplistic form farad&#x27;s per meter and the reciprocal system it&#x27;s just area per unit time which would you rather memorize for a test by the same token naturally units are quite useful to validate concepts and equations if they don&#x27;t add up something is wrong consider the capacitor an electrical device to store charged charges work as previously shown with the natural units of energy T over s let&#x27;s look at some of the equations work done by voltage looks good voltage current relationship also good energy of charge nuke that does not add up to P / s it adds up to s the product of capacitance in farad&#x27;s and voltage of force is not energy but space this equation is conceptually wrong and is one that Larsson identified in this book basic properties of matter having to make a distinction between the energy of charge T over s and will determine the quantity of charge which this is representing as s when the equations don&#x27;t add up just invent a universal constant with the terms to make it add up Universal constants aren&#x27;t at all constant just an admission of something goes here but we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;ve been discussing the relation between space and time so what are these things and how are they different simple answer is they&#x27;re just two aspects of a ratio nothing more like the numerator and denominator or the heads and tails of a coin it&#x27;s just a convention that we picked to represent a dichotomy in ancient philosophy space is considered young and time is in the time-space being the Tao of motion since space and time are just aspects they must behave the same way everything that exists in space must therefore exists in time everything that exists in time must also exist in space space has three dimensions therefore time has three dimensions time has a clock therefore space has a clock interesting concept isn&#x27;t it the reciprocal of our conventional frame of reference is 3d time with clock space a concept unique to the reciprocal system which is then promoted by researchers such as David Wilcock of History Channel Fame space and time to find the ratio of motion we observe two kinds of stable non accelerated motion for example if we hop in our space suits and go out into deep space with a baseball there are two things we can do to generate motion of that baseball first is throw it where it moves away from us in a straight line that&#x27;s a linear velocity second we can spin it where it stays in the same spot rotating on the axis of spin forever this is an angular velocity both of these velocities require a single scalar magnitude to express that speed so they are one-dimensional velocities and angular in revolutions per second all other motions are a combination of these two primary motions this is what Professor Nehru was getting at in his paper on the conservation of direction proposing by rotations to counter spinning rotations that produce the vibration of the photon makes a lot of sense from when a photon such as a gamma ray is destroyed it splits into two particles an electron and a positron the electron is a rotating unit of space in the positron is a rotating unit of time to counter rotations this brings us to the end yang of motion a linear and angular motion combined to produce all the structure we know note that this is an RS two concepts Orson realized that they had to be a rotational component but was a strictly linear young type thinker so we had to invent a rotational base to account for the in aspect of the universe in RS 2 we give equal priority to yin and yang two feminine masculine aspects of structure what we observe of these primary motions is that the young linear velocity is expressed as a series of connected locations that define a three-dimensional structure it is basically connected out in 3d much like the structure of a rubik&#x27;s cube a problem that arises in that we can only observe the structures created with connected dots so in a Y in angular velocity is present we don&#x27;t know how to interpret it because it is sitting at the same location all the time spinning around so we came up with a concept to describe it what Larsen refers to as equivalent space and conventional science calls force fields unlike linear structure these fields cannot be directly observed they could only be detected by how they change the connected out relationships how Yin changes young or how time changes space let&#x27;s take a minute to summarize what we already know space is linear and by itself we observe space as empty it&#x27;s a vacuum but space has stopped in it that stuff is 10 we can touch it therefore it cannot be a vacuum since space is a vacuum that stuff cannot be space the only other choice we have for stuff since we only have two choices is time so what is this stuff we call time as mentioned earlier time has three dimensions the stuff of time is a 3d temporal structure existing at a location in 3d space we call this stuff particles atoms molecules yep that stuff all around us is actually time not space the empty regions between our the space enter again that nasty reciprocal relation if we live in a region where space is empty and time is full then the reciprocal should exist a region where time is empty and space is full these two conditions where the stuff of time is in empty space and the stuff of space is in empty time form yin-yang of motion what Washington refers to as the two sectors that comprise the physical universe the material sector has matter comprised of a 3d temporal rotation Y n linked to a 3d spatial location Jung likes the Taiji to this yin-yang combination is inseparable if you&#x27;ve got space you&#x27;ve got time if you&#x27;ve got time you have space now the cosmic sector its inverse becomes the realm of antimatter because the reciprocal system is based on the multiplicative inverse antimatter is technically inverse matter being a 3d spatial rotation the in aspect of space linked to a 3d temporal location the young aspect of time it is not based on charge but on displacements from unity as discussed earlier about the natural datum being unity one half of the universe the material sector is moving at a fraction of the speed of light one over N where n is the temporal displacement that&#x27;s the 1/2 we observe measure and spend our lives in the conventional reference frame as Larson calls it the other half of the universe the cosmic sector is moving at speeds faster than light and over one where n is a spatial displacement in the old days study of the cosmic half of the universe where space appears as a solid with bubbles with time in it was called the ether washin derived ether as a natural consequence of the reciprocal system being the inverse realm of 3d time and clock space referred to the new age as the metaphysical realm when researching the various ether concepts that were popular in the 19th century I found the term became a catch-all for a number of concepts that are clearly distinguished in the reciprocal system first is the progression of the natural reference system which is the unit speed motion that is moving outward wanting to push everything apart at the speed of light astronomers refer to this as the Hubble expansion a name for the scalar expansion of the universe problem arose however because conventional astronomy has a datum of 0 not unit speed the speed of light so they had to invent something to account for this tendency to fly apart at the speed of light and they called it dark energy it starts because it cannot be observed why because it doesn&#x27;t actually exist the problem only arises because they do not recognize the natural unit speed datum that is the basis of the reciprocal relation between space and time next is the rotational nature of equivalent space we can only observe this Y in angular velocity as a field effect either spins with its cycloid spiral motion and vortices now we have the inversion created by equivalent time just as space has its equivalent space the inversion of space the cosmic ass of the universe has its time and equivalent time the inversion of time equivalent time appears as an invisible solid the stuff either is made of in the region between anti atoms in the material sector we are builders masons we start with something then add stuff to it until we have something from our perspective any structure in time appears inside out from this like a stonemason sculpting a statue they grab a chunk of solid rocks and chip away everything that doesn&#x27;t look like their object they&#x27;re trying create ether works the same way you start with a solid then create bubbles like the Theosophical coil on of different dimensional structures to create temporal objects what it comes down to is that conventional physics only addresses roughly one quarter of the universe the observable linear young portion of space the rest are avoided because it is there you will find the soul of the universe and the key to all these free energy systems you hear so much about but nobody knows how they work to summarize from our perspective there exists two sectors of the universe a material one based on space-time relations that is constructive builds up from nothing to something and is based off of clock time the other is the cosmic one when viewed from our confessionals perspective is energy based in time-space as a destructive sculpting system note that I say our perspective because if you were actually born in the cosmic sector everything would be flipped around and our material sector would be the ether and we look like the solid with the bubbles and they would have the vacuum with the stuff of themselves in it barson x&#x27; conceptual model resulted in two postulates that define his reciprocal system of physical theory first the physical universe is composed of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time second the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is Euclidean with this starting point arson was able to deduce the observable physical universe as a natural consequence of this theory it was very close but not perfect the rs2 reevaluation fixed the number of these problems with Larson&#x27;s first draft of a theory of everything and modified the second postulate ever so slightly as concepts like projective geometry were not well known back in the 1950s outside of military applications the RS 2 version of the second postulate is the physical universe conforms to the relations of or Neri mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and this geometry is projective note that we just modified two things commutative was removed as rotational systems do not commute I times J is not equal James times I in imaginary numbers and the in aspects of motion are included in RS two we can rotate without anything to rotate geometry was changed to projective from Euclidean as motion is basically an invariant cross ratio of projective geometry Larson actually uses projective geometry and all the scalar relations as scalar motion is distinctly non Euclidean and that it has no geometry at all as they say if it looks like a duck walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it&#x27;s a duck so let&#x27;s call the geometry that Lawson uses by its real name projective the reciprocal system has some fundamental differences from conventional thought if you try to use conventional understanding to understand a universe based on motion you&#x27;re going to fail so let&#x27;s look at some of the differences the speed of light the velocity of the progression of the natural reference system is basically the end of the tape from which everything is measured the speed of light is absolute in the sense that it is the natural datum of measurement if the end of your tape measure is a random number every time you use it you&#x27;ll never get the size of anything faster-than-light speeds are commonplace forming the cosmic half of the universe and over one is just as probable as one over n our conventional experience using natural units universal constants disappear or become very simple like 2 pi most of these constants occur because a piece of the puzzle is still missing once you account for all the pieces there&#x27;s no need for them all magnitudes in the reciprocal system are by night which Larson calls absolute magnitudes as such there are no / zero areas or infinities to contend with if you do encounter one then you&#x27;ve switched aspects or sectors and for example are trying to apply temporal motion using spatial equations as Scotty from Star Trek was saying the right tool for the right job you have to make sure you&#x27;re using temporal coordinates in a temporal system and spatial coordinates and a spatial system and not get them confused all the devices constructed by conventional science become unnecessary the reciprocal correlation between space and time provides a framework to understand what is actually going on without ad hoc convention the primary features of the reciprocal system are that it greatly simplifies chemical and molecular properties particularly bonding as there aren&#x27;t any bonds in the reciprocal system it&#x27;s all a matter of orientation to cancel net motion it&#x27;s just like twisting a puzzle piece until it snaps into place it also simplifies astronomy and cosmology because astronomers have it backwards the only thing needed to create stars and galaxies is gravity when you flip the direction around with natural units it is easy to eliminate bogus or incorrect formulas and equations because they just don&#x27;t add up natural consequences of a reciprocal relation assist in viable conceptual models this kind of checksum has been missing from physical theory for quite some time I have primarily focused on these physical aspects of the reciprocal system but it does not stop there Larson realized that it is able to define the physical universe as a natural consequence of this theory but the observed universe contained more than those consequences provided for by removing the physical from the observed Larson was left over with them bunch of things he could not really identify but gave it a shot in his last book beyond space and time continuing those natural consequences Larson found that life is a natural consequence of physics and just another stage of the complexification of motion ethics then becomes the natural consequence of evolving life metaphysics psionic ability and most paranormal phenomena are all a natural consequence of the material cosmic relation faster than light travel on the 3d space side is slower than light travel on the 3d time side this is where the concept of folding bass and wormholes comes in extrasensory abilities in space are just normal intuitive abilities in time simple explanations on how alternative energy devices function they aren&#x27;t free but are over unity because they are operating on the cosmic side emotion faster than light and the speed of light is unity therefore over unity makes sense now doesn&#x27;t it the reciprocal relation can make an educated guess as to what&#x27;s out there by extrapolating fundamental principles as natural consequences of the theory but one must remain open to those consequences as most of what we know is backwards if you are interested in taking a look at what the reciprocal system has to offer in terms of life the universe and everything we have some resources available the main site is reciprocal system org run by the International Society of unified science a nonprofit organization if you are interested in the more metaphysical side of things including personal development and investigation into the paranormal using principles of the reciprocal system you may find the antiquities forum interesting the rs2 investigation began on this site and was later moved as a separate line of research if you are into the New Age the raw material and seeing what the reciprocal system has to offer at the extreme end of the speculation spectrum check out the Daniel papers on conscious hugs they started with an RS analysis of geoengineering and proceeded to time-travel warp-speed a detailed analysis of global control mechanisms and a revisiting of the colonization of earth by the gods if you enjoy going boldly where no man has gone before you will want to check out the daniel papers but definitely not for the closed-minded Dewey Larson&#x27;s books are available on the website and on Amazon if you have questions please feel free to post them on the Rs to a Research Forum and the folks there will do the best to help you out thank you for taking the time to watch this presentation</p>
