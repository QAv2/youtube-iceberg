            <p>hey guys I just wanted to show a little bit better of what I&#x27;m trying to go with with these oil experiments here so I got it going now it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell I&#x27;ll give it another kick you couldn&#x27;t see that and there and it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell them trying to get it so that it so you can really see the dynamic flow but what it basically is what I&#x27;ve been able to to observe a so-called positive here so-called negative here and we&#x27;re getting the energy is sucking towards this electrode and shooting off and heading towards this this electrode and we&#x27;re getting this circular pattern here this for take this vortex like pattern and it just keeps going over and over and up here we&#x27;re actually getting pieces coming out this way so it&#x27;s really very interesting you know these pieces are doing that this wings here here&#x27;s our electrode on the same side and then on the other side you have a counter rotating this one&#x27;s going counterclockwise the right ones going clockwise and it&#x27;s spinning back to the to the negative electrode and some of this is going here so this is gonna here and it&#x27;s really coming around and propelling at this point I haven&#x27;t really gotten any measurements as far as the force that&#x27;s being exerted whether it be and all over all in this direction but if the structure of a vacuum is a double torus and Townsend Brown was using like this other side of electrostatics which he called electro kinetics for anti-gravity well this seems to be definitely a experimental proof that we&#x27;re getting the same movement so it&#x27;s going counterclockwise here and it&#x27;s going clockwise here see then on the top it&#x27;s heading in towards and then out to the tips on both sides zoom and behind the electrode of course they&#x27;re going towards pushing this electrode this way pushing it this way so that&#x27;s my drawing that&#x27;s my experiment next thing to do is maybe try to upgrade our circuit here to maybe push a little bit more of this power out we definitely have the capacitors for it just need to get a bigger transformer so keep an eye out for that we&#x27;re also charging with our extreme energetics John Bedini charger thanks Aaron here I call me for that charger battery up looks pretty good and of course we got our background Gerard Morin pump dishwasher with the blender motor and our transformers of course to step up the voltage I just I don&#x27;t have that together yet there&#x27;ll be another video I might even use just another home in polar motor and spend that I&#x27;m jeanna to generate the electricity instead of this DC actually has a lot of resistance with the battery I mean with the with the magnet in there so yep those are so that&#x27;s my experience that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s the Townsend Brown stuff that&#x27;s how it really works with the double torus field just like a planet Earth or a side or an atom or a star anyways sacred g-got a little bit peace out</p>
