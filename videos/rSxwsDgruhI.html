            <p>[Music] well thank you all for coming and letting me speak at the sustainable energy talks my name is Carson fan Austin I&#x27;m a student in biomedical engineering here at the TU II and I think I&#x27;m kind of like most of you I&#x27;m kind of an idealist I envision a future in which all energy generation is 100% green now being this idealistic actually led me to research our efforts to get there so far and quite frankly left me shocked with the current state of affairs because it turns out that despite we have all these beautiful technologies like wind turbines hydro electrics photovoltaics they only make up for 7% of the grand total in power generation and this is a neat a terrible pie chart I made in paint to illustrate this so even in the Netherlands scientists have calculated that by the year 2050 only 35% of our power generation will be green and that&#x27;s accounting for all current projects that are running right now and even to yet unbuilt nuclear reactors if you can call this a green technology and I&#x27;m not even going to talk about the growth in oil because it turns out we&#x27;re not hitting peak oil at all yet we&#x27;re just finding new ways to extract oil and to use it so this left me with a really important question why is the energy transition happening so slowly and in this research I found out that many inventors over the last century will actually have come up with ideas which can outperform most of the technologies we have today and we&#x27;ll give some examples of that right now you may all know this man this man is called Nikola Tesla and in my opinion he&#x27;s one of the brightest minds in the history of science and he has worked on technologies which not only harvest electricity from the vacuum of space but also to transmit it wirelessly across the globe for everybody to use freely and just to quote him here electric power is everywhere in unlimited quantities and power the world&#x27;s machinery without the need for coal or guess is that amazing well unfortunately his primary investor called JPMorgan he eventually found out that he could not profit from Tesla&#x27;s ideas so he simply cut his funding at one point and Tesla died a rather poor man and without the respect he actually deserved now this is just the list of people who have worked on similar technologies if you&#x27;re interested and want to do your own research and I&#x27;m just going to name two more examples of this list nice is up is that of Stanley Meyer you may all know of the possibility to run your car in hydrogen gas you got the combustible mixture of oxygen and hydrogen you burn it leaves you with excess power to run your car and the byproduct of just tap water h2o well Stanley Meyer actually found out a way to use tap water as a fuel source by hitting the water molecule at its resonant frequency and thereby very effectively splitting the water in hydrogen and oxygen and with this he built a dune buggy with which he could drive from the east of the west coast of the United States on just one full tank of water at one point unfortunately he went out to dinner with his investors yes again investors and after sipping his cranberry juice he grabbed his throat he bolted out the door of the restaurant he dropped to his knees and cursed that he had been poisoned and this sounds like something straight from a movie right but it&#x27;s actually really and you can look up the details yourself I just give one more example that if the an actual working device currently in Switzerland and to all you electrical engineers this may resemble an electrostatic Wimshurst machine sounds complicated but this one actually converts the ambient field energy or radiant energy as Tesla would call it into usable electricity and the reason why mr. Baumann has chosen not to disclose this technology is that he thinks Humanity is simply not ready for it yet and we may soon and see why so this leaves us with a very big question what happened why are we not driving in water fueled cars why are we not receiving electricity from the atmosphere or vacuum of space freely Peter Linderman is an authority on the radiant energy Tesla was talking about and he proposed four forces actually and the first being the banking system and I know what some of you may think oh here comes that guy with that Illuminati conspiracy theory no we&#x27;re going to leave that behind so in a free market economy everybody is free to earn as much money as they like but only in the form of the dollar or the Euro or whatever currency you have so you&#x27;re not going to be paid in gold anymore for example so if I would have a system which I can with which I can raise my own capital with without borrowing wind from a bank the control of this banking system is lost so naturally they try they do everything to stop this you can even see this in current day technologies like photovoltaics and wind turbines they&#x27;re already already being regulated more and more because of their devaluating capacity it&#x27;s even on the cover of The Economist it&#x27;s not a big secret or conspiracy and that brings me to the second force national governments because governments found out that the true policy that actually works is called an eye for an eye so it&#x27;s constantly jockeying for influence in world affairs and it&#x27;s survival of the fittest basically so imagine when one nation or one party in another nation achieves the ability to generate their own power the balance of power literally shifts from the government to that other nation or party within that nation and everybody will want this technology and at the same time everybody will want to prevent the other from getting it so to prevent this chaos governments do something smart they issue a restriction on any patent or invention that can give an opponent an advantage over the government in power generation it&#x27;s called invention secrecy and it&#x27;s still going strong as the federal agency of American scientists says the third group actually comprised of the deluded inventors who are frost errs if you will which actually are only in it for the money so the problem is most of these don&#x27;t work YouTube is full of them and actually the first two forces use the worst cases of these people to promote the idea that every technology concerning this free energy is a hoax is a scam so nobody believes in it anymore and then there&#x27;s the people who actually have built a device that works but they&#x27;re still in it for the money and then shell comes to their doorstep and says hey here&#x27;s a couple of million dollars go live a happy life but don&#x27;t speak about your technology again so but it&#x27;s a couple of million dollars to a twenty trillion dollar industry anyway now really wondering if somebody from the audience can guess what the fourth forces what is the fourth force that&#x27;s preventing this tech from happening anybody has an idea consumers exactly it&#x27;s all the rest of us it&#x27;s you and me because you see the in the incentives and the motives the first three forces they seem so selfish and so narrow but in reality we share those same motives these forces are literally just different aspects of the same problem it&#x27;s a human one it&#x27;s the greed and it&#x27;s the fear of competition and it&#x27;s that want for power so in the end I believe that this revolution it has to happen within our lifetimes and either it goes horribly wrong and we destroy ourselves in the process or we as a people choose the green transition and we can nowadays because we have the Internet to form a critical mass and spread the information as opposed to let&#x27;s say twenty years ago so that&#x27;s why I challenge you all to do your own research into the subject if you are interested and spread the word because it is up to us to develop this technology that is already there and the first three forces are not going to help us with this and I would like to close with this the true basic need of every human I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s water it&#x27;s not food and it certainly is not money I think it&#x27;s energy and that is why my hope for the future is a world in which energy is free for everybody thank you very much [Music] [Applause] [Music]</p>
