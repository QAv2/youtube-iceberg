            <p>i&#x27;m tim ventura for american anti-gravity and today we&#x27;re joined by dr eugene poglinoff to discuss his experimental research in gravity modification and superconductors for nearly two decades dr poglanov has been researching the link between gravitation and high-temperature superconductors and just recently published the peer-review results of new experiments he&#x27;s conducted to measure the speed of a force beam projected by a stationary superconducting apparatuses developed so let&#x27;s start out by describing the forced beam generator dr poklarov thank you for joining us from what i understand this device pulses a high voltage discharge from marx generator through a stationary superconducting emitter in a magnetic field can you describe that for us a bit yes i will try though the installation is pretty complicated but the principle is pretty simple so we have a typical high voltage discharge the voltage goes up to 2 million or at the exception up to 5 million volts we have a superconducting emitter which is a double layer superconductor one layer is made of superconducting material another layer is made of normal conductor that is the secret of the production but the main requirement to the emitter so during the discharge uh from the van der graaf generator we have an interesting phenomenon that is not typical for usual discharge so this discharge is accompanied by a gravity effect and the emitter emits we can call it virtual gravitons or gravitational waves so they propagate at very high speed to very big distances not losing their energy and they&#x27;re able to interact with normal matter so during last six or seven years we were studying this effect and measuring uh all the phenomena that accompany this effect i should point out that this is very different than the rotating superconductor experiments you conducted in the 1990s and that in the case of the forced beam generator it creates a substantial amount of force i believe you&#x27;ve indicated it was enough to sometimes knock things over in the lab is that correct yes that&#x27;s absolutely correct but if we compare the rotating disk and the impulse gravity generator the principle is the same because we create a high density electric field in both materials so in the rotating disk uh the emission of uh gravity waves is um not so efficient and it is uh pretty slow from all over the surface and during the processes in the impulse gravity generator we have a high disc high voltage discharge and the intensity of the gravity radiation is much bigger though the time is very short it&#x27;s about usually 60 or 70 nanoseconds but the gravity beam is able uh to knock down different objects that stand in the field of the projection area or under certain conditions it is possible to make holes in brick walls and it&#x27;s possible to bend metals so it&#x27;s a very powerful tool now have you been able to measure the amount of force generated and have you found any correlations between the amount of energy used in the marks discharge and the amount of force generated in the beam itself yes we try to make it and there is an article together with professor giovanni moderneze so this is available on the net in los alamos database so sometimes the energy is comparable with what we have in [Music] marx generator but sometimes it is big and we don&#x27;t speak about over unity device but simply we create the conditions when the energy that is inside solid bodies or inside a physical vacuum it can be extracted and sent to a certain direction now you&#x27;d also described a strange effect that was happening behind the beam generator have you been able to explore this at all well we noticed that during the discharge there is a certain emission of radiation on the back side of the device and this radiation has some harmonics and the frequency is not quite clear it&#x27;s pretty difficult to measure it so this effect allows it penetrate this radiation penetrates different materials and it can weld metal objects for example with plastic objects so this is not a pleasant thing but we noticed that this field exists only at the distance of several meters then the intensity goes down so this is this is not not dangerous at all oh okay now are there any thresholds involved with this experiment perhaps maybe it works only over a certain voltage or magnetic field intensity yeah that&#x27;s absolutely right we have usually all the effects at the voltage of half a million volts if it is low then the defect is the effect is not not so obvious and it&#x27;s difficult to notice it but uh the bigger the voltage of course the bigger the effect interesting you know one thing i&#x27;d also wondered about was i believe it was ron kosir had speculated that in a discharge event like this you have a lot of harmonics in the spark itself and he had wondered if maybe that played a role in creating the effect uh maybe maybe i agree with this approach there are a lot of things that we should study more and in detail of course yeah now i&#x27;d like to ask have you discovered any refinements to this process that make it more efficient or powerful yes we noticed that if we want to obtain a really powerful pulse then the [Music] the time of the discharge should be as small as possible and also there is a parameter when the voltage grows up so this erection time of the voltage should be as small as possible uh under these circumstances uh the pulse becomes extremely powerful so that you can make holes in metals and at big distances the energy is not lost at all oh okay so reducing that ramp up time for the voltage is important then now how many experiments have you conducted with this so far probably hundreds right because you&#x27;ve been working probably hundreds yes yeah and this goes back i think about 10 years right yes i think the first article appears in 2000 or 2002 something like this and we were working uh very hard with this topic well just recently you published a paper on these experiments titled the study of light interaction with gravity impulses and measurements on the speed of gravity impulses which you co-authored with dr giovanni modernise and that describes the propagation speed of the force beam now in that paper you guys had actually done a lot of measurements on the speed and it looks like you use two different types of measurement devices right right so our main goal was uh first of all to determine the speed of the gravity impulses and to study the interaction of the gravity impulses with laser beam and in fact there are two parallel experiments and the results pretty amazing because first of all we were maybe the first team who tried to determine the speed of the propagation of the gravity impulses at the distance of more than one kilometer and we used very precise equipment we used rubidium atomic clocks two of them synchronized clocks and we were able to determine with high precision the propagation speed of the gravity impulses and we repeated these experiments for nearly half a year and we use different voltages we use different conditions different emitters but practically always with a very good precision and low duration we got the figure of 64 c which means that the gravity impulse is propagating at the speed 64 times faster than the speed of light wow wow now because of this massively high propagation speed it does that increase the margin for error in your experimental measurements no the the area of the measurements is very low first of all because rubidium atomic clock is a very powerful is a very precise device and also we repeated the experiments many times we also used very sensitive piezoelectric sensors and the measurements are described exactly with a good precision in our article so we think that and we&#x27;re practically sure that of course there is a small place for an era but it is really small well you know in reading through the experiment you guys had done amazingly detailed write-ups on this and it was very carefully conducted so that the piezo crystals respond if i understand this correctly to changes in pressure and so they&#x27;re picking up a mechanical change and the other experiment you had done for measurements almost looked like a wave interferometer would that be accurate yes we can say so and so the second experiment was when we had a laser beam which of uh situated in uh in the projection area of the uh gravity beam so that uh the laser beam was at a small angle along the propagation line of the gravity beam and we had the distance of about 60 meters uh where the gravity where the laser beam crossed the projection area of the gravity impulse and we noticed that the intensity of the laser beam was changing when the pulse was activated and the intensity diminished up to seven or nine percent under certain conditions that depended on the voltage of the discharge but it&#x27;s pretty obvious that the gravity pulse can blow away some photons some particles that propagate inside this area and though the action was very small but the devices are quite precise so again we cannot say that there was something wrong with the measurements and again it was repeated several times so it&#x27;s a very interesting phenomenon well and at 64 times the speed of light that&#x27;s very different than i think what relativity has described although at the same time i&#x27;ve seen a lot of models that place the speed of gravity as being much higher do you know of any support in physics for that particular speed or is there anything that indicates that that might be something that we could expect to see in these experiments well first of all if we speak about the theory of relativity dr einstein never limited the speed of gravity so he didn&#x27;t even discuss these problems so from his point of view uh there is no contradiction also the gravity wave practically has no mass and we can call it a gravity wave which means gravity wave is in fact a distortion of media what media do we distort it&#x27;s what we call ether or subatomic particles several orders of magnitude smaller than the electron they have no friction when they interact with each other with other particles they have no mass so there is not a surprise when the gravity [Music] wave goes with a speed much faster than the speed of light also during solar eclipses it was noticed in earlier times and during uh recent years that uh during the eclipse uh when we watch the sun or some other planets the information comes to us uh with the delay and so when we see the eclipse the planets are already in the other position because they move pretty fast uh in space and uh i think that russian astronomer kosary was the first who measured the radiation which comes from the sun and other stars so that radiation is pretty powerful and that means that this radiation comes much faster than the speed of light and our experiments with laser beam shows that really the gravity uh rays of gravity beam it can take the particles of light and move them with very high speed so that&#x27;s the way how we determine them and that&#x27;s the way how causality determined them in the first place yeah you know dr tom van flandren had told me in a previous interview years ago that when orbital calculations are being done orbital calculations always assume an infinite speed of gravity as opposed to you know having it limited by the speed of light and heat actually said that you know if you substituted the value c those calculations would not be accurate and the planets literally would not orbit the sun the way that we know that they do so i think there&#x27;s a lot of supporting evidence for a much higher speed of gravity now i guess i probably should back up a little bit and ask is this force gravity or is that something that i think yourself and others have called it just because we&#x27;re not really sure what else to call it uh well i usually approach all this research as an experimental uh physicist and uh for example giovanni madaneza he approaches this as a theoretical physicist so he&#x27;s very accurate in giving corresponding terms to all the events so he calls it a gravity like impulse and i call it simply a gravity impulse because during last two years we made a considerable advance in this research and uh using all the information that we had before we have now the technology which allows us to make objects heavier or lighter if they are in the vicinity of a new device which we call an artificial gravity generator so i&#x27;m pretty sure that if we make the objects heavier or lighter this is gravity now with that description you&#x27;re talking about the the rotating superconductor research as well right yes that&#x27;s right okay so you&#x27;ve also continued your research in that area uh yes of course and uh if we speak about superconductors now we understand that superconductors were extremely useful as model materials because they allow us to create any configuration of the magnetic field that we want but we can actually work without superconductors using normal conductors and some other composite materials and they give practically the same effect or even better effect than superconductors so we now turned back to rotating disks with composite structure and these disks under certain conditions can create a gravity field so we are working with rotating disks and also with rotating magnetic fields which are practically the same thing as rotating body but so but uh uh in a in a bit different way so the mechanism is a bit different so would it be potentially possible then to eliminate the superconductor entirely and go completely to a rotating magnetic field yes that&#x27;s right so our last research shows that working with composite material that do not include superconductors at all we are able to create gravity fields in space in the air in different objects and all the objects in the vicinity of our artificial gravity generator we can control their weight now have you published any papers describing that because that&#x27;s not something i&#x27;m familiar with but i would love to read more about it no these things are entirely new so we haven&#x27;t published any materials yet because this is part of our know-how and we also prefer not even to make any patents at present because we would like to go directly from the stage of research to the stage of engineering and application yeah i understand that you&#x27;ve been looking seriously at commercial applications for all of these technologies can you tell me about a few of the applications that particularly catch your interest well the main application of course will be the transportation system it will be a new transportation system on the planet earth and in space because our technology allows to move very heavy objects with big speed or on the contrary with very low speed we do not pollute the environment we don&#x27;t have any radioactive materials the system does not produce noise doesn&#x27;t produce exhaust gases so and takes very small amounts of energy to activate it so it&#x27;s practically the dream of every engineer at the same time parallel to transportation we can speak about energy production new energy production plants which are based on artificial gravity generators because any turbine can be half of the turbine can be made heavier or lighter and it will begin to rotate just by itself so it&#x27;s a new approach which will later eliminate all oil or gas burning power plants also we want definitely to eliminate radioactive materials and our systems are reliable very safe and much more efficient that the systems that people use at present and definitely uh speaking about the future of these artificial gravity generators we can speak about uh traveling to different planets because now it will be much easier than with primitive rockets and we can speak about mining in space because with our systems we can uh bring pretty big asteroids to the earth very slowly not burning in atmosphere and if needed we can move very high very heavy objects to the earth orbit so if we want to make a series of space stations that is not a problem but definitely a lot of research and engineering work should be done and where we think that we are approaching this stage well i should ask how people can get in touch with you if they&#x27;d like to learn more about your work do you have a website set up for what you&#x27;re doing or some of the commercial applications of it no i don&#x27;t have a website yet so people who are really interested in in this research and people who are interested in investments they can contact me directly of course i do not work alone i have a team of scientists from different countries from italy united states britain russia and we&#x27;re a good scientist with a lot of professors with phd degrees so we are not inventing something we are very serious we are very responsible people i do not think that it is good to make a website because and also we would not like to demonstrate anything to people because i&#x27;m not david copperfield i do not work with tricks it&#x27;s pure science and a very serious science so everything can be discussed i&#x27;m open to communications absolutely well and i will definitely forward people your way as well well we&#x27;re out of time today but i want to thank you again for joining us and i hope to speak with you again soon as your research continues to move forward thank you very much i hope this will be the beginning of the new era in the gravity research thank you again</p>
