            <p>Nicola Tesla invented technology a century ahead of his time. So why did the world try to erase him? They told you Thomas Edison was the genius who gave us electricity. But Tesla&#x27;s inventions could have changed the entire world. Free energy, wireless power, and global communication decades before anyone else. When Tesla proposed sending power through the airs, no limits, investors pulled out because free energy can&#x27;t be sold.</p>
<p>Soon after his lab burned down, his patents vanished, and his name faded from history books. Tesla&#x27;s dream wasn&#x27;t just electricity. It was freedom. Power for everyone owned by no one. And maybe that&#x27;s the real reason his ideas were buried.</p>
<p>He once said, &quot;The present is theirs. The future for which I really work is mine.&quot; They erased his name, but not his truth. Follow Hidden Truths TV for more stories they tried to silence.</p>
