            <p>hello this is Dr Ron W SATs founder and chair of the international Society of unified science this is part four of my paper theory of unit space time and displacements from unit space time material and Cosmic photons sub atoms and atoms please uh pause the video here table for subatomic and intermediate particles I want you to take a look at uh each line leave the masses M neutrino masses Cosmic neutrino massless M or material Neutron masses Cosmic Neutron chargeless material proton charged material proton chargeless Cosmic proton charge C proton material compound Neutron you can see that this is a compound structure it&#x27;s an intermediate particle with two photons two R and one half r similarly a cosmic compound Neutron 1 12 R and 2 R material hydrogen here and Cosmic hydrogen here this column has to do with rotational displacements this is effective rotational displacements rotational speed rotational frequency where again R is the rird frequency and this is the calculated mass in year note on an electric charge electric charge in the cocal system is a one-dimensional rotational vibration the natural unit value is R over Pi the rotation reverses at the end of each Revolution therefore the cycle takes twice as long as a uniform rotation a negative charge in time therefore has the frequency R over 2 pi a positive charge in space has the frequency 2 R over pi an electric rotational displacement in time can take a rotational vibrational displacement in space positive charge an artic rotational vibrational displacement in space can take a rotational vibrational displacement in time a negative charge let me just back up on that last sentence I should say an electric rotational displacement space can take every R ational vibration displacement in time negative charge okay continuing material atom of atomic number Z equivalent to Z electric time displacements can take Z positive charges space displacements regardless of its actual number or type of electric displacements a cosmic atom of atomic number Z equivalent to Z electric space displacements can take Z negative charges time displacements regardless of its actual number or type of electric displacement a material proton has one net electric time displacement due to the magnetic displacement so it can take one positive charge but it also has one electric space displacement so it can also take a negative charge similarly for the cosmic proton this proton has one net electric space displacement due to its magnetic displacement so it can take one negative charge but it also has one electric time displacement so can take a positive charge the observed negatively charged quote antiproton can therefore either be a negatively charged material proton or negatively charged Cosmic proton given the energy requirements and accelerators it is likely however that the observed quote anti-proton is a negatively charged Cosmic proton also note that the material positron is not an anti-particle the electron or a cosmic particle likewise the cosmic positron is not an anti-particle for the cosmic electron or a material particle note on mass the mass calculation for the material particles is given in detail in reference 13 the corresponding subatomic and intermediate particles in the cosmic sector have the exact same masses the first real atoms are dyum and Cosmic duum and this is shown in table four M duum and C dyum you can see the photon frequencies the rotational displacements the effective rotational displacements rotational speed rotational frequency and the calculated mass and U for convenience the spin representations for atoms and C atoms are reduced Ed to just giving one set rather than two because they are identical so for instance mum can be specified simply as two hyphen 1 hyphen parentheses 1 and cerium can be specified simply as parentheses 2 hyphen parentheses 1 hyen one each rotational system is equal to Unity so the mum and Cosmic uterum must have the same mass see magnetic moments of electron proton and neutron in the reciprocal system none of the sub atoms have intrinsic magnetic moments or charges but similar to diamagnetic and paramagnetic matter a magnetic charge two dimensional rotational vibration may be temporarily induced in them normally electropositive elements those with the electric time displacement are paramagnetic positive whereas Electro negative elements there electric space displacement are di magnetic or negative the proton has an electric space displacement usually takes a rotational vibration space positive charge over the net electric time displacement apparently the net electric time displacement dominates here so the proton acts as a paramagnetic a paramagnet a positive Magnetic Moment can be induced in it the electron also has an electric space displacement but takes a rotational vibration in time negative charge here the electric SP displacement seem is to do a therefore a negative Magnetic Moment can be induced in it compound neutron has both electric space and electric time displ between and is therefore unstable electric space displacement from the proton rotation dominates so a negative Magnetic Moment can be induced in it further work including quantitative calculation needs to be done here the nutrino mass and energy flavor changes the M neutrino can be identified as the electron nutrino and the C nutrino can be identified as the anti-electron nutrino in conventional terminology of course the mass slam Neutron can be identified as the muon neutrino and the mass C Neutron can be identified as the anti neuron neutrino there are no other neutrinos so it&#x27;s probable that the tal neutrino is really just the M neutrino and the anti- toown nutrino is really just the C neutrino neutrinos in the reciprocal system have zero Mass which contrasts with conventional Theory which says that they have a small Mass which is necessary to explain the quote oscillation between flavors according to reference 36 published in 1973 the mass of the electron neutrino 60 electron volts and the mass of the MU on neut Trina was less than 1.6 electron volts according to reference 34 published in 2008 the mass of the electron neutrino is between 0 and 200 me the mass of the muon nutrino is between 9 and 200 M and the mass of the Town nutrino is between zero and 200 200 M so the estimates have come down considerably over the period from 1973 to 2008 the different Transformations termed flavor changes are as follows using effective displacements M neutrino plus a mass M electron equals a mass m Neutron and you can see how we&#x27;re using the effective displacements in these equations here A C neutrino plus a massless c electron equals a massless c Neutron a massless m Neutron plus a mass m positron equals an m neutr and a massless c Neutron plus a massless C positron equals a c neutr all of these masses particles are carried at at the speed of light by the SpaceTime progression but are refracted when moving through matter or sea matter there&#x27;s essentially a constant flux of these particles throughout the Universe similar to the flux of photons therefore the combinations of happen on a regular basis so for example an En trino created from solar energy generation can combine with a masses an electron on its way to the Earth and Comm masses and neutron Etc reciprocal system can also explain the variation of neutrino energy levels the ground state Photon frequency for the material neutrino and massless neutron of 2 R can be increased to practically any frequency according to reference 46 page 47 neutrinos from Supernova 1987a had individual energies of 10 million electron volts this means they were essentially rotating gamma photons but the reference say these are quote anti-nutrients which is quite unlikely they were actually the normal electron neutrinos dimensional theory has a difficult time explaining the energy of the neutrinos whether they have zero mass or very small Mass E calculation of average lifetime of the compound Neutron reference 13 gives the reciprocal system equations for calculating the average lifetime and half lives of heavy radioactive isotopes here an alpha particle is ejected in the case of neutron Decay a proton is ejected together with a cosmic neutrino and an electron the neutron completely decomposes the charges are created in the process the mean lifetime depends on the natural unit of time together with an exponential function as with the radioactive elements but the natural units are different for the neutron the natural unit of energy to use is equal to one electric time displacement equal to two atomic mass units expressed in terms of me therefore Z equal 0.5 which is the effective atomic number for H1 and the proton and the neutron compound neutral and so we get the uh equation for to you can read it there equation 38 and the result is 83988 6486 seconds the one in the second numerator means one M this calculation is unforunately a quote oneoff because there&#x27;s no other case sumar to this for a material particle so it&#x27;s not possible to provide additional confirmation reference 34 page 22 and reference 50 page 1142 say the mean lifetime of the neutron is 8886 seconds reference 49 page 1337 says it&#x27;s between 877 and 926 seconds reference 48 page 9 hyen 131 says it&#x27;s 1,0 seconds reference 36 page 237 reference 45 page 45 says it&#x27;s 932 seconds reference 41 page 109 says it&#x27;s 865 seconds reference 47 page 99 says it&#x27;s 889 seconds reference 40 page 23 says it&#x27;s 935 seconds in general the newer references give lower values isn&#x27;t it odd that according to Conventional Theory National physics stable atoms can contain unstable neutrons and stable stars like quote neutron stars can be constructed out of unstable neutrons Professor Shu gives a conventional answer in reference 41 page 111 he says quote because of Po&#x27;s Exclusion Principle protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom are arranged in discrete energy levels much as the electrons in the shells of an atom are the guiding principle in both cases Po&#x27;s Exclusion Principle which forbids two identical Fons to occupy the same Quantum state but why should neutrons or protons or electrons obey Po&#x27;s Exclusion Principle the sub atoms don&#x27;t know poly the observe free proton neutrons and electrons can have the same energy level as the gra now we come to section four atoms a periodic table of elements and C elements the periodic tables are given in the appendex which we&#x27;ll get to in the later part of this lecture the figure after the matter table shows the rotational axes of the material atom the figure after the catter table shows the rotational axes of the see at the alternation of magnetic and electric displacements is very logical and one can clearly see the Symmetry between the matter table and the catter table the cical system periodic table for matter first appeared in my book reference 9 Pages 42 to 43 the masses of the elements in C elements reference 13 gives the equations for the calculation of the isot es of all matter elements to get the corresponding masses for the Isotopes of the cosmic sector we simply invert the equations 25 given in that paper and you can see the equations here there&#x27;s one equation for Z subc greater than or equal 10 and there&#x27;s one for Z Sub C greater than one or less than 10 remember Z sub Cal 1 is um you know for the height of dyum okay so where you sub see is Cosmic atomic number and G subc is the number of cosmic gravitational charges the inverse is based on the equivalent atomic number not the equivalent atomic weight hence the four in the numerators these equations do take into account the mass defect so they are more exact than previous such equations such as those in reference 22 Z sub Cals 1 forum is special case and the mass simply 2.14 169 251 U by symmetry table five follows so this is the table you can see the element the Val of Z and then a which is atomic mass then G which is a number of I charges and then we have the the calculations both in terms of VI and in terms of En electron for you can study this table in the paper so that&#x27;s table five Cosmic Isotopes and those are the most probable um we&#x27;re assuming here that spased from the matter table in refence 13 assuming a magnetic ionization level of one the same Flux Of nutr is observed in our sector at the current out the column on the right is the value the mass NES of meev so equation 39 here 39 C and 39d give give the Valu inp just conversion in the material environment Cosmic Isotopes can pick up material gravitational charges so this is when they come here by means of say cosmic rays or created in our particle Labs it&#x27;s often the case with experiments and accelerators equations 9d are then modified to 39e and 39f you can see T subm is small integer it can&#x27;t be more than two times T subp where T subp is the number pencil magnetic rotational displacements usually though not necessarily g subc equals zero and G subm is not some sample calculations follow together with particle identifications so we can express the functional format in equations above here and we get this table the second column gives the conventional identification so we see some side particles n particles omga Ada Z Delta Sigma Pi muon don&#x27;t know what the C Krypton 72 is question mark not sure what the conventional identity is and then the K after the kons these are the important Cosmic isotypes that we observe and it&#x27;s the general Decay sequence there are hundreds of possible Cosmic Isotopes the cical system database makes it easy to enter them by providing ranges one can then input the number of material gravitational charges to obtain the total mass in U or M or when can inut the observe mass and determine the most likely Val of G subc for the cosic no Isotopes when the neutron was discovered in 1932 by Chadwick the scientific Community assumed that it was a constituent of the nucleus SoCal nucleus of the atom and was the explanation for Isotopes and atom building however in the decades since it&#x27;s been determined that mutron addition plays only a minor role in atom building there&#x27;s no major major flux of neutrons but there is a remarkably high flux of neutrinos reciprocal system asserts that neutrinos can obtain a magnetic charge a two-dimensional rotational vibration in space and thus become trapped in matter two-dimensional rotational vibration in space induces a two-dimensional rotational vibration in time a quote gravitational charge in the associated atom this is equal to 1 AMU at building thus takes place by neutrino addition everywhere in the material sector not by Supernova as assumed by conventional Theory the recent discovery of iron in Intergalactic space proves this the Davis neutrino detector made use of the following reaction that&#x27;s chlorine a certain isotope of chlorine plus the electron neutrino converts to argon plus an electron this shows in effect how neutrinos are the source for Isotopes and atom building not neutrons see below for more details it usually takes two magnetically charged neutrinos to move to cause the atom to move up the periodic table table five lists many Cosmic isotopes with masses less than that of the muon these should be considered as predictions by the reciprocal system they&#x27;ll have to be assiduously looked for in the aftermath of proton antiproton collisions accelerators some miscellaneous Cosmic elements Larson gives tables for the barion resonances and Mison resonances and reference one second edition Pages 205 208 the Sigma Series Lambda series Z series N series Delta series are there recently many heavier particles have been discovered the maximum number of gravitational charges equals 2 * 5 = 10 giving 9 9, 31198 322 MV plus the small inverse Mass if the observed particle is greater than this mass then it cannot be the cosmic isot the Kon or k meon plays a prominent role in particle physics lson explains this particle as follows reference one second edition page 199 quote the standard technique for the production of transient particles therefore is to use protons or hydrogen atoms which fragment protons as the raw material for Cosmic atom Del the high energy environment that is created in the production apparatus the particle accelerators the proton which is M1 Hy one hyen parentheses one ejects an electron m0 0 hyen parentheses 1 using effective displacements and then separates into two massless neutrons M12 1 half zero Each of which converts to a half Cosmic proton atom that is one of the rotating systems of that atom by direct inversion these half Cosmic Krypton atoms cannot add displacement and become muons because they are unable to dispose of the proton Mass which persists as a gravitational charge half of the normal sizes the proton has only one rotating system they remain as particles of the distinct type each with half of the cosmic Krypton Mass 52 me and half of the 931 me mass of a normal gravitational charge the total being 492 me they can be identified as kons or kons The observed mass of which is 495 excuse me 494 me as can be seen from the foregoing the initial production of transient Cosmic particles in the accelerators is always accompanied by a copious production of chons and quote not on electron electric charge of cosmic elements the charged pons plus and minus have 4.59 358 me more mass than the neutral Pon this is 110 times the mass contribution of positive charge of a proton to the proton&#x27;s mass further research is needed here to explain this charge effect of some Cosmic elements some miscellaneous Cosmic elements lison gives tables for the baron resonances and Mong resonances in reference one second edition Pages 205 to 208 the uh Sigma Series Lambda series I series N series Delta series are there okay so on second okay moving on P 67 we already did this previous page okay we&#x27;re back true identity of the wz and higs bong and to left W ban Reserve mass is 8.43 giga electron volts from reference 50 page 11 l 1 that converts to 86. 31617 U using the reciprocal system database for material isps one can see that this particle could be Krypton with G subm 15 ridum with G subm = 13 Sr G subm = 11 y with G subm = 9 draconium with G subm = 7 MB with G subm = 5 m o with G subm = 3 or teum with the G7 one smaller numbers would be favored and accelerated so most likely the W poson is two Z boson The observed mass is 91.8 75 gig electron volts which is 9789 3807 U using the reciprical system database from materialized stps one can see that this particle could be many of the elements in mod 3D at the periodic table however the most likely element is indium g subm equals zero three now for the famous Hicks bosons and just one two hick bosons have been discovered with mass is given as 123.5 GV = 132.5 82703 U and 126. 6 GB equal 1359 10689 U these particles are most likely cesium with gmal 23 or 26 prediction because there are many ice typs of cesium there could be many more supposed P bosons to be quote found elements to the right of cesium from barium to europium and the periodic table are rare elements these could be created in accelerators and match them aspects of the higs bons but cesium is a much more common element for the tpon The observed mass is 17841 MV reference 49 page 1182 which is 1.91 531 U this is close to the mass of cerium 2.12 U however the tel particle does not change to material Dum rather it decaying Neons pons kons Etc so a more like possibility is that it is C helium 5 with one Cosmic gravitational charge and one material gravitational charge giving a mass of 1675 but that&#x27;s a little low so more research is needed here d alpha and beta radioactivity material atoms the general equation for Alpha radioactivity is and you can see the equation there in ref in excuse me equation 41 where X of n goes to X of nus 2 plus n Alpha pi and reciprocal system notation with the first number being rotational Mass 2 Z and the second number being rotational vibrational Mass that&#x27;s gravitational charges or isotopic charges the general equation is 2z plus 2 subm goes to 2z - 4 + 2 Sub n + 4 +0 where for clarity a plus sign is is rather thany equation for beta radioactivity is and you can see the equation there X subn goes to X ofn plus or minus one plus uh an electron orron plus uh neutrino either electron neutrino or anti-electron neutrino electrons and positrons with their charges are created in the process the neutrino is originally present in this case not created in process if a cosmic nutrino comes out this means that it had originally created uh negative gravitational charge in the isot so the mass would be less than 2C in radioactive decay say from uranium 238 to LED 206 the process precedes by both Alpha and beta Decay quote the loss of the rotational Mass necessitates beta emission to restore the equilibrium between rotational and B veral Mass it&#x27;s reference to page27 and here you can see table seven Cosmic adom building sequence and Accel and accelerators Cosmic adom buildup process and accelerators sequences as follows based on reference 1 second edition page 203 reference one second edition page 202 203 quote in the atom building process in a high energy environment expent the necessary energy is readily available and essential task is to provide the required Mass this applied in the form of see Krypton atoms Mass 5 1.73 m each the full sequence of cosmic atoms in the building process therefore consist of a series of elements the successive numbers of which differ by F2 m p shows this to be at least approximately true we&#x27;ll stop at this point we&#x27;ll continue paper will be continued in the next SL</p>
