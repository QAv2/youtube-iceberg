            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In this world, if an 18-year-old awakens a lord&#x27;s talent, they have the opportunity to enter the battlefield of the myriad races vying for supremacy. The Dragon Sea Kingdom has existed for 5,000 years. Countless powerful humans paved the way for the continuation of their race, paving the way for the struggle for supremacy among all races to give humanity a place to survive in the battlefield of countless races fighting against other races. However, to date, the Dragon Sea Kingdom and even Blue Star are only at the very bottom of the battlefield of the myriad races vying for supremacy. Countless powerful alien races from other star systems also want to devour this ancient and mysterious blue star.</p>
<p>The man has been in this world for 12 years, and today is the day humanity awakens its lordly talent. Lyn Sha, frank talent piece. Next, the middle-aged man beside the testing stone tablet announced indifferently. Lyn Sha silently walked off the stage. The students laughed mockingly.</p>
<p>The top student from Jangdong number three middle school only had an F- level talent. With only an F-rank talent, you&#x27;d be nothing more than cannon fodder in the battle of all races. Haha. Peaceful talent reduces monster hostility by 10%. At this moment, a girl with a cold and aloof demeanor stepped out from the crowd.</p>
<p>Lord Talent Test, please remain quiet. She looked at Lyn Sha as he approached and said softly, &quot;Leave the rest to me.&quot; Lyn Shia nodded and watched her walk toward the testing stone tablet. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chu Yui, the city lord of Jangdong City. Today, you have completed the Lord talent test and are ready to enter the battlefield of the war of all races.&quot; On the other side of the enormous portal in the plaza, radiance shone brightly. Chu Yusi dressed in a suit stood there.</p>
<p>In 5 minutes, the battlefield for the struggle for supremacy among all races would begin. On the battlefield, there will be death and injury, but glory and achievement await you. May your future be bright, and may the dragon sa kingdom prosper. Long live humanity. With a chorus of shouts, the portal suddenly opened and blazing light shone down.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha felt a sudden brightness before his eyes and his body involuntarily entered a bizarre and fantastical time space passage. A few seconds later, a cold voice sounded in my ear. Biometric verification successful. Lord&#x27;s identity confirmed. Welcome to the battlefield of the myriad races.</p>
<p>You are in the Lon region. You have arrived in your territory and gained 10 minutes of invincibility. Before he could finish speaking, Lyn Sha found himself surrounded by desolation. Beneath his feet lay hard ground, and in the distance stood the Lord&#x27;s mansion, a level zero structure. The surrounding area consisted of simple buildings and logging camps.</p>
<p>The territory was enclosed by a wooden fence, and the outside world was blurred under the shroud of light. Lord&#x27;s talent confirmed. The voice of the supreme god continued to ring out. Talent confirmed. SSS level talent.</p>
<p>Eternal peace. Lyn Sha saw the SSS level talent displayed on the panel eternal peace. He had never seen such a talent before. He quickly sat down cross-legged, the tattoo on his wrist flashing, and then issued the command. Open personal panel.</p>
<p>Lin Sha level one attributes strength 17 spirit 18 constitution 15 soul 25 skills unrestricted mixed martial arts d rank all weapon mastery d rank all unit command d rank farming s rank combat power rating 18 stars lord&#x27;s talent eternal peace click to view lin sha confirmed his attributes the average person&#x27;s four attributes strength, spirit, body, and soul are usually between 8 and 10, but his values have exceeded those of ordinary people. He continued examining the SSS level talent and discovered that it was upgradable. The talent was divided into five parts. Heaven and earth stand firm. Increases the spiritual energy concentration of the territory by five times and the probability of sudden events by five times.</p>
<p>life and destiny increases crop output speed and mineral extraction speed by five times. Continuing the lost learning of the sages increases learning speed by five times allows unlimited learning of any skill and enables the teaching of others. Eternal Peace increases building construction upgrade and production speed by 100% and increases city defense system defense by 100%. Peace for all ages. Conflict increases troop, divine beast, and hero attributes by 20%, loyalty by 20%, troop production by 100% and allows access to the divine perspective.</p>
<p>This talent is simply unparalleled, especially the establishing the heart of heaven and earth and continuing the lost learning of the sages, which shocked Lyn Sha. Immediately Lynn Shao realized the mysterious token in his mind that had transported him to this world. He hurriedly checked it and the system issued a notification. Unknown item detected in player. You have obtained one Hasha token.</p>
<p>Hasha token. Unknown level item bound. Upgradeable. Current progress 1%. Function summoning of China.</p>
<p>Consumes energy to summon Chinese troops, mythical beasts, heroes, and buildings of the highest quality. Energy 1/1. Function: Heroic Spirit Possession summons the heroic spirit of a Chinese emperor to possess you, granting you imperial abilities for 24 hours. Energy 1/1. Function: Ascension: Consumes energy to ascend any item, skill, unit, or hero to the highest level.</p>
<p>Energy 1/1. 5 minutes have passed. His invincibility is about to end and his territory is facing a monster threat. Recruit troops immediately. Lyn Sha took out a recruitment talisman.</p>
<p>Recruitment talisman. Quality. Common. Function description. Recruit 10 soldiers of common quality per team.</p>
<p>Ordinary recruitment tokens can generally only summon militia whose combat power is relatively weak. Although there are other advanced runes, Lyn Sha can only use this ordinary recruitment token for now before entering the battlefield of the myriad races. All lords talents will be revealed within 24 hours, and many wealthy lords will prepare highlevel items for their descendants. If you are unprepared, the main god will give you three items of the lowest quality: recruitment token, leader token, and heroes token. Lyn Sha made up his mind.</p>
<p>He used Hasha summoning, consuming one unit of energy to summon a unique Hasha troop. With a wave of Lin Xiaos hand, the ordinary recruitment talisman transformed into a golden talisman in the bright light, interwoven with auspicious clouds and mythical beast patterns. A portal appeared. 10 figures emerged, each clad in fishcale armor and wielding a 3meter long weapon, the blade of which was fitted with a sharp double-edged sword. These soldiers had resolute faces and cold expressions.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha noticed that they seemed slightly puzzled when they first arrived. The leader approached Lin Shiao and knelt on one knee. &quot;Your subordinate, Tanggi, greets your lordship.&quot; The other nine echoed in unison, &quot;Greetings, your lordship. No need for formalities, please rise. Lynn Shiao waved his hand, then began to observe their attribute panels.</p>
<p>Emo Dao iron guard tangi race humania level one quality legendary attributes strength 38 + 8 spirit 15 + 3 constitution 35 + 7 soul 10 + 2 combat power 31 stars skills divine valor pillar of strength bloodthirsty frenzy slash with the trend slash against the trend ordinary ary soldiers typically have a combat strength of 1 to three stars. While these Mod Dao iron guards have a combat strength 10 times that of ordinary soldiers, they also enjoy the 20% all attribute bonus from Lin Xiao&#x27;s eternal peace conflict. He looked at Tang Yi and said in a deep voice, &quot;Are you Chinese?&quot; Tanggi looked up and replied, &quot;Yes, good. This is the battlefield of all races.&quot; Lyn Xiaos voice suddenly rose. My iron guards, now that you have joined my ranks, you must fight alongside me in every battle.&quot; Tangg Yas eyes flashed with fervor.</p>
<p>And then the 10 men shouted in unison, &quot;We swear to serve our lord to the death.&quot; &quot;Ding!&quot; Tangg Yi, the iron guard of the Mod Dao, has reached 100% loyalty, ready to go through fire and water. With his loyalty maxed out, Lin Sha nodded in satisfaction. Next, he checked the Lord&#x27;s Manor panel. Lord&#x27;s Manor level zero quality, common defense, 100 + 100. Population capacity 200.</p>
<p>Not bad. The wooden fence can hold out for a while. Lyn Sha smiled slightly. Now that they had the China token, they would continue using it. Lyn Sha believes that sublimation is the fastest recovering active function in the Hasha order.</p>
<p>Function enhancement consumes one energy to upgrade any item/skll/unit/hero to the highest quality. Energy 1/1 automatically refills every 24 hours. A flash of bright light, the sublimation took effect, and the Lord&#x27;s manor instantly transformed. Although still a level zero building, it was more sturdy and majestic than ordinary buildings, and the wooden fence emitted a faint golden light. The territory instantly expanded to 20,000 square meters.</p>
<p>Lord&#x27;s mansion level zero quality. Legendary defense 2,000. Add 2,000. Attributes. Spiritual energy revival.</p>
<p>Luck revival. Abundance power. Healing. Thorn fence. Special building.</p>
<p>Rainbow pool. Click to view. Population capacity. 4,000. Legendary quality is indeed powerful.</p>
<p>The Lord&#x27;s Mansion&#x27;s defense and population capacity have been increased by 20 times, and many other attributes have also been added. Click to view. The rainbow pool produces 10 to 100 units of random resources daily. With five times the luck and the spiritual energy revival attribute, the resources will definitely be good. Lyn Sha thought confidently.</p>
<p>He checked the main god panel and found that the invincibility period was about to end. Tanggi arranged for the Mod Dao iron guards to guard the territory, kill any monsters they encounter immediately. The iron guards of the Mod Dao arrived one after another just as the invincibility period ended and the light screen in the Lord&#x27;s Manor disappeared. The surrounding area was shrouded in the fog of war. Lyn Sha didn&#x27;t rush to act.</p>
<p>Tangg Yi, you stay outside and protect my safety. Yes. Upon entering the lord&#x27;s mansion, although it was a level zero building, the interior was fully equipped and the furniture was exquisite. Lynsha sat down and closed his eyes. Used the skill eternal peace conflict to activate the gods perspective.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha activated the full view perspective and the viewpoint rapidly rose to an altitude of 10,000 m overlooking the entire battlefield. The fog of war was ineffective. However, the celestial perspective cannot cover the entire starting village number 89757 because the map is too large. Celestial perspective 0/1 requires charging. Current progress 0%.</p>
<p>The view lasted only 10 minutes. Lyn Sha adjusted the view and found that the territory was located among a large mountain right at the mouth of a valley. This is a classic gourd-shaped terrain suitable for defense. But if it is blocked by the enemy, the consequences would be unimaginable. Fortunately, there are abundant resources behind the territory which can be used to expand it.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha continued to adjust his view, observing the surrounding resource points and monsters. Iron ore, copper or silver or crystal or everything you could want. There&#x27;s a squad of phantom archers to the west. An excellent unit, quite strong. There is a nest demon next to the mercury mine.</p>
<p>It is a level 30 epic creature and extremely powerful. If you encounter it at the beginning of the game, you will definitely die. The centaur layer is also nearby and it contains elite warriors. The fog of war surrounds all unexplored areas where resources and monsters are hidden. The territory of a new lord may be surrounded by low-level monsters or deadly highle monsters.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha used his divine perspective to quickly explore and memorize all the important information. He began recording information about the area around the valley and scanning the Lord&#x27;s mansion further away. The chat channel in the newbie village number 89757 has become active. Hello everyone, I&#x27;m new here. Please be kind to me.</p>
<p>My name is Dinglay. Please take care of me from now on. The chat exploded instantly. Dinglay, that academic genius with A-level lord talent. I&#x27;ve met a master, an A-rank talent.</p>
<p>Only one in tens of thousands. My E-rank talent. I&#x27;m basically doomed. Just as everyone was preparing to join Dinglays alliance, several unfriendly voices emerged. Is Jang Dong number one middle school really that good? Dingle, is he really a good player? This outrageous provocation immediately sparked outrage among Ding Lay supporters.</p>
<p>Who are you? How dare you speak to Ding Lay like that? The other party retorted dismissively, &quot;I&#x27;m Xiao Datang. I&#x27;m Gene Dang. We&#x27;re from the International Bilingual Academy. So what?&quot; Dinglay was helpless. Although he had A-level talent, he could only carry two excellent recruitment tokens, which was no match for them.</p>
<p>10 minutes later, Lin Shiao ended his celestial perspective. His view returning from the sky to his surroundings. Excellent. Time to begin the exploration. He checked the chat history.</p>
<p>He wanted to reach the top of the leaderboard, obtain massive rewards, and most importantly, get the hero rank one reward. Lyn Sha walked out of the lord&#x27;s hall with Tang Yi guarding in front. Upon seeing Lin Shao, Tanggi immediately bowed and said, &quot;Lord, Tanggi, summon all the Mod Dao iron guards. There are small monsters in the northwest corner that will arrive in three minutes.&quot; Yes, Tang Yi responded and quickly summoned the Mod Dao iron guards. Lin Shao arrived at the northwest corner and noticed the war fog in the distance.</p>
<p>Soon after, several dark-skinned long-toed caveman appeared in the fog. Caveman level one, quality, common power, three stars. Caveman centurion level, four, quality, excellent combat power six stars. Lynn Sha glanced at it disdainfully, then ordered, &quot;Attack!&quot; Tang Yi slashed several cavemen in half with a single stroke. Green blood splattering everywhere.</p>
<p>Tang Yi kills four cavemen, gains 480 experience and four energy. The Mod Dao iron guards advance steadily and quickly clear out the remaining cavemen. Tang Yi killed the caveman centurion and gained 400 experience, three energy, 15 gold coins, two rare leader tokens, and one rare treasure chest. Lyn Sha saw the dropped items. He was lucky.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lyn Sha realized that the energy was used to charge the Hasha token. My lord, the enemy has been wiped out. Please give the order. Dispose of the corpses. No one can use them, Lynsha commanded.</p>
<p>I just happened to get a rare citizen token, which can be used to summon rare farmers to collect resources. Lyn Shia took out two rare leader tokens and one ordinary leader token given by the main god and summon them together. The ascension skill is still on coold down, but he starts the game with a team of rare peasants and a team of regular peasants. Summon farmers. A flash of light appeared and small portals reappeared within the territory from which farmers emerged one by one.</p>
<p>Their clothes were somewhat worn and they carried farm tools, toolboxes or baskets on their backs. 30 farmers walked out of the gate and knelt down to pay their respects. Greetings, Lord. Rise all of you. Lyn Sha nodded in acknowledgement, then began assigning tasks to the farmers.</p>
<p>You go to the forest 300 m west of the territory to cut timber. You go to the mine 50 m south to dig for stones. The rest of you come with me and Tanguan to gather resources. One of the rare farmers suddenly knelt down. My lord, the outside is shrouded in the fog of war, and we have never explored it.</p>
<p>He knew that the fog of war was thick with monsters and dangers, and he feared that the Lord would send peasants to scout ahead. Many lords initially had only 10 peasants, but now they have 30, and they feel that Lin Xiao is sending his peasants on a dangerous mission. Lyn Xiaos eyes flickered, and Tang Yi immediately noticed, slamming his long sword into the ground. Several cracks appeared in the ground. How dare you? The farmers, terrified, immediately knelt down.</p>
<p>Lord, spare us. It&#x27;s all right. Lynn Sha waved his hand. Just go gather resources. Don&#x27;t worry.</p>
<p>I have strong troops protecting me. The location is safe and there are no monsters around. The farmers breathe a sigh of relief and set off. Soon, their voices rang out. I&#x27;ve reached the stone quarry.</p>
<p>There really aren&#x27;t any monsters here. We&#x27;ve reached the forest and we haven&#x27;t encountered any monsters along the way. Let&#x27;s start gathering. As the farmers moved forward, the fog of war gradually dissipated. An even bigger surprise followed.</p>
<p>How come my data collection speed is so fast? Me, too. I&#x27;m not tired at all. It must be the Lord&#x27;s special ability. That&#x27;s great. My abilities are now stronger than an epic peasant.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia smiled slightly, knowing that this was the effect of his talent. Peace for all ages, life and destiny for the people. Sustaining life increases crop output by five times, accelerates crop maturity by five times, and increases resource gathering speed by five times. Even rare farmers have increased their gathering speed by five times, making them as efficient as epic farmers. Lynn Sha responded calmly.</p>
<p>This will make you better farmers. You might even be able to become legendary farmers. The farmers shouted in unison. We commoners will forever follow our lord. Ding.</p>
<p>Your ordinary and rare farmer loyalty has reached 100. At this point, he was ready to proceed with the next step. Lyn Shiao instructed, &quot;You eight farmers. Go with me to collect resources. Tanggi, you take two Mod Dao iron guards and we&#x27;ll go in another direction to clear out the monsters.</p>
<p>The remaining eight farmers will come with me. The remaining two Mod Dao iron guards will guard the territory.&quot; Lynn Shiao divided his forces into two groups, preparing to quickly kill monsters and occupy resource points. The iron guards of the Mod Dao were terrified, and Tangi immediately knelt down to dissuade them. Lord, you must not go into battle personally. My lord, leave the fighting to us.</p>
<p>You are the Lord, and you must not get hurt. In the eyes of the Mo Dao Iron Guards, Lyn Shiao was worthy of their loyalty, but his strength seemed insufficient. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s 18star personal ability is undoubtedly top tier in the beginner zone, but he is still somewhat weak against legendary units. Let&#x27;s try the heroic spirit possession technique. Lin Xiaoing took out the Chinese token and silently chanted, &quot;Use the Chinese token.&quot; Heroic spirit possession function.</p>
<p>Heroic spirit possession consumes one energy to summon the heroic spirit of a Chinese emperor to possess you, granting you some of his abilities for 24 hours. A flash of golden light. What is this? The MO Dao iron guards and the farmers all knelt down, feeling an incomprehensible pressure. As the golden light faded, Lin Sha felt the power of countless heroic spirits of Chinese emperors. At that moment, a valiant phantom slowly approached him and possessed him.</p>
<p>Xiang Ji, Overlord of Western Shu, ability borrowing level one. Fusion level very low. Duration 24 hours. Skills: Supporting Strength: Fathered Valor, Desperate Measures, Overlord Spear Command, Rank A. Xang Yu.</p>
<p>The first time Lin Sha summoned a heroic spirit of China, it was Xiang Yu, one of the strongest emperors in ancient China. Among the five skills, the command a level skill provides a 30% bonus to all attributes for all troop types. When combined with Lin Xiao&#x27;s own talent, it increases the total attributes of all troop types by 50%. Lin Shia checked his attribute panel. Lyn Sha level one attributes strength 17 plus 250 spirit 18 + 100 constitution 15 + 200 soul 25 + 110 skills unrestricted mixed martial arts d rank all weapon mastery d rank farming cir rank lifting strength feathered courage last stand overlord spear command a rank combat power rating 18 stars.</p>
<p>Lord talent. Peace for all ages. These attributes are ridiculously strong. He took out a purple rare quality spear from his backpack. This was a prize he had brought back from the blue star world.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha gripped the spear. It was usable, if not perfect. Rise, all of you, and follow me into battle. Lyn Sha commanded. The iron guards of the Mod Dao raised their heads and looked at Lin Sha with reverence as if they saw a heroic phantom behind him.</p>
<p>We swear to follow our lord to the death. Lyn Shao led Tang Yi and three other Modo Dao iron guards forward. Soon they arrived at a monster encampment guarding a sulfur mine. Upon seeing the few people there, the monsters roared and pounced. Lava giant lizard level eight.</p>
<p>quality, excellent combat power, 10 stars. Dozens of lava giant lizards rapidly approached, but Lynn Shiao calmly swung his spear, activating the overlord spear skill, sweeping away nearly 10 giant lizards. You have killed a lava giant lizard 8, gaining 2,400 experience, eight energy, and 56 gold. Lord, you are mighty. The iron guards of the Mod Dao immediately followed, rushing into the monster horde and slaying the giant lizards.</p>
<p>Your unit, Tanggi, killed two lava giant lizards, gaining 600 experience, two energy, and six gold. Seconds later, all the giant lizards had been killed. However, a huge lava giant lizard lord appeared and pounced on Lyn Sha. Tanggi prepared to fight back, but Lynn Shia preemptively said, &quot;It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve stretched my muscles. Leave it to me.&quot; The lava giant lizard lord charged straight at Lin Shiao, who met it head-on, and punched it in the head, unleashing the power of a pillar, activated, Lin Xiao&#x27;s strength surged.</p>
<p>With a single punch, the lava giant lizard lord&#x27;s head was instantly smashed into the ground. You have killed the lava giant lizard lord, gaining 2,100 experience and five energy. A flash of white light and the voice of the supreme god rang out. Loot equipment. Liaos eyes flickered and he directly obtained three precious items.</p>
<p>A mini tavern, an excellent treasure chest, and a black long sword. The mini tavern is a tiny building model that can be placed directly on your territory to quickly transform it into a real tavern. saving a lot of resources. The excellent treasure chest shimmers with a purple light, and the items inside are guaranteed to be of excellent quality. It is a rare blind box in the battlefield of all races.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha decided not to open it yet. Then he looked at the black long sword. Black long sword quality blue rare. Attributes: base attack 180, strength plus 10, spirit plus 10. Description: A weapon suitable for night battles.</p>
<p>light and sharp with a black blade to reduce glare. Although the sword was good, Lynn Shiao had no need for it. So, he put it up for auction, setting a starting price of 2,000 gold coins and a buy it now price of 3,000 gold coins. At the very beginning of the game, rare equipment can fetch a good price, especially for players who spend money on the game, as they often have a lot of gold coins and vouchers. After finishing these tasks, Lynn Shiao turned to occupy the sulfur mine and instructed the farmers.</p>
<p>You go and collect materials from the lava giant lizards. Follow me when you&#x27;re done. The sulfur or isn&#x27;t needed right now, but these materials must be collected first. Yes. The farmers obeyed, taking out their daggers and beginning to cut the lava giant lizards.</p>
<p>You have obtained five pieces of lava giant lizard meat, five pieces of lava giant lizard hide, and five pieces of lava giant lizard blood. At the same time, a notification sounded. Your unit, the Iron Guard, Tang Chuan, has killed three goblin warriors, gaining 600 experience, three energy, and eight gold. At this moment, there was still a hero&#x27;s token in the backpack. Heroes play a crucial role in the struggle for supremacy among all races, even surpassing lords in importance.</p>
<p>Recruiting heroes requires a tavern, a level one lord&#x27;s manor and a hero&#x27;s token. Lyn Sha happens to have a tavern that can be built quickly, and he only lacks the resources for a level one lord&#x27;s manor. We must race against time and recruit heroes before anyone else. Lyn Shao thought to himself as he led Tangg Yi and the Emo Dao iron guards to continue their battle against the wild monsters. Meanwhile, the chat channel became active again.</p>
<p>I saw a rare blue long sword in the auction house. What rare equipment dropped less than an hour into the game? Wait, was it the sword Lin Sha sold? Lyn Shia? That genius student from Jangdong number three middle school? Yes, the one who&#x27;s number one in the grade. Many new lords flocked to the chat, expressing their desire to add Lin Shiao as a friend, with some even suggesting that he be brought into the alliance. However, Ziao Dang jumped out to mock that so-called academic genius. I&#x27;d like to see just how amazing he is.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha cleared out three monster layers and seized the copper and iron mines. Now, he was preparing to challenge the monster treasure house. Monster treasure house is a rare outdoor building in the battlefield of the waring states with an extremely low appearance rate. The monsters inside are at least level 10 and the strongest can reach level 20 just as he was preparing to lead the moa iron guards to challenge. The main god system suddenly notified him that someone had initiated a video communication request.</p>
<p>Chufinga Lynsha laughed. The video showed a young man with dyed red hair. Chufinga. Of course, this young master is in the same starting village as the famous genius Lin Sha. Chufinga said smugly.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t expect that after you dyed your hair, you&#x27;d also learned so many vulgar words. Does the old man know? Lyn Sha teased. Hey, don&#x27;t mention him. Chufungo waved his hand. Wait, is that the monster treasure house behind you? Dude, you&#x27;re only level one and you&#x27;re already challenging the monster treasure house.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao smiled faintly. We have to try. Chufingo was silent for a moment. Lyn Sha, although your talent is strong, you only have a chance to become stronger if you&#x27;re alive. All right, I understand.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao interrupted him. You know I&#x27;m tough as nails. Fine. Chufing aside. He opened the chat channel and saw many people mocking and disdainful, but he didn&#x27;t care.</p>
<p>Upgrade. Lyn Sha waved his hand to command. The Mod Dao iron guards gained a large amount of experience and quickly leveled up to level three. Thank you, Lord. The iron guards of the Mod Dao clan led in unison.</p>
<p>Lin Shia nodded solemnly. After we enter the monster treasure house, monsters will swarm in from all directions. Lin Sha led Tangg Yi and the other three Emo Dao iron guards into the monster treasure house where they were instantly teleported inside. The scene inside the room relieved Lynn Shiao. Dozens of Minotaur guards were waiting for them.</p>
<p>Minotaur guards level 18. Quality excellent. Combat power rating 48 stars. Skills, high morale, endurance aura, blood lust. These minotaur guards are enormous and wield double axes.</p>
<p>Although powerful, they are physical attack type monsters. The minotaur guards charged forward. Tangg Yi and the other three iron guards with broadswords quickly formed a defensive line, protecting Lin Sha within it. Lyn Shao originally intended to have them retreat, but then he thought it would be a good opportunity to see if the level four Emo Dao iron guards could handle the level 18 Minotaur guards. The Minotaur&#x27;s twin axes slashed down at Tang Yi with a terrifying whooshing sound.</p>
<p>His blood lust skill was activated. The minotaur was preparing for a fatal blow, but Tangi stood firm. The pillar of strength skill of the Mod Dao Iron Guard was activated, greatly increasing his attributes with a significant rise in strength, spirit, and constitution. Pillar of strength. When facing a superior enemy force that outnumbers your own, morale, and attributes are boosted, and the effect is doubled when protecting the lord.</p>
<p>The minotaur guard swung his ax down suddenly, but Tang Yas long sword swiftly swept it away. The long sword struck the minur like lightning, cleaving him in two. Your unit, the iron guard of the Mod Dao, has killed a minur guard, gaining 10,000 experience, 30 energy, and 150 gold. Then came two new enemies. One Minotaur chose to fight head-on, while the other tried to flank Tang Yi.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha gripped his spear, ready to provide support at any moment. Tangg Yi charged at the minur in front of him, slashing down with his sword. The minotaur&#x27;s double axes were easily cleaved in two, and his long sword became stuck in his shoulder armor, blood splattering everywhere. At the same time, the Minotaur s double axes from the side were rapidly closing in on Tang Yi. However, just as the enemy was feeling triumphant, a cold light suddenly flashed and the minur who was attacking from the side was unexpectedly cut in two.</p>
<p>That cold light was the effect of Tang Yi using reverse slash. The blade was extremely fast and the counterattack was even faster. Reversal slash triggered when the enemy blocks or is not instantly killed, delivering another fatal blow. Cannot be dodged or blocked. Upon seeing this, the minotaur in front of them was immediately filled with fear and prepared to continue its attack.</p>
<p>Tanggi sneered and swung his long sword once more. Another flash of cold light appeared and three minotaurs were instantly killed. One of them was the minotaur that blocked the attack headon, while the other two were killed with a single blow as they charged forward. Is this the power of legendary units? Lyn Sha was shocked. A level four unit challenging a level 18 unit, killing four minotaurs with three strikes.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s simply heaven defying. The iron guard of the Mod Dao possesses five powerful skills, each of which is enough to drive enemies to despair. Lyn Shaigh, the Mod Dao Iron Guards are truly unreasonable and powerful. They become stronger when faced with strong opponents, and the more enemies they have, the stronger they become. Suddenly, Lyn Xiaos gaze froze as he recalled memories of his previous life.</p>
<p>The iron guards of the Mod Dao. Lyn Shiao suddenly realized that this Mod Dao soldier was very likely from the Mod Dao army of the Tang Dynasty in his previous life. He recalled a record in the Tang Dynasty&#x27;s six codes. The Mod Dao was carried by infantrymen. The sword weighed 15 caddies, was 7 ft long, with a blade 3 ft long, and a handle 4t long.</p>
<p>The MO Dao army capable of cleaving through Centtor has now cleaved through Minotaur. Doesn&#x27;t that make sense? Lynn Sha smiled, a surge of pride welling up inside him. This Mod Dao soldier truly lives up to his reputation. Chapter 11. It&#x27;s his good fortune to have gotten involved with me.</p>
<p>You have successfully defeated all the guards in the Monster Treasure House. Rewards are being calculated. The voice of the Supreme Deity rang out. Battle results. Annihilate the following enemies.</p>
<p>47 Ta guardians. Excellent. And three Tan elite guardians. Excellent. Battle duration 2 minutes and 11 seconds.</p>
<p>Our casualties zero. Special bonuses. First to break through the monsters treasure house in the entire region. The lord personally participates in the battle and the level difference between the lord and the troop type exceeds 10 levels. Reward one, 235,000 experience, 5,600 gold, 480 energy, five excellent quality spirit fields, one epic quality treasure chest, one scale rock breastplate.</p>
<p>Reward two, 1,000 wood, 1,000 stone, 1,000 iron ore, 1,000 copper, or 1,000 silver, or 100 gold or 100 sulfur. Looking at the reward, Lin Shia exclaimed excitedly. I got an epic treasure chest. What a pleasant surprise. He glanced at the resource panel.</p>
<p>Experience 705,000. Gold coins 13785. Fine treasure chests three dropped by small monsters. Rare treasure chest one. Excellent treasure chest one.</p>
<p>Epic chest one. Other mini tavern one. Excellent quality spirit field five. Black long sword one scaled rock breastplate one special battlefield energy of all races 1250 resources timber 4700 stone 4550 iron or 2,100 copper or 2,100 silver or 1,000 gold or 100 sulfur 100. He decided not to delay any longer and to hurry back to his territory to upgrade the lord&#x27;s manor.</p>
<p>He would recruit heroes after the tavern was built. Tangg Yi summon all the Mod Dao Iron Guards back to the territory, he commanded. Yes, my lord, Tanggi replied. On the other side, Ziao Daong and Jin Dang had just finished their battle. The silverback wolf had been dealt with by the harpy.</p>
<p>Ziao Datong sat down and complained. Damn it, there was actually a rare monster, the silverback wolf. Two of my lizard cavalrymen have died,&quot; Xiaoa Daong said angrily. Gene Dang sighed helplessly. &quot;This is the route you suggested.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s too risky. If we encounter rare monsters that are level 10 or higher, we won&#x27;t even be able to defeat them altogether.&quot; Xiao Datong retorted indignantly. &quot;Who told you not to bring the wild boar rider? Now I have to go into battle myself. My sword is almost dulled. We need to stockpile resources when clearing land.</p>
<p>Look, I&#x27;ve prepared rare hero tokens. Once I recruit heroes, I&#x27;ll definitely be able to sweep through the newbie village. Gene Dang said confidently. Xiao Dong looked at him and said, &quot;You seem quite confident, but look at my combat strength. It&#x27;s not even enough for an eight-star character.&quot; Xin Dang smiled and said, &quot;That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re not Lyn Shao.</p>
<p>You know, he has a combat power of 15 stars, plus the special evaluation from the main god, making him practically invincible in early game ambushes. Xiao Datong gritted his teeth. That guy&#x27;s luck is too good. He even managed to get a black long sword. Gene Dang nodded.</p>
<p>Yes, he fought monsters all by himself, so the main god gave him a higher evaluation. Don&#x27;t you think his combat power would be even stronger if he got that sword? Xiao Datangs eyes lit up. If I had that black long sword, my combat power would be even stronger than a 15 star. The two stared at each other for a moment. Then Ziao Datong whispered, &quot;He dares to sell the sword for 3,000 gold coins? Who would buy that?&quot; Jin Dang suggested, &quot;Why don&#x27;t we force him to sell at a low price?&quot; Xiao Datong laughed.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s just a penniless and powerless wandering lord. How could he possibly withstand our three teams of rare troops? He then sent a message in the chat channel. Lin Shiao, this is Xiao Dong Lizard Cavalry. Click to view with your Franked Talent. It must be tough on the battlefield of the myriad races, right? Your black long sword has been sitting there for so long and no one&#x27;s bought it.</p>
<p>How about we become friends and you give me the sword? I&#x27;ll offer you protection once. How about that? It&#x27;s your good fortune to be able to connect with me. Xiao Datong said confidently. Chapter 12. Opening treasure chest still requires faith in mysticism.</p>
<p>Xiao Dangs comment in the chat channel sparked a round of laughter. Xiao Datang, the lizard knight. That&#x27;s a really strange name. Someone from a prestigious school wants to get Lin Xiao&#x27;s equipment for free. How can you provide protection if you don&#x27;t even have 3,000 gold coins? Isn&#x27;t what brotherhia Dang did inappropriate? I Heay believe this is robbery.</p>
<p>Ziao Dang roared, Shut up. I wasn&#x27;t talking to you. Gene Daong immediately spoke up. I&#x27;m with Xiao Shang. Who has a problem with that? Wild boar rider harpy at heay.</p>
<p>Do you have a problem with this? Disaster talisman. The chat channel was silent for a few seconds. No one dared to speak. These two displayed three rare troop types enough to place them among the top in the starting village. Even more terrifying, Gene Dang also possessed a suppression talisman.</p>
<p>This allows him to legally launch suppressions without being punished by the main god system. Seeing the quiet channel, Xiaoang spoke again with satisfaction. At Lin Shiao, add me as a friend and let&#x27;s chat privately. You did a good job. I&#x27;ll give you a chance to be my friend.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha returned to his territory, saw Xiao Desangs mentions and chat history, and sneered. Sorry, not interested. If you want the equipment, go buy it yourself. After sending the message, Lin Sha closed the chat channel and directly opened the Lord&#x27;s Mansion interface. Lord&#x27;s Mansion level zero quality legendary defense 2,000 plus 2,000.</p>
<p>Attributes spiritual energy revival luck revival abundance power healing thorn fence special building rainbow pool capacity for thousand upgrade requirements for thousand wood for thousand stone 1500 iron ore 1500 copper ore. He chose to upgrade without hesitation. Upgrade countdown 11 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds. Lynhia&#x27;s talent, Eternal Peace, increases building and upgrade speed by 100%. Upgrades that originally took 24 hours now only take 12 hours.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s 11:55 a.m. now, less than 2 hours before the Battle of the Myriad Races begins. He plans to complete the upgrade and recruit heroes before midnight tonight. To deal with the demonic tide, we need to increase our troops first. He decided to open the treasure chest.</p>
<p>In less than two hours, Lynn Shiao had accumulated three excellent treasure chests, one rare treasure chest, one superior treasure chest, and one epic treasure chest. The Lord&#x27;s Manor is being upgraded, and he begins opening treasure chests. Open the superior treasure chest first. You have opened a fine treasure chest one and obtained 1561 fine iron. You have opened a fine treasure chest one and obtained 1734 fine bronze.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha frowned. Looks like I need to wash my hands. He washed his hands again, returned to the Lord&#x27;s manor, and continued opening treasure chests. Open the excellent treasure chest. You have opened a fine treasure chest and obtained the following equipment.</p>
<p>A fine fishbone breastplate. Open the rare treasure chest. You have opened rare treasure chest one and obtained one rare recruitment token. Excellent hard currency. Next, open the excellent treasure chest.</p>
<p>You have opened the excellent treasure chest one and obtained one scale rock shoulder pad. Seeing the scale rock shoulder pads, Lin Shia was in a good mood. Perfect. I got a scale rock breast plate. While farming Tarantin, he checked the equipment attributes.</p>
<p>Scaled rock breastplate set two fifths. Quality purple excellent attributes. Base defense value 155. Strength + 10. Constitution + 10.</p>
<p>Scale rock shoulder pads set two- fifths. Quality purple excellent. Attributes base defense value 85. Strength plus 10. Constitution plus 10.</p>
<p>Special attribute ignores all four stats. Attack speed increased by 3%. Ding. The lord possesses two pieces of the scaled rock heavy armor set. Triggering set bonuses.</p>
<p>Set bonus. Scaled rock heavy armor set. Two-fifths strength plus 10. Constitution plus 10. Lyn Shia smiled with satisfaction when he saw the two pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>Although the epic treasure chest hadn&#x27;t been opened yet, he was already laughing. Opening treasure chests really does require believing in metaphysics. Chapter 13. Are you really archers? I&#x27;ll wear the scale rock heavy armor myself. That way, even without the emperor&#x27;s spirit possessing me, I can still maintain decent combat power.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao said self-deprecatingly. In this way, I&#x27;ll be more like a true wandering lord. Ranger lords are lords who fight for supremacy among all races by relying on their powerful military strength. Unlike other lords who focus on territory development, they invest all their resources in improving themselves. When Lyn Xiao&#x27;s talent awakened, it was at the F rank.</p>
<p>His friends all advised him to take the path of a wanderer. After all, the lord&#x27;s talent was too weak, and he had no background. Only by focusing on improving himself could he survive in the battlefield of the myriad races. Lyn Sha shook his head, dismissing these thoughts, and opened the last treasure chest. The epic treasure chest.</p>
<p>Open the epic chest. You have opened an epic chest and obtained an epic special equipment. Forest witch&#x27;s cloak. Click to view epic level special equipment. Lynhos heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Special equipment generally requires epic or legendary quality to appear. It&#x27;s impossible for it to be of low quality. Lyn Shao quickly recalled the contents of the knowledge base. Moreover, special equipment has unique abilities or attributes. Look at the stats of this forest witch&#x27;s cloak.</p>
<p>A magnificent crimson cloak floated down from the sky and landed lightly in Lin Xiao&#x27;s hands. Forest witch&#x27;s cloak. Special quality orange epic. Attributes. Base defense value 365.</p>
<p>Constitution plus 35. Spirit plus 35. Special abilities. Invisibility rank A. Concealment rank A.</p>
<p>Click to view. Special attribute. Exclusively for females. Non-female wearers will not gain the special ability. Introduction.</p>
<p>Legend has it that it was made by Alice, the witch of the elf forest. It has an elegant appearance and is suitable for women to wear. Lynsha looked at the cloak and couldn&#x27;t help but sigh. This was a powerful special epic equipment with excellent defense, stamina, and spirit attributes. And it also came with two A- rank skills, invisibility and concealment.</p>
<p>This meant that once worn, unless the opponent possessed a gold legendary level ability, they would be unable to break through it. But what puzzled him was the meaning of the exclusively for women attribute. He looked at himself, then at Tang Yi standing not far away, that rough, burly man whose fists could kill an ox. Tang Yi sensed the gaze and turned to look at Lin Shao, revealing a puzzled expression. Lyn Sha turned back helplessly.</p>
<p>Forget it. I don&#x27;t want to think about it anymore. It&#x27;s probably to prevent the Lord from castrating himself for equipment. He stopped thinking about it and continued organizing his plans. The Lord&#x27;s manners still needed 12 hours to upgrade and heroes couldn&#x27;t be recruited until the tavern was completed.</p>
<p>The Hasha token requires 1,000 battlefield energy to charge, while Hasha summon has no cool down and can be used as long as you have energy and items. Lyn Sha thought, I can continue to farm monsters to obtain energy and ensure that I can summon Hasha heroes after the tavern is built. He decided to directly exchange battlefield energy for Hasha token energy. Use 1,000 battlefield energy to exchange for one Hasha token energy. Use the Hasha token, Hasha summon to summon a Huasha exclusive unit.</p>
<p>With a flash of bright light, the blue recruitment token in Linhao&#x27;s hand instantly transformed into a golden Chinese recruitment token decorated with auspicious clouds and featuring mythical beast patterns at the bottom. With a flick of his hand, a portal opened abruptly within the territory and 10 strong figures emerged. The group quickly formed ranks, cautiously surveying their surroundings. &quot;Not bad,&quot; Tanggu praised in a low voice. The leader stopped and after receiving the indoctrination of the main god, he looked up and saw Lin Sha.</p>
<p>He led the team toward him, took off his helmet, and knelt on one knee. &quot;Your subordinate,&quot; Song Ruer greets your lordship. &quot;Get up,&quot; Lyn Shao said calmly, supporting himself with his hand. Song Ruer led his men to their feet, their eyes fixed on the Lord with curiosity and respect. Lyn Sha also sized up the newly summoned soldiers.</p>
<p>The 10 men were clad in heavy iron armor, had burly builds, carried crossbows on their backs, and wielded horizontal swords. They were clearly a squad of archers. &quot;This archer looks even stronger than the iron guards of the Mod Dao. Is he really a ranged unit?&quot; Lyn Shao thought to himself. At this moment, Tangi couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Sui, are you guys archers?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Song Ruer took the huge divine bow off his back and shook it.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t it obvious? And your armor? Tangg Yi pointed to the airtight iron armor. Is this infantry armor? It weighs 60 gene. Yes, our ranged units are weak in close combat, so we wear this thick armor to protect ourselves. Song Ruer explained. That makes sense, doesn&#x27;t it? Chapter 14.</p>
<p>The strongest Chinese ranged unit makes its debut. Excellent spirit field. Weak in close combat. You&#x27;ve worn down the hilt of your knife. You must have killed quite a few people before, right? Tangi looked at the tall and burly Song Ruer in front of him, wondering why this slender ranged soldier seemed so strong.</p>
<p>Soon, his gaze locked on his song Ruer&#x27;s armor, and his eyes lit up. A foot soldier weighing 60 gene. Although it wasn&#x27;t as shiny as his own fish gale armor, it offered much better protection, especially the iron helmet&#x27;s face and neck protection, which Tang Yi greatly envied. Lyn Sha was speechless at the sight of the 10 archers in front of him. These ranged units, nearly 2 m tall, wearing 60-lb armor and carrying crossbows bigger than a person, don&#x27;t look like proper archers at all.</p>
<p>He even suspected that these archers superb crossbows were just for show and that when the enemy got close, they would find that these ranged units were not flustered at all in melee combat and even smiled. Lynn Shiao shook his head, deciding to first understand their capabilities. Check the attributes of the divine archer. Divine archer song Ruer race human level one quality legend attributes strength 30 + 15 spirit 30 + 15 constitution 30 + 15 soul 15 + 7. Combat strength 33 stars.</p>
<p>Skills: Eagle Eye, rank A, armor penetration, rank A, long range, composure, giant killer, five elements, arrow. The divine arm archer has incredibly powerful attributes with all three attributes: strength, spirit, and constitution fully maxed out. Its combat power rating has reached 33 stars, even surpassing that of a level one iron guard with the MO DAO. The A-level skills, eagleeye and armor penetration, grant the divine archer superhuman vision and penetration capabilities. In particular, the long shot skill allows the divine archer to fire accurately at a standard range of 350 m and a maximum range of 500 m.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha breathed a sigh of relief. It turned out that these archers were the real ranged units. I already know your capabilities. return to the team and fight alongside me later. Song Ruer and the others immediately knelt down.</p>
<p>Yes, Lord. Looking at their reverend eyes, Lin Sha made a judgment. Their loyalty was definitely not low, at least 90%. Since that was the case, he intensified his efforts to continue grinding monsters and accumulating battlefield energy. After returning to the Lord&#x27;s Manor, Lynn Shiao decided to start farming.</p>
<p>He has five spiritual fields of exceptional quality. The earlier they are planted, the earlier they will be harvested, thus solving the problem of food. Spirit fields are of paramount importance to lords, not only increasing the loyalty and happiness of their residents, but also serving as a crucial skill in the battle for supremacy among all races. Lynsha took out five excellent spirit fields. LinkedIn quality excellent output 42,000 units maturity time 48 9.6 hours special effect accelerates wound healing and increases resistance to disease in the battlefield of all races.</p>
<p>The output and maturity time of spirit fields are extremely important. Lynhia&#x27;s exceptional spirit fields not only have high output but also a particularly short maturity time with the bonus from his SSS level lord talent eternal peace. The output and maturity time of his spirit fields are stronger than those of legendary fields. This SSS level talent is just too strong. Lyn Sha walked to an open area of his territory, waved his hand, and five spirit fields immediately appeared in front of him, radiating a hazy glow.</p>
<p>Cooking time, 9 hours, 35 minutes, and 59 seconds. Pause. The spiritual fields needed farmers to take care of them. So, Lin Shia recalled five ordinary farmers and two rare farmers. The five of you will be in charge of these spirit fields.</p>
<p>Tonight&#x27;s dinner depends on you. Five ordinary farmers. thanked Lin Shia in surprise and began to get to work. Several other farmers nearby whispered among themselves, &quot;This spirit field feels different. Nonsense.</p>
<p>This is an exceptional spiritual field.&quot; The two rare farmers looked on with envy, hoping that Lyn Sha would assign them tasks. Lyn Sha was in no hurry to involve rare farmers in farming because ordinary farmers could also increase the output of the spirit field to 2,000 units. While the improvement effect of rare farmers was limited, just as he was about to assign tasks, a gruff voice suddenly rang out, &quot;Enemy attack.&quot; Chapter 15. The demonic tide came. The demonic tide gone, &quot;Enemy attack!&quot; A Mod Dao iron guard shouted.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao immediately led the Emo Dao iron guards and divine arm archers to the warning position. Upon arrival, they saw the black tide turnurning in the distance, rapidly advancing towards the Lord&#x27;s manor fence. The area around the Lord&#x27;s manor had been cleared by the iron guards, and there was no fog. Although it was midday, the enemy&#x27;s figures were indistinct in the black fog. Only limbs, claws, and eyes could be seen, exuding an eerie and terrifying aura.</p>
<p>These are not monsters, but demons. The demonic tide is more threatening than the beast tide. Demons are more chaotic and bloodthirsty than beastmen, orcs, and demons. Lynsha was a little confused. Demonic tides usually only occur after the Lord&#x27;s mansion is upgraded.</p>
<p>He had just started upgrading, so how could he have encountered a demonic tide? Judging from the numbers, there are at least several hundred monsters in the demon tide. A guard with a long-handled sword patrolled outside the fence. Seeing the black tide approaching, he raised his weapon to prepare to fight. With the activation of the pillar of strength skill, the attributes of the iron guard with the MO Dao were greatly enhanced. He was ready to defend the Lord&#x27;s mansion to the death.</p>
<p>Iron Guards of the Mod Dao, march out to meet the enemy. Lyn Shao ordered, &quot;Divine Armchers, prepare to fire.&quot; Archers were ready and Son Ruer immediately said, &quot;Sir, we can see the enemy clearly now and we can open fire at any time.&quot; Lyn Sha was taken aback. The archers with the divine arm bow were still far from the fence and the demon tide was several hundred meters away from the fence. How could these archers open fire so quickly? All right, Song Rule, you command the archers to provide fire support, Lin Sha ordered. Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>bows. And Song Rui shouted, &quot;Stretch!&quot; They stepped on the crossbow heads to tighten the bow strings. Knock the arrows. The archers quickly drew their bows, knock the arrows, and loaded them into their crossbows. Ready, fire! With Song Rus command, 10 giant crossbows fired simultaneously, the bolts accurately striking the demonic tide.</p>
<p>The demonic tide paused for a moment and then 10 hideous corpses rolled out, each with a feathered arrow stuck in its head. Your unit, the archer song Ruer, has killed the swollen drowning one, gaining 800 experience, 10 energy, and 15 gold. Your unit, the archer song Rome, has killed the swollen drowning man and obtained swelling drowners. Lyn Sha recognized these monsters. They were indeed a demonic tide.</p>
<p>The swollen drowners are monsters formed from the long-term decay of abandoned corpses. They typically inhabit areas near water sources, poisoning creatures or dragging passers by into the water to drown. They are of rare strength and do not generate demonic mist on their own, but will join a demonic tide if swept up in it. Lyn Sha confirmed that this was a demonic tide and knew that there must be even stronger demons hidden within it. The demonic tide continued to advance towards the Lord&#x27;s Manor.</p>
<p>Lin Shiao, Tangg Yi, and the others quickened their pace, preparing to join forces with the Mo Dao Iron Guards to resist this wave of demonic tide. The archers fired a second volley of arrows. So fast, Lyn Shao was surprised to see that the archers had knocked the bows and fired in a volley in just a few seconds. He turned his head and saw that the archers no longer needed to step on the bow string with their feet, but instead used one hand to quickly draw the bow, string the bow, and knock the arrow in one smooth motion. In a short time, the archers fired 30 arrows and 30 demons fell to the ground.</p>
<p>When Lin Shiao and the iron guards of the Mod Dao arrived at the front of the demonic tide, the demons attack had slowed down and the fog had gradually dissipated. With a whoosh, the fog completely dissipated, revealing the remaining monsters who seem to be hesitating whether to continue their attack. But behind them, more than a hundred monsters have already fallen. Archers didn&#x27;t stop, firing again in unison. With each volley, more monsters fell.</p>
<p>Soon only one isolated giant ghoul remained among the remaining monsters. Giant ghoul level eight. Quality rare attributes strength 16 spirit 12 constitution 20 soul 8 combat strength 15 stars skills demonic mist ghoul eater plague Lin Shiao and the Modo Dao Iron Guard silently watched the day&#x27;s giant ghoul preparing to receive the final blow. The archers quickly knock their bows again. Your unit, the archer song Ruer, has killed a giant ghoul, gaining 1,500 experience, 30 energy, and 50 gold.</p>
<p>As the giant ghoul fell to the ground, its corpse began to gradually dissolve. Lyn Shiao and the Mod Dao iron guard slowly turned around and looked at the iron lumps behind them. &quot;Well done!&quot; Lyn Shao nodded in satisfaction. After returning to his territory, Lin Sha instructed the rare farmers to retrieve some monitor lizard meat from the warehouse, roast it, and distribute it to everyone. All gathered resources are instantly stored in the warehouse, requiring no transportation and suffering no loss.</p>
<p>Rare farmers carry simple tools, including a barbecue grill. Soon, large chunks of monitor lizard meat were grilled, and Lynn Shia called out to everyone, &quot;Come and eat some grilled meat.&quot; Thank you, Lord. Everyone expressed their gratitude. Although the barbecue was just ordinary food, it tasted quite good. Just as Lin Sha and everyone were eating the barbecue, the system interface suddenly flashed and Chufinga sent a message.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha Chufinga&#x27;s red hair appeared in the channel. Seeing Lyn Shiao still eating barbecue, she was a little surprised. Why don&#x27;t you look at the chat channel? It&#x27;s in an uproar. Chapter 16. Why are all my soldiers tough guys? Lynn Shiao opened the chat channel and couldn&#x27;t help but chuckle as he looked at Xiao Daong and Gene Dang as messages.</p>
<p>It turned out that seeing that they hadn&#x27;t received a response, the two of them lost face and started spewing threats in the chat channel, constantly spamming the screen. Seeing the two lose their composure, Lyn Sha didn&#x27;t take it to heart and said to Chufinga, &quot;They&#x27;re just clowns. No need to pay them any mind.&quot; However, Chufinga&#x27;s expression turned serious. Lyn Sha, things are not as you think. I looked into these two people and they&#x27;re not simple.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha asked in confusion, &quot;How do I check? How can I find information about other lords in the newbie zone?&quot; Chufinger explained, &quot;These two have complicated backgrounds. They bullied classmates for a long time at school and even committed a bloody crime which was later suppressed.&quot; Lyn Sha nodded, indicating his understanding. Most importantly, they have powerful backers, and they are even able to connect with the Jang Bay city lords mansion and some forces in the official district. Lyn Sha said calmly. So, they have powerful backers.</p>
<p>Chufinga nodded. Yes, don&#x27;t worry. I know what I&#x27;m doing, Lyn Sha said casually. Thanks for the reminder. I have something to do.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll hang up now. After hanging up the communication, Lynsha quickly led his men to replenish their energy, preparing to fight monsters and recruit heroes as time was of the essence. Are you all full? We&#x27;re full. The burly men responded in unison, their voices deafening like thunder. Grab your weapons and follow me into battle.</p>
<p>Yes. Seeing the reactions of these burly men, Lyn Sha couldn&#x27;t help but think that most of the other lord&#x27;s troops were angels. female swordsmen and Amazonian female warriors. While he had recruited only these rough men, the style was a bit off. However, he quickly regained his composure and decided to focus on the important matter.</p>
<p>I hope my first hero is a girl. Lyn Sha recalled the nearby map and had an idea. Upgrade all Moda iron guards to level six. Leader to level seven. Upgrade all archers to level five.</p>
<p>Boss to level six. He waved his hand and allocated most of the experience points, raising the level of the Modo Dao iron guard to level six and also raising the level of the divine arm archer. Thank you, my lord. The soldiers expressed their gratitude in unison, feeling the immense power they had gained from the upgrade. Tanggi, leave behind two Emo Dao iron guards.</p>
<p>Sun Ruer, leave behind two divine arm archers. The rest of you, come with me on this expedition. Lynn Shiao set off with two teams of legendary gold tier troops, aiming to grind monsters, accumulate experience, and gather battlefield energy. According to his memory of the map, he led his team to a monster gathering point. Rock golem level 10, quality rare, attributes, strength 20, spirit 10, constitution 26, soul 10, combat power 20 stars.</p>
<p>skills, low tier magic immunity, critical strike. These rock golems are tireless, enormous, and powerful, and novice lords usually don&#x27;t provoke them easily. Lyn Sha waved his hand and ordered, &quot;Kill!&quot; with divine crossbows quickly launched ranged attacks while the iron guards with long swords charged forward to engage in close combat. The archer s arrows shattered the rock golem almost instantly while the iron guard with the long sword swung his blade with force easily killing the enemy. Soon the largest granite golem fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia collected the dropped equipment without lingering. Well done. Keep it up. Lyn Sha led the team forward, sweeping away almost all the monsters they encountered. They killed elite level nles, murlocs, and bandits, gaining a large amount of experience and gold, and also obtained elite and rare treasure chests.</p>
<p>Finally, they reached the phantom shooters lair. Through the archer&#x27;s field of vision, Lyn Sha saw the phantom archer inside the nest. Phantom shooter level 10, quality excellent attributes: strength 25, spirit 30, constitution 18, soul 15. Combat power 26 stars. Skills: rapid fire, long range sniping.</p>
<p>Phantom archers are powerful ranged units in the early game. Although their defense is relatively weak, they have a long range, high accuracy, and strong attack power. Lyn Sha looked at the 16 muscular men in the group, shook his head slightly, and sighed inwardly. This style is really fierce. Chapter 17.</p>
<p>Subduing the Phantom Archer. Dealing with these phantom shooters is not difficult at all. The ammo dao iron guards and divine arm archers were both clad in armor weighing dozens of kilograms. Legendary level troops wouldn&#x27;t be easily defeated by these superior level troops. Lyn Shiao could have the Mod Dao iron guards charge in and kill them outright or have the divine arm archers use their long range skill to kite them from 500 m away.</p>
<p>Moreover, with Xiang Yus heroic spirit possessing him, he was confident he could charge in and wipe them out completely. But Lyn Xiao&#x27;s real purpose was to subdue these phantom archers because this was the phantom archers lair in the battlefield of the myriad races. After defeating the guards and occupying the nest, a certain number of corresponding creatures will spawn each week. In other words, after Lyn Sha occupies this nest, he can recruit a certain number of phantom archers every week. There should be 35 of these phantom archers.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha thought to himself after capturing the lair, I can recruit seven more each week. He knew his luck was exceptional. The lord&#x27;s manner hadn&#x27;t even finished upgrading when he encountered the beast tide and the demon tide. If the manor were fully upgraded, he might face an even stronger demon tide. More manpower meant more strength.</p>
<p>So he decided to try and subdue all 35 phantom archers. Lynn Shiao ordered, &quot;Iron guards of the Mod Dao, archers of the divine arm archer, advance with me and defend against the arrow attack. Do not retaliate unless I give the order.&quot; &quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; the crowd responded, marching in unison toward the phantom archers lair. As soon as they entered the attack range, dozens of arrows came flying through the air, heading precisely towards them. &quot;Defend!&quot; Tang Yi shouted, and the iron guards with their swords swung their blades to block the arrows, knocking them down one by one.</p>
<p>Tanggi then used his body to shield Lynn Shiao from several arrows. With their superb bows ducked slightly to avoid arrows hitting their eyes, allowing the rest of their bodies to be struck by the arrows. Their armor sparked, yet they remained unharmed. Tanggi, witnessing this, couldn&#x27;t help but think to himself, &quot;Their defenses are too strong.&quot; After several volleys of arrows, Lin Shia and the others finally saw the phantom archers standing in front of the forest cabin in the distance. These tall wood elves wore green leather armor, blending seamlessly into the forest.</p>
<p>Seeing the iron guards of the Mo Dao and the archers of the divine arm archer block the arrows unharmed, the phantom archers were stunned and stopped shooting, hesitating. Before they could escape into the woods, Lynn Shiao gently pushed aside the guards and looked up at the phantom archers, saying, &quot;Stop. We can talk.&quot; Lin Xiao&#x27;s frank talent, peace, took effect, reducing the hostility of all hostile monsters by 10%. Faced with a sudden and powerful enemy who did not initiate an attack, the Phantom Archers immediately ceased their assault. The first step to subjugation, a ceasefire achieved.</p>
<p>A handsome blonde archer stepped forward. Stranger lord, you have invaded our territory. You had better give us a good reason. Lyn Sha glanced at him and said softly, I have come to invite you to join my territory, become my people, and fight for me. At the same time, I have come to protect you and ensure that your people can survive on this cruel battlefield.</p>
<p>The Phantom Archer leader shook his head. You probably have your eye on our lair and want to recruit Phantom Archers. According to the rules, you must defeat us and take over the lair. Lyn Sha slowly stepped out from among the guards and walked up to the blonde man, exuding an imperial aura. I not only want the lair, but I also invite you to join me.</p>
<p>How could that be? Before the blonde man could finish speaking, Lynsha interrupted. I know you&#x27;re obsessed with archery. But I have even stronger archers here. Don&#x27;t you want to see them? A stronger archer? The blonde man scoffed. In this valley, no one is stronger than us phantom archers.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha looked at Song Rule and all the phantom archers followed suit, looking at the divine archer archers. Song Ruer and eight other archers took the giant crossbows from their backs, drew back the bow strings with one hand, loaded the bolts, and prepared to fire. Upon seeing this, the Phantom Archers immediately became alert and drew their bows again, ready to counterattack. But with a glance from Lin Shao, S Ruer and the others simultaneously pointed their giant crossbows at the sky and pulled the triggers. The arrows whistled out, instantly flying into the air and disappearing into the forest.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, a giant raven fell from the sky and crashed to the ground, dead beyond any doubt. Eight arrows were embedded in its back and wings. The phantom archers gasped in astonishment. The arrows striking with incredible precision from above astonished them with their power and skill. Lyn Sha nodded to himself.</p>
<p>The second step of subjugation demonstrating the power of the same type of troop accomplished. The divine armed bow was far superior to the phantom archer, demonstrating an absolute advantage. Meanwhile, somewhere in the newbie zone, a handsome young man was rolling on the ground in agony. Ah, I didn&#x27;t see anything, but my contracted spirit pet was ambushed. My eyes, my head, my body.</p>
<p>It hurts so much. And my chrysanthemums. Chapter 18. Recruitment talisman. Necromancer&#x27;s summoning scroll.</p>
<p>Luck explodes. Lyn Sha walked up to the phantom archers, releasing the energy of Xiang Yus Imperial Spirit, and his aura suddenly surged. The surrounding air seemed to freeze, and the phantom archers stared at him in shock. feeling as if the entire world was distorting around him. &quot;The Golden Legend,&quot; the lead phantom archer couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right. They are all legendary gold tier units, and they are my subordinates,&quot; Lyn Sha said slowly. &quot;Are you willing to join my ranks?&quot; Soldering, the leader, and the other phantom archers knelt on one knee. &quot;Soldering and 34 Phantom archers are at your command.&quot; Lyn Sha nodded in satisfaction. Good.</p>
<p>You will become my strength. Upgrade. A flash of light appeared and all the phantom archers power increased. They stood up filled with fighting spirit. God.</p>
<p>Check solderin&#x27;s attributes. Lynn Sha commanded. Phantom shooter soldering level 12. Quality excellent. Attributes.</p>
<p>Strength 27 + 14. Spirit 35 + 18. Constitution 19 + 10. Soul 15 plus 7. Combat power rating 28 stars.</p>
<p>Skills: rapid fire, long range sniping. Lynn Shia nodded in satisfaction. He patted Saul the Lin on the shoulder. Get up. The Phantom Archer will become a nightmare on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Thank you, my lord. Ding. Phantom archer. Soldering. Loyalty has reached 70%.</p>
<p>Obedience is key. Lyn Sha was satisfied. The loyalty level had reached 70, meaning these troops had become elite. He led his team to the phantom archers lair and gently sent out a wisp of his consciousness to occupy the forest cabin. Recruit phantom archers.</p>
<p>Currently, there are seven phantom archers available for recruitment. Recruitment cost 1,600 gold coins per person. Please select the number to recruit. Recruit everyone. Recruiting seven phantom archers cost 11,200 gold coins, which made Lin Sha feel a little pain.</p>
<p>The recruitment cost for these special units was very high, but in order to enhance their strength, they were still necessary to recruit them. Looking at his eight iron guards with long swords, eight divine archers, and 42 phantom archers, Lyn Sha was full of confidence. On his first day in the newbie zone, he was ready to sweep everything aside. However, Lyn Sha discovered that although these phantom archers were incredibly handsome, they were all male elves. Why are they all men? He silently shook his head, deciding to stop dwelling on it.</p>
<p>My lord, Tanggi shouted. Who will we fight next? Wait a minute. Let me find where the succubus is. Lin Sha replied instinctively. Huh? Tangg Yui was a little stunned.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ziao Daong and Jin Dang were also clearing out the monsters. Damn, Lynn Shiao, how dare you ignore me? Ziao Daong roared angrily as he slashed a goblin to death. When I find you, I will definitely take my revenge. Aa dot. Ziao Daong slashed several goblins in succession when suddenly a blue light flashed across the ground.</p>
<p>A loot dropped. Ziao Daong was surprised to see the blue item drop and quickly ran over to pick it up. It&#x27;s a rare recruitment token, Ziao. Daong exclaimed with delight, &quot;Heaven is helping us.&quot; Gene Dang also turned his head and saw Xiao Daong pick up the blue glowing item, a hint of greed flashing in his eyes. &quot;No way, I got equipment, too.&quot; Gene Dang hurriedly ran over and picked up another blue item.</p>
<p>A scroll of necromancers. Gene Dang exclaimed. Ziao Daong also came over. Let me see. Book of the Dead.</p>
<p>Quality: Blue Rare. Ability consumable when used summons 20 elite skeleton archers and 20 elite skeleton warriors all rare units at level 10. Duration 24 hours. My god, it really is a tome of the dead. Ziao Daong exclaimed with ecstasy.</p>
<p>With 40 level 10 rare units, I can sweep through the newb zone. While Xiao Daong was pleased, he saw Gene Dang also looking smug, which made him furious as he left, thinking, &quot;Why don&#x27;t I have any luck like him?&quot; Xiao Daong continued to hack and slash at the goblins, his anger raging when suddenly his sword broke. Click! Ding! As the sword broke, another item glowing blue fell from the goblin. &quot;Damn, I&#x27;m so lucky.&quot; Ziao Daong exclaimed. Chapter 19.</p>
<p>My lord, you have saved countless men from the world. Ziao Daang excitedly checked his spoils and discovered he had obtained another talisman. Teleportation scroll quality rare blue. Description: A lower tier alternative to the portal. Usable only once, lasting 24 hours.</p>
<p>After obtaining the location, a two-way portal to the designated location can be opened. Great stuff. This can be used personally, sold, used for escaping, and even used to kill people, Xiao. Daong said excitedly. Gene Dang also revealed a somewhat insincere smile.</p>
<p>Not bad. It&#x27;s a good thing. We&#x27;ve all had a pretty good hall today. He even if that brat Lin Sha doesn&#x27;t sell me the black long sword, I can still become king. Shiao Daong said smuggly.</p>
<p>Even if Lin Shiao is a ranger lord with 20 star combat power, he&#x27;s nothing compared to our four teams of rare troops and the undead. Gene Dang added with a sneer. The two looked at each other for a moment and then fell silent. A few seconds later, Ziao Daong spoke up. Dang, your talent is B-level positioning, right? That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Gene Dang smiled coldly. Location accurately locates the position of a lord within the same region whose level difference is no more than 10 levels. Can be used once every 24 hours. Has no attack power, but is indispensable in faction wars. Xiao Datong nodded.</p>
<p>Since Lin Shiao is so weak, yet he possesses treasures. A dangerous glint flashed in his eyes. We even have teleportation talismans and a bounty order, plus the ability to locate his coordinates. Add to that our four rare unit squads and a necronomicanin that can summon 40 undead warriors. Why not just do it directly? He made a throat slitting gesture, his intentions clear.</p>
<p>It will both seize Lin Xiao&#x27;s things and quickly establish our authority. Does Shang, are you in or not? Jin Dang remains silent for a moment before finally making up his mind. Let&#x27;s do it. Fortune favors the bold. And what danger is Lin Sha compared to that? I&#x27;ll go back and prepare and bring the harpies with me.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s wipe him out together and let everyone in the newbie zone know how powerful we are. As darkness fell, Lyn Sha unleashed a powerful strike, piercing through the head of a demonic creature resembling a seductive woman with his spear. The creature let out a sharp scream and exploded into pieces. Your lordship is mighty. The iron guards behind him, seeing Lin Xiaos heroic figure, all shouted.</p>
<p>The long-eared elf saw the Lin was also shocked and he was glad that he had joined Linhao&#x27;s side. The Lord is so powerful. He easily dealt with our phantom archers all by himself. It seems my choice was right. With a flash of purple light, the female demon dropped a purple superior treasure chest.</p>
<p>Another treasure chest. It seems the main god wants me to open more blind boxes. Lyn Sha picked up the treasure chest and the flashing lights stored it in the system warehouse. The monsters had been wiped out. Lyn Shao turned around and saw a group of admiring gazes.</p>
<p>Lord, you are mighty. Tang Yu was the first to step forward, kneeling on one knee and clasping his hands and greeting. Lord, you are handsome and elegant, concerned for the world and dedicated to eliminating demons and protecting the righteous. You are truly a holy ruler. Son Rueer also arrived, lifted his mask, knelt down, and clasped his hands.</p>
<p>Lord, you are a man of great stature and extraordinary strength. You are devoted to eliminating evil for the common people and saving countless men. Your merits are immeasurable. Soldering stood there dumbfounded. Even a legendary golden unit was flattering the Lord.</p>
<p>Did the Lord have such a pinchant for it? Lyn Xiaoso&#x27;s lips twitched slightly as he watched the two burly men&#x27;s performance, feeling utterly helpless. &quot;What does it mean to be concerned about the world and to eliminate demons and protect the righteous path? What does it mean to save countless men in the world?&quot; he asked casually. &quot;Exactly,&quot; Tanggi immediately explained. &quot;The Lord has been frowning from the very beginning, knowing that there are female demons causing trouble, and he is worried. So, he brought us here to wipe them out.&quot; Song Ruer continued, &quot;These female demons appear charming on the surface, but are actually hideous and devour men&#x27;s essence.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lord, you saw through their tricks at a glance. Without the Lord, how could an ordinary man withstand these alluring demons?&quot; Tang Yi chimed in, &quot;Lord, you risked your life to eliminate this threat for the sake of all men. Your merit is truly immeasurable. Your excellency has truly done a great deed.&quot; The crowd shouted in unison. Solderings eyes widened and he suddenly realized that he had wronged Lyn Sha and his heart was filled with respect for him.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha looked at the scene before him, his head throbbing with pain. He was only thinking about balancing the number of male soldiers, but he accidentally led everyone to clear out this group of demons. He never expected that Tang Yi and Song Ruer would misunderstand him as a noble lord who was eliminating evil for all men. Feeling the admiring gazes of Tang Yi and Song Ruer, Lin Shao sighed softly and said calmly, &quot;I am very gratified that you can understand my good intentions.&quot; Just then, a system notification sounded bite. Phantom archer soldering loyalty has reached 80.</p>
<p>As easy as using and limb chapter 20, White Stocking Lolita and school uniform boy with dark circles. Upon hearing the prompt from the main god, Lin Sha suppressed the twitching at the corner of his mouth and thought to himself. This actually works. Fortunately, Tang Yi and Song Ruer were there to support him. But the style of this situation was getting weirder and weirder.</p>
<p>He looked around at the 2 m tall muscular man who was playing the straight man and Solderlands admiring gaze. Wait a minute, Selin. What&#x27;s with that look in your eyes? Lynn Shiao quickly shook his head, dispelling these wild thoughts. It&#x27;s getting late. Everyone go back to the territory.</p>
<p>Nighttime is extremely dangerous on the battlefield of the myriad races. Except in areas controlled by lords, most wild monsters become stronger at night, and powerful demonic creatures appear frequently. Lyn Sha knew that nighttime was the domain of wild monsters, and lords would return to their territories in advance to avoid danger. He suspected that this situation was a setting made by the main god system to repair or manipulate certain mechanisms. Coupled with his strange luck, Lyn Sha worried that he might encounter something even more terrifying that night.</p>
<p>But now that you&#x27;ve killed enough monsters, collected enough gold, experience, and energy, and recruited 42 exceptional phantom archers, the mission is complete. It&#x27;s time to go back and open treasure chests, build a tavern, and recruit heroes. So Lyn Sha led his men toward the Lord&#x27;s mansion. The warriors in the group were full of fighting spirit, and as they moved forward, the monsters around them screamed in agony. Meanwhile, not far from Liao&#x27;s territory, some novice lords were preparing to launch a final attack before nightfall.</p>
<p>A petite Lolita style girl dressed in a Lolita dress and white stockings with small animal ears on her head has an innocent and sweet appearance. Yet her figure is striking. She is leading a group of we werewolves in a fierce attack on a wild monster guarding a stone mine. Go big dog, go. The little girl waved her small hands which were wearing animal claw gloves to cheer on her werewolves.</p>
<p>Encouraged, the werewolf captain&#x27;s eyes turned bloodshot. He leaped up and killed the monster with a single punch, and the other werewolves fought back fiercely. Then, seeing the werewolves display their skills, the little girl jumped and cheered. Her body swaying with excitement, making the werewolf captain blush. I got some good stuff again.</p>
<p>The drop rate in the battlefield of 10,000 races is really high. The little girl jumped up and down happily and immediately picked up the equipment that was flashing green light. She muttered to herself. Beauty really can put food on the table, although I am only slightly attractive. Even the battlefield of the myriad races is favoring me.</p>
<p>Not far away, a boy in a school uniform had just put down his bow and arrow. He had a handsome face. Although two heavy dark circles under his eyes marred his good looks. Even though they&#x27;re just ordinary monsters, it&#x27;s really unusual to encounter so many monsters in the beginner area, he muttered to himself. A female creature draped in green leaves with a slender figure and transparent elven wings floated over and bowed to him.</p>
<p>My lord, the demon child has finished cleaning up and dropped a blue item. Please come and take a look. Upon seeing such a beautiful woman, the school unifored no evil intentions and gently replied, &quot;I understand. I&#x27;ll be right there.&quot; He picked up the demon child&#x27;s blue item, a smile spreading across his face. &quot;Great.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a rare spirit field.&quot; &quot;Haha, I&#x27;ve been so lucky since I stopped arguing with those two fat guys.&quot; He excitedly held up the spirit field and said, &quot;With this rare spirit field, I can finally feed my people.&quot; Upon hearing his voice, a group of female creatures gathered behind him. They were slender and had alluring faces. Seeing their lord so happy, they all smiled with delight. Really? That&#x27;s wonderful. Your highness is amazing.</p>
<p>Long live the lord. We can finally eat our fill. The women flew over and surrounded Heay, all offering him sweet smiles. My lord, you are truly great. Thank you, my lord.</p>
<p>Lord, could you please draw some luck from Yao Yao? Heay hurriedly pushed them away. Stop. Stop. Stop. Can&#x27;t you see it&#x27;s getting dark? Stop fooling around.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go back farm and have a good meal. They cheered. Great. Well lead the lord back. Heay shook his head and smiled, then flew back to his territory, surrounded by others.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lyn Sha finally led his team back to the Lord&#x27;s manor before nightfall. Few, it feels so good to be home. Lyn Sha breathed a sigh of relief. Now that I can&#x27;t kill monsters, I should go back and replenish my energy, farm, build a tavern, and recruit heroes. He looked at the exceptional spirit field, which was nearing maturity.</p>
<p>Inspect the spirit field. The system pops up the spirit field attribute window. LinkedIn quality excellent output 42,000 units. Ripening time 1 hour 37 minutes and 36 seconds. Special effects accelerates wound healing and enhances resistance to disease.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha calculated it will take another hour to mature. No problem. He called over three rare farmers and asked them to grill the barbarian beef. These wild bulls were monsters Lynn Shiao encountered while exterminating the black death demoness. Although they were troublesome, they could now be used as food.</p>
<p>Once the meat was cooked, the spirit fields would also be ready, solving the territo&#x27;s food problem. Next, we need to take stock of our achievements and prepare for future developments. God system. View all my current resources. Chapter 21 A.</p>
<p>Bountiful harvest. Awaiting the heroes reports. Lynn Shiao checked the resource panel and nodded in satisfaction. Experience 1,354,300 can be used to upgrade troops, heroes, lords, and special buildings. Gold 12,950.</p>
<p>Recruiting phantom archers cost a lot and the money-making speed is slow. Treasure chests, one excellent treasure chest, two rare treasure chests, two superior treasure chests. items. Green leader charm X1 purple defense charm X1. Other items: Mini tavern X1 scaled rock breastplate X1.</p>
<p>Scaled rock shoulder pads X1. Black long sword X1. Currently on auction claw of attack X1 life amulet X1. Special battlefield energy of all races X3 300. Resources: Wood, X9, 740, Stone, X8, 550, iron or X4, 700, copper or X4, 700, silver or X2, 350, refined iron, X1, 561, refined copper X1, 734, gold or X100, sulfur X100.</p>
<p>A very fruitful harvest, Lyn Sha thought to himself with satisfaction. Although the monster killing was a bit slower than expected, the overall speed was still very fast, far exceeding that of the average beginner. Peace for all ages is truly powerful. The battle over the past few hours yielded Lynn Shia a considerable amount of treasure chests and equipment. First, he acquired a green quality leader token, allowing him to recruit 10 excellent quality farmers.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha gave them some lava giant lizard meat to cook themselves and then sent them to chop wood and mine. The purple defense talisman is a one-time protective talisman that can create a light shield within the territory, blocking 10,000 points of damage for 1 hour, making it very suitable for defending against surprise attacks. Next, he inspected several new pieces of equipment. Attack claw quality rare blue. Attribute attack power 220.</p>
<p>Suitable for lords who need high burst damage such as assassin type heroes. Life amulet quality purple excellent. Attribute stamina plus 30 increases wound healing and physical recovery speed. This equipment is equivalent to increasing the survivability of an average novice lord by three to four times, making it a life-saving artifact. Attack claws are suitable for heroes with high burst damage, while life amulet can improve survivability and is more popular than attack claws.</p>
<p>Lynsha put down the equipment and began opening the treasure chest. One fine chest, two rare chests, and two superior chests. Open them all. He quickly opened the five treasure chests. Excellent treasure chest contains 200 gold ore.</p>
<p>Rare treasure chest. Obtain a deadly bow. Rare treasure chest. Obtain wall construction blueprints. Excellent treasure chest.</p>
<p>Obtain one piece of scale rock leggings. Excellent treasure chest. Obtain the snow dance katana. Lyn Sha was stunned for a moment, not expecting to be so lucky. The first excellent treasure chest was like a warm-up, and the following chest successfively yielded equipment and a city defense building blueprint.</p>
<p>In particular, the scale rock leggings completed his existing scale rock set three-fifths, greatly increasing his defensive capabilities. Scale rock leggings set three-fifths. Quality purple excellent. Attributes base defense 150, strength plus 10, stamina plus 10. Set bonus scale rock heavy armor set 3 fifths plus 15 strength plus 15 stamina.</p>
<p>a very significant attribute bonus. Lyn Sha then examined the deadly bow. Killer bow quality rare blue attributes attack power 180, agility plus 10. Special attribute increases critical hit chance by 10%. This bow is perfect for heroes with high accuracy and critical hit rate, especially ranged units like the divine archer.</p>
<p>Finally, there was that beautiful katana dance of fine snow. Quality purple. Excellent attributes. Attack power 280, strength + 15, agility + 15. This katana is both beautiful and powerful.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a perfect legendary weapon. Lynn Shiao decided to keep it and distribute it after the first hero arrives. &quot;This knife is much stronger than the black long sword. Perhaps my first hero will be a swordsman, so I&#x27;ll give it to him,&quot; Lyn Sha thought. Looking at all this equipment, he was very satisfied.</p>
<p>On his very first day in the newbie zone, he had already acquired so many good items. Which hero will I recruit? Lyn Sha looked up at the dark knight sky. Could we get a beautiful hero this time? Di Wong Xiao Jun Xiao Chan Diao Xiao Xiao. Anything is fine. I&#x27;m not picky.</p>
<p>He chuckled self-deprecatingly, but these female heroes don&#x27;t seem to have much fighting ability. Next, he checked the progress of the Lord&#x27;s Manor and confirmed that there were still a few hours left before the upgrade was completed. Expected to be finished at 11:55 p.m. Level myself up a few times first. We can&#x27;t just focus on upgrading the honks.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia waved his hand with a smile and seven colored light immediately rose in the Lord&#x27;s Mansion. Chapter 22. The founding emperor&#x27;s staff techniques. Continuing the lost skills of the sages. A flash of light spread throughout the lord&#x27;s manor, but not a single ray escaped.</p>
<p>After a day of intense battles and accumulating a wealth of experience, Lyn Sha, with the help of 20 legendary gold units and 42 superior units, successfully reached level 10. His experience was almost depleted, but he didn&#x27;t stop striving to become stronger. As stated in the theory of lords, a powerful lord does not necessarily possess great marshall prowess, but one who possesses great marshall prowess is certainly a powerful lord. Lyn Shia himself possesses great marshall prowess and would never give up on improving it because of his cheat ability and handsome appearance. As the afterglow faded, Lyn Sha closed his eyes, sensing the fluctuations of power within his body.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve become stronger. He opened his eyes. a cold light flashing within them like a sharp sword piercing through the clouds. Lynn Sha retrieved a rare spear from his system space, jumped into the courtyard in front of the Lord&#x27;s mansion and began practicing his spear techniques. The sound of spears cutting through the air filled the air as the spear danced in his hands, creating a dense and impenetrable display of spear flowers.</p>
<p>Tangg Yi, S Ruer, and Saul Lin were chatting when they saw Lin Xiaos martial arts demonstration and stopped talking, drawn to it. Excellent. Excellent, Lord. Although I don&#x27;t understand your marksmanship, it seems invincible combining offense and defense, Tanggi exclaimed. Simply smashing it with a gun can demonstrate such power, Song Rui added.</p>
<p>Tangg Yi and Song Rui both sensed that Lin Shao was not using traditional spear techniques, but rather a unique skill that incorporated stick techniques. At that moment, Song Ruer suddenly understood and blurted out, &quot;It&#x27;s the great ancestor. It&#x27;s the Pamlong staff technique.&quot; He explained, &quot;This is the Panlong staff technique created by Emperor Taou of Song. He once conquered the world with just a staff. This staff technique is incredibly powerful and can be considered a top tier martial art.</p>
<p>Tangg Yu was completely confused. So Son Rueer continued to explain this set of staff techniques has been lost to time and many people only know some fragments of it. Today we actually saw the Lord demonstrate the complete technique. Lord, you must be a true descendant of the Chinese people. To have acquired this skill is truly an incredible stroke of luck.</p>
<p>Song Ruer exclaimed excitedly. Moved by their actions, Seong Ruer and the other archers picked up their ring pommel swords and began practicing with Lin Sha, using them as clubs. Tangg Yi and the others, not to be outdone, joined in with their long-handled swords, and the courtyard was instantly filled with the glint of blades and the lively atmosphere. After Lin Shao finished practicing a set of panlong staff techniques, he stopped, looked around, and saw two neatly standing squads of soldiers. The Mod Dao iron guards and the divine arm archers.</p>
<p>Ding! Your unit, the divine archer song Rueer, has reached 100% loyalty. Ready to go through fire and water. Ding! Your unit, the divine archer, has reached 100% loyalty. Go through fire and water. Ding! You have triggered the eternal peace, inheriting the lost skills of the sages, talent skill, and will be taught the skill coiled dragon staff technique.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha nodded in satisfaction. His team members had improved through the practice. The systems notification made him realize that he had not only fully mastered the panong staff technique through his martial arts practice, but had also passed it on to 20 trusted subordinates through his innate skills, enhancing their strength. Lin Shao pondered this in his mind, checking the attributes of Tang Yi and Song Ruer, the Iron Guard of the Mod Dao, Tang Yi. Race: human, Hasha.</p>
<p>Level seven. Quality legend. Attributes: Strength 83 + 42. Spirit 39 + 19, Constitution 72 + 36, soul 34 + 12. Combat power rating 68 stars.</p>
<p>Skills: Divine Valor, Pillar of Strength, Bloodlust, Slash with the Momentum, Slash Against the Momentum, Dragon Staff, Beginner, Divine Archer, Song Rue. Race: Human Hashia Level six. Quality: Legend. Attributes: Strength 65 + 33. Spirit 65 + 33.</p>
<p>Constitution 55 + 28. Soul 35 + 18. Combat power rating 63 stars. Skills eagle eye rank A. Armor penetration rank A.</p>
<p>Long shot composure giant killer five elements arrow. Dragon staff technique beginner. Looking at the two units attributes, Lin Shiao smiled with satisfaction. Golden legendary units are indeed powerful. The attribute increase per level far exceeds that of other units.</p>
<p>Song Ruer and Tang Ye gain five points to their main attribute, 3.75 points to their secondary attribute, and two points to their third attribute with each level up. It&#x27;s terrifying. Their growth potential is unmatched by other troop types, he exclaimed. What&#x27;s even more terrifying is that after learning the Panlong staff, their four-dimensional attributes increased by 10. S Rui&#x27;s attributes are now far superior to those of a level 12 Solin.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha pondered while feeling gratified. The growth potential of the golden legendary troops is indeed strong, especially since they start from a high level and can completely surpass me in the future. But these Chinese soldiers are 100% loyal and completely subservient to me. Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;The Lord is the ultimate winner. There&#x27;s no need to rush.</p>
<p>Time to check my own attributes.&quot; The god system panel popped up and Lyn Sha was shocked to see his personal attributes. Lyn Sha level 10 attributes. Strength 67 + 250 spirit 68 + 100 constitution 45 + 200 soul 45 + 110 skills unrestricted mixed martial arts dank all weapon mastery d rank farming c rank panlong staff technique a rank lifting the tripod feathered courage breaking the boat and sinking the ship overlord spear command a rank combat Power rating 64 stars. Lord&#x27;s talent. Peace for all ages.</p>
<p>Click to view. Chapter 23. Recruiting the first hero. To Lynhiao&#x27;s astonishment. His own attributes were also incredibly strong.</p>
<p>Based on my initial attribute points, I&#x27;ve achieved a terrifying stat line. Plus five points to two main attributes and plus three points to two secondary attributes for every level up. Although my initial attributes aren&#x27;t as good as legendary units, my growth potential surpasses them. I also have the scale rock set. Even without the eternal emperor&#x27;s heroic spirit possessing me, my attributes are still enough to go head-to-head with Tang Yi and Song Rui.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia was only slightly amazed by the strength of his own attributes. As a lord, anything is possible. After opening the treasure chests and participating in the martial arts practice, it was about time. Lyn Sha went into the courtyard where he heard the farmers heho heho sounds. My lord, a farmer bowed and said, the meat is ready.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha nodded gently and said, carry the meat to the center of the yard. Call everyone, including the brothers who work hard in the mining area, and let&#x27;s eat together. Yes, my lord. The farmer who was roasting meat left deeply moved. He had never encountered a lord who treated farmers so well.</p>
<p>Other lords only care that the peasants don&#x27;t starve to death, and they provide the worst food. Sometimes the peasants even have to sneak out to gather wild vegetables themselves. Before long, apart from a few warriors patrolling and guarding the territory fence, all the Mo Dao iron guards, divine arm archers, phantom archers, and farmers came to the center of the courtyard. Several farmers also brought over cooked spirit rice porridge. Just half an hour ago, Lyn Ziao&#x27;s five excellent spirit fields had also matured, and the first batch of spirit rice had successfully entered the warehouse.</p>
<p>10,000 units of spirit rice were enough for the people in the territory to eat for more than a week. The second batch of Lingi has begun to be planted and will be ripe by tomorrow morning. There is 100% enough food. The aroma of roasted meat and the fragrance of rice porridge wafted through the air, stimulating everyone&#x27;s taste buds, and some people&#x27;s stomachs even rumbled. Enough with the nonsense.</p>
<p>Now that you&#x27;ve become my subjects, Lyn Sha, just do your job well and I&#x27;ll take care of the rest. Lyn Sha didn&#x27;t waste any more words and told everyone to get started. Talk is cheap. Action speaks louder than words. He&#x27;s not one of those famous bosses on Earth from my previous life who only knew how to use empty words to manipulate their subordinates.</p>
<p>Those who only think about making more money are no different from the Walking Dead. Money shouldn&#x27;t be a college student&#x27;s dream. You have to pay tuition to study at school, but you can learn things by working here without paying tuition. So, what if the salary is lower? Young people shouldn&#x27;t always think about making money. They should be willing to endure hardship and learn new skills.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what truly matters. Lyn Sha shook his head, trying to dispel his wandering thoughts. He squeezed into the crowd and sat around the barbecue grill with the soldiers and farmers of the territory. He tore off a piece of barbarian beef, picked up a bowl of steaming spirit rice porridge, and began to eat heartily while chatting with the people next to him. Lynhia&#x27;s approachable actions touched everyone in the territory.</p>
<p>This lord was not only handsome and imposing, possessing superb marshall prowess and powerful skills, and commanding a fierce and ruthless army, but he also treated his people like brothers, being approachable and kind without distinction of rank. These people who had long been indoctrinated with civility in another world and had witnessed countless tragic fates not be moved. Ding. The loyalty of farmer Zu E in your territory has reached 100. Ready to go through fire and water.</p>
<p>Ding. Your unit phantom archer soldering has reached a loyalty level of 90. Obedient to all commands. The system notifications kept coming. After Lin Sha finished his meal, the loyalty of all the farmers in his territory reached 100.</p>
<p>And even the phantom archers, who had only joined less than half a day ago, had a loyalty of 90. It can be said that the cohesion within the territory is at an unprecedented high. After eating and drinking his fill, it was already late at night. Lyn Sha glanced at the upgrade progress of his lord&#x27;s manor. Lord&#x27;s mansion under upgrade.</p>
<p>Upgrade countdown. 29 minutes and 36 seconds. Click the pause. I almost forgot. Now is the perfect time to use it.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Lord&#x27;s Manor was about to be upgraded, Lyn Sha remembered that there was one more thing he hadn&#x27;t used. That&#x27;s the city defense building wall that I just got from the treasure chest. This is a fairly common item. After use, it can upgrade the wooden fence of your territory into a wall. A wall is much better than a wooden fence.</p>
<p>The walls are higher and wider with greater defensive capabilities. Highle walls are even city walls where people and horses can walk and ride, making them impenetrable to ordinary monsters. Use the item to construct a defensive structure, the wall. As soon as Lynn Sha finished speaking, the wooden fence surrounding the entire territory, which was shimmering with golden light, was immediately covered by a burst of white light. Construction of the wall has begun.</p>
<p>Wall under construction. Construction countdown 29 minutes and 59 seconds. Click to pause. The wall is a very simple defensive structure, not a core building with a pivotal role like the Lord&#x27;s mansion. Moreover, it was converted from a wooden fence, so it can be built very quickly in just 1 hour.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha with his innate talent directly reduced construction time by 50% and the wall could be completed in half an hour. The timing is perfect. Lyn Sha did not forget to upgrade the walls as soon as possible to obtain higher defense, but rather wanted to complete the upgrade of the walls and the upgrade of the Lord&#x27;s mansion in the same time period. Because he suspected that every action he took in his territory would attract beast tides or demon tides, he couldn&#x27;t let such a small matter as upgrading the walls affect the important matter of upgrading the Lord&#x27;s Manor. Half an hour later, as the light faded, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s Lord&#x27;s Mansion successfully completed its upgrade, transforming from a level zero Lord&#x27;s Mansion at the start to a level one Lord&#x27;s Mansion.</p>
<p>Lord&#x27;s Mansion level level one quality legendary defense 5,000 + 5,000 attributes spiritual energy revival luck revival abundance power healing thorn fence special building rainbow pool click to view capacity 10,000. As the Lord&#x27;s upgrade is completed, the wooden fence expands outward, further increasing the territo&#x27;s area. As it is a legendary lord&#x27;s mansion, the territory area has been directly expanded to 50,000 square m, making the few buildings in the entire territory appear lonely. The next moment, the wall was also upgraded. In the light, the wooden fence transformed into a sturdy wall 3 m high and nearly 1 meter thick, enclosing the entire territory.</p>
<p>The wall quality average defense 1,000 at 1,000. The wall is of ordinary quality, so it only has 1,000 defense points, which is even less than the legendary quality wooden fence with 2,000 defense points. Fortunately, the walls are counted as separate defenses, and the 5,000 points of defense from the previously rumored wooden fence around the Lord&#x27;s Mansion are still retained. After completing the Lord&#x27;s mansion and surrounding walls, Lynn Sha worked tirelessly. He has already met two of the three conditions for recruiting heroes.</p>
<p>The third condition is that he uses a mini tavern, which can be completed in an instant. Use the mini tavern item to build a tavern within your territory. As soon as he finished speaking, the one colon 200 scale miniature tavern in Lin Xiao&#x27;s hand disappeared in the light. In just a few seconds, an identical tavern building appeared in the territory. The tavern is now complete.</p>
<p>The conditions for recruiting heroes have been met. And right now, it&#x27;s only the first day of the opening of the 89,757 newbie zone of the Battle of 10,000 races. At 11:55 p.m., Lyn Shia is about to make history. At this moment, Lynn Shiao didn&#x27;t care whether he was expecting a female general or an empress to appear and directly said, &quot;Exchange for Hasha token energy. Consume one energy point to use the Hasha token.</p>
<p>Hasha summoning function to summon a Hasha hero.&quot; A flash of seven colored light appeared and a portal appeared in the territory. The notification sound from the main god system came through. Congratulations on obtaining the Chinese hero Sword St. Payman. Chapter 24.</p>
<p>Sword Saint Payman. Sword St. Pman. As the voice of the main god system faded, a figure emerged from the portal. This is a man dressed in ancient Chinese attire.</p>
<p>He is wearing a pure white brocade robe with a tiger pattern gold belt around his waist. He has long, neat hair tied back. Below his eyebrows are bright eyes and he has a slender figure. He is truly a man of extraordinary talent and elegance. The man had a three-ft long sword hanging diagonally at his waist.</p>
<p>Although he was young, his expression revealed a hint of vicissitude, and every move he made was that of a swordsman. He stepped out of the portal, casually glanced around, and looked relaxed and indifferent, seemingly not at all puzzled by being in an unfamiliar place. At this moment, the god system began to instill information into the man. The man tilted his head and received all the information in a moment. So, it&#x27;s another world, a battlefield with endless wars and countless worlds and races.</p>
<p>Very well, this will allow me to hone my swordsmanship and pursue a higher level. After muttering a few words to himself, the man turned his head and looked at the lord Lin Sha, who was surrounded by dozens of emo dao iron guards and divine arm archers standing in front of him. Lyn Sha also stared silently at the man in ancient costume not far away. Heroes like knights errant, swordsmen, and chivalous thieves are unruly and more powerful in combat, but they are often too unrestrained and have lower loyalty than other heroes, requiring more maintenance of the relationship between lord and hero. Lynn Shiao recalled the relevant knowledge of the paper on the management of male heroes and the taming of female heroes mistaken and involuntarily connected it with the sword saint and knight in front of him.</p>
<p>In his previous life, Lyn Shao had vaguely heard of the name Pay Min. He only knew that Pay Min was one of the three perfections of the Tang Dynasty. Pay Min sword dance was as famous as Lee Ba&#x27;s poetry and Jang Sus cursive script. He had been awarded a title by the emperor of the time which showed his strength. But chivalry can break the law with martial arts.</p>
<p>The more powerful the chivalous hero, the more unrestrained and free they are. You are my lord. At this moment, Pay Min spoke, his voice gentle and refined yet seemingly casual. Looking at the carefree man before him, Lyn Xiaos serious face slowly relaxed, and he gave Pay Min a kind smile. Exactly.</p>
<p>Welcome, young swordsman from China. Welcome to be my subject, my first hero. Payman saw Linn Sha admit that he was the lord. He paused for two seconds and stared straight at the tall young man in front of him. He stopped his nonchalon attitude and quickly stepped forward, knelt on one knee, and bowed in greeting.</p>
<p>I am Pay Min, the 31st generation descendant of the Pi family of Hadong. I pay my respects to the Lord and am willing to serve you. Lynn Sha, who had already mentally prepared himself, stood there dumbfounded. This swordsman isn&#x27;t as arrogant as I imagined. Please rise, Mr.</p>
<p>Pay Min. Lyn Sha reached out to help him. I dare not address you as sir. You flatter me. My lord, you may simply call me by my name, Pay Min.</p>
<p>Pay Min stood up. He looked at his lord, Lin Sha, and his casual and chivalous aura disappeared, replaced by a more respectful one. Lin Shao also silently watched Pay Min thinking to himself, &quot;Check Pay Min&#x27;s personal attributes.&quot; The main god system immediately displayed Pay Min&#x27;s attributes. Sword Saint Pay Min Chinese quality golden legend level one. Attributes: Strength 58 + 29.</p>
<p>Spirit 63 + 32. Constitution 55 + 28. Soul 55 + 28. Skills: Sacrifice to break through illusions Srank. Sword mastery Srank.</p>
<p>Sword of all things. A sword from the east. Sword dance. Sword aura. A rank.</p>
<p>Ultimate path. Lord of 10,000 swords. Exclusive unit type: Chinese Ranger. Combat power rating 61 stars. Lin Sha nodded, thinking to himself.</p>
<p>This is a hero, a legendary hero of China&#x27;s golden age. Comes with an S-rank skill and boasts a combat power rating of 60 stars from the start. This is the most promising unit in my territory. It&#x27;s a pity we don&#x27;t have any experience points left. Otherwise, I could upgrade him immediately.</p>
<p>At level two, he would definitely be stronger than Tang Yi and Song Ruer, who are both at level seven. Lyn Shao had already used most of his experience points to level up, raising himself to level 10 in one go. After reaching level 10, the experience points required for level 11 even exceeded the total of the previous 10 levels. Moreover, Lyn Sha possessed the spirit of a Chinese emperor who could protect him probably. But Lyn Sha wasn&#x27;t sure if it was always a top expert like Xiang Yu.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha will not upgrade himself in the short term. So, he will focus on upgrading his subordinates. Pay Min, who is 61 stars at level one and has unprecedentedly powerful attributes, is a hero unit and will definitely be a key target for development. Thinking of this, Lynn Sha reached out and gently patted the sword saints shoulder, saying, &quot;Hey, Min, since we&#x27;re here, let&#x27;s make the best of it. Now that we&#x27;re in this strange world, are you willing to follow me to achieve great things and live up to the name of chivalry?&quot; Pay Min smiled faintly and said,&quot;Lord, you are protected by the Emo Dao soldiers of our great Tang dynasty, and you are the rightful heir of the Lee family, the emperor of the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>Although you have a chivalous spirit, you were also a soldier in your previous life, serving as a general in our great Tang dynasty.&quot; Pay Min knelt down on one knee again and bowed, saying, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it only natural for a young man to serve as Lord? I, Pay Min, am willing to serve you like a dog or a horse. Ding! Your hero, Sword Saint Payman, has reached 80% loyalty, as easy as a fingertip. The system notification sounded at just the right moment. &quot;Good, good, please rise.&quot; Lyn Xiaos doubts were finally resolved. It turned out that Pay Min was not only a swordsman and a sword saint, but also a soldier of the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>No wonder he chose to obey orders first in front of the Lord. Just as Lin Sha was about to give Pay Min a gift to help him unleash even greater power, several system voices came at the same time. Ding! You have successfully recruited your first hero in 13 hours and 56 minutes. Your speed has made history. You&#x27;ve set a new record on Earth.</p>
<p>You recruited heroes on your very first day in the Battle of all races, triggering a hidden reward. The god system rewards an extra hero and a legendary treasure chest. Signal interference is in progress. Correction. The god system will reward you with one epic chest and one additional beautiful heroine which will arrive soon with the demon tide.</p>
<p>Your speed in recruiting heroes has set a new record for earth. In 5 minutes, you will be subject to signal jamming across the entire planet. Correction. Your speed in recruiting heroes has set a new record on Earth. An announcement will be made across the entire Lon region in five minutes.</p>
<p>The voice of the God system stopped, but Lin Xiao&#x27;s heart was filled with turbulent waves. He had actually made history on Earth. He was the fastest newbie lord to recruit heroes on the entire planet. He knew he would set a record, perhaps in the newbie zone or the official zone, but he never imagined his record would break the entire planet&#x27;s record. with the Lord&#x27;s talent granting a 100% increase in building speed, the mini tavern, and the ability to farm resources across the entire map without wasting time on exploration.</p>
<p>He combined these three elements to achieve a historic feat. Also, what does bonus hero mean? Does it mean I can get two heroes with just one book? Also, why does the god system emphasize that this hero is a female hero? And why is she here again with the arrival of the demonic tide? Also, will there be a district-wide announcement later? Chapter 25 rewards you with a beautiful female hero. Here at 11:55 p.m., the chat channel in the 89757 newb zone became lively once again. On the first night in the newbie zone, there are always too many things to do. Dinglay, finally finished.</p>
<p>My lord&#x27;s manner started upgrading an hour ago. Upgrading completed within a day. Everyone, how&#x27;s your progress? By the way, I&#x27;ve also prepared the tavern&#x27;s materials. At this rate, I might be able to recruit my first hero tomorrow. In this battlefield of myriad races vying for supremacy, having my own hero and not having to charge into battle alone is truly blissful.</p>
<p>Dinglays smug remarks immediately caused a stir in the chat channel. Wow, Dinglay is still up so late, working so hard. No wonder he has a talent. By the way, Dinglay, what is your talent? Keep it a secret. Hey, I&#x27;m not afraid of geniuses.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m afraid of geniuses who work even harder than you. My god, I just scouted the area during the day and lost five units only to capture two mines. There&#x27;s still no sign of copper or iron mines. And Dinglay has already started upgrading his lord&#x27;s manor. Wow, a hero has emerged in just 3 days.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s fast enough to put us in the top tier of the LN region. Dinglay is definitely going to be a top player in the official region from now on. Most new lords follow a step-by-step approach, scouting, dispelling the fog of war, then grinding monsters, and capturing resource veins. Therefore, it is indeed rare for a new player to be able to start upgrading their lord&#x27;s manor on the first day. Haha, my little sister is also quite lucky today.</p>
<p>She just secured the necessary mineral vein and will be able to start upgrading the Lord&#x27;s manor later. Hey girl upstairs, want to get to know each other? Tell me your coordinates and I&#x27;ll come and keep watch for you. Seeing that someone was able to collect all the resources on the first day and that the person was a girl, some people had wicked ideas, making everyone nervous. Although my little sister is somewhat pretty, she&#x27;s definitely not brainless. My family has elite troops, so we&#x27;re not afraid of you.</p>
<p>Girl, you didn&#x27;t say where you were, but you&#x27;ve already revealed your abilities. Girl, are you out of your mind? The chat channel fell silent again. Luckily, the pretty girl hadn&#x27;t revealed her location, otherwise a real tragedy would have occurred. Xiao Datong, what are you so arrogant about? You guys are busy collecting resources while I&#x27;m busy leveling up. I&#x27;m already level five.</p>
<p>Lizard cavalry. Click to view. Gene, Dang, brothers, Datong are indeed frank. We are strong enough, so we are not afraid to expose our strength. I&#x27;m also level six.</p>
<p>I still have two rare unit squads, hog riders and harpies. Click to view. My brother and I are going to do something big tomorrow, and we would appreciate it if you could all do us a favor and witness it. Xiao Datong and Gene Dang s comments once again silenced the chat channel. Indeed, most lords are busy collecting resources, and leveling up is a matter for later.</p>
<p>After all, the battlefield of the myriad races is a contest based on the overall strength of the territory. However, these two brothers are equipped with rare troops and are constantly leveling up. They must have gained more experience and items than others, and their strength in the early stages is probably much greater than everyone else&#x27;s. Putting aside other things, most of the new lords are currently only at level one or two, leading ordinary troops and ordinary peasants. Seeing that no one dared to speak, Zhiao Datang and Gene Dang became smug again.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s wrong? Scared now. This is what they call when the neighbor hoards food. I hoard guns. The neighbor is my granary, huh? Dinglay, you think you&#x27;re so great? You dare to act tough in front of me? I&#x27;ll level up first, then go farm resources from the mines. I&#x27;ll upgrade my lord&#x27;s mansion by tomorrow at the latest, but I&#x27;m much stronger than you guys.</p>
<p>Ziao Datang was smug, and no one in the entire chat channel dared to respond to him. His apparent recklessness was even a facade. He already possessed a second team of rare troops, as well as teleportation and quest tokens. Gene Datong also had a necromancer summoning scroll. The two of them were far stronger than they appeared.</p>
<p>On the surface, his strength is enough to crush 90% of the newbies. And in reality, he can crush 99% of them. If it weren&#x27;t for the possibility that every district might have some immortal descendants or the offspring of high-ranking officials, Xiao Datang and Gene Dang would even believe that the two of them could already rule the 89,757 newbie district. They&#x27;ve got their hands on this newbie zone. But the thought of that person who treated him like he was nothing cast a shadow overhau mood.</p>
<p>That person was clearly so weak. Yet he ignored him time and time again. Just like a lion ignores an ant. His presence pierced Xiao Datongs good mood. Lyn Shiao.</p>
<p>His lord talent is only F-level trash. And myself B rank talent, two rare troop units, a level five lord. Combat power as high as 25 stars. and you&#x27;ll also have good luck frequently getting great equipment. I am the chosen one yet I am treated like air by such a good for nothing.</p>
<p>How can I swallow this insult? Thinking of this, Xiao Daong was furious and couldn&#x27;t help but start cursing in the chat channel again. Lyn Shiao, I&#x27;m giving you one last chance. I&#x27;m already level five. Are you scared yet? Now, immediately hand over the black long sword. Submit to me and I&#x27;ll spare your life.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t wait until tomorrow to regret it. I never let anyone who dares to mess with me get away with it. After making those harsh remarks, the chat channel remained silent. Xiao Daong knew that everyone was watching the chat channel, waiting for Lyn Xiaos response, and paying close attention to this duel. But Lynn Shiao himself didn&#x27;t care at all.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ziao Datang felt even more agitated and couldn&#x27;t help but continue. Lynn Shiao, aren&#x27;t you a genius from Jangdong number three Middle School? Aren&#x27;t you very awesome? What? You&#x27;re too scared to speak. You pathetic ranger lord. You didn&#x27;t even have the chance to recruit your first hero. Lyn Shia, answer me.</p>
<p>Answer me. Ding. Regionwide announcement. Lynn Shia from the Lon region 89757 newbie zone of the blue star realm has successfully recruited the first hero, setting a new record for the Lan region. The system rewards him with an additional beautiful female hero and one epic treasure chest.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao from the Long Non region 89757 newbie zone of the blue star realm has successfully recruited the first hero, setting a new record for the Lan region. The system rewards him with an additional beautiful female hero and one epic treasure chest blue star. The system announcement sounded three times and Lin Shia, who was drinking water, choked and coughed incessantly from the sudden sound. Cough, cough. What the hell? Why did you have to announce the reward in the first place? This is troublesome.</p>
<p>The whole region knows I have an epic treasure chest, and I&#x27;m going to become the target of everyone&#x27;s hatred. Fortunately, it&#x27;s just an epic treasure chest. Although it&#x27;s rare, I&#x27;ve gotten some myself every year when I was playing Monster Treasure House. And what&#x27;s with the system rewarding an extra beautiful female hero? Newbie zone 89756 in Lon region. A tall, beautiful, and aloof girl is deep in thought with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>Behind her stood the orderly buildings of the territory, row upon row, neatly arranged, towering walls and sharp arrow towers. Dozens of soldiers were practicing in the spacious open space of the Lord&#x27;s mansion. A valiant female soldier approached the stunningly beautiful woman and whispered, &quot;Miss, everything is ready. Our lord&#x27;s manor will be upgraded in 3 hours. Then we&#x27;ll use the mini tavern to become the first lord in the entire region to recruit a hero.</p>
<p>This time we&#x27;re sure to set a record.&quot; Also, Mrs. first hero has been chosen. Just then, a system announcement that resounded throughout the entire region came through. The female solders&#x27;s voice was filled with surprise. Someone beat us to it.</p>
<p>Who is it? We&#x27;ve been preparing for so long. We even bought speed up talismans at a high price. We could have been number one. The usually calm and collected, stunningly beautiful woman suddenly opened her eyes. It&#x27;s him, Lyn Sha.</p>
<p>I knew he was no ordinary person. A mere F-level talent would never be enough to defeat him. Then after hearing the second half of the announcement, a faint smile appeared on the beautiful woman&#x27;s lips, rewarding a beautiful female hero. This guy&#x27;s really got some nerve this way. Ziao Dahongs words were still hanging in the chat channel, and the system announcement for the entire region had already sounded three times.</p>
<p>His mouth was agape as if struck by lightning, and he had no idea what year it was. 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds. Haha. The chat channel was suddenly flooded with bursts of laughter. Chapter 26.</p>
<p>Believe Lin Shia or believe I am Chin Sher Huang. Haha. This is hilarious. It&#x27;s a slap in the face. A complete slap in the face.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not a comedian, are you? Haha. I he was originally lying in the arms of a beautiful woman watching the show, but this scene made me laugh so hard I was shaking with laughter. You used the wrong idiom, didn&#x27;t you? Why are you behaving so frivolously, you grown man? The beautiful women next to me were laughing so hard they couldn&#x27;t breathe and their bodies were shaking so badly they were practically falling on me. Puff. The previously subdued chat channel is now filled with a joyful atmosphere as all the novice lords who haven&#x27;t slept are chiming in with their own words, mocking the scene that just unfolded.</p>
<p>Enough. Shut up. Realizing what was happening, Xiao Datong flew into a rage again. Shut the hell up. Suppression talisman.</p>
<p>Suppression talisman. Suppression talisman. The group threatened by Ziao Datong gradually calmed down. After a moment, Xiao Daong said in a sinister tone, &quot;That&#x27;s more like it. Lyn Shia can set a record.</p>
<p>A lord with F-level talent, no money, and no power can set a record. I don&#x27;t believe it for a second. Do you believe Lin Sha can be the first to recruit heroes? Or do you believe I am Chin Sher Huang?&quot; He a trust Lin Shao Datang at Heay. Suppression talisman, teleport talisman, lizard rider, orc veteran. He a chin shang Xiao.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re smart to know what&#x27;s good for you. Lin Shiao, step forward. Is there a system error or is there another Lin Sha in the newbie zone? No one responded to Xiao Datons question, but Gene Dang immediately messaged Xiao Datong privately. Dong, you&#x27;re foolish. How could you reveal all your trump cards? Now everyone knows you have two rare troop types and teleportation scrolls.</p>
<p>Xiao Dat. Uh, damn it. I forgot. It&#x27;s all Heay&#x27;s fault. I&#x27;ll kill him.</p>
<p>Gene Dang. Forget it. Forget it. A small act of impatience can ruin a big plan. It&#x27;s not too late to deal with him after we&#x27;ve dealt with Lin Shiao.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t he say he&#x27;s surrounded by beautiful women? He probably has a lot of female soldiers. Xiao Datons eyes lit up. That&#x27;s right. Surrounded by beauties. This kid is quite lucky with women.</p>
<p>But do you think Lynn Shiao actually recruited the first hero and the second hero as a system reward? Gin Shang. I also find this very strange. How could an F-rank character set a record? But the god system has never made a mistake before. Xiao Datang. Does that mean Lynn Shiao is stronger than us now? No.</p>
<p>Gene Dang pondered for a moment and said, &quot;First of all, we cannot be sure whether Lin Shiao is really recruiting heroes. Secondly, newly recruited heroes have only about twice the stats of troops of the same quality. Lyn Shia is just a poor kid. How powerful can ordinary quality heroes be? They might not even be able to defeat rare troops. Again, you forgot.</p>
<p>If a hero has truly been recruited, it means he&#x27;s about to encounter a demonic tide sent by the main god system. Yes, and the demon tide. Xiao Datangs eyes lit up as well. The faster you recruit heroes, the fiercer the demonic tide will be. This kid recruited heroes on the very first day.</p>
<p>The demonic tide will definitely be incredibly powerful for him. Waha! Xiao Daong became increasingly happy and started speaking publicly in the chat channel again. &quot;Lin Xiao, you&#x27;re in big trouble recruiting heroes now. Can you withstand the demonic tide? Even if you bring two ordinary heroes, you&#x27;re no match for the demon tide.&quot; Haha, I&#x27;ll be right here watching how you, an orphan with no parents, die. I&#x27;ll be waiting to collect your corpse.</p>
<p>And when the time comes, your black long sword will still be mine. The moment the system announcement was made, Chufunga, who was also organizing resources within her territory, understood what was happening. A demonic tide. How did Lin Sha recruit heroes so quickly? Can he handle the demonic tide? Chufinga immediately initiated a communication with Lin Shiao. After a brief flashing communication signal, Lin Shiao answered the call.</p>
<p>Phone go. What&#x27;s the matter? Lyn Sha, you&#x27;ve really made it to the top and you&#x27;re even recruiting heroes. Chufinga&#x27;s flamboyant red hair immediately filled the entire screen. Lyn Sha couldn&#x27;t help but lean back slightly so as not to have Chufinga&#x27;s face looming in front of him. Yes, I have already recruited heroes.</p>
<p>How did you do that? I&#x27;ll tell you about that later. It depends on talent. I&#x27;m preparing to fight against the demonic tide. Lynn Shiao didn&#x27;t want to deceive his friend, nor did he want to tell Chufunga directly right now. This will let him know some secrets he shouldn&#x27;t know, which may not be good for him.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chufinga saw Saul Linn and several phantom archers behind Lin Shia through the main gods chat video window. Lynn Shao sent all the MO Dao iron guards and divine arm archers to guard the surroundings, leaving only some phantom archers behind. Phantom shooter. As a powerful ranged unit, Chufinga naturally recognized the phantom archer and immediately blurted it out. Yes, this is the phantom shooter.</p>
<p>Oh, I see. Lyn Sha, you&#x27;re really something. Shufinga suddenly realized, feeling much relieved. You must have used your talent for peace combined with your oratory skills to win over a group of phantom archers, right? Then we can use these phantom archers to farm resources without taking any damage, occupy the mines, and be the first to upgrade the lord&#x27;s manor, build a tavern, and recruit heroes. You&#x27;re definitely lucky.</p>
<p>There are resources right around your spawn point. Excellent. Excellent. Chufinger&#x27;s eyes were full of satisfaction. Even an F- level talent shines brightly in your hands.</p>
<p>You truly deserve it. This Phoenix song, no need to say more. You truly deserve the title of genius. You have both courage and luck. Chufinga interrupted.</p>
<p>With the phantom archers helping you defend a city, this wave of demonic tide should be a sure thing. Lyn Shiao, I can&#x27;t lose to you by too much. I&#x27;m hanging up now. Contact me if you need anything. After saying that, Chufinga hung up the call, leaving Lin Shia with a rice smile on his face.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t need to explain himself. Chufinga already understood him. Lyn Shia shook his head and was about to leave when Chufunga initiated another communication. Lyn Shiao, something terrible has happened. That guy, Xiao Datong, actually has teleportation talismans and two teams of rare troops, too.</p>
<p>You&#x27;d better be careful. It turned out that Chufinga had seen Xiao Dataongs message in the chat channel and instantly realized how dangerous Xiao Daong was. She then turned back to remind Lin Shiao, &quot;Okay, I understand. I&#x27;ll be careful.&quot; Seeing his brother make a special trip back, Lyn Sha was also very moved and promised Chufinga, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about me. My troops are far stronger than his.</p>
<p>Phantom archers are an excellent unit, but they are weak in close combat. They can&#x27;t be allowed to get close, otherwise they might be ambushed by that kid. Xiao Dot. Chufinga offered a couple of reminders, and knowing that Lin Shiao had phantom archers and was on guard, she wasn&#x27;t too worried and hung up the call again. Lyn Xiaos curiosity was also peaked.</p>
<p>So, he opened the chat channel and took a look. Hell, what a clown. People like that aren&#x27;t worth my time to deal with. Lynn Shiao shook his head, intending to ignore Xiao Datong and Gene Dashangs incompetent rage once again. But seeing Xiao Daongs enraged insults, he typed a string of messages in the chat channel.</p>
<p>I will not offend others unless they offend me. If they do, I will be punished by heaven and earth. Xiao Datong, I&#x27;m warning you, don&#x27;t go too far. Even a clay figure has a temper. Let alone Lin Shia, who has always wanted to become the most powerful lord.</p>
<p>He cannot tolerate others trampling on his dignity. Ziao Dataong has crossed the line by insulting his parents. Lyn Shiao then closed the chat channel. The walls are built, the farmers have been called back, and the soldiers are all on high alert. We are fully prepared to deal with the demonic tide.</p>
<p>Why haven&#x27;t the systems extra hero rewards and epic chests arrived yet? As I pondered, a system notification sounded. Ding. Your territory will be attacked by a demonic tide in 3 minutes. Difficulty of this demonic tide Srank. Chapter 27.</p>
<p>A sword comes from the east. The succubus makes her appearance. An Srank difficulty demonic tide. Level demonic tide. In the first book in his textbook when upgrading your lord&#x27;s manner and recruiting your first hero, you will encounter a demonic tide.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the magic tides in the beginner area are D level or C level. Even if a beginner lord with A-level talent sets some records in the beginner area and shows extraordinary talent, the god system will at most set AB level magic tide in order to hone the newcomers. An S ranked demonic tide is unheard of in the newbie zone. It&#x27;s only occasionally encountered by top players in the official zones at specific stages. But although it&#x27;s an S rank magic tide, it&#x27;s fortunate that it&#x27;s activated based on the lord&#x27;s overall strength.</p>
<p>The S rank magic tide in the beginner area is definitely not as good as the S rank magic tide in the official area. Otherwise, if thousands of level 100 monsters charged at the start, even Xiang Yu in his true form probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to withstand it. This shows that my talent and strength are too great, triggering the relevant conditions of the god system, Lyn Sha pondered. Two teams of legendary gold units, 42 phantom archers, setting a record for the fastest hero recruitment on Earth. The SSS level talent is probably the result of these combined, which led me to encounter an unprecedented S-level magic tide in the newbie zone.</p>
<p>However, the battlefield for the struggle for supremacy among all races is not a battlefield where everyone is to die, but a battlefield to cultivate lords and make them stronger. There will be no situation where certain death is inevitable. Let&#x27;s meet force with force and water with earth. Let me see just how powerful the S-class demonic tide really is. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s fighting spirit was ignited by the Sclass demonic tide, and he began to look forward to it.</p>
<p>He said to Pay Min, who was meditating with his eyes closed. Pay Min, you&#x27;ve come at just the right time. A wave of incredibly powerful monsters is approaching. Your sword is ready to be drawn. Pay Min slowly opened his eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve come at the perfect time. The two arrived at the entrance to Linia&#x27;s territory where all the Emo Dao iron guards, divine arm archers, and phantom archers were on high alert. The system s demonic tides usually rushed towards the territory openly and honestly. Coincidentally, after Lyn Xiao&#x27;s Lord&#x27;s Manor was upgraded to the first level, it completely occupied the bottleneck of the valley. Lynho&#x27;s territory is surrounded by cliffs on two sides and a river and high walls behind it.</p>
<p>If the demonic tides want to come over, they must come directly through the territo&#x27;s gate. This gave Lynn Shiao the opportunity to concentrate his defensive forces on defense. In the distance, huge dark clouds appeared in the sky. As the black clouds swirled, twisted and deformed figures fell straight down from the sky, carrying flames and black smoke. They crashed among the rocks in the wilderness, and some also crashed into the gathering places of wild monsters.</p>
<p>The demonic mist churned and screams rang out. These unfortunate monsters were instantly infected by the demonic tide and turned into demons as well. Slowly, one by one, the monsters rose from the ground, their numbers increasing and their aura growing more and more terrifying. Suddenly, a shrill howl rang out, and thousands of demons seemed to receive a signal, rushing towards Lyn Xiao&#x27;s territory without regard for anything else. They&#x27;re here.</p>
<p>Iron guards of the Mod Dao, prepare. Divine Archer, fire. Phantom shooter, read the bow. Meteor showers rained down, flames streaking across the sky with tremendous force, and the entire 89757 newbie zone witnessed this terrifying scene. &quot;What the hell is this?&quot; someone muttered to themselves, trembling with fear.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the terrifying thing in the sky fell far away from me, someone said with relief, &quot;Is this a demonic tide? I&#x27;ve never heard of a demonic tide like this before, someone asked in the chat channel. I don&#x27;t know. Maybe it&#x27;s a system bug. What system bug? Isn&#x27;t this all Lin Xiao&#x27;s doing? Xiao Daong said gloatingly. This kid broke the record.</p>
<p>Now he&#x27;s getting his comeuppants. May he be struck down by lightning. Chufinga also looked solemnly at the meteor shower falling continuously in the distant sky, turned on his communication device, and was ready at any time. He was preparing to connect to that person&#x27;s communication and he was also ready to call his own father at any moment but he won&#x27;t contact that person again. The unspoken understanding between the brothers made him realize that if they really encountered a problem they couldn&#x27;t handle that person would definitely come to him.</p>
<p>If someone can handle things but you keep contacting them that&#x27;s not concern that&#x27;s charity. That person has too much pride and will never accept charity from others. Is Lin Xiaos demonic tide here to deal with you? Iron Guards of the Mod Dao, hold your ground. Tang Yas powerful voice rang out, and 10 Modao Iron Guards stood at the gate of the territory, their backs to the territory, ready to deploy their 3 m long Dao swords. The rolling black clouds and demonic mists surged in.</p>
<p>And at the forefront were the most common demonic creatures, demon children, horned demons, and demonic hounds, both common and superior. Their numbers as endless as ants moving house. Behind them were fierce demons and bone demons of excellent and rare quality, also stretching far and wide, with no end in sight. The surging demonic army were several nest demons. Massive creatures composed of enormous mouth parts and tentacles.</p>
<p>Instantly recognizable as terrifying. These were epic beings of the demon race, possessing high attack and defense and capable of continuously creating new demonic children and horned demons. In addition to these main demonic armies, there are also demonic puppets such as ghouls, swollen drowners, mist demons, and plague zombies. transformed from neutral monsters that were infected and killed by the demonic tide during the meteor shower just now. Five-headed nest demons.</p>
<p>With the help of Song Rui&#x27;s eagle eye ability, Lin Sha directly saw the most dangerous creature in this demonic tide through the black mist. Nest demon. Race demon. Level 30. Quality epic.</p>
<p>Attributes: Strength 115. Spirit 45. Constitution 125. Soul 45. Combat power rating 105 stars.</p>
<p>Skills regeneration, infection, flame immunity, reproduction. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve seen too many of my own legendary gold units. The attributes that would terrify other new lords are nothing to me. Lynn Sha shook his head. This was the first unit he had encountered that was level 30, and it was an epic unit with a combat power rating of 105 stars.</p>
<p>Looking at the data panel alone, the 115 strength and 125 constitution are far superior to the attributes of the MO Dao Iron Guard. But Lynn Sha remained unmoved. If the strongest nest demon only has this attribute, we should be able to get through this without any major dangers. Lynn Sha said softly. Pay Min standing to the side looked at Xiao Mo with a fierce fighting spirit.</p>
<p>My lord, leave me a few of these demons. I&#x27;ll kill them all before I deal with them. Okay, go. Pay Min moved with lightning speed and walked straight out of the territo&#x27;s gate. Facing them, a tidal wave of demon children and horned demons surged forth.</p>
<p>Just ants. Pay Min&#x27;s long robes fluttered without wind, and his long hair swayed behind his head, exuding an indescribable elegance and freedom. He formed a swordfinger gesture with his right hand and pointed it towards the densest part of the demonic tide. &quot;Rise!&quot; Payman transformed into a sword light, soaring into the sky and cutting through the demonic tide. Wherever he went, all the demons were annihilated.</p>
<p>A sword comes from the east. Pay Min transforms into sword energy, reaching a state of selflessness, using his body as a sword and the sword to control himself, dealing damage equal to 10 points of his own strength plus spirit plus soul attributes, ignoring magic immunity and evasion and cannot be controlled while casting. Payman&#x27;s sword technique almost cut the demonic tide in half. Then Pay Min used his movement techniques to move around and fight amidst the demonic tide. Truly worthy of the title of sword saint.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha stood quietly at the gate of the territory and exclaimed, &quot;As a lord, his main role is to stabilize the morale of the army and express his confidence in victory. But at that moment, affected by pay men&#x27;s swordsmanship, the rear of the demonic tide became somewhat chaotic. Hm. Could it be that the true leader of this wave of demonic tide has arrived? Lyn Sha also felt that this time the five nest demons were not enough and did not seem like a challenge for his s class demon tide. Lyn Sha immediately looked over and saw two women wearing tight leather clothes that accentuated their beautiful figures with big eyes, red lips, and faces that were both innocent and alluring.</p>
<p>They had two small long horns on their heads and long thin tails behind them. They walked out from the very end of the demonic tide. It&#x27;s a succubus. One of the succubi sensed something, glanced at Lyn Sha, then smiled quietly, and whispered to the other succubus beside her. When the other succubus turned around, she and Lyn Sha made eye contact.</p>
<p>Although the two were separated by a distant battlefield, their eyes met in an instant. Lyn Sha suddenly felt a loud boom in his head and his thoughts froze for a moment. Chapter 28. Demon Tide boss. The legendary flame demon makes its appearance.</p>
<p>Just as Lin Sha was in a brief mental vacuum, the fighting near the territory naturally did not stop. Call out. The sound of air being torn apart came from nearby, and the archers unleashed their first volley. The tin-headed bone demon and the fierce demon immediately fell dead. Meanwhile, the Phantom Archer had already drawn his bow, ready to fire at any moment.</p>
<p>These two powerful ranged archers only targeted enemies of superior quality or higher, ignoring the most numerous demon children and horned demons. Because those weak but numerous enemies are reserved for the iron guards of the Mod Dao, when the demonic tide reached a distance of 200 m, the Phantom Archer fired his arrow. Swish, swish, swish. The Phantom Archers dominance among elite units is inseparable from their rapid fire ability. These elves arrows are fast and accurate, even faster than the divine archers.</p>
<p>The divine arm bow for long range shooting. They need to step on the bow to draw it, firing one arrow every 3 seconds. When they enter the normal firing range for rapid fire, they can simply pull back the giant crossbow with their hands, achieving one arrow per second. But that&#x27;s not enough. The Phantom Archer can fire two arrows per second.</p>
<p>The incredibly fast soldering can fire three arrows per second. This is also the type of soldier that Lynn Shiao decided to go to great lengths to recruit. The phantom archer&#x27;s rate of fire effectively compensates for the divine archer&#x27;s weakness. If S Ruer and his men were like Barrett rifles, incredibly powerful and capable of point-to-point demolition, but requiring them to pull the bolt after each shot, then Solin and his men were like fully automatic rifles, and very accurate ones at that. The Phantom Archer&#x27;s first arrow pierced the monster.</p>
<p>The second arrow was already flying in midair, and the third arrow was already knocked in the Phantom Archer&#x27;s hand. This extremely high rate of fire is best suited for dealing with large numbers of fragile enemies. And so ghouls, bloated drowners, and horned demons fell in droves. However, the demonic tide was like a stream blocked by pebbles. Although it kept creating waves, the demons still rushed to the front of the territory.</p>
<p>Standing before the monsters were 10 burly men, tall and strong, clad in heavy armor, and wielding long swords. The MO DAO Iron Guard S skill has been activated. Pillar of strength. When facing a superior enemy with a combat strength rating close to or exceeding that of your own, increases morale and strength, spirit, and constitution. The greater the number of enemies, the more morale, strength, and constitution are increased.</p>
<p>This effect is doubled when protecting your lord and heroes. Faced with a large number of powerful demons and nightmare horses whose strength was comparable to his own on paper, the Mod Dao Iron Guard immediately pushed his pillar of strength skill to its limit. Increases three-dimensional strength, spirit, and body attributes by 100% and doubles the protection for the lord, increasing strength, spirit, and body attributes by 200%. Heroic: The iron guards of the mo down never retreat. The more enemies there are, the stronger there will becomes.</p>
<p>Activated when the number of enemies exceeds five times the number of iron guards of the Mod Dao, increasing health by 5% and so on up to a maximum increase of 100% of maximum health. The life value of the MO DAO iron body is also directly increased by 100%. The current MO DAO iron guard are as follows. Strength 83 + 166 + 42. Spirit 39 + 78 + 19.</p>
<p>Constitution 72 + 144 + 36. Soul 34 + 68 + 12. In the battlefield where all races v for supremacy, health points are a hidden attribute linked to physical strength and are generally not visible. Such a health value is more realistic because even the most powerful creature will die if it is hit in a vital spot or its head is cut off. Even with tens of thousands of health points, several rounds of reinforcements, the MO Dao iron guards with their two layers of iron armor are truly tanky.</p>
<p>With a howl, the monster charged. With a single slash, Tangi cleaved seven or eight demonic children into pieces. Then with a swift strike, another slash was unleashed in milliseconds, instantly killing more than a dozen demon children and ghouls. All the demons within a 3meter radius were wiped out. All the MO Dao iron guards stood shoulderto-shoulder like a dam against a raging torrent, blocking all the monsters before them.</p>
<p>Whether the monsters were common, fine, rare, or exceptional quality, from level one to level 20, none could withstand a single strike from the Mod Dao. The mist of the silent night had been dispelled by the meteor shower, and moonlight shone down. The sky was ablaze with fire light, illuminating the endless tide of demons. Amidst the demonic tide, a sword light, sharp and unstoppable, crisscrossed with sword energy, illuminating the demonic tide. Before the demonic tide, a wall of people stood proudly, advancing like a wall.</p>
<p>One by one, rare and exceptional monsters were targeted and killed by the divine archer, while fine and rare monsters were slain by a hail of arrows from the phantom archer. This demonic tide, which had terrified most of the novice lords to the point of silence, was actually stopped by Lyn Sha and his heroes and troops. No one noticed that Lyn Sha was standing motionless, his eyes unfocused. Two stunningly beautiful succubi stood at the very back of the demonic tide, coldly watching the scene unfold, as if the deaths and injuries of the demons before them had nothing to do with them. One of the succubi licked her lips, her delicate pink lips, and scarlet tongue, creating a seductive interplay.</p>
<p>Master, is this the human? Although he looks quite handsome, he is so weak and easily defeated. The other succubus chuckled. He&#x27;s got something. I can&#x27;t figure out his true background. It seems he doesn&#x27;t belong to this era.</p>
<p>Not belonging to this era. The succubus, addressed as master, did not answer the question, but instead said, &quot;Let&#x27;s go. I&#x27;ve already met the person the ancient demon spoke of. He has potential and is quite good-looking. If he survives, this princess really likes the raising a child type of relationship.</p>
<p>You know, let Tungle test his strength first. With that, the succubus waved her hand gently, opening a portal. The two stepped into the portal and disappeared. Ding! Your hero, Sword Saint Pay Min, has slain the Nest Demon Lord, gaining 34,000 experience points, 50 energy, and 867 gold. The notification from the main god system startled Lin Sha awake.</p>
<p>What just happened to me? Lyn Sha suddenly realized what had just happened. He saw two succubi at the end of the demonic tide. One of the succubi even made eye contact with him and then he lost consciousness. No one even knew about it. Although it was only for a brief moment, the danger involved was self-evident.</p>
<p>Wait, where&#x27;s the succubus? Lynn Shiao immediately mobilized the spirit of Xiang Yu, gripped his spear, and poured his power into himself to boost his aura. Seong Rue, come to my side and protect me. Tangg Yi blocked the main entrance. Lyn Shao called Song Ruer, who immediately came over, drew his divine crossbow, and stood guard for Lin Shao. After making sufficient preparations, Lyn Sha raised his head again and looked at the demonic tide.</p>
<p>The demon tide had already been decimated by his own group of fierce men, but Lyn Sha looked closely and could not find the succubus. Upon closer examination of my body and mind, I found nothing unusual. Was that just a hallucination? After searching repeatedly, Lynn Shia still couldn&#x27;t find it and couldn&#x27;t help but doubt his experience. After all, succubi are only epic creatures and shouldn&#x27;t have such power. It&#x27;s unbelievable that a single glance from thousands of meters away could make me, who was possessed by the spirit of Xiang Yu, lose consciousness.</p>
<p>Be careful when you encounter Succubi in the future. And don&#x27;t fall into their traps. Lyn Shiao shook his head. He had a cheat code. Just then, a massive body rose slowly from behind the demonic tide.</p>
<p>Its enormous size, burning body, and radiant glow even drew the attention of everyone on the battlefield. It was a fire demon that was 10 m tall. Legendary creature. Chapter 29. Slaying the flame demon.</p>
<p>The beautiful heroine has been distributed. Fire demon Tungle. Race: High Demon. Level 30. Quality golden legend.</p>
<p>Attributes: Strength 185. Spirit 175. Constitution 90, soul 175. Combat power rating 179 stars. Skills: Rank A, Command, Split Attack, Flame Immunity, Summon Volcano, Incineration, Resurrection.</p>
<p>The Flame Demon appeared. All the monsters on the battlefield became excited as if they had been injected with adrenaline. Domination rank A increases all attributes of all creatures within the demon tide by 30%. In an instant, the previously scattered demonic tide rose up again. Lynhiaos eyes flickered when he saw the flame demon attribute.</p>
<p>Both are level 30, but the legendary gold flame demon is almost twice as strong as the epic nest demon. It even has a race listed as high demon with a built-in 30% all attribute boost. While it can&#x27;t match the 20% all attribute boost from its own eternal peace skill combined with the 30% all attribute boost from Xiang Yu&#x27;s heroic soul, it&#x27;s more than qualified to be the final boss of this S class, Demonic Tide. As for why it&#x27;s level 30, that&#x27;s because the highest level the newbie zone can accommodate is level 30. The Balro was almost entirely composed of flames.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hands, two huge and scorching fireballs immediately hurdled towards the Lord&#x27;s mansion. Boom! Boom! Two loud explosions rang out, and the territory&#x27;s barrier was immediately severely damaged. Ding! Your territo&#x27;s walls have suffered heavy damage. Current defense value 378/2,000. With just one strike, the front wall of the territory was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>This Balrog is also a magic attack and ranged unit. It&#x27;s all right. The territory&#x27;s total defense is 12,000. It can withstand a few more hits. Lyn Shiao secretly marveled that his lord&#x27;s manner was legendary and his own talent, eternal peace, added 100% to the city&#x27;s defense value.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a wall with a normal defense value of 1,000 points plus a regular Lord&#x27;s manner with a defense value of 1,000 points would be nothing more than a single blow to the flame demon. As expected of an S class demonic tide, ordinary lords would be instantly annihilated upon encountering it. If we kill the flame demon right now, everything will be solved. Just as Lin Sha was about to give the order, Pay Min, who had just killed the second nest demon, looked up and saw this scene. Perfect timing.</p>
<p>Pay Min transformed into a beam of sword light and charged straight at the flame demon in the distance. The flame demon as high spirit stat of 175 allowed him to quickly discover the human swordsman&#x27;s intentions. Under the dazzling sword light, the flame demon had no choice but to temporarily avoid its brilliance. The towering flame demon nimblely dodged Pay Min&#x27;s sword strike from the east, then raised his large hand and struck the human sword saint. Amidst the raging flames, Pay Min advanced instead of retreating.</p>
<p>He was struck by the flame demon, which instead aroused his ferocity. Sacrifice oneself to break through thoughts is activated. Burning life force using lost essence as a catalyst enhances one&#x27;s combat power. For every 1% of life lost, one gains 2% more strength and spirit. Upon breaking through the barrier, one detonates the attacks Pay Min has inflicted on the enemy, causing massive damage.</p>
<p>Demon die. Pay Min is a level one hero. Even with Lyn Xiao&#x27;s 50% attribute bonus, his four stats are only around 80. When he was hit by the flame demon, he suffered a serious injury. As soon as the sacrifice to breakthrough thoughts was activated, a burst of light immediately erupted from the flame demon&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>It turns out that the sword strike from the east had already struck the flame demon. The flame demon cried out in pain as paymen struck again with his sword. The sword light piercing through the flame demon&#x27;s massive body. With a howl, the fire demon waved its hands, sending down and exploding more than a dozen fireballs that killed countless monsters around it. One of the fireballs also hit Pay Min, who had no way to avoid it.</p>
<p>Paymen floated in the air. The flame demon pointed a finger and a beam of fire shot straight at Pay Min. Pay Min activated his movement technique, dodged to the side, and transformed into a sword again, striking the flame demon and slicing through its body, leaving trails of lava. The flame demon raised his hand, and the ground trembled. A volcano rose from the ground, and in an instant, the sword light struck the volcano, blocking the sword.</p>
<p>Then, volcanic lava erupted and shot out in all directions. Some lava fireballs flew everywhere and exploded between the iron guards of the Mod Dao, which the iron guards withtood. Others exploded on the territo&#x27;s walls and defensive formations, causing the territo&#x27;s defense value to drop rapidly. Some magma fireballs seemed to have eyes, chasing after Pay Min. Pay Min activated sword dance to block all the magma, but his offensive was already weakened and the flame demon seized the opportunity to blast him away with a big fireball.</p>
<p>Huh? Extraterrestrial demons, you&#x27;ve got some skill. Pay men coughed up blood and was about to activate, sacrifice, and break through thoughts again to fight the flame demon to the death when a streak of light flashed past him. Lyn Shao had arrived at the center of the battlefield at some point. Holding a long spear, he was possessed by the spirit of Xiang Yu and flew away as a streak of light, piercing the head of the flame demon with a single thrust. Lin Sha attributes strength 67 + 250, spirit 68 + 100, constitution 45 + 200, soul 45 + 110.</p>
<p>the critical hit rate of yourself and your heroes and troops to 100%. Commonly known as a critical hit every time, this shot carries a 100% critical hit rate and is infused with the power of a tripod and the essence of the overlord spear, making its attack power terrifyingly high. One strike and the flame demon is instantly killed. Even the rare spear that Lynn Sha brought couldn&#x27;t withstand the power of this attack. After piercing the flame demon&#x27;s head, it slowly turned into ashes.</p>
<p>Ding! You have defeated the fire demon Tungle, gaining 150,000 experience points, 100 energy, and 2,000 gold. You&#x27;ve obtained a legendary chest one. You&#x27;ve obtained the Knights Lance Broer. As the system notification sounded, the enormous fire demons slowly collapsed, making a huge crashing sound and gradually turned into ashes. After a few seconds of silence, &quot;Your lordship is mighty.&quot; All the soldiers who witnessed this scene shouted in unison.</p>
<p>Then they launched a fierce attack, charging out and turning the tide of monsters into a horde of fleeing, panicked creatures, &quot;Well done!&quot; Lyn Sha reached out and helped Pay Min, who was panting on the ground, to his feet. &quot;Only today do I realize that your excellency&#x27;s martial arts are unparalleled.&quot; Pay Min bowed deeply to the ground, showing utter admiration for Lin Sha. It&#x27;s all thanks to Pay Min for wounding the flame demon and distracting him that I was able to strike successfully. Lyn Sha didn&#x27;t take credit for it. He knew that his basic skills were far inferior to Pay Min&#x27;s.</p>
<p>It was only through the power of Xiang Yus spirit and Paymen&#x27;s cooperation that he was able to kill the flame demon. With the flame demon slain, the amplification of the demonic tide disappeared. But Lyn Xiao&#x27;s troops were inspired by their lord&#x27;s performance and launched an even more ferocious attack. The demonic horde was quickly wiped out, except for a few that managed to escape over the valley or into the night. You have successfully resisted the S-class demonic tide.</p>
<p>Rewards are being calculated. The system notification sounded. Battle results. Destroy the following enemies. One flame demon, legendary.</p>
<p>Five nest demons, epic. 67 nightmare horses, excellent. 890 fierce demons, rare. 1673 bone demons, rare. And one horn demon, fine.</p>
<p>Battle duration, 1 hour, 2 minutes, and 11 seconds. Our casualties, zero. Special features: S level demon tide. The first demon tide in the entire region. The lord personally participates in the battle and the level difference between the lord and the troops exceeds 10 levels and the first legendary boss in the newb zone rewards 1 mill637,450 experience 65,600 gold 4,430 energy one epic quality pond one epic quality chest three superior quality chests one blacksmith shop one rare equipment horse slaying saber one fine equip equipment.</p>
<p>Birchwood Longbow. God, I haven&#x27;t received my last reward yet. Seeing that his territory had successfully resisted the demonic tide, Lynsha felt relieved and casually asked, remembering that his extra hero reward had not yet arrived. The god system never responds to contestants, and Lyn Xiao&#x27;s question was just a casual remark, as if he were talking to himself. With Pay Min, a legendary hero from China who could fight a level 30 legendary flame demon at level one.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia was already very satisfied. Unexpectedly, the god system directly replied to Lyn Sha. Contestant number 11 12020, your extra female hero has been awarded. Lyn Sha, question mark. The main god system replied to me, &quot;No, the key question is where is the beautiful heroine?&quot; Chapter 30.</p>
<p>Only Lin Sha dared to suppress her Lin Xiao&#x27;s strange behavior. While Lin Sha was battling the demon tide, Chufunga, who was sitting solemnly in the same newbie zone, waiting for news, was anxiously waiting for a communication. Lyn Sha, being born into poverty, is not a disgrace. A true man is one who can bend and stretch. If you can&#x27;t hold on, just attack.</p>
<p>My berserkers are all ready. I also have teleportation scrolls. I&#x27;ll go straight there to help you fight off the demonic tide. If we act quickly, I can also ask the old man to help me break through the barrier. Amidst her muttering to herself, Chufinga&#x27;s avatar flashed.</p>
<p>Someone had initiated a communication request. Chufinga didn&#x27;t even look at it before taking the communication. Hey, Lynsha, don&#x27;t say anything else. Just tell me the coordinates. I&#x27;m coming right now.</p>
<p>So, you really are in contact with Lin Shiao. A clear, melodious female voice came from the other end of the line. Chufinga was taken aback. She looked up and saw a stunningly beautiful yet aloof face appear on the communication interface. Dug Jalon Yuri looking for Lin Sha.</p>
<p>Yes, Chufinga. Dugu Jaolon said expressionlessly, her face as cold as ice, making it impossible to tell why she had come to him. The unusual activity that occurred in the 89757 newbie zone has attracted the attention of the entire LN region. A man named Lyn Sha set a new record for the entire Lan region and received an additional reward. That&#x27;s right, that person is Lyn Sha, the one you know, Chufunga replied.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Chufinga&#x27;s affirmative reply, a glint seemed to flicker in Dugu Jaolons beautiful eyes, but it vanished in an instant. She continued, &quot;Someone just posted on the forum that a meteor shower fell from the sky over your newbie zone, indicating that at least an epic level monster&#x27;s demonic tide has appeared. Some analysts believe it might be a demonic tide of a level difficulty.&quot; Lyn Shao Chufinga&#x27;s expression also wavered slightly. Although he knew about the complicated relationship between the woman opposite him and Lin Shiao, and it was not appropriate for him to comment too much. At this moment, he could feel Dugu Jaons concern for Lin Shia.</p>
<p>He hasn&#x27;t contacted me yet, but his profile picture is still online. That&#x27;s good. Dugu Jaolon didn&#x27;t say anything more and hung up the call. She understood Lin Shia, the pride of the school, who had always been superior to her, and his arrogance. A system announcement came on.</p>
<p>Dugu Jalon, a player from the Lan region of the Blueest Star realm, has successfully recruited his first hero, becoming the second ranked rookie lord in the Lan region this year. System reward one epic treasure chest. After the announcement was repeated three times, a system notification sound, which only Dugu Jalon could hear, followed. Ding! Your territory will be attacked by a demonic tide in 3 minutes. Difficulty of this demonic tide.</p>
<p>Rank A. In the sky, a meteor shower began to form. Lin Sha, with your F-rank talent, and without any assistance, how did you manage to deal with the A-rank demonic tide? Dugu Jaolan waved her hand and pointed, and a three-ft long sword flew into her hand like lightning. Ta sword. The sword passed down through my family.</p>
<p>Others say it was created by an ancient demon, but I can only feel close to it. This time we fight side by side. Let me experience the A-rank difficulty of the demonic tide too. Chufinga breathed a sigh of relief. Although he was arrogant, he was Lyn Xiao&#x27;s best friend and had powerful backing.</p>
<p>But he knew how terrifying Duga Jaolon was. This woman is not to be trifled with. During her talent test, the test stone tablet had just started to react when the director and a few others mysteriously took her away. Nobody knows her background, but I think she must have gotten at least an A, right? All Lord talents below grade C, such as grades D and E, are revealed on the spot. The purpose is to discourage lord players with low talent and ability.</p>
<p>After all, the battlefield of all races is not blind. Canon fodder will easily die there, and alien races and alien species will live to gain points and resources, thus strengthening others for no reason. It can also improve the efficiency of resource coordination. After all, for entertainment lords below rank C, if it&#x27;s really useful, such as the talent, peace, and prosperity, which increases everyone&#x27;s recovery speed, they can directly find a strong player to rely on. Talents of C rank and above can be made public by the lord himself/ herself.</p>
<p>B- rank talents are already considered excellent talents and are considered the mainstay of the official server. Rank A are the seated players, and all parties must protect them closely to prevent lords from other domains from intercepting them halfway. Only someone like Dinglay, who likes to show off, would have most people know that he is an A. Dugu. Jaolon, the eternal second place student at Jangdong number three middle school, possesses unparalleled intelligence and marshall prowess.</p>
<p>Her family background is shrouded in mystery. Chufunga only knows that her power surpasses her own and her lord level talent is absolutely no less than her own. Only Lyn Sha would dare to disregard her feelings and press down on her. Huh? It&#x27;s pressing down on her head. No, I mean you have to outdo her in every way.</p>
<p>Oh my god. Just as Chufinga was talking to herself, another call came through on the communication interface, startling her. Holy crap, it&#x27;s my dad. Chufinga dared not not answer. The moment the call connected, he realized he had forgotten to wear a hat.</p>
<p>His fiery red hair dazzlingly bright. Fongu, who is this red-haired guy who&#x27;s with Lyn Sha? Chu Fongu, are you asking for a beating? On the other end was a middle-aged man in a suit and tie, tall and with an extraordinary demeanor. He was none other than Chu Yusi, the city lord of JDong City. Red hair? What red hair? Dad, the light here isn&#x27;t very good. It&#x27;s the fire light that&#x27;s illuminating it.</p>
<p>Chufinga changed the subject. Fortunately, Chu Yusi was clearly in a hurry and didn&#x27;t bother to pursue the matter further. Getting straight to the point, is Lynn Shia from the same district as you? Yes, he&#x27;s the one who set the record. It really is him. Shu Yusi breathed a sigh of relief and said, &quot;I just received a secret message from above.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s something strange about Lin Xiaos matter. We need to protect him carefully and observe him for a period of time. Strange. Yes. The main god system said he set a new record for the entire region, but instead rewarded him with an extra hero.</p>
<p>This has never happened before. Chu Yusi&#x27;s expression was serious. The extra heroes are only awarded to the top three in the ninth heaven each year, as well as the record setter in the blue star realm. Above the 89757 novice zone is the Lon region. Above the Lan region are the eight domains.</p>
<p>The LN region belongs to the Lshia domain. Above the eight domains is the blue star realm and the blue star realm belongs to the ninth heaven. Upon hearing this news, Chufinga&#x27;s expression turns serious. Furthermore, Jabbron, the first prophet lord under the queen of dragon summer domain, deduced that the demonic tide Lin Sha is facing this time is likely to be between A level and S level in difficulty. His potential is definitely more than just frank.</p>
<p>This is the recognition of him by the main god system. The prophet lord believes that he may grow into a powerful ranger lord which is a talent that our dragon summer domain desperately needs. Therefore, the prophet lord wants to focus on cultivating him. But this demonic tide is exceptionally dangerous. Can Lyn Sha really hold on? It should be fine, right? Hearing her father&#x27;s analysis, Chufinga suddenly became uncertain.</p>
<p>He has at least 20 phantom archers. Immediately, Chufinga told Chu Yusi about what he had seen behind Lin Shiao, including the phantom archer, his deductions, and how Lin Sha was the first to recruit a hero. &quot;Yes, he&#x27;s got potential.&quot; Shu Yusi nodded. She faces death headon, fully utilizes her talents, remains calm and decisive, and has strong resilience. much better than my brat ahem.</p>
<p>In short, he&#x27;s a promising talent. Fungu, since he&#x27;s your good friend, you must help him if you have the chance. Under Chu Fungas mournful gaze, Chu Yusi ended the communication, leaving behind a single sentence. If he survives this demonic tide, tell him he can contact me anytime if he needs anything. Chufinga shook her head.</p>
<p>Why is everyone looking for that kid? Lynn shouted. After saying that, he suddenly noticed that the explosions in the night sky outside had stopped and the meteor shower had ceased. The demonic tide has ended. He quickly looked at Lyn Xiaos profile picture and breathed a sigh of relief. Lyn Shiao is still alive.</p>
<p>Chapter 31. The true hidden hero. Baoi makes her debut. My lord, what are you doing? His weakened state. Pay Min was radiant, clearly having benefited greatly from the battle just now.</p>
<p>He had just returned to the Lord&#x27;s mansion when he saw Lyn Sha bending down to fetch a bucket of water. &quot;Wash your hands. Open the treasure chest,&quot; Lyn Sha replied irritably. Feeling like he&#x27;d been tricked by the system, Lyn Sha decided to open all the treasure chests and confirm all the rewards to feel more at ease. Otherwise, it&#x27;s like the so-called beautiful heroine who has no shadow at all, but everyone in the district thinks she does.</p>
<p>He has a beautiful female hero. Where is she? He currently only has rare equipment. Horse slaying saber one. Excellent equipment. Birchwood longbow one.</p>
<p>Two excellent quality chests. Two epic quality chests and one golden legendary chest. There&#x27;s also the lance blec and blacksmith shop dropped by the balro in the epic quality pool. Some of these items are weapons which seem to be of good quality. The other two are auxiliary buildings that will greatly enhance the territory strength.</p>
<p>The rare spear I brought from Lsha just happened to explode. So, I guess I can use a new spear to replace it, but I can&#x27;t look at it right now. Enough talk. Let&#x27;s open the treasure chest. You have opened the excellent treasure chest one and obtained a scaled rock belt.</p>
<p>Great. Another piece in the set is complete. Liao&#x27;s mood improved slightly. At this point, only the helmet of the scale rock set is missing from the complete set. The set bonus is already plus 20, and the bonus will increase significantly once the set is complete.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m on a good day, so I&#x27;ll open all the treasure chests in one go. You have opened the excellent treasure chest one and obtained a demon suppressing shield. You have opened epic chest one and obtained epic recruitment token one. You have opened epic chest one and obtained one piece of falion. You have opened legendary treasure chest one and obtained the blueprint for the special building.</p>
<p>Demon slaying shield fal Chinese tulu. These names sound very high-end and sophisticated. Just as Lin Sha was trying to confirm what good item he had obtained, a soldier outside the lord&#x27;s mansion shouted, &quot;By the god of elves. No, the supreme god. No, lord.</p>
<p>We have found your beautiful heroine. You have no manners. Lynsha was taken aback when Solderland&#x27;s furious shout rang out beside him. This is our lord. You must be mindful of your rank.</p>
<p>Soldering bowed apologetically to Lyn Sha and said, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, my lord. Elves live in the forest. Although they are an elegant race, they don&#x27;t really understand hierarchical order. I will go and investigate the situation now.&quot; Soldering then walked toward the gates of the territory. scolding his men as he went.</p>
<p>Who was making such a loud noise just now? Your uncultured attitude is a disgrace to the elegance of our elven race. Lyn Sha shook his head. The handsome Saul basically managed his subordinates by yelling. But the problem was that he didn&#x27;t even realize it and thought he was known for his elegance. Solderings voice came from outside the door.</p>
<p>Miss, I&#x27;m sorry to have startled you. I&#x27;ll be loudly reprimanding my men in a moment. Please turn around. I will take you to see Holy Shwats fact. Even the usually well-mannered and handsome Saul became incoherent.</p>
<p>My lord, Helen has arrived. Lyn Sha shook his head again. It&#x27;s all the system announcement&#x27;s fault. A beautiful female hero is being awarded as a reward. Announcement to all servers.</p>
<p>Even his subordinates all knew about this and were all eagerly anticipating it. This group of strong men, including his dozens of farmers, were all male. highly loyal and worshiped him greatly. In just one day, they started paying attention to the beautiful heroins. As soon as the battle ended, someone volunteered to search the battlefield.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, they actually found it. Since she&#x27;s his beautiful heroine, why doesn&#x27;t she come looking for him instead of playing hideand seek with him, showing off a true hidden hero? Does she act arrogant just because she&#x27;s beautiful? Lyn Shao began to feel somewhat dissatisfied with this hero he had never met. Someone as beautiful or not is secondary. A true hero listens to himself. After all, his goal was to successfully enter the official Lan district and become a top expert in the Hasha domain.</p>
<p>Living a carefree and unrestrained life in this other world, living up to his identity as a transmigrator. Lyn Sha would never let a woman who wasn&#x27;t on his side jeopardize his important plans. While pondering, Lynsha walked out the door and saw Saul Lin and his group. Even Saul, who was incredibly handsome and had seen countless beautiful elf women, stared blankly at a figure like a leerous man. Lyn Sha followed Solderlands gaze.</p>
<p>Then he met his heroine. She was a woman who hid herself inside a large cloak. Now that she had been found by the phantom archer, she had lowered the hood of her cloak, revealing her true appearance. Seeing the man the elves called their lord looking over the woman turned her face as well. Lyn Shia and he looked into each other&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>It was a face of unparalleled beauty, both pure and ethereal, yet alluring and seductive. Her long black hair cascaded down her back, and her face was fair and flawless as if sculpted from ice crystal. Her nose was soft yet straight. Her lips were full and red, and when she blinked, her thick, interlaced eyelashes were like a brush. If we&#x27;re only talking about her appearance, she&#x27;s already absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>But the feeling she evokes is even more heartpounding. With his experience of living two lives, at first glance, Lyn Sha thought she was a charming and mature woman. At second glance, she seemed like a pure and innocent young woman who could arouse a man&#x27;s protective instincts. Upon closer inspection, she was just like the white moonlight that you longed for in your youth. Moreover, one can sense a charm emanating from her that is a blend of innocence and allure.</p>
<p>Her exquisitly beautiful face always carried a hint of sorrow, making her appear pitiful to me, which that was the only thought that popped into Linia&#x27;s mind. No wonder the phantom shooter was yelling. No wonder the well-informed Sauling was so frightened that he swore twice. Soldering even called her Helen, which is synonymous with the most beautiful woman in the west, much like the little dragon girl in China. Fortunately, Lin Sha had lived two lives and possessed the Hasha token.</p>
<p>So, he quickly regained his senses. His gaze towards the woman immediately transformed into pure admiration and the subtle majesty of a lord looking at a hero. The woman was somewhat surprised to see the young and handsome lord behave in such a way. Immediately, a look of surprise appeared on her face. She gently lifted the hem of her wide cloak and gracefully bowed to Lin Sha, revealing her snow white skin in the process.</p>
<p>Your humble servant, Baoi, greets your lordship. Ba, Ba, Baoi, one of the four infamous fim fatal in ancient China. The Baoi who is as famous as Sudaji. The Baoi who caused King Yu of Zhao to light the beacon fires and play with the feudal lords. Is Ba my reward hero? Lyn Sha was taken aback.</p>
<p>This Baoi was famous for her beauty and was known for her bewitching nature. Was she his reward hero? What could she do? Check Bao&#x27;s attributes. Ba race human ancient China. Quality level, level one. Attributes, strength, spirit, body, soul.</p>
<p>99. Skills: Charm, Srank. A smile worth a thousand pieces of gold. S rank. Beauty that could cause disaster.</p>
<p>A rank. Stunning beauty. S rank. Inong reversal, S rank. Click to view.</p>
<p>Main god system hint. Suspected hidden skill. Combat power rating. Star. Exclusive unit.</p>
<p>Songstress. this. Upon looking at it, Lin Sha was somewhat surprised. This is the second time Lin Sha has seen the main god system marked with. The first time was with the quality of the Hasha token which the god system used.</p>
<p>The second time was with this stunningly beautiful woman before us, capable of driving any man mad. Her quality, attributes, and combat evaluation were all replaced with symbols. What does this mean? Was Ba powerful or not? Look at her small, delicate frame. She seems fragile and can&#x27;t withstand any hardship. Even at level one, his soul stat is as high as 99.</p>
<p>He is definitely not weak. And then there are her skills. Fatal, allure, beauty that could topple kingdoms. These skill names don&#x27;t sound like positive or uplifting names. It seems like they&#x27;re going to kill the lord.</p>
<p>Chapter 32. The true beauty who caused disaster. Baoi and Lin Xiaos impulsiveness. Upon seeing Baoi&#x27;s attribute panel and skills, Lin Shiao remained outwardly calm, maintaining his lordly dignity, but inwardly he was constantly ranting. Oh God, I asked you to arrange female heroes for me.</p>
<p>Not this kind of fem fatal who could bring ruin to the country. I thought Chin Yuan Yuan and Lee sure were the limit. I can&#x27;t even imagine characters like Jiao Chan and Daji appearing in nine out of 10 online novels. My lord, won&#x27;t you let me in? At this moment, Baoi spoke in a delicate voice. Please come in.</p>
<p>The night is chilly, but I have some hot porridge here. Lyn Shia, being a gentleman, invited Baoi and led her into his territory. Along the way, soldiers and farmers alike, as long as they were male, would stand frozen in shock and lose their composure upon seeing Bao&#x27;s true face. Is this the lord&#x27;s beautiful heroine? No wonder the phantom archer recognized her at first glance. A skilled archer muttered to himself.</p>
<p>No doubt about it. Natural beauty is hard to hide. If she&#x27;s not a beauty, then who is? Beside him, a guard with a long sword also said, his eyes glazed over. I think even Yong Guaye Feay, the concubine of Emperor Schwanzong of Tang, couldn&#x27;t be more beautiful than this woman. Shill, quiet.</p>
<p>A young, dashing, and upright man walked over, seemingly unaffected, and reminded the Mo Dao iron guards and the divine arm archers. Miss Ba is so beautiful. She might just be the future lord&#x27;s wife. Everyone, you should be more respectful with your words. Oh, there are no incompetent heroes.</p>
<p>only incompetent lords. Lyn Shao kept reminding himself that no matter what kind of hero he was, he had his own place to shine. Sitting by the fireplace in the open space in front of the lord&#x27;s manor, with his most loyal guards protecting him just a few dozen meters away, Lyn Sha handed Baoi a bowl of hot porridge to help her recover some energy in the dead of night and then clicked to view Ba&#x27;s skill attributes. Alluring Srank, she possesses endless charm, radiating an irresistible allure at all times. Increases attraction to the opposite sex by 300%.</p>
<p>Increases attraction to the same sex by 200%, reduces hostility towards the opposite sex by 50% and increases hostility towards the same sex by 100%. The first skill left Lynn Shiao speechless. A superkiller for straight men and a master at turning straight women gay. Moreover, the woman both loves and envys her, making it a truly tumultuous relationship. A smile worth a thousand pieces of gold.</p>
<p>Level S. It is said that Bao Ci rarely smiled. In order to see the beauty smile, King Yu of Zhao spared no expense to buy her a smile and even lit the beacon fires to amuse the feudal lords. However, the story of lighting the beacon fires to amuse the feudal lords does not exist. When Baoi smiled, her master could gain a certain benefit which was proportional to the degree of Bao&#x27;s happiness and multiplied based on the overall economic strength of Bao&#x27;s master.</p>
<p>So this is what a smile worth a thousand pieces of gold means. As long as this woman smiles, I can make money. Lynsha suddenly looked at Ba. Could this beauty become his cash cow? But he&#x27;s been a straight man in both his lives with excellent luck with men but almost no luck with women. How can he make a beauty of this caliber laugh? Lyn Shao shook his head and continued reading.</p>
<p>A fem fatal level a because Baos&#x27;s charm was so outstanding. She was envied and rejected by the laws of heaven and earth. Constantly attracting hostility and misfortune from those around her which accumulated over time. When misfortune accumulates to a certain extent, it will bring great disaster to the area where Bao se is located, including but not limited to demonic tides, beast tides, earthquakes, fires, tsunamis, floods, extreme cold, extreme heat, foreign raids, assassinations, genocide, national annihilation, and world wars. What? Lyn Sha suddenly looked up, his eyes fixed on Baoi.</p>
<p>This beautiful woman is such a jinx. We need to find a way to get rid of her. Lynhos actions clearly startled Baoi, who was drinking porridge. With a loud crash, the bowl of porridge in Bao&#x27;s hand fell to the ground and shattered into several pieces. Lord, your expression is terrifying.</p>
<p>What did Ba do wrong? Ba sat prostrate on the ground, her fair arms covering her chest. Her eyes quickly welled up with tears, filled with resentment and longing. Her sorrowful appearance could instantly soften the heart of any man. Lyn Shao stared at Baoi in silence for a few seconds before slowly regaining his composure. Baoi brought misfortune to the area she inhabited, not specifically to her master.</p>
<p>Perhaps she could be sent elsewhere or used for. Moreover, this was not her original intention. Hu Lin Shia let out a long breath. If she really is the kind of vixen who brings disaster to the country and its people, I would rather be punished by the god system than let this hidden danger go unchecked. Sigh.</p>
<p>Never mind. Let&#x27;s look at the skills first. Peerless beauty srank. Ba&#x27;s stunning beauty greatly enhanced people&#x27;s vanity. If Ba successfully joins a territory and her loyalty to the Lord reaches 80 or higher, all heroes, troops, peasants, and other creatures under that lord&#x27;s command will feel deeply proud that the Lord has such a beautiful wife/conubine/hero.</p>
<p>When the conditions are met, all units in the territory will have an additional 20% loyalty to the lord and an additional 20% production efficiency. If the city where Baoi is stationed is attacked by foreign enemies in order to protect Bao, our units will have 100% increased health and 100% increased morale during wartime and will never retreat. Note, a secondary condition is that Bao Ci must appear before her subjects at intervals. Two elements reversal S level. A peerless beauty in prosperous times.</p>
<p>A bewitching enchantress in chaotic times. Bowsy&#x27;s luck value will fluctuate between minus 100 and 100. If it stays at a positive or negative value for a long time, it will lead the owner&#x27;s luck to one side. If Baoi were to encounter a prosperous and righteous ruler, she would accumulate more good fortune, continuously helping her master to obtain better luck and opportunities, ultimately leading to the prosperity of the nation. If Baoi were to encounter a chaotic and incompetent ruler, she would attract more misfortune, constantly weakening the master&#x27;s fortune, and ultimately bringing about a great calamity.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ba&#x27;s special skills cannot be discarded, transferred, or maliciously exploited by the Lord. Otherwise, it will directly lead to her ultimate misfortune. Ba&#x27;s current luck value minus 100. Lyn Sha Lyn Sha rubbed his temples, feeling a deep headache. The complex and confusing information forced him to close his eyes and use his brain to find a solution.</p>
<p>This Ba was forcibly given to me when the main god system malfunctioned. She didn&#x27;t seem aggressive at all, but it seems that her abilities are all at the rule level. Ba can be described as a double-edged sword. If used well, she can defend the city, become a cash cow, add icing on the cake, and bring prosperity to the country. Moreover, to be honest, she was indeed the most beautiful woman Lynn Shia had ever seen.</p>
<p>Even as a pretty face, she was pleasing to the eye. If used improperly, the skill of a beautiful woman attracting hostility and misfortune is something no one can counter. And then there&#x27;s the negative effect of the two elements reversal. Who can resist that? Lynn Shiao now suspects that King Yu of Zhao lost the Western Zhao dynasty and died because of this. Coincidentally, the category of fatal includes the entry for a foreign rating.</p>
<p>But Baosi cannot be given away or abandoned. Her current luck value is as low as minus 100 and she is almost entirely plagued by misfortune. What should be done? Lynn Sha even doubted whether his eternal peace and prosperity, establishing the heart of heaven and earth, which had increased his lux several times over, could withstand the misfortune brought by Ba. Ultimately, why Ba? Why did the god system force Ba upon itself? Just as Lin Sha closed his eyes and rubbed his temples, a pair of warm, soft hands gently rested on his temples. Is the Lord feeling unwell? A soft, fragrant breeze came from behind him, and Bao&#x27;s voice like sweet wine, accompanied by the fragrance exhaled from her mouth and nose, gently brushed against the back of Lyn Xiao&#x27;s neck.</p>
<p>Before anyone knew it, Ba, who had noticed Liaos anxiety, had come up behind him, wrapped her arms around his back, and started massaging his temples. Although she was wearing a cloak, her shapely curves and soft touch clung tightly to Linhaos back. Lyn Shao suddenly opened his eyes. The next second, Lyn Sha, who had never been intimate with a woman before, suddenly stood up. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; Baosi exclaimed in surprise, tripping over Lin Sha as he stood up.</p>
<p>&quot;My lord,&quot; Lyn Sha then realized his overreaction and quickly bent down to help Baoi up. &quot;Sorry, I didn&#x27;t react in time.&quot; He froze before he could finish speaking. The sudden movement had pulled at Bao&#x27;s cloak, causing her to fall to the ground where the cloak slipped off. Beneath the wide cloak, Baosi was only wearing a snow white lace gauze undergarment. Her long, slender neck and most of her fragrant shoulders partially exposed, the shimmering light of her breasts faintly visible.</p>
<p>Lynho&#x27;s throat bobbed, and he felt his breathing become heavy. He instinctively reached out and grabbed Baoi cloak and all and carried her into the Lord&#x27;s mansion. Chapter 33. Pay men&#x27;s white moonlight, the forest witch&#x27;s cloak. Lynn Shiao carried Ba directly into the Lord&#x27;s mansion.</p>
<p>Having just survived a massive battle against the demonic tide, the group emerged victorious. It is a time when one&#x27;s blood and energy are at their peak. It was late at night when I encountered this stunningly beautiful woman who threw herself into my arms. The golden legendary soldiers guarding Lin Xiao&#x27;s side dozens of meters away were stunned. Then everyone showed expressions that said, &quot;Men understand a hymn.</p>
<p>Miss Ba is indeed going to become the Lord&#x27;s wife.&quot; A mo Dao iron guard whispered. Pay Min chuckled smugly, his expression carefree and forthright. A fine sword for a brave warrior. A beautiful woman for a hero. No, wait.</p>
<p>Beautiful lady. They were a match made in heaven. It was just a natural progression. After saying that, Payman secretly wiped away a bead of sweat. He was a hero in the profession.</p>
<p>And he was afraid that if he quoted the ancient Chinese proverb that a beautiful woman should be paired with a hero, the Lord might misunderstand and think that he had any improper thoughts. Everyone nodded. Just now, our lord was merely sitting in front of the campfire chatting with the beautiful heroine for a few moments. It only took a few minutes. The beautiful heroine smashed the porridge bowl.</p>
<p>Then he even pounced on the lord and hugged him. Isn&#x27;t this just like dry wood meeting a raging fire, igniting instantly upon contact? The lord is young and handsome, dashing and extraordinary, yet kind to others. Miss Ba is stunningly beautiful and captivating, and she fell in love with the Lord at first sight. She even went so far as to pursue and embrace him. No wonder the god system made a world announcement, telling everyone that the Lord has a beautiful heroine.</p>
<p>This is a marriage that everyone envys. The group of burly men stood in front of the bonfire in the open space of the square, guarding the lord&#x27;s mansion from a distance of several dozen meters. But each of them wore a strange maternal smile. By the way, it seems that Miss Ba was frightened and broke the bull just now. The blonde blue-eyed Sdalin suddenly said, &quot;He was an elf and an archer with excellent eyesight even at night.&quot; After hearing the sound of the bull breaking, he glanced over and seemed to see Bao&#x27;s frightened expression.</p>
<p>Soldering asked in confusion, &quot;Sue, your archers have eagle eyes. Their vision is better than ours.&quot; As an elegant gentleman, it is my duty to inquire about the Lord&#x27;s wife&#x27;s condition. Did you clearly see whether the Lord frightened Miss Baoi into breaking the bowl, or whether Miss Ba broke the bowl in her excitement? S Ruer, a man of few words, had his entire face buried under the armor with only his eyes showing. He said in a muffled voice, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see it. Is there a difference?&quot; Soldering paused, unsure what to say.</p>
<p>Ah, this is Miss Ba&#x27;s brilliance, playing hard to get. Pay Min, who was standing to the side with his sword held to his chest, chimed in with admiration. In the end, it was all talk and no action. In the end, they were childhood sweethearts. The fire light illuminated Pay Min&#x27;s handsome face, half of which was in shadow, highlighting his sharp features and undeniable dashing good looks like a down on his luck wanderer.</p>
<p>Soldering peaked his curiosity again and said, &quot;Mr. Payman, you seem to be least affected by Miss Ba. You are handsome and dashing, a man of exceptional talent. How did you resist the charm of Miss Ba?&quot; Payman slowly raised his head and looked at soldering. It&#x27;s very simple.</p>
<p>When you have someone in your heart, you&#x27;ll find that of all the waters in the world, only one is for you. These men were all burly and fierce, capable of killing without batting an eye. Despite being the most disciplined and elite troops, they had little experience in this area and looked eager to learn from the advice. I see. Soldering looked enlightened and continued to ask.</p>
<p>Mr. Payman, you are a man with a story. I&#x27;m very curious. What kind of beauty could attract you? Is she a young beautiful girl, a chivalous female thief, a noble lady, or a noble woman? We have many knights here, and they all like noble women. As soon as the question was raised, the group of muscular men who had been distracted by the affair between Lin Sha and Bao C turned around and stared intently at Pay Min.</p>
<p>Aside from the lord, this swordsman was the most handsome among them. His long hair was tied back. His appearance was gentle and refined. And his face was sharply defined, handsome and sunny. Yet his expression always carried a hint of melancholy and nonchulence, a masculine charm that made other men envious.</p>
<p>Soldering self was beautiful, but too affeminate, which didn&#x27;t fit the aesthetic of these tough guys. Pay Min looked up at the sky, his expression deep and thoughtful. She was the most dazzling moonlight of the Tang Dynasty. The iron guards with their long swords pricricked up their ears. She was a goddess who could captivate you at first sight and leave you for life.</p>
<p>At this moment, even Song Rui turned his head, his eyes shining brightly. Who is she? Soldering asked gracefully. She is Granny Gong Son. Tangg Yi, who was standing to the side, couldn&#x27;t help but spit it out. Big what What a generous gift.</p>
<p>What you black bastard? The elegant solderings loud foul-mouthed curses carried from afar. The swearing reached the lord&#x27;s manner, but Lyn Sha clearly had no time to care why saw the Lynn was swearing. He brought Baoi in. However, there were no sofas in the Lord&#x27;s mansion. It was entirely in the style of traditional Chinese architecture.</p>
<p>There was no other way but to put Baoi on the bed. Ba was so nervous that she dared not breathe, her whole body trembling slightly and her long eyelashes quivering as if she foresaw what was about to happen. No one can resist her allure, even if it&#x27;s not her intention. The young and handsome new owner in front of them seemed to be the same. Her face flushed and she closed her eyes like a flower waiting to be picked.</p>
<p>Then Lyn Sha picked up a cloak and threw it at her face. Quick, try them on. Baousi was taken aback when she found herself holding a magnificent deep red cloak. The Lord carried me in. It turns out he just wanted to prevent others from seeing my body and changed me into a new cloak.</p>
<p>Have I misunderstood you, Lord? A strange emotion welled up in Ba&#x27;s heart. She couldn&#x27;t remember how many years it had been since she had felt this way. Whether it was from being touched, feeling shy, or experiencing the sweetness of young love, Ba felt a lump in her throat. Is he the different kind of person? Just as he was lost in thought, Lyn Sha turned around and his voice came. Hurry up and put on the cloak.</p>
<p>I have something to ask you later. Lyn Sha let out a breath. It was too dangerous. This vixen is too dangerous. He almost lost control of himself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his mind honed by two lifetimes was strong enough. Upon seeing Ba&#x27;s cloak, he remembered a piece of equipment. His first epic item. Forest witch&#x27;s cloak. Special quality orange epic attributes base defense value 365.</p>
<p>Constitution plus 35. Spirit plus 35. Special abilities invisibility rank A. Concealment rank A. Click to view.</p>
<p>Special attribute exclusively for females. Wearing this item by any other gender will not grant the special ability. Description. A cloak of unknown origin said to have been made by Alice. the strongest witch in the elf forest.</p>
<p>Its elegant and beautiful design can attract the attention of all women at a glance, making it more suitable for women. Stealth skill is simply invisibility. It&#x27;s an A-level stealth skill. Without a detection skill of a level or higher, the user cannot be detected. The key point is this.</p>
<p>Concealment rank A skill. Concealment rank A can block any skill of the wearer of rank A or below. can block the wearer&#x27;s aura, making the wearer undetectable, unlocatable, and uncarchable by specific skills. At first, Lyn Shao thought it was a cloak exclusively for female assassins. But now he realized that it was a perfect match for Baoi.</p>
<p>Her fem fatal skill, which is specifically designed to bring misfortune to her master, is it not only a level? This problem will be solved once you put on the forest witch&#x27;s cloak. When Baoi saw Lin Shiao turn around, she blushed and changed into a new cloak. As she put it on, her eyes remained fixed on Lin Shiao. She didn&#x27;t understand Lin Xiaos intentions, but his unusual behavior alone was enough to peique her curiosity. Put it on, my lord.</p>
<p>Ba&#x27;s timid voice came from behind, and Lin Shao finally turned around. A peerless beauty in a gorgeous red cloak with snow white skin, black silk cascading down her back, eyes like stars, and her embroidered lips slightly parted, shy as a flower, made Lin Xiaos banners sway. But Liaos next words caused Bao&#x27;s mind to explode as if struck by lightning. How does it feel? Don&#x27;t you feel like all the bad luck surrounding you has disappeared? Chapter 34. Ba.</p>
<p>I was born to be a concubine. How does it feel? Don&#x27;t you feel like all your bad luck has disappeared? Lynhiaos gentle voice suddenly sounded like thunder in Bao&#x27;s ears, causing her to lose her composure for a moment. When she came to her senses, she suddenly looked at her lord. What I saw was a pair of gentle and peaceful eyes. My lord, he he knows my secret.</p>
<p>He knows everything. He looked at me by the fireplace just now was so terrifying. Did he know my secret? and his troubled expression afterwards was all because he was trying to find a solution for me. Then he carried me back and gave me this cloak. Ba&#x27;s heart was pounding.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were in turmoil and she sat blankly on the bed. What&#x27;s wrong? Lyn Xiaos gentle voice came again, startling Baoi awake. She quickly sat up straight and closed her eyes. In just a few seconds, Bao&#x27;s long eyelashes were already wet and her body began to tremble. She opened her eyes, which were filled with mist.</p>
<p>My lord, your bad luck is gone. Ba couldn&#x27;t help but be happy, for the misfortune that had followed her like a shadow had suddenly disappeared. In an instant, she felt much more relaxed. Then, Ba lowered her head and began to sob softly. She poured out all her grievances and the tragic experiences she had endured due to the misfortunes that had surrounded her over the years, turning them into tears.</p>
<p>Finally, finally, I don&#x27;t have to bear this heavy fade anymore. After crying for a while, Ba remembered that her lord was still beside her and quickly composed herself. Lyn Shao patiently waited for Baoi to adjust her mood, which made him even more certain that Baoi was nothing more than a fim fatal forced into this situation. Very good. Seeing that Baoi had calmed down, Lin Xiao nodded happily.</p>
<p>This cloak is yours. Wear it well. Seeing Lin Xiaos concerned gaze and overflowing joy, Baoi felt another wave of emotion. He truly cared about me. He gave me the cloak, knew my secret, and stayed by my side and even worried about me.</p>
<p>Ba&#x27;s secret passage. Ding! Your hero Ba&#x27;s loyalty has reached 70%. Feelings have begun to blossom due to the triggered loyalty boost. Ba sees two elements reversal. Luck value has now increased to minus 95.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha was slightly taken aback. Does this increase loyalty? But the initial loyalty is too low. You know, your own talent can increase loyalty by 20% and Baoi is your own hero. Yet, Baosi only has 70 loyalty after triggering the boost. That means the initial score might only be 60.</p>
<p>If she were an ordinary lord, Baoi might only have 50 points of loyalty. Who could stand such a bewitching heroine? Lyn Sha completely ignored what the sudden feelings following the 70 points of loyalty meant. He continued to ponder. However, the increase in luck value is good news. I was just worried about how to solve this big problem.</p>
<p>It seems that I need to do more strategy and cultivate Bao&#x27;s loyalty in the future. Seeing this, Lyn Sha pulled over a stool and sat down in front of the bed. Baoi, may I tell you your story? Lyn Shaol looked into Ba&#x27;s eyes and said, &quot;Why were you forcibly given to me by the god system? And why did you hide and only get found by my people after the demonic tide? I am your lord. You can be honest with me, and I will help you solve your problems.&quot; Still immersed in the emotion and relief after the misfortune was over, Ba slowly raised her head upon hearing this. sitting on the lord&#x27;s bed with the handsome lord right in front of her wielding a large sword and riding a golden horse.</p>
<p>Bousi blushed and her heart raced again. She lowered her head again and whispered. My lord has shown me great kindness and I will certainly tell you everything I know without reservation. Wait. Lynsha suddenly raised his hand to interrupt.</p>
<p>Why do you always refer to yourself as this concubine? Just use your real name or me. all this this concubine stuff. Are you here to be my wife? Ba was taken aback and stammered. I came here to be a lord. Ba suddenly realized what was happening, covered her face with her hands, and was too ashamed to look at anyone.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha, I feel like my clueless straight man like remarks have made me all alone. Ahem, let&#x27;s continue. It is I, your humble servant. I am actually of Chinese descent, and so is your excellency, sir. Lynn Sha nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;When I arrived in this strange world, I discovered that there were no Chinese people here. I dared not come out, so I hid outside the demonic tide. But after seeing the Lord&#x27;s soldiers and swordsmen, he dared to come out and acknowledge them.&quot; Lyn Sha found it a bit strange. The troops in this battlefield of 10,000 races were all from Western games. orcs, goblins, centtors, elves, monsters, zombies, angels, demons, dragons, and the like.</p>
<p>There were no Chinese people, but many lords in this other world were from Lia. The territory of Liao was similar to that of China, and the people of Liao were all of yellow race, spoke Chinese, wrote Chinese characters, and pasted spring festival couplets. Besides not watching the spring festival gala, making dumplings, or studying history during Chinese New Year, it&#x27;s pretty much the same. So why is Ba so concerned? But he did not interrupt Ba, signaling her to continue. I am from the state of Bao during the Zhao dynasty.</p>
<p>Since childhood, I have been able to attract attention by causing unusual phenomena in the heavens and earth. But it also brought endless misfortune to the family and relatives around him. When he was young, both of his parents died tragically. Someone saw that I was beautiful and raised me. He intended to take me as his concubine, but he met with misfortune after only one year.</p>
<p>Later, someone took them in, but within 3 years, their family was destroyed and they died. When I was young, I was already stunningly beautiful and I always managed to find someone to take me in. Although they were all lustful and wanted to take me as a concubine when I grew up, none of them lasted more than a year or two. I was once again left to wander the streets and was taken in by someone again. This time the person was a doctor, a nobleman.</p>
<p>The doctor consulted a diver who determined that my fortune was abnormal and could only be suppressed by someone with exceptionally strong fortune. Therefore, he presented me to the Zhao Emperor. King Yu of Zhao, Lin Shao thought to himself. But he was a postumous title given by later generations. So it was normal for Baoi to only call him the son of heaven.</p>
<p>Emperor Ji Gonging fell deeply in love with me at first sight. But he was no ordinary person either. He saw that my luck was extraordinary and asked the imperial adviser to tell my fortune. The imperial adviser foresaw that I was born with an inescapable curse. If I were to remain by his side, it would even overwhelm the nation&#x27;s fortunes, causing disaster and leading to the nation&#x27;s destruction and the deaths of its people.</p>
<p>The Imperial Preceptor intended to sacrifice his own century of cultivation to forcibly kill me, but was stopped by the Zhao Emperor. At that time, he was already bewitched by me and could not resist my charm. Bowsi lowered her head, her voice growing softer and softer, seemingly filled with remorse. My lord, bewitching the emperor was not my intention. I understand.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t need to worry. Lynn Xiaoings calm voice once again gave this stunningly beautiful woman strength. She paused, then continued. Later, the Zhao Emperor widely recruited alchemists from all over the country to seek a way to dispel misfortune. After examining my face, an alchemist devised a plan.</p>
<p>As long as I can laugh, bad luck will gradually dissipate. This is how the story of the princes playing with the beacon fire came about. Lyn Sha raised an eyebrow and listened patiently as Baoi continued. But I lost my family at a young age and wandered the world. All I have seen is sorrow and separation and the tragic things that happened to people and everyone who was with me has met with misfortune.</p>
<p>I really can&#x27;t laugh anymore. Ba raised her head and looked at Lynsha. Her eyes were like stars and spring water, indescribably moving and alluring. Yet her delicate brows were slightly furrowed, always carrying a trace of sorrow. The Zhao Emperor tried every means to win a smile from his concubine.</p>
<p>The emperor said that he would not take me as a concubine until I smiled. I understand the good intentions of the Zhao Emperor, but some things cannot be forced. The emperor has also exhausted his time in trying various methods and the Zhao dynasty&#x27;s national fortune has also been exhausted and the country&#x27;s power is declining more and more. A year later the Chuanong attacked and killed the Zhao Emperor Ji Gong Shang. I was also captured.</p>
<p>The Chuan people were extremely unlucky. They were ambushed and killed by the Chong people on the way. I died in the chaos of the battle. Ba fell silent. Her shoulders trembled and she began to sob softly again.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha also fell silent. What a poignant scene that left men speechless and women in tears. Let&#x27;s not worry about how Baoi came back to life after dying or how old Ba was in the Zhao dynasty. At this moment, one should sit down next to the beauty, gently lift her hand, care for her, and comfort her. With the beauty in one&#x27;s arms, the good time will not be wasted.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha was moved and his body was also restless. His heart was racing and he unconsciously sat on Ba&#x27;s bed. At this point, who cares about anything else? You have to let your body take control of you. Obedience to the body. Then what? Lynch asked.</p>
<p>Even top students are ultimately driven by their own inquisitive minds, the most advanced bodily organs. Chapter 35. What kind of for fluid was administered? Nights I miss you. Lynn Shao was more interested in Bao&#x27;s story than Baoi herself and the fundamental reason for this was that Lyn Sha desperately wanted to find out Bao&#x27;s identity and why she had been brought back to life. Where did their own Chinese military force come from? What role does his own Hasha token play in all of this? I&#x27;d like to know even more why the main god forced Ba upon him and what his intention was.</p>
<p>Why was the god&#x27;s reward system so chaotic before? Baoi could not possibly know everything, but even knowing only some of it would be helpful to Lynn Xiao&#x27;s judgment. As a clear-headed and goal-oriented person, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s goal has always been to become a superior person in this world. To make this life worthwhile, one woman will not be his final destination because he doesn&#x27;t want to be manipulated or led by the nose. So although the handsome, straight-laced, academically gifted lord sat next to the stunningly beautiful woman, his eyes fixed on her, his heart was filled with a thirst for knowledge. Ba glanced at Lyn Sha, seemingly both disappointed and relieved.</p>
<p>Her face, both ethereal and alluring, held a touch of shyness, making her even more captivating in the night. Later, my consciousness did not disappear. Instead, it drifted to an unknown place. It looked like a dream with no sense of direction, no sun, moon, or stars in the sky, and no mountains or rivers on the ground. There were buildings and pavilions there, and there were many people dressed in black.</p>
<p>&quot;A person dressed in black?&quot; Lyn Sha asked curiously. &quot;Yes, that&#x27;s right. They were dressed in black and shrouded in black mist. They were quite surprised to see me. Some people in the black mist discovered that I could attract bad luck.</p>
<p>They cast spells on me, saying they wanted to heal me and help me break free from the bad luck that has plagued me for thousands of years, but it had no effect. During the spellcasting, I was also passively instilled with 5,000 years of Chinese history by the magic, only to find out that my reputation was so bad. At this point, Baoi was on the verge of tears. Lyn Sha breathed a sigh of relief. How could this be blamed on Baoi? Throughout history, it was mostly the emperor&#x27;s inaction that led to the national crisis being pushed onto a weak woman.</p>
<p>He reached out and gently patted Ba&#x27;s shoulder. Don&#x27;t worry about it. I treat all my people the same. Ba blushed, feeling a strange flutter in her heart, unsure whether it was from Lin Xiaos actions or his words. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that such a famously beautiful enchantress could be so easily shy after opening her heart.</p>
<p>Later, the men in black&#x27;s attempt failed, and they temporarily sealed me away. In my hazy state, I heard them say that the effects of the misfortune on me are becoming more and more obvious, and they can no longer suppress it. If this continues, the misfortune will manifest itself and bring them even greater calamity. They are already in a state of disaster, hiding in the cracks of the world, and are no longer able to bear my misfortune. In the end, I was sealed away until recently when I awoke and was sent to this world.</p>
<p>A voice told me that I should become the Lord&#x27;s little servant. By the end, Ba&#x27;s voice had become so faint as to be barely audible. Be my underling. Lynn Sha chuckled. All the soldiers, farmers, and heroes in my territory are my underlings.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be shy. Make yourself at home, and let&#x27;s build a great future together. Ba was stunned. Her beautiful mouth slightly open, her eyes almost overflowing with tears. It was hard to tell whether she was disappointed or speechless.</p>
<p>How can this lord be so oblivious to romance? Ba looked up and met Liaos eyes, only to see Lin Shiao staring at her with a half smile, a sly smile on his lips. Oh. Baoi reacted instantly, collapsing to the side of the bed, too ashamed to look at anyone. The Lord has already understood what she meant. He was just teasing her.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaosos voice came. Ba, when I released you, who was that voice in your ear? Was it the Supreme God? Ba shook her head. I do not know. I have never heard the voice of the chief god. I only feel that my voice sounds very similar to one of the men in black.</p>
<p>Who exactly is that man in black? Lyn Sha murmured to himself. They claimed to be ancient demons. Ancient demons? An unheard of race? Lyn Sha shook his head. This name is just too ridiculous. Is it that kind of ancient demon that laughs with a rockus cackling laugh? Why were the ancient demons so afraid of Bao&#x27;s fatal fate? Lyn Shall put these things aside for the time being.</p>
<p>He had a basic understanding of Bao&#x27;s past, but the questions still remained unanswered. Ba herself was unaware of this. Bao sees fatal effect has been temporarily controlled, but her Inyong reversal effect is still at minus 95. How should we deal with it? Thinking of this, Lyn Shao asked, &quot;Your misfortune has been stopped by the cloak. Without the accumulation of misfortune, the situation is temporarily under control.</p>
<p>But your luck is still in a very dangerous state. Do you know how to increase your luck value?&quot; Ba laughing. Lyn Sha, Lyn Sha, Then give me a smile, Ba. But I really can&#x27;t laugh because Baoi was protected from misfortune. The fatal effect no longer activated.</p>
<p>The gloom between her brows had dissipated considerably. Her red lips were slightly parted, and her delicate eyebrows were slightly furrowed, giving her a pitiful appearance. But she spent her life in misery and displacement, almost never laughing, and had forgotten what it felt like to laugh. &quot;Perhaps we should try to see if Ba sees laughter has any effect, and then we can find a way to deal with her negative skills,&quot; Lyn Sha thought to himself. Immediately, Lyn Sha froze.</p>
<p>&quot;In his previous life, he was of average appearance, a typical straight man, and had never been in a relationship. In this life, although I was born with an incredibly handsome face as an orphan, all I wanted to do was live a good life and make a name for myself. I never even had a romantic relationship. How does he know how to make girls happy? After thinking it over, Lyn Sha decided to tell Baoi a joke first. The deer got lost in the forest, so it called its good friend, the giraffe.</p>
<p>Hello, I&#x27;m lost. Giraffe? Yes, I&#x27;m a giraffe. Ba wrinkled her pretty nose and looked at Lin Shia with a puzzled expression. My lord, what is a telephone? Why do we need to call it a hem? Forget about that. Let&#x27;s change the joke.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha touched his nose and continued. In a certain place, there lived a wealthy man surnamed Hang. He was young and rich and was the son of the richest man in China. This young man roams freely among the flowers, surrounded by beauties, singing and dancing every night. living a life of great pleasure.</p>
<p>But she coveted the son&#x27;s surnamed female internet celebrity uh the actress you. This woman looks down on the young master surnamed Huang and keeps him at arms length. Yet he is infatuated with her and can&#x27;t help but shower her with concern and good morning and goodn night greetings. One day the young master surnamed Huang caught a slight cold and needed to see a doctor for an for drip. Before leaving, the young master Wong asked someone to pass on a message to the female entertainer.</p>
<p>Do you know what message he passed on? What are you saying? Ba was completely captivated by the story, her big eyes sparkling as she stared intently at her lord, waiting for what would happen next. Lyn Sha paused for a moment, then spoke slowly in a deep, magnetic voice. Honey, I&#x27;m going to get him for drip. What kind of for drip? The night I miss you. Bowsi couldn&#x27;t help but spit it out, then giggled uncontrollably.</p>
<p>How could there be such a ridiculous man? Although ridiculous, he&#x27;s also somewhat endearing. Huh? Lyn Sha laughed as well. Don&#x27;t you think this young master Hang is as cute as an animal? Does it resemble? S. Huh? Ba laughed so hard she bent over, tears streaming down her face. Amidst the trembling of her body, a fragrant breeze reached Lin Xiaos nose, making his banners flutter.</p>
<p>Haha, the term simp is truly brilliant. Who came up with this term? Haha. Ba&#x27;s charming laughter even seemed to have a thud, and Lyn Sha seemed to hear other women&#x27;s laughter as well, just as he was wondering. Ding! You have successfully made Baoi smile. A smile worth a,000 gold activated.</p>
<p>You have received 13,594 gold coins. Ding. Because you improved Bao&#x27;s mood and made her smile. Your hero Ba&#x27;s loyalty has increased to 80. Love at first sight.</p>
<p>Ding. Due to the triggering of a loyalty boost. Ba sees two elements reversal. Luck value has now increased to minus 90. Ding.</p>
<p>Due to triggering the ismile worth a thousand pieces of gold effect. Bow sees two elements reversal. Luck value has increased to minus 88. Chapter 36. My humble servant attends to the Lord in his bedtime.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. From the discovery of Baoi until now, only a short hour has passed. He was finally able to figure out Bao&#x27;s background and take targeted measures against her skills, blocking her fatal ability, removing her inner turmoil and letting her lower her guard. He then used a joke, or maybe it was a joke. Lynn Sha wasn&#x27;t sure to trigger a smile worth a thousand pieces of gold and found a way to reduce Bao C&#x27;s negative luck value of two elements reversal, successfully raising her luck value to minus 88 while also increasing her loyalty to 80 points.</p>
<p>Love at first sight. From then on, this stunning beauty was no longer a ticking time bomb in his territory and her positive skills could be used, which was a great help to his territory. Hm. What&#x27;s this love at first sight thing? It sounds a bit like some kind of Japanese game setting. The female heroes and male soldiers are set up differently.</p>
<p>The male heroes 80 points are called as easy as using an arm. Does this mean that female heroes can have some deeper conversations? Lyn Sha looked suspiciously at the beautiful woman sitting next to him who had opened her heart. Her pretty face was slightly flushed because of her longlost cheerful smile, and her eyes sparkled like stars. sometimes bewitching and sometimes pure. Combined with her snow white skin, her defenseless demeanor was truly irresistible.</p>
<p>She was sitting next to Lynn Shia, her eyes half closed, leaning slightly against him. She didn&#x27;t say a word, but her gesture spoke volumes. If 80 points of loyalty is called love at first sight, what do you call 100 points of loyalty? Doing whatever you want. He look at Ba. She hasn&#x27;t been happy in a long time.</p>
<p>Let her relax first. If I remember correctly, I got quite a few good items this time while resisting the demonic tide. Let&#x27;s check their attributes first. Use the ones we can use. Give them to our subordinates and put the junk or unwanted ones up for auction.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha never waste time. So, he immediately got to work. God, check all my equipment. Of the myriad races immediately and faithfully fulfilled its duty, displaying one piece of equipment after another. Yu long bow, excellent weapon.</p>
<p>Click to view. Black long sword, rare weapon on auction. Fatal strike bow, rare weapon. Attack claws, rare weapon. Dance of fine snow, rare weapon.</p>
<p>Horse slaying saber, rare weapon, click to view. Life amulet, superior equipment. Demon suppressing shield, excellent equipment, click to view. Scale rock shoulder pads, scale rock breastplate, scale rock belt, scale rock leggings, purple excellent set for fifths complete. Knight&#x27;s lance lilac epic weapon click to view.</p>
<p>Falion epic weapon click to view. Forest witch&#x27;s cloak epic equipment. Your hero BC is wearing it. Bold text can be removed. Special.</p>
<p>One blacksmith shop. One epic quality pond. One epic quality recruitment token. one gold legendary quality Hashia Tulu construction blueprint. I never imagined that I would accumulate so much equipment on just my first day in the battle of the myriad races.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia was also a little stunned. Although he had expected it, he was still slightly shocked by his gains after listing all the equipment. There is an old Chinese saying, &quot;The tallest tree in the forest will be felled by the wind. My unlucky fate may attract unnecessary attention or even assassination attempts when I am still weak. However, with Ba by my side now, whether by coincidence or not, her current negative luck from the two elements reversal should have largely offset my eternal peace and prosperity for the people.</p>
<p>There probably won&#x27;t be any more big explosions like this in the future. We&#x27;ll have to take it one step at a time. Lynn Shiao analyzed himself for a moment and subconsciously found a suitable reason for his stunning beauty. Unbeknownst to him, Baosi&#x27;s allure had subtly influenced him, leading Lin Shiao to regard her as a heroine he had to protect. This god system is quite intelligent.</p>
<p>For all the equipment I haven&#x27;t seen before, there&#x27;s a click to view button next to them. Let me check out the equipment one by one. First up is the Birch Longbow. A highquality piece of equipment with a base attack bonus of 100. There&#x27;s really not much to say about it.</p>
<p>Just put it up for auction. Soldering wouldn&#x27;t even consider it. The deadly bow is good. We can keep it for soldering. As for Song Ru and the others, they&#x27;ll probably need better bows to match.</p>
<p>Attack claw, an assassin&#x27;s weapon. I don&#x27;t have an assassin myself, and Pay Min probably wouldn&#x27;t wear this anyway, so I&#x27;ll sell it. The dance of fine snow is a decent weapon and it looks pretty cool. We can let Pay Min try it out. If he&#x27;s willing, it&#x27;ll be his.</p>
<p>Pay Min possesses the skill sword of all things. So, he can use a katana as a sword as well. However, when I was looking at the equipment just now, I thought there was a Falian epic weapon that was also a sword. I&#x27;ll take a look at it later and then decide whether to keep it or not. Horse slaying saber.</p>
<p>A rare piece of equipment with powerful attributes. base attack power 300 plus 20 strength. It&#x27;s over 3 m long with the blade being over a meter long similar to a Modo Dao. Let&#x27;s just give it to Tang Yi. After arranging the weapons and equipment above, Lin Shiao continued looking down.</p>
<p>The life amulet is a good piece of equipment. It can speed up the recovery of health and increase stamina by 30, which is equivalent to giving a tanky character a free boost of health. I&#x27;ll wear this myself so I don&#x27;t get killed in the early game. The scale rock heavy armor set excluding base defense adds 15 or 10 points to strength and constitution with each piece for a total of 50 points. The set bonus adds 20 points to strength and constitution for a total of 70 points.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like directly adding the attributes of Tang Yi, a level seven iron guard with over 60 stars in combat power to yourself. According to Linhao&#x27;s memory of studying the dictionary of equipment for all races, if all five pieces are collected, the attributes of the scale rock set will increase. Good stuff. I&#x27;ll wear it myself. It increases defense, strength, and constitution.</p>
<p>Better safe than sorry. Magic shield. A rare piece of equipment that can withstand one magic attack of no more than epic level every day. Suitable for daily wear. Grants plus 10 soul points.</p>
<p>a standard shield mainly for defense against magic. It was able to withstand one of the fire demons attacks earlier. It can be useful if used properly, so I&#x27;ll keep it for now. Next up are the two main weapons. These are also Lyn Xiao&#x27;s first and second epic weapons.</p>
<p>Knight&#x27;s Lance Bryan epic weapon quality orange epic. Attributes: base attack power 580, strength + 20, spirit plus 20, soul + 20, constitution minus 10. Special attributes increases critical hit chance by 20%. Can be thrown to kill enemies. Range is positively correlated with the master&#x27;s strength.</p>
<p>Automatically returns to the master&#x27;s hand after being thrown. Can emit light for illumination. Introduction. This is the most famous spear on the continent of Trius. Brianac is a renowned magic spear of the Danu race.</p>
<p>Wielded by Lug Mack Eselin, the god of light and sun. Its name means piercing. This spear can unleash a deadly light no matter how distant the enemy. Brianac is a living magic spear constantly thirsting for blood. Falion epic weapon quality orange epic lord exclusive.</p>
<p>Attributes: base attack power 600, strength plus 25, spirit plus 25. Special attribute effective against dragons and evil gods. Increases damage against dragons by 50% and damage against evil gods by 10%. Description: One of the holy swords of the continent of Trius, made of dragon bone. Legend has it that it was the sword of the hero king Mars, born from the flame emblem.</p>
<p>Because it is made of dragon bone, it has a special effect against dragons, but it is also easy to arouse the hostility of dragons. A holy sword and a demonic spear both are quite good. However, Falshin can only be used by lords. So, all that&#x27;s left for pay men is dance of fine snow. Lyn Sha himself has full weapon control and can use any weapon.</p>
<p>He decided to use these two weapons. A long spear for range and a long sword with even higher attack power than the spear. Having finally finished looking at all his equipment, Lyn Sha was about to examine his golden legendary item when a soft, boneless whisper beside him interrupted his thoughts. Ba, seemingly snapping out of her days, said in a barely audible voice, &quot;My lord, it&#x27;s getting late. This humble servant will attend to you as you prepare for bed.</p>
<p>Chapter 37. My lord, please submit to me. Lyn Xiaos breathing immediately became heavy again. No matter how many lifetimes he had lived, he couldn&#x27;t resist the repeated teasing of such a stunningly beautiful enchantress. Besides, this enchantress seems to be sincere.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t care about your graceful figure. I only know that you&#x27;re just playing around. But what I fear most is that you, a seasoned player in the game of love, have fallen in love with someone real. The god systems evaluation of love at first sight is genuine. Lynsha suddenly turned around and looked at Baoi, who had just lowered her head to the ground.</p>
<p>Feeling the Lord&#x27;s burning gaze, Ba slowly raised her face, shily but fearlessly, meeting Lyn Xiaos eyes. My lord, I, Baoi, will serve you in bed. Seeing that Lin Sha hadn&#x27;t responded and was only staring at her, Ba repeated her words, saying again, &quot;That mysterious voice said that Baoi&#x27;s life was entirely in the hands of the Lord. If Ba could survive, let Baoi become your concubine, Lord, to assist you in achieving your ambitions of conquest. It&#x27;s past midnight now.</p>
<p>Your highness should rest as soon as possible to conserve your energy and continue your quest for glory. Late at night inside the lord&#x27;s manor, Bai had somehow removed her forest witch&#x27;s cloak. Her long flowing black hair cascaded down her back, and her skin, fair and flawless, as if sculpted from ice crystal, radiated a captivating charm that blended innocence and allure. Does your majesty feel that Ba, having been wandered to many places and being the consort of the Zhao emperor, is no longer worthy of you? Bousy bit her red lips lightly, her hands resting on the drawstring of her snow white lace undergarment. Her next move was obvious.</p>
<p>She said with tears welling up in her eyes, &quot;My lord, no one can win a smile from Baoi.&quot; Therefore, Baoi was still a virgin. My lord protected Baoi from misfortune by telling her jokes, and Ba has never been so happy. My lord, you must be the right one. Baoi dared not hope to become the Lord&#x27;s wife. As long as she could stay by the lord&#x27;s side and become the lord&#x27;s woman, Baoi would be very satisfied.</p>
<p>My lord, please submit to my will. Ding. Your hero Ba has revealed her true feelings and her loyalty has increased to 90%. She can do whatever she wants. Okay, now the evaluation of the main god system is pretty clear.</p>
<p>Everyone knows what they can do now. A stunning beauty. She even directly revealed secrets that women in ancient times would never dare to speak of, expressing her true feelings and making such a voluntary sacrifice. At this moment, it would be a real disservice to the body that Lyn Sha, the steel-willed straight man, had honed over many years if he didn&#x27;t do something. Liaos body moved involuntarily.</p>
<p>At this moment, part of his body, his brain, was working at lightning speed. At first, he never imagined that he would have to say goodbye to being single on his very first day on the battlefield of the myriad races of all races remains high and many lords believe in living for the moment. Therefore, it is quite normal for things to happen between lords and heroes or even units of the opposite sex on this battlefield. In the battlefield of the myriad races, the Lord himself can return to his original world every once in a while, but the heroes and troops cannot return. Unless the Lord reaches a very, very high level, he can bring the heroes or troops back to his own world or send the heroes and troops back to their world.</p>
<p>Therefore, heroes and troops are naturally dependent on their lords. But the level that the Lord wants to reach is extremely high and extremely difficult. There was only one domain lord in the entire Lshia kingdom, the Langsha domain queen. In the blueest star world, it is the Dragon Sea Kingdom. In the Blueest Star realm, the battlefield of the myriad races, there are eight domains, and the Dragon Sea Kingdom belongs to the Dragon Sea domain.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is quite normal for some lords to have a home in the world they live in and a partner on the battlefield. Their wives usually do not get jealous because their partner on the battlefield is a great help to their official spouse. Of the myriad races vying for supremacy, the strength of most lords is inferior to that of heroes. After all, wandering lords and marshall merit lords are a minority. However, the lord also holds the power of life and death over his subordinate heroes and troops.</p>
<p>Because of the loyalty system, heroes with a loyalty level above 80 will never betray you. Heroes with 100% loyalty are even said to be loyal to their lord to the death with legends even suggesting they commit suicide together after the lord&#x27;s demise. Unwavering loyalty, never betrayal, immense power, and diverse races. Who wouldn&#x27;t love a partner like that? Many single people even come to the battlefield of all races, hoping to say goodbye to being single. It would be perfectly reasonable for Lynn Shiao to have something happen with his own peerless enchantress.</p>
<p>But Lynn Sha still had a question in his mind. That is Ba&#x27;s arrival was related to the person who claimed to be an ancient demon. Regardless of whether his laughter sounds like he or not ancient demon, that name just doesn&#x27;t sound right. He wouldn&#x27;t act impulsively, letting his lower body control his upper body. Even if Baoi was truly sincere to him and her loyalty was genuine, did the ancient demons have any other intentions? Lyn Sha began to analyze.</p>
<p>If what Baoi said was true, but those ancient demons initially tried to heal Baoi, only sealing her away after their efforts failed. Furthermore, these ancient demons are hiding in the cracks of the world, saying they cannot bear Bao sees misfortune. Finally, they even dumped her on me. What a kind yet weak demon? Let&#x27;s double check, Lyn Sha thought to himself. Ba, from the time you met me until now, has everything you&#x27;ve said been true? Ba&#x27;s loyalty has reached 90%.</p>
<p>If the Lord asks her to, she has no way to lie. Lyn Sha used this to confirm again whether Baoi had deceived her. My lord, Ba blushed. What I said is of course true. Ba subconsciously thought that Lynn Sha was asking him if her confession earlier was true.</p>
<p>The words she just uttered, which were like a woman&#x27;s confession, had already taken her thousands of years of courage, and the Lord actually wanted her to say them again. If your lordship wishes to hear it, I may repeat myself. No, Lynsha shook his head. No matter how you look at it, Ba was innocent and sincere to him, and that was enough. In the dead of night, a lone man and a lone woman, a handsome man and a beautiful woman, deeply in love, dry wood and a raging fire, ready to ignite at the slightest touch.</p>
<p>The man is unmarried, and the woman is also unmarried in a practical sense. At this time, the elegant and antique style rosewood bed Ba sat like a delicate flower on the petals of a huge deep red cloak. Her figure was as graceful and alluring as spring water. She closed her eyes shily, pounced on Linhaos back again, reached out, and wrapped her arms around him, embracing him once more. Without the cloak obstructing his view, Lyn Shiao could feel an amazing tactile sensation and the graceful curves of her body.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha couldn&#x27;t remember how many times he had experienced shortness of breath. He turned around, not even noticing the faint snort that inexplicably popped into his head. The warm hibiscus tent. Ouch, that hurts. Um, chapter 38.</p>
<p>Drink more hot water. Chufinga bravely goes on. Lyn Shao, who was taking off his coat, stopped. Just now, he seemed to hear a faint groan in his mind. Then, Baoi suddenly exclaimed and clutched her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>Ba, what&#x27;s wrong? The hazy, ambiguous atmosphere from just moments ago vanished instantly. Lynsha stepped forward with concern and embraced Ba. Ba was now curled up in a ball, her face deafly pale. Several beads of sweat streamed down Ba&#x27;s pretty face, and her body began to tremble uncontrollably. After a moment, Ba caught her breath, but her red lips had turned pale, no longer possessing their previous charm.</p>
<p>My lord, I am so sorry. My period has started. This is so sudden. I just had a severe pain in my lower abdomen. It&#x27;s an ailment I&#x27;ve suffered from for many years due to misfortune.</p>
<p>It always hurts terribly during my minstral period. Soba. This humble servant cannot give it to my lord. Sob. Lyn Sha breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>It turned out to be minstal cramps. But what was that muffled groan I heard in my head just now? Why now of all times? He thought Ba or some ancient demon had set a trap for him, wanting to make fun of him. Or perhaps some ancient demon developed some evil biological technology, planted some kind of catalyst within Bao&#x27;s body, waiting for the moment she and the demon to become intimate before suddenly it crawled out of Bao&#x27;s body, still chuckling to himself while drinking hot water from his thermos. Lynn Shiao shook his head, dispelling the strange association that only Earthlings would have. It might really be a coincidence, but it might really be premeditated.</p>
<p>In any case, today&#x27;s romantic encounter is out of the question. Lyn Sha immediately examined himself and carefully checked the Hasha token in his mind, but found nothing unusual. Turning his head, Lyn Sha saw Bao&#x27;s heartbroken expression and felt relieved, offering her words of comfort. It&#x27;s all right. It&#x27;s just the natural order of things.</p>
<p>Drink more hot drinks. Before she could finish speaking, Baosi gasped again, cold sweat pouring down her back. She then buried her face in Linia&#x27;s arms, her jade-like fingers gripping his arm tightly. He&#x27;s quite strong. His strength value is no less than 50.</p>
<p>Is this some ancient demon taking revenge because it didn&#x27;t want to drink hot water? Lyn Shao felt a sharp pain from Bao&#x27;s grip and thought to himself. Baoi, is there any way to relieve your pain? Lyn Sha asked, seeing that Baoi had been in excruciating pain for quite some time without any relief. Yes, your majesty, I was unaware, but my previous minstral flow didn&#x27;t hurt this much. Perhaps perhaps the misfortune was severed and my body underwent some unknown change. Sigh.</p>
<p>After saying this, Baoi was in so much pain that she almost fainted. My lord, I deserve to die. Even so, Baoi still believed that she had brought trouble to Lin Sha. She was afraid of embarrassing the Lord. She had taken the initiative to throw herself into his arms, and the Lord had also fallen for her.</p>
<p>But at this crucial moment, she will the Lord think I&#x27;m making fun of him. After all, her reputation as a vixen is so resounding. Baosi was in so much pain that she was sweating profusely and she was filled with anxiety. Don&#x27;t talk nonsense. Get some rest.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha didn&#x27;t think too much about it. He covered Bao Ci with a blanket, turned around and sat down at the table, then dialed Chufinga&#x27;s number. It was already 2:00 a.m., but neither of them needed to say much about their brotherhood with Chufinga. Lyn Shia, you called me. What&#x27;s up? Chufinga answered the call quickly, though his red hair looked a bit messy, clearly indicating he had just gone to sleep.</p>
<p>&quot;You survived that terrifying demonic tide, huh? Truly, a scourge lives on for a thousand years,&quot; Chufunga yawned. &quot;Fongu,&quot; Lyn Shao said, sounding slightly anxious. &quot;How can women relieve menstrual cramps?&quot; &quot;Just drink more hot water.&quot; Chufunga said casually, then suddenly froze, staring intently at Lin Sha. Lyn Sha, what did you just ask? How to relieve menstrual cramps? You Oh, I understand. Chufinga suddenly realized it&#x27;s that beautiful heroine who was awarded.</p>
<p>Mm. Lyn Sha nodded. You&#x27;re pretty good, kid. Chufinga laughed. You were such a blockhead in school.</p>
<p>You were so handsome and a big shot, but you never thought about love. Now you&#x27;ve only been on the battlefield of 10,000 races for a day, and you&#x27;ve already been taken by a beautiful heroine. You&#x27;re already taken. So, are you no longer single? Chufuningo winked at Lin Shiao, giving him a knowing look. Stop fooling around.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s get down to business. How can we relieve menstrual cramps? Lyn Xiaos face flushed slightly, but his strong willpower controlled his facial muscles, making him appear nonchalant. &quot;Uh, right. Isn&#x27;t this it? How do we say goodbye?&quot; Chufinga realized, slapping her forehead. Oh dear, this is really bad timing.</p>
<p>By the way, why are you asking me? I&#x27;m not a woman. After Chufinga finished speaking, she noticed that Linhaos expression on the other side had become somewhat strange. Didn&#x27;t you always tell me that you&#x27;ve dated at least five girlfriends? Lyn Sha said expressionlessly. They even said how considerate you were back then. How you relieve the girl&#x27;s pain by giving her a secret recipe and successfully won her over? Lyn Sha stared at Chufinga.</p>
<p>You haven&#x27;t forgotten, have you? Or is the secret recipe simply brown sugar and hot water? Under Lyn Xiao&#x27;s suspicious expression, Chufunga was stunned. He spoke after a few seconds. Uh huh. Haha. I haven&#x27;t forgotten.</p>
<p>How could I forget? This is only my first day on the battlefield of 10,000 races. I&#x27;ve been too busy to remember. Huh? Chufinga laughed and waved her hands repeatedly. Wait here. I&#x27;ll sort it out and give you the secret recipe later.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha nodded slowly and said, &quot;Thanks, brother. As soon as possible.&quot; After hanging up the call, Chufinga looked up to the sky and let out a long howl. &quot;Hey, what are you bragging about? What are you bragging about? Aren&#x27;t you just asking for trouble? I&#x27;ve only heard that female lords who have fought on the battlefield of 10,000 races are not troubled by this matter. They seem to have a secret formula, but I&#x27;m not a woman myself, so how would I know what that secret formula is? Where am I supposed to find the secret recipe now? Chufinga thought for a moment and then dialed his ex-girlfriend&#x27;s number. The call was immediately disconnected after one ring, and the other party replied with, &quot;Get lost.</p>
<p>I called my second ex-girlfriend, but there was no answer. They should all be asleep by now, and no one will answer my calls.&quot; Chufinga scratched his head, suddenly remembering a figure. That&#x27;s right. That person must still be awake because she was just fighting against the demonic tide. It was announced throughout the entire region.</p>
<p>So be it. So what if it&#x27;s embarrassing? Anyway, it was Lin Sha who caused this trouble, so it&#x27;s only right that she bears the consequences. Chufinga gritted her teeth and dialed Dugu Jaolons number. A moment later, the communication was established. woman of unparalleled beauty and aloofness, standing alone in the night, covered in blood, held a three-foot sword and coldly gazed over.</p>
<p>It seems she has already defeated the demonic tide. Chufinga, what do you want with me? The dazzling aura and intense killing intent emanating from the aloof woman could even be transmitted through the interface. Chufinga felt her heart skip a beat. Ahem dugu jaon. Ahem, I want to ask you how to relieve menstrual cramps in girls.</p>
<p>Um, now the intense killing intent seemed almost tangible. Chapter 39. The chosen one and dogs must not be purchased. Not long after, Lyn Sha received a call from Chufinga. Chufinga, on the other end, was covered in cold sweat as if he had just gone through a major battle.</p>
<p>Chufinga, what&#x27;s wrong with you? It&#x27;s nothing. It&#x27;s just that recalling the secret recipe is too taxing on my brain. Chufinga waved his hand and said, &quot;Could it be that this kid also has a memory palace?&quot; He looked so exhausted. Lyn Sha was still asking when Chufunga said, &quot;Lynn Shiao, I&#x27;ve given you the secret recipe. It&#x27;s getting late.</p>
<p>I need to rest a bit so I can recruit my first hero tomorrow. Bye-bye.&quot; He then hung up the call. Something&#x27;s not quite right about phone. Lyn Sha shook his head. So the secret recipe was actually so simple.</p>
<p>However, this secret formula is only available in the battlefield of all races. So many female lords who join the battlefield of all races will not be affected. But this secret recipe only drops from killing monsters. Although the drop rate is not low, no one auctioned it on the first day of the new server. Lyn Shia checked the auction house.</p>
<p>There were only a few dozen items on display, none of which were what he wanted. He glanced at Baoi beside him again and found that she had fallen into a deep sleep, but her body would occasionally twitch and convulse as if she was still enduring pain. Fine, I&#x27;ll sell all my junk equipment tomorrow morning and then try to buy this item. There&#x27;s no point in rushing things now. The most important thing is to sleep.</p>
<p>Today is only the first day, and so much has happened. Not only did I break the blue star record and obtain my first hero, but I also defeated the most dangerous demonic tide. The system also forced a fim fatal into my life, and it took a lot of effort to turn her into a great help. With Bowsy around, I won&#x27;t have any problem with my gold coins in the future. Furthermore, the loyalty of his subjects and the city&#x27;s defense system have been strengthened once again.</p>
<p>As for the issue of Ein and Yang reversal, we can deal with it slowly later. That little girl Ba is lying right next to me. How could she possibly run away now that the excitement has worn off? Lyn Shia is also feeling tired. Lyn Sha took off his coat and laid down on the rosewood bed. Fortunately, the legendary lord&#x27;s mansion was spacious and elegant with a large and comfortable bed.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha lay down and fell into a deep sleep. The night was as dark as ink, and the loyal Emo Dao iron guards and others took turns standing guard to protect the lord&#x27;s mansion. The next day, early to farm in the wild, ran into Gene Dang again. Great success. I&#x27;ve gotten another amazing item.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a stealth talisman. Oh, Gene Dang seemed very pleased. That&#x27;s good. It will be helpful to us. Oomph.</p>
<p>With this stealth talisman, after we use it, all troop types will have their presence minimized for 24 hours. In other words, we can cross the battlefield of the myriad races supremacy without attracting the attention of neutral monsters, and it won&#x27;t fail when I launch an attack. I can use it to gain the upper hand for 24 hours. Not bad. Not bad.</p>
<p>H not bad rare equipment. Gene Datong smiled stiffly. Seeing someone else being luckier than him first thing in the morning was hardly something to be happy about. Your luck has been better than mine lately. Could you really be the chosen one? Haha, maybe.</p>
<p>We always say life and death are predestined and wealth and honor are determined by fate. No one can say for sure, right? Datangs tail was practically wagging, which made Gene Dang feel a surge of disdain. By the way, after we meet up later, shall we continue with our plan? Gene Dang changed the subject. Keep going. Why not keep going? Xiao Daong said casually.</p>
<p>That kid Lynn Shiao dares to mess with me, dares to disrespect me, and that means he disrespects our international school. How could the principal and the others let him go? Let us kill that brat first to enhance our school&#x27;s reputation, and the principal will surely reward us. After all, our school has long had its eye on that woman, the domain lord. Shu, Gene Dang interrupted Xiao Dataong. Watch your words.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t discuss this matter before the plan is completed. Hiao Daong realized he had misspoke and changed the subject. Now that we&#x27;re on the same team, as long as you activate your location tracking and I activate my teleportation talisman, we can immediately get to Lyn Xiao&#x27;s location. But before that, I&#x27;m going to humiliate him first. Xiao Datang opened the chat channel and spoke again.</p>
<p>Hey, our F-level genius Lin Shia is still alive. What? Divine retribution hasn&#x27;t killed you yet. You&#x27;re lucky you survived. That&#x27;s a demonic tide. Eay jumped out and replied, &quot;Rol, didn&#x27;t I learn about demonic tides? There&#x27;s no such thing as a demonic tide that drops meteors and fire from the sky.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no such case in the textbook. It&#x27;s recorded on page 197 of the People&#x27;s Education Presses Science Related to Demon Tide and Beast Tide. He chimed in again. You you little brat, are you asking for a beating? Do you believe it or not? Chin Sher Huang. Goodness.</p>
<p>Heay even answered first. The chat channel fell silent for a moment, but everyone knew that they were all struggling to hold back their laughter. Damn it. Heuh Xiao Daong was about to explode again, but Gene Dang, who was standing nearby, quickly pulled him back. Dang, calm down.</p>
<p>Have you forgotten what you&#x27;re supposed to be doing? Xiao Datang, panting heavily, managed to calm himself down and said, &quot;We don&#x27;t teach that stuff at our international school. It&#x27;s useless. We&#x27;d rather learn Japanese.&quot; So, what if it&#x27;s a demonic tide, Lynsha? You survived such a dangerous demonic tide. You must have been seriously injured, right? How many of your soldiers and heroes are left? Oh my, you poor lad. Your pathetic ordinary soldier and ordinary hero has an F-level talent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, peace is ineffective against the demonic tide. Can you withstand the next wave of beasts? Sai, what can I do? I&#x27;m a good person. Give me the black long sword, and I&#x27;ll reluctantly help you fend off the beast tide. Consider it a promise I made out of loyalty. How&#x27;s that going, Lyn Sha? Hurry up.</p>
<p>Because I am the chosen one. If I wait any longer and I get some good equipment, I won&#x27;t be able to see your black long sword. Oh dear. Do you still want to protect your beautiful heroine? Don&#x27;t let me get away with it. I have a particular fondness for married women.</p>
<p>And I have a hundred ways to make your beautiful heroine fly to the heavens. Huh? Shameless. How old are you? How can you speak so vulgarly? I can&#x27;t stand it anymore. The pretty girl jumped out and cursed. H Why don&#x27;t you give it a try? You&#x27;ll see that not only is my speech vulgar, but my actions are even more vulgar.</p>
<p>Shameless. The pretty girl went offline and stopped replying. Lyn Shao Daton continued to confront Lin Sha. Listen to my advice, brother, and remove the black long sword from the shelves. Then give it to me.</p>
<p>As for your previous disrespect, just kneel down and apologize. I can even protect you. Ding. Player Lin Shia has removed Black Long Sword one from the auction and it is temporarily unavailable for auction. There was a brief silence in the chat channel.</p>
<p>Xiao Daong was stunned and instantly felt his vanity was satisfied like never before. Lyn Shiao chickened out as expected. What good is the personal strength of a lord with frank talent? They still have to obediently bow down in front of him. Harah, Lyn Sha, good, good. It&#x27;s right to face reality.</p>
<p>All you need to do now is trade the black long sword to me using the god system. As for kneeling, you can just go live and kneel down and cow so that everyone in the district can see it. You won&#x27;t need to come all the way here. Harah, I&#x27;ve been very lenient with you, haven&#x27;t I? Ding. Player Lin Shiao has relist Black Long Sword 1 for 10,000 gold coins.</p>
<p>This is now restricted. It cannot be sold to player Xiao Datong at any price. Note, Children of Destiny and Dogs are not permitted for purchase. A few seconds later, haha. The chat channel erupted in bursts of laughter once again.</p>
<p>Chapter 40. An evil plot. Selling equipment. Lyn Shiao. Xiao Daong was speechless with rage.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll make sure you die. a horrible death was also indignant and said to Xiao Dataong, &quot;This Lin Shiao is really disrespectful to us.&quot; &quot;Da Chong, use your talent skill to locate immediately. I&#x27;ll use the teleportation scroll. Let&#x27;s charge straight there.&quot; Gene Dang hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth and said, &quot;All right, his B level ability positioning can only be used once every 24 hours.&quot; In order to establish his authority against Lin Sha, he decided to use it now. Use the talent skill positioning.</p>
<p>A flash of light appeared, and Gene Dang closed his eyes, sensing carefully. A moment later, he opened his eyes and exclaimed with surprise, &quot;Holy crap!&quot; Lyn Xiaoso seat is right next to us. What? Ziao Daongs eyes lit up. Right next to us? Yes, there are only two or three novice lords between us. Ginden said, &quot;The location capabilities only allow for a glimpse through the fog of war.</p>
<p>All I can see is his territory, which has already been enclosed by walls.&quot; &quot;Looks like that kid&#x27;s got some skills,&quot; Xiao Dataong said sinisterly. &quot;Too bad even a level one wall can&#x27;t stop us.&quot; Jean Dang nodded and added. Also, when my consciousness returned just now, I noticed that the two lords in the middle seemed to be a skinny boy surrounded by a large number of flower fairies and a white stocking lowly. They all look weak. None of their units are a match for us.</p>
<p>A flower fairy, a white stocking lowly. Xiao Datangs breathing became rapid. Flower fairies are the most beautiful fairies, but their attack power is not strong. They are just elite soldiers. Their appearance is almost identical to that of humans, and they are also light and graceful.</p>
<p>They can be played with in many different ways. I haven&#x27;t had any taste of meat in a long time. I&#x27;ll play with the skinny boy later. Orc veteran behind him also licked his lips. Orcs are seasoned veterans, a rare unit known for their ferocity, savagery, and bloodthirstiness.</p>
<p>In the battlefield of the myriad races, they are among the most brutal races besides monsters. Hearing their lord&#x27;s words, the orc veterans were also drawn in, their mouths watering. As for white stocking lols, nine out of 10 lis are rich. Those who dare to wear white stockings are both foolish and rich, so the experience must be quite different. Since they are so weak and so close to us, why don&#x27;t we? Xiao Datongs eyes flashed with a murderous glint.</p>
<p>Why don&#x27;t we just kill our way through? First, we&#x27;ll take care of the skinny kid and the white stocking lowly&#x27;s resistance. Then, we&#x27;ll seize the flower fairy and the white stocking girl. After we&#x27;ve had our fun, we&#x27;ll start a live stream and wipe out that kid, Lin Sha, hacking him to pieces and humping at his beautiful heroine. Gene Dang remained silent. He hesitated and said, &quot;The newbie zone is different from the official zone.</p>
<p>Most people in the newbie zone are from the same country. You can rob someone of your own kind without a legitimate reason, but killing someone of your own kind will be punished. We have a talisman for attacking. The punitive talisman can only be used on one lord. It must be used on Lin Shia.</p>
<p>Then for the other two lords, can I just x-ray them without killing them? Gene dang. Xiao daong is utterly brainless. Or rather, his mind is filled with nothing but lewd thoughts. If they&#x27;re only raped and not killed, are they supposed to wait for the lord to run back to the real world and complain? No matter how powerful the forces behind these two are once they&#x27;ve aroused public outrage, the people behind them won&#x27;t bother cleaning up their mess. Just then, the main god system suddenly issued a notification.</p>
<p>Newbie zone number 89757. Player Yong Hi has been eliminated. Ziao Daong and Gene Dang looked at each other in bewilderment. This is the first lord to die in the newbie zone. He died on the second day after the server opened, which is relatively late.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, a message suddenly appeared in the chat channel. Help! Help! A lot of monsters have suddenly attacked my territory. It looks like an exceptional level demon. My troops can&#x27;t hold out at all. Someone, please save me.</p>
<p>The chat channel fell silent. No one knew what was going on. How could a large number of monsters suddenly appear and attack the territory? It&#x27;s not a monster tide. Before anyone could respond, the main god system announced again. In beginner zone number 89757, player Leong Guang has been eliminated.</p>
<p>His territory has been captured and the previously occupied mine is now unclaimed. Who who knows what&#x27;s going on? Someone asked in the chat channel. Although everyone was on guard against each other, the sudden appearance of the monster made everyone tense. Oh my god, monsters have appeared here too. They&#x27;re bone demons.</p>
<p>Dozens of bone demons. My units got wiped out instantly. Guys, I might be in serious trouble. Newbie zone number 89757. Player Wuang has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Piss. The successive deaths of lords have created a climate of fear and unease among the people. It was the meteor shower last night. Someone jumped out and spoke in the chat channel. The textbook said that special demonic tides can infect nearby monsters and turn them into monsters.</p>
<p>They can also cause them to go berserk. Everyone be careful. Oh no, why didn&#x27;t you say so earlier? I&#x27;m on my way to farm Pokémon right now. Oh my god, the little elf has turned into an elf zombie. But even as a zombie, her figure is still amazing.</p>
<p>Newbie zone number 89757. Player Lu Tong has been eliminated. Everyone, at this moment, Ziao Daong and Gene Dang exchanged a knowing glance. The two wicked people came up with a new way out. Now, because of the meteor shower, a large number of wild monsters in the entire Newbie area have mutated into monsters.</p>
<p>Notifications of newbie lords dying come in every now and then. Perfect. We can take advantage of the chaos to break through. As long as no one escapes alive, no one will know it was us. He then get started.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia, who had also gotten up early, was organizing his equipment and planning to buy some life healing potions when he discovered Xiao Datongs outrageous remarks. Incompetent wretch, barking like a mad man, Lyn Sha muttered to himself. So they gave him a small punishment. That&#x27;s right. The life-healing medicine is the secret formula for treating menstrual cramps.</p>
<p>Therefore, female lords who enter the battlefield of the myriad races will not be troubled by this problem. The medicine originally used to treat wounds and stop bleeding only needs a small sip to regulate in and yang unblock chi and blood make people feel comfortable all over and no longer suffer from pain. It&#x27;s unclear who first discovered the life-healing potion&#x27;s effects, but it benefited many female lords and became a closely guarded secret passed down through generations. The drop rate for this potion isn&#x27;t low and it doesn&#x27;t have the effect of bringing the dead back to life or restoring flesh to bones, so it&#x27;s not exactly a rare item. Therefore, Lyn Sha estimated that someone must have already obtained it by now.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha first wrote the note, &quot;Children of destiny and dogs are not allowed to purchase,&quot; on his black long sword, then suddenly thought that leaving a message was also a good idea. He put his two weapons, the birchwood longbow and the claw of attack into the auction house. The birch long bow is a fine weapon, but it only costs 800 gold coins, while the rare attack claw costs 2,500 gold coins. Then, a note was added under both weapons. You can use healing potions to offset part of your gold coins.</p>
<p>Based on past year&#x27;s prices, a bottle of life healing potion costs 100 gold coins. Even in a new server, it wouldn&#x27;t be too expensive. Using it to exchange for weapons is far from worthwhile. After doing all this, Lyn Sha spoke again in the chat channel. Looking to buy life healing potions.</p>
<p>Private message me with your price. No reply if you don&#x27;t want them. Then Lynn Sha closed the chat channel. Beside him lay the beautiful and sleeping Bi. Lyn Sha did not wake her up.</p>
<p>After all, her abilities were mostly passive, and she had no way to fight on the battlefield. Stepping out of the Lord&#x27;s mansion, the phantom archers, the iron guards of the Mod Dao, and the divine arm archers on duty were in good order. The three captains and pay men had also rested and were waiting for orders in the courtyard. A hint of a hidden smile on their faces. Even a fool could tell that Lin Sha knew everyone thought something had happened between him and Baoi.</p>
<p>While that wasn&#x27;t wrong, it just so happened that things didn&#x27;t go as planned. Then Pay Min, this down on his luck playboy, even raised an eyebrow at Lyn Sha. Pay Min, come here. I have something good to show you. Pay Min, my lord, I was wrong.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha, the grandson, is quick to put on an act. Lyn Sha, you come here right now. and Tangi Saw the Lin come here too. Chapter 41. A stunning beauty captivating allure unleashed.</p>
<p>Hey Min, Tang Yi, and Saul walked over cautiously. Last night, the three of them sat by the fire and talked quite a bit about the Lord and his wife&#x27;s ambiguous relationship. At this moment, under the Lord&#x27;s command, they dared not disobey and had no choice but to step forward. Only Song Rui nodded slightly in satisfaction. I understand the principle that too much talk leads to mistakes.</p>
<p>So, I just listened from beginning to end and didn&#x27;t say a word. Gossiping about the Lord is absolutely forbidden. These three guys are in big trouble now. Lyn Sha pulled out a katana, a large bow, and a horse slaying sword and threw them to the three of them. Take it.</p>
<p>See if it suits your needs. Overjoyed, the three brandished their weapons a few times. Tangg Yi and Saw the Lin immediately knelt on one knee and bowed, saying, &quot;Thank you, Lord.&quot; Payman also bowed deeply to show his respect. &quot;Sui Lynn Shiao&quot; turned around and said, &quot;Son Rueer, I&#x27;ll give you a better bow and crossbow next time I get it. This deadly bow is a bit mediocre and doesn&#x27;t do justice to you.&quot; Song Ruer breathed a sigh of relief, quickly saying he dared not accept such praise and thank the Lord.</p>
<p>soldering. Pay Min who was admiring the dance of fine snow display also exclaimed in admiration, &quot;What a fine knife. The blade is long and slender, and it&#x27;s easy to use. I am skilled in the sword of all things, and this katana can also be used as a sword. Thank you for your kindness, Lord.&quot; Having said that, Payman picked up the sword, tucked at his waist, casually tossed it away.</p>
<p>The sword landed some distance away, shattering with a thud. It turned out to be nothing more than a rusty iron sword and a rotten wooden scabbard. Upon seeing this, Tanggi asked curiously, &quot;Young Master Pay Min, the renowned sword saint, only uses a rusty iron sword.&quot; Pay Min tucked the dance of fine snow into his waistband, waved his sleeve, and smiled freely. The sword is an external object to me. My body is the sword, and all things are swords.</p>
<p>I am powerful with any sword, so even a rusty iron sword can shine with unparalleled sharpness in my hands. Damn it, he got away with it. The people nearby whispered to each other. Then why did you throw away this sword and replace it with the one the Lord bestowed upon you? Tanggi persisted, seizing the opportunity to attack relentlessly. Lyn Shiao added, &quot;Dance of fine snow.&quot; &quot;Eh.&quot; Pay Min looked up at the sky looking like a hermit and then said, &quot;A precious sword is given to a hero, a gift from the Lord.</p>
<p>This is a great affirmation and honor for me. Although I can use any sword with unparalleled skill, if I were to use the sword bestowed upon me by the Lord to kill enemies, I would only remember the Lord&#x27;s kindness and be even more powerful, thus upholding the Lord&#x27;s marshall virtue.&quot; This kid is indeed worthy of being a general. He speaks so succinctly. Lyn Sha thought to himself. Pay men was very satisfied with his performance.</p>
<p>But he couldn&#x27;t help but show some humility. So he asked nervously. Judging from your appearance, my lord, you seem to be proficient in many martial arts, and you must be quite skilled with a sword. I am humbled that you have bestowed such a fine sword upon me. But do not use it yourself.</p>
<p>No need to worry. Lynsha said, &quot;I have something even better. Since it doesn&#x27;t matter what sword you use, I won&#x27;t give it to you.&quot; After saying that, Lyn Sha took out Falshion, showed it to everyone, and then put it back into the god space. From the moment Falin appeared, it exuded an extraordinary quality. The dragon bone handle and the dragon bone-shaped blade with their dim and gloomy light radiated a murderous aura and were incomparably sharp.</p>
<p>It was clearly no ordinary item. Pay Min remained expressionless. Tangg Yi and the others couldn&#x27;t help but chuckle to themselves. Inside the territory, the soldiers on duty also witnessed the little incident that occurred in the square. Although they were on guard or patrolling, they all felt a warm feeling in their hearts.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no other reason than that the Lord is exceptionally capable, generous, and kind-hearted, getting along well with his subordinates, and joking around with them. It&#x27;s truly fortunate to be able to serve under such a lord. Unbeknownst to them, the loyalty of everyone in the territory increased once again. At that moment, the gate of the Lord&#x27;s mansion creaked open, and a stunningly beautiful woman walked out. It was Ba.</p>
<p>The epic forest which cloc cloak that Lynn Shiao had given her with a hood pulled down. Although only her head was visible, it still couldn&#x27;t hide her stunning beauty. The cloak, like fiery red petals, was elegant and luxurious, making Baoi even more beautiful. Ba&#x27;s black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall. Her face was fair and flawless, as if sculpted from ice crystal.</p>
<p>Her nose was soft yet straight. Her red lips were full, and her big eyes were captivating. Her whole demeanor was a blend of innocence and allure, making her truly pitiful to behold. Ba&#x27;s face still seemed to have a blush and shyness which easily made people think of something. My lord, Baoi began.</p>
<p>Why did you come out? Shouldn&#x27;t you be resting? Lyn Shao said gently. Lord, you want Ba to get some rest? Was Baoi exhausted last night? The answer is self-evident. Seeing Baoi emerge from the Lord&#x27;s mansion and hearing their lord&#x27;s attitude, the group realized what was happening and quickly lowered their heads which had been staring at Ba in a moment of irrationality. This is very likely the Lord&#x27;s wife or at the very least the Lord&#x27;s concubine. Immediately, a wonderful feeling lingered in their hearts.</p>
<p>Such a beautiful woman, so stunningly gorgeous, is the perfect match for their most beloved Lord. This further demonstrates the Lord&#x27;s power and charisma. A perfect match made in heaven. These are things that only exist in their territory. Being a member of that territory is truly a source of pride and honor.</p>
<p>Ding. Because Baosi&#x27;s loyalty has reached 90 points, allowing her to do whatever she wants. And she has appeared before the people of the territory. Her stunning beauty special effect will be triggered within one month. All units in the territory gain an additional 20% loyalty to the lord and an additional 20% production efficiency.</p>
<p>If a city where Baoi resides is attacked by foreign enemies in order to protect Baoi, all friendly units gain 100% increased health and morale during battle and will never retreat. Lynsha nodded. It seemed that as long as Baoi showed up once a month, the people of the territory could maintain the special effects. As for Baoi, although she didn&#x27;t truly become his woman, it seems pretty much the same now. At least everyone in the territory thinks so.</p>
<p>Anyway, he couldn&#x27;t escape this vixen&#x27;s grasp in the future, Lyn Sha thought to himself. My lord, I wish to offer my assistance in developing your territory. Baoi noticed the crowds reaction and knew they had misunderstood, but she was willing to help and explained her purpose to Lin Sha. Seeing that Bao Si was not unwell for the time being, Lin Shiao said, &quot;All right, let&#x27;s take a look at what other construction projects there are later.&quot; Lin Xiao&#x27;s level one Lord&#x27;s Mansion comes with a territory of up to 50,000 square me, which currently consists of only the Lord&#x27;s Mansion, tavern, warehouse, and a few simple residential buildings. The tavern recruits heroes, and you can also have a drink and a meal there, but it&#x27;s too small.</p>
<p>The warehouse is a system building and cannot be entered or exited. It can only be looted when it is occupied by the enemy. The residential buildings were even intended for the local farmers. The soldiers live in barracks while the heroes live in the lord&#x27;s mansion. This legendary lord&#x27;s mansion is quite large with side halls and wing rooms.</p>
<p>Last night was an unusual night. One of the heroes, Pay Min, was resting on a cot by the fire with Tang Yi and the others. Not daring to disturb the lord in the other heroes sleep. It can be said that the construction of the territory started from scratch. There was nothing to be done.</p>
<p>Tangi, you lead the moa iron guards to these areas to clear out the wild monsters. Remember, bring back the meat of the redeyed ram. That&#x27;s our lunch. Lyn Shiao took out a few pieces of paper with a sketch he had drawn from memory before leaving home, marking a simple route and a dozen or so monster spots. Song Ruer, you lead the archers to these places to kill monsters.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re all slowm moving. Just be careful of the dark elf spies. They can stealthily engage in melee combat, so don&#x27;t get hurt. Soldier, you take 20 phantom archers and go this way. These are the easier monsters.</p>
<p>Just clear them out slowly. Paymen, didn&#x27;t you say you hadn&#x27;t killed enough nest demons? There are plenty more along this path. You can try out your new sword and see how sharp it is. If you can&#x27;t win, come back to me.&quot; Pay Min curled his lip and said, &quot;Lord, don&#x27;t underestimate the great Tang Sword Saint.&quot; Lyn Sha chuckled. The remaining phantom archers will defend the base.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Lyn Sha immediately made arrangements, sending his men in four groups to grind monsters and gain experience. After all, troops cannot participate in territory construction. And even if they wanted to, they would not know where to start as the buildings within the territory are not actually built brick by brick. These things still need to be done by the farmers. It was still early and as the saying goes, the early bird catches the worm.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha had experienced a day of intense battles yesterday. Today is the day when most lords will begin what they will all go through. Farming. Chapter 42. The escape of the white stocking Lolita.</p>
<p>Lynn Shao excelled in his studies at school and being a Chinese person from Earth in his previous life. He was naturally skilled in farming, possessing a grade C farming skill that increased the production speed of all his territories by 10%. The talent eternal peace further grants life and destiny, increases crop output by five times and accelerates crop maturation by five times. Peace increases the extraction speed of all resources and mineral veins by five times and increases the construction, upgrade, and production speed of all buildings by 100%. Therefore, the speed of farming and construction can be described as extremely fast.</p>
<p>The territory now has five excellent spirit fields, which mature every 9.6 hours, yielding 2,000 units of spirit rice each time they mature. It&#x27;s roughly equivalent to maturing every 10 hours with a yield of 2,000 gene per mu. This yield, which was the level of rice yield per moo that Lyn Xiao&#x27;s most respected grandfather had worked hard for his whole life to achieve on Earth in his previous life, is actually more than two harvests a day on the battlefield of the myriad races. However, the battlefield of the myriad races cannot be judged by common sense. Apart from ordinary and elite troops being similar to ordinary people, rare and above troops have a significantly increased food consumption.</p>
<p>As for epic and legendary troops, because they are too powerful, their consumption is exceptionally high. Moreover, there are countless enormous beasts such as codto beasts, minotaurs, behemoths, cyclops, hydras, and dragons. It is quite normal for a behemoth or dragon to eat hundreds or thousands of kilograms in one meal. The grains grown are stored in the main god systems warehouse and will not be damaged or expire. In the later stages, the number of troops in the Lord&#x27;s mansion is as vast as the sea with thousands or tens of thousands of soldiers fighting each other at any time.</p>
<p>It can be said that no matter how much you grow, you can accumulate it. This also gave rise to many lords skilled in farming on the battlefield of the myriad races who continuously farmed in the rear of the main battlefield to supply the military merit lords on the front lines. Lynhiao&#x27;s current five excellent spirit fields if they were normal excellent spirit fields would not be enough to deal with his current two heroes, 62 types of troops, and 30 peasants. Fortunately, Lyn Xiaou&#x27;s talent was strong enough that the output of his excellent spirit field was comparable to that of a legendary spirit field. Moreover, when killing monsters, he also made sure to keep the edible monster meat, such as lava giant lizard meat and barbarian beef.</p>
<p>He had kept quite a lot of these in his warehouse. We still need to accumulate more spirit fields in the future. After all, the Chinese soldiers are humanoid, so their consumption is only normally high. But if we want to lead the Chinese soldiers to become king and dominate, we must increase their numbers. The Mod Dao iron guards and the divine arm archers are all legion units.</p>
<p>Large-scale legion battles are the best way to showcase their combat power. Luckily, we have this pond. We can replenish some of our food supplies and start using it. Lyn Sha took out an epic quality pond. Pond quality epic.</p>
<p>Output 200 1,000 units. Default output spirit fish which can be caught and farmed with other habitable creatures. Time 96 19.2 hours. Special effect one. When consumed randomly increases one of the following attributes by one point.</p>
<p>Strength spirit body or soul. This effect can only be applied once every 24 hours. Special effect two. When consumed, there is a very small chance to increase the user&#x27;s skill level up to a maximum of B level. Upgrade requirements too complicated to list.</p>
<p>Of 10,000 races is, as the name suggests, a pond. This pond can raise fish, other aquatic creatures, and even some amphibious units. You need a pond to recruit them. The pond is supposed to house spirit fish, but they&#x27;re actually just ordinary spirit grass carp. Fortunately, there&#x27;s plenty of them, so you can eat your fill.</p>
<p>But once the pond reaches the epic level, its nature changes. The resulting spirit infused grass carb even come with two special effects. The first is that it can randomly increase one of the four stats by one point once a day. The second special effect can enhance a user&#x27;s skill level. For example, if Lynn Shiao eats the spirit fish, there is a certain probability that he will upgrade his mixed martial arts level D, all weapon mastery level D, all troop type command level D, and farming level C to the highest level B.</p>
<p>Of course, under normal circumstances, this probability is extremely small. But under the influence of Lin Xiao&#x27;s eternal peace fortune, this probability has become small. If you eat it every day, over time you&#x27;ll eventually see an improvement. Moreover, eating spirit fish can increase one of the four dimensions every day. Lyn Shia took out the pond structure, which was just a white ball of light.</p>
<p>He handed it to the rare farmer he had summoned. Build a pond. Ding. Your farmer is building a pond. Pond under construction.</p>
<p>Construction countdown. 47 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds. Click to pause. The pond, which originally took 4 days to build, was shortened to 2 days, which made Lin Shia nod with satisfaction. With an epic level pond, any one of these epic quality spirit fish can fetch an astronomical price at the auction house just because it randomly adds one point to attributes and enhances skills.</p>
<p>But before I am strong enough, I can&#x27;t let anyone find out. I&#x27;ll enjoy it with my subordinates for now. This pond is a wonderful thing. Epic level pawns are rare, even in the official Lon region, and there may only be a few dozen in the Hasha domain, which are firmly held by powerful families. While the hardworking farmers were building the pond, Lynn Shiao called over another farmer and left the blacksmith shop for him to build.</p>
<p>Of the myriad races, apart from many buildings that can be built instantly, all other buildings require farmers to construct them. However, buildings that are dropped no longer require resources to construct. This is a design feature. Blacksmith shop quality average required. Blacksmith farmer.</p>
<p>Function. Repair and maintain farm implements and weapons. Replenish consumables such as arrows and javelins. Produce ordinary level weapons and armor. A simple basic blacksmith shop.</p>
<p>If there are no blacksmiths, farmers can even be asked to act as blacksmiths, but they can only perform the bare minimum of their functions. Blacksmith shops don&#x27;t have a production speed because they require blacksmiths to work alongside farmers. The more people working on blacksmithing, the faster the blacksmith shops output will be. At this stage, the main function of the blacksmith shop is to replenish the arrows of the phantom archers and the divine archers to replenish the kitchen knives of the peasants and to serve as a prerequisite building for the tier three base. Even if I upgrade the blacksmith shop to the legendary level, it won&#x27;t be of much use because it won&#x27;t be able to play its full role until there are blacksmith masters joining.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s build it first. It doesn&#x27;t require resources anyway. We can upgrade it later. Ding. Your farmer is building a blacksmith shop.</p>
<p>Blacksmith shop under construction. Construction countdown. 23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds. Click to pause. After setting down the two buildings, Lyn Shia checked the requirements for upgrading his Lord&#x27;s Manor to level two.</p>
<p>Lord&#x27;s mansion level one. Quality legendary. Defense 5,000 + 5,000 plus 2,000 for the walls. Upgrade requirements. Prerequisite buildings.</p>
<p>Tavern 1. Spirit field May 1st. Saved. Required resources: 5,000 wood, 5,000 stone, 3,000 iron, or 3,000 copper or 500 refined iron, 500 refined copper. Saved.</p>
<p>Upgrade. Cool down time 14 hours 18 minutes, and 15 seconds. Upgrading from tier 1 to tier 2 isn&#x27;t too difficult. Almost every lord will build the prerequisite buildings. As a top student, Lin Shia had already memorized the required conditions and had long since met the prerequisite buildings and resources.</p>
<p>All he lacked now was the cool down time for the upgrade. That&#x27;s right. Upgrading your lord&#x27;s mansion to level one will trigger a monster horde, and the god system will give your lord&#x27;s mansion a 24-hour cool down period. The upgrade was completed at 11:55 p.m. yesterday, bringing the Lord&#x27;s Mansion to level two.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia needs to wait 24 hours, and the upgrade will continue tonight. The initial Lord&#x27;s Mansion is just to make up the numbers. Only the first Lord&#x27;s Mansion is the real Lord&#x27;s Mansion. The Lord can build farm houses and produce farmers. The second Lord&#x27;s Mansion unlocks more buildings.</p>
<p>As I capture more and more mines, my 30 farmers are no longer enough. I need to build farm houses right now. Just as Lin Sha was enthusiastically carrying out construction in his territory, his neighbor, Lord, not far away, encountered an unexpected disaster. No, big dog, don&#x27;t die. A sweet coetish voice cried out, trembling with sobs.</p>
<p>Ouch. Damn it. You stepped on me. Ah, it&#x27;s the Lord. Flee.</p>
<p>Run. The enemy is too strong. We can&#x27;t hold out any longer. As soon as the werewolf captain, lying flat on the ground, finished speaking, he kicked his legs, closed his eyes, and died. &quot;Big, what did you say?&quot; &quot;Damn it, do you mean I should run north?&quot; Jazine asked in a tearful voice, but there was no reply.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don&#x27;t know which way is north.&quot; &quot;Hey, Big Dog, your tails up.&quot; &quot;Thank you, Big Dog. Even though your body&#x27;s stiff, you&#x27;re still so loyal. W I&#x27;ll definitely avenge you. Big dog, don&#x27;t worry. I will definitely survive.</p>
<p>Trembling, a little girl dressed in a Lolita dress and white lace stockings activated her innate ability and hurriedly fled in the direction pointed to by the werewolf captain&#x27;s raised tail. Chapter 43. Heay and Tu Shan by Chin on the run. Hateful. Damn it, Gene Dang.</p>
<p>You actually let that white stocking lowly get away. What&#x27;s your harpy doing here? Xiao Datang kicked away a werewolf corpse on the ground in dissatisfaction and said, &quot;We used stealth spells and disguised all our troops like monsters, surrounded the territory, and still the white stocking lowly escaped.&quot; &quot;I was about to take my pants off, and you let them get away. Just shut up,&quot; Gene Dang said with an unfriendly expression. The harpy reported that she didn&#x27;t see any humans fleeing. &quot;Maybe that woman&#x27;s lordly talent is invisibility.&quot; Invisibility.</p>
<p>You think invisibility is a common talent? Xiao Dataong said angrily. Every individual with the talent for stealth is considered a top tier player, someone that all countries would prioritize protecting. Would they only bring two elite squads of werewolves as their main force. While Ziao Daong was still fuming, a harpy flew back and whispered a few words in Gene Dangs ear. Gene Dangs eyes lit up.</p>
<p>The harpy discovered escape footprints. They&#x27;re heading towards where that skinny lord and the flower fairy soldiers were. Go after them. We can take care of them at the same time. Meanwhile, on the other side, two thin men in school uniforms with even darker dark circles under their eyes.</p>
<p>He were carrying a bow and leading a large group of beautiful flower fairies to clear land near his territory. My lord, this place is excellent. I&#x27;m sure there are some easy monsters to deal with here. Not difficult to deal with. Great.</p>
<p>Great. Then we&#x27;ll all attack together later so you don&#x27;t get hurt. Yay! The Lord is the best to us.&quot; The flower fairies cheered, and sure enough, the scouts discovered a fine iron or vein ahead where dozens of hyenas were entrenched. &quot;My lord, the demons have gone.&quot; The flower fairies swarmed forward, gracefully, flying low and scattering poisonous seeds as they battled the ordinary level wild monster, the hyena. Heay quickly drew his longbow, wanting to help.</p>
<p>At that moment, a pure white beastlike figure suddenly rushed from his side. Heay was caught off guard and knocked down. Hey, protect the lord. Flower fairies quickly flew out and rushed towards Heay. He was quick enough to do it.</p>
<p>He rolled over, stood up, drew his bow, and aimed at the beast. The next second, he froze. How come it&#x27;s a white stocking lowly? The white stocking lowly who bumped into someone was also dizzy. After struggling to get up, she saw Heay pointing a bow and arrow at her. And a group of slender and beautiful flower fairies wearing only a few leaves were eyeing her menacingly.</p>
<p>Uh, don&#x27;t kill me. I&#x27;m the Lord next door. I&#x27;m pretty. I can warm your bed. I can be cute and I can whine to cheer you on.</p>
<p>Nearby protested, we can do it too. Lord, kill her. Heay put down his bow and arrow and asked in confusion, &quot;A pretty girl?&quot; The white stocking lowly stood with her hands on her hips, stomped her foot angrily, and her ample bosom and animal ears swayed back and forth. What kind of pretty girl is this? My name is Tu Shan by Chien. And another thing, when I said I was somewhat pretty, I was being modest.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m actually super beautiful. Okay. Eay said helplessly, &quot;Hey, pretty girl, what are you doing here? You can legally kill someone who invades your territory without cause. Upon hearing this, the little girl in white silk finally remembered what she needed to do. She immediately pouted and burst into tears, feeling wronged.</p>
<p>Brother, please take me in. My house has been overrun by monsters. Dozens of extremely ferocious monsters killed all my troops. I was the only one who escaped. Wait, what did you say? Monsters? They&#x27;ve breached your lord&#x27;s manner.</p>
<p>Heay immediately became very nervous. Where is your territory? How did you get here? Tan by Chin said, &quot;I used my innate skill to escape here. I ran for half an hour. That means your territory is right next to mine.&quot; He was even more surprised. Since the monsters have come to your territory, they might come to mine.</p>
<p>Damn it. I thought I was the chosen one, but how come my luck is so bad? Of all the times I ran into a monster running around everywhere. Sisters, demons, hurry back to the territory. With the new walls I built around the Lord&#x27;s manor, we might be able to hold out. Without further ado, Heay pulled Tan by Chin toward the Lord&#x27;s mansion.</p>
<p>Hey, you. Why are you grabbing this girl&#x27;s hand for no reason? Tu Shan by Chin slapped Heay&#x27;s hand away. Oh, sorry. It&#x27;s just a habit. Heay scratched his head.</p>
<p>There are just too many beautiful women around me. Too Shawn by Chin pouted. No matter how many women there are, none are as beautiful as my little sister. You must have been lusting after her. The flower fairies guarding Heay on the side were unhappy again.</p>
<p>The demons are clearly the prettiest. The demons are flexible and they can even fly. You&#x27;re only big in the chest. You can&#x27;t even fly. Heay quickly tried to smooth things over.</p>
<p>All right. All right. You two are like Fen and Yongu Fei. Each beautiful in your own way. By the way, beautiful lady, what kind of monster attacked you? Tu Shan Bian thought for a while and said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see it clearly.</p>
<p>I only saw that some of the demons were female demons with bat wings, but no hands, and they could fly. And then there are the red-skinned monsters with ugly fangs, tall stature, who wield axes and drool at the sight of any young girl. Uggh. So disgusting. Drooling when you see me? Are you sure such a monster exists? Or is the drool actually coming from me? Uggh.</p>
<p>How can you say such awful things? Eay pondered for a moment. The monsters you&#x27;re describing seem to be harpies and orc veterans, except the harpies have feathered wings and the orcs have green skin. Could it be a result of the demonic tide infection and mutation? But this group seems kind of familiar. As the two talked, they were about to arrive at the gate of Heizay&#x27;s territory. Just then, a piercing scream rang out.</p>
<p>Lord, run, there&#x27;s an ambush. Then came a loud bang. As the group stood there in a days, a frustrated voice rang out. Damn it, what bad luck. I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to have some fun.</p>
<p>Quick, everyone, rush out. Don&#x27;t let a single one escape. capture the flower fairy and that white stocking lowly and ravaged them mercilessly. Immediately, a large group of monsters rushed out from behind the walls of Hezy&#x27;s territory. Red orcs, harpies with bat wings, giant lizards, and giant boores.</p>
<p>They all look to be at least elite units. Damn it, they&#x27;re already at my doorstep. Run. He grabbed Tu Shawn by Chin and turned to Ron, but unfortunately, he was no match for the ambushers. It was only a matter of time before he was caught.</p>
<p>A flower fairy flew out. My lord, I have no regrets in this life for knowing you. Please forget about me and live a good life. Having said that, without waiting for Heiz&#x27;s response, the flower demon flew straight towards the enemy who was chasing after her with a sinister grin. The red and green orcs eyes gleamed with cruelty.</p>
<p>They were about to have a good taste of this flower fairy. The flower fairy flapped her wings, scattering poisonous seeds, and fought fiercely with the beastmen for several rounds. Finally, exhausted and unable to withstand the beastmen, she was captured alive. Then, with a loud bang, it exploded. Yao Yao the flower fairy used her self-destruction to halt the pursuer&#x27;s advance.</p>
<p>He wanted to cry, but had no tears, so he could only grit his teeth and run away. Tan by Chiian was also moved to tears by this touching scene, wiping her eyes as she ran. And so, amidst the roars of the pursuers, one flower fairy after another rushed forward, risking their lives to buy heay time to escape. Which way should we run? The north. Tu Shan by Chin replied.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what my captain of the guard told me before he died. Then run north. W you bastards. You bastards. You bastards.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry. I will definitely avenge you. Then he began to mutter to himself. 1 2 3 77. I still have 77 left.</p>
<p>Bang. 76. I still have 76 demons left. I can escape. Tan by Chin was stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>Ugg. You&#x27;re so heartless. You scumbag. Usually naive and silly girl suddenly became very clever and she screamed. You&#x27;re actually calculating how many more flower fairies you can use to buy yourself time.</p>
<p>How could you treat a soldier who loves you so deeply like this? He a rolled his eyes at the pretty girl next to him and slowly said 77. Chapter 44. Lyn Sha, I&#x27;ve discovered your secret. Tan by Chian immediately fell silent. She was afraid that the thin man in front of her, wearing a school uniform and with darker dark circles under his eyes than a master of time management, would push her out to take the blow.</p>
<p>After all, he was a scumbag who didn&#x27;t even care when his own beautiful flower fairy died, and she knew absolutely nothing about him. This scumbag even knows he&#x27;s a pretty girl. It&#x27;s infuriating that she never reveals her ID when they chat. What exactly did I do that gave me away? The two remained silent, gritting their teeth as they ran north. Finally, amidst the continuous banging sounds, the two new lords shook off their pursuers.</p>
<p>But there were only 23 fluttering flower fairies around him. Tell me, what&#x27;s the point of running all the way north? Tu Shawn Bachin said breathlessly, &quot;My little sister doesn&#x27;t even have a lord&#x27;s mansion anymore. How can she make a comeback? How can she avenge the fallen soldiers?&quot; Heay said nonchalantly. If there&#x27;s no Lord&#x27;s manor, we can come back next year. The most important thing right now is to save your life.</p>
<p>At worst, even without a lord&#x27;s manner, we can still become wandering night errant lords like Lyn Sha. At this moment, Lyn Sha, the least successful of the wandering lords in everyone&#x27;s eyes, had just completed the construction of a level one lord&#x27;s manor and unlocked the farmhouse. Farmhouse quality average output ordinary quality farmers. Time recruit one or two per day every half day. Click to start recruitment.</p>
<p>Resources consumed. 50 units of food are required as a recruitment fee for each farmer and the lord will bear the subsequent living expenses. Note one house is required for every 10 farmers and the number of farmers must not exceed the maximum population capacity of the lord&#x27;s manor. This is the farmhouse. Once you have a farmhouse, it will continuously recruit farmers from the other world, allowing you to recruit farmers without needing a citizen token.</p>
<p>However, the territory must also meet the requirement of having housing for farmers to live in. As for the maximum population capacity, Lynhiao&#x27;s level one legendary quality lord&#x27;s mansion can only support 10,000 people. There&#x27;s no need to worry about reaching the limit in the short term. The rate of recruiting one ordinary farmer a day is still too slow. Even with Lin Xiao&#x27;s talent increasing recruitment speed by 100% and output by 100%, it is still not enough.</p>
<p>Such a farmhouse is simply not enough to meet Lyn Xiao&#x27;s goal of becoming number one in the newbie zone. Use Hasha token ascension to consume one energy point and ascend the quality of your farmhouse. Lynn Shiao decisively used the sublimation function of his cheat hasha token function. Ascension consumes one energy point to use the ascension ability, upgrading any item/skll/un/hero quality to the highest level. Energy 1/1 automatically recharges every 24 hours.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao had already calculated it since the last use of the ascended lord&#x27;s mansion. Ascending the spirit field, pond, blacksmith shop, and pond is no longer in the best interest. Upgrading a single peasant or phantom archer to legendary quality would be too wasteful. As for the Mod Dao iron guards, the divine arm bow archers, Pay Min, and Bao Sea, they are all of the highest quality and do not need to be upgraded. Therefore, upgrading a productive building, a farmhouse, is the most cost-effective option.</p>
<p>A flash of golden light appeared and a simple thatched farmhouse immediately transformed in the light. In a short while, a building resembling a luxurious country villa with a gold colored exterior appeared. Farmhouse quality golden legend output legendary quality farmer. Time recruit one or two per hour every 30 minutes. Click to start recruitment.</p>
<p>Resources consumed. 500 units of food are required as a recruitment fee. Subsequent living expenses will be borne by the Lord. Note, one house is required for every 10 farmers, and the number of farmers must not exceed the maximum population capacity of the Lord&#x27;s Manor. Lyn Sha immediately clicked to recruit 20.</p>
<p>The recruitment should be completed in about 5 hours. The territo&#x27;s stored grain totaling over 10,000 units of spirit rice was immediately consumed by the majority by the fact that legendary farmers are 10 times more expensive than ordinary farmers. Their abilities and value far surpass those of ordinary farmers, making them highly coveted by many lords in official servers. It all comes down to one thing. A legendary farmer can cultivate a legendary spirit field on their own.</p>
<p>And that value far exceeds the cost of recruiting farmers. Therefore, Lynn Sha would rather spend most of his stored grain than not activate the legendary level farmers first. In the future, farmers will be able to do everything they need. Cultivate farmland, mine minerals, build structures, cook, and even work as blacksmiths, or take on other part-time jobs. While waiting to recruit farmers, Lynn Shia went to the auction house again to look for the items he wanted.</p>
<p>Still, no one is selling life-saving healing potions. No one has contacted me about the price. Maybe I need to spread the word a bit more. Retrieve the equipment that his men, including Tangg Yi, S Ruer, Saulin, and Pay Min had obtained and automatically stored in the main God systems warehouse. While Lin Sha was at home building things, the four armies collectively acquired a common spirit field, a fine quality breastplate, and a fine quality leg armor.</p>
<p>Baosi&#x27;s skills seemed to have slightly reduced my luck against the heavens, but it is still above that of ordinary people. Lyn Sha felt a little more at ease. As long as he continued to win over Baoi and got through the novice period, Baoi, who had transformed into a person with positive fortune, could help his fortune advance even further. As for this junk, sell it all. Lyn Shao turned around and put all the items, the ordinary spirit field, the fine breastplate, and the fine leg guards up for auction.</p>
<p>A new message has been added under all the items for sale. Looking to buy life healing potion. Please message me with your price. Thank you. Aa bastard.</p>
<p>Bastard. Suddenly appearing, Ziao Daang was covered in blood. With a fierce thrust of his sword, he pierced through the astonished man in front of him. He was a young man dressed in the clothes of the dragon kingdom. He&#x27;s the lord of the newbie zone.</p>
<p>What? It was the human lord who killed me. Before the young man could finish speaking, Ziao Datang struck again with his sword. Blood splattered everywhere. Ding. Newbie zone number 89757.</p>
<p>Player Kong has been eliminated. Ask your mother. I didn&#x27;t get a single flower demon or white silk. I even lost an orc and injured a lizard rider because of the flower demons self-destruction. Can a human lord kill you? Xiao.</p>
<p>Daong appeared to be insane, wielding his sword again and again, seemingly trying to vent all the anger he had felt that day. All right, Datang, calm down for a bit. Gene Dang standing to the side said coldly. Because you haven&#x27;t satisfied your desires, you&#x27;ve already slaughtered all three lords next to the skinny boy. You&#x27;ve dropped two more rare recruitment tokens and a life healing potion, and I&#x27;ve dropped a purple weapon, the black wind axe.</p>
<p>Your temper should have subsided a bit by now. Upon hearing Gene Dang mention his incredible luck, Ziao Datang slowly stopped chopping and revealed a ferocious smile. Slaughtering your own kind increases the drop rate, but I need to take care of either the skinny kid or that little girl before I can calm down. After saying that, he turned his head, looked around, and sneered. I can&#x27;t find any trace of those two people in any of the three locations.</p>
<p>It seems they ran to the last direction. Lyn Shia, I&#x27;ll make you feel better if I do it. I&#x27;ll give you a good scolding when I log on. Xiao Daong entered the chat channel, glanced at the chat history briefly, and narrowed his eyes slightly. Lin Shiao is trying to buy life-healing potions.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s he doing? Is he injured? As if remembering something, Ziao Datang immediately went into the auction house and began searching. Sure enough, all six items Lin Shia had listed in the auction house were marked with seeking life healing potion, can be used as a discount in gold coins, and included a price tag of am. After hesitating for a few seconds, Ziao Datangs expression became increasingly ferocious. Haha, Lynsha, I&#x27;ve discovered your secret. Chapter 45.</p>
<p>What are you barking like a dog? Haha, Lyn Sha, I&#x27;ve discovered your secret. Xiao Datong looked up at the sky and roared, attracting the attention of Gene Dang. Daong, what&#x27;s wrong? That kid Lynn Shiao can&#x27;t hold on any longer. Xiao Dong sneered. He&#x27;s been asking for life healing potions across the entire chat channel.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s even added notes to all the items he&#x27;s listing on the auction house, saying he wants to buy life healing potions. Gene Dang, including that black long sword with the inscription, children of destiny and dogs cannot purchase. Xiao, shut up. Basically, we&#x27;re just scrambling to buy medicine. This kid must have suffered a serious injury.</p>
<p>the kind that can&#x27;t be slowly healed inside the territory. Lynn Shiao is the first place winner of the Long Non District Martial Arts Competition. His martial arts skills must be very high, no less than those of rare soldiers, and may even reach the level of outstanding soldiers. His ability to break records and earn extra hero rewards as a ranger lord, and his successful defense against the demonic tide is enough to demonstrate his exceptional combat prowess. I knew it.</p>
<p>How could a new lord with only ordinary recruitment tokens and ordinary heroes be so arrogant for so long and get so much equipment? Six pieces. He must have sold all of his equipment. It turns out he was the one who charged into battle and now he&#x27;s seriously injured. I was a little worried at first. Lynn Shiao has few soldiers, so he will definitely prioritize upgrading himself.</p>
<p>Maybe he is already level seven or eight. We might have to lose a small squad of rare troops to take him down, but now it seems like we have it in the bag. Xiao Datangs expression grew increasingly ferocious. Now I&#x27;m going to tear him apart and ravage him in front of everyone. Let everyone know that I&#x27;m not someone to be trifled with.</p>
<p>Just as Gene Dang was still puzzled, Ziao Datang immediately sent a private message to Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha, do you want the life healing potion? Click to view. Come to the public channel to get it. Then without waiting for Lin Ziao&#x27;s reply, Zhiao Datang spoke on the public channel. Life healing potion for sale, 10,000 gold coins per bottle, Lin Shia and dogs are not allowed to purchase at Lin Shiao.</p>
<p>Do you want to buy it? Come and buy it. The chat channel, which had been quite lively, fell silent again. Everyone is watching Xiao Daongs revenge battle. A few minutes passed. The expected reaction of Lin Sha filled with regret and remorse did not occur.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha did not even acknowledge Xiao Datong. Xiao Datong, he Lin Shiao, you&#x27;re too scared to speak now. Trying to buy it from someone else. Let me tell you this. Anyone who dares to sell the life healing potion to Lin Shiao is an enemy of me.</p>
<p>Xiao Datong and Gene Dang. Lin Sha, you won&#x27;t get it from me. Lyn Shia, answer me. Still no one answered. Ziao Daong Lin Sha, aren&#x27;t you going to answer me? Let&#x27;s see how long you can keep up this act.</p>
<p>If you kneel down and cow out to me on live stream and apologize, offering me the black long sword with both hands, I might spare your life. Oh no. Even if you give me the black long sword, I won&#x27;t spare you. It&#x27;s too late. You&#x27;ve repeatedly ignored my attempts to win you over and trampled on my dignity.</p>
<p>You must die. At Lyn Sha, you&#x27;re too arrogant. Do you think the battlefield of 10,000 races is still your lousy school where someone can shelter you from the wind and rain? and where you can cry to your teacher if you lose. Too bad you&#x27;re too green. I&#x27;ve already discovered your secret.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re injured. Severely injured. You actually went to the chat channel and auction house to buy life healing potions and even left messages on all the items as if you wanted everyone to know you were injured. Xiao Daton grinned maliciously. He wanted to expose Lin Xiao&#x27;s secret to the public, let everyone see it, and make Lin Shia lose face.</p>
<p>What? The chat channel immediately buzzed with excitement. Lyn Shia was seriously injured. No wonder. No wonder he was in such a hurry to buy life restoring medicine. I knew it.</p>
<p>So many lords died during that kind of demonic tide like the meteor shower. How could Lyn Sha possibly survive? He&#x27;s not some big shot like Ding Lay. It looks like Lynn Shia is in deep trouble now. He either needs to withdraw early or he&#x27;ll die on the battlefield of the myriad races. Quite a few people have died today alone.</p>
<p>Dinglay. Everyone, don&#x27;t talk nonsense. We&#x27;re all from the same district. We should give Lin Sha more encouragement and courage. The most brilliant student from Jangdong number three middle school is seriously injured and cannot participate in the newbie rankings with me.</p>
<p>Everyone said Dinglay is indeed kind-hearted. Even in this situation, he still wants to take care of Lyn Shao. Dinglay. Lin Shiao is also a super academic genius, so everyone should show him some respect. Academic genius.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiao&#x27;s F-level talent already destined him to never reach the same level as Ding Lay. By the way, Dinglay, have you recruited your first hero yet? Dinglay? He he I&#x27;m not very talented, but I&#x27;ll be able to recruit heroes soon. I&#x27;ll probably be number one in our region. No, number two. Wow.</p>
<p>No wonder you&#x27;re a pro. That&#x27;s real skill. recruiting heroes on only the second day after the server opened. I haven&#x27;t even started upgrading my lord&#x27;s mansion yet. He he that&#x27;s right, that sight.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiao&#x27;s record-breaking performance and being the first to recruit a hero are just luck. Look at him now. He&#x27;s seriously injured and desperately seeking medicine. That&#x27;s right. The true test of a genius lies in the battlefield of all races.</p>
<p>The most impressive are those like Ding Lay who are known for their composure. Seeing the debate in the chat channel, Ziao Daong was overjoyed. Even though Lynn Sha did not reply, but most people are mocking Lyn Shao, he has been isolated. So Xiao Dataong struck while the iron was hot. Lyn Sha, do you see that? A wandering night errant like you, relying on your marshall prowess, is doomed to die if you get injured.</p>
<p>You, a powerless and insignificant person, dare to be so arrogant on the battlefield of all races, not taking me seriously at all. I respect your F-level talent and your courage to venture into the battlefield of 10,000 races. You&#x27;re a real man. I&#x27;ve shown you kindness several times, but you didn&#x27;t appreciate it and dared to humiliate me again and again. A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated.</p>
<p>Today, I&#x27;m going to announce this to the entire district. Lord Xiao Daong and Gene Dang alliance. Use the punishment talisman to punish Lord Lin Sha. Effective immediately. Lyn Sha prepare to die.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, watch how I get rid of this shameless scoundrel. The words shocked the entire district. Dinglay. Xiao Datong. Isn&#x27;t this inappropriate? Xiao Datong, I have the extermination talisman.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m within the rules of the battlefield. I can deal with whomever I want. Dingle. But we&#x27;re all from the same district and we&#x27;re all from Lia. Xiaoangi Dinglay.</p>
<p>The battlefield of 10,000 races is not child&#x27;s play. It&#x27;s a real battlefield. Every contestant who enters the battlefield of 10,000 races has signed a life or death waiver. The Dragia Kingdom trained us to be qualified warriors and qualified lords so that we could fight for the interests of the Dragia Kingdom. This is not a place for sentimentality.</p>
<p>It is a place of ruthless slaughter. Lynn Shiao has repeatedly insulted me as a dog, and Lynn Shia must pay the price. Dinglay sai. All right, colleagues, as you&#x27;ve all seen, it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t want to help, but the battlefield of the myriad races is definitely not a place for leisure and vacation. Perhaps we do need some bloody lessons to make everyone realize the cruelty of the battlefield more quickly.</p>
<p>I have no objection. Upon seeing this, Xiao Daong snorted coldly. Lyn Sha was tagged again. Lynn Shiao, you&#x27;re just waiting to die. Surprisingly, Lyn Sha actually replied this time.</p>
<p>He slowly typed out a question mark. Eh, what are you barking about like dogs? Chapter 46. I&#x27;m not targeting anyone in particular. I mean, what are you barking like a dog? The sudden appearance of the words caught everyone offguard. Lyn Sha, you actually dared to reply.</p>
<p>You dared to curse me. You wait. I&#x27;ll cut you into a thousand pieces and torture your heroine to death. Ziao Daong jumped up and cursed angrily like a mouse whose tail had been stepped on. Dinglay Lyn Shiao.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s great. The fact that you can still reply to messages when we meet means you&#x27;re in good shape. By the way, were you cursing at me just now? You must have misunderstood. I was trying to help you. Look, I even told everyone to encourage you, and I was still trying to persuade Daong not to target you.</p>
<p>Before Lin Shiao could reply, Xiao Daong jumped in again. Lynn Shiao, no one can persuade me now. You&#x27;re dead today. Let me tell you the truth. I&#x27;m leading my troops and I&#x27;m about to enter your territory.</p>
<p>Haha. Didn&#x27;t expect that, did you? Lyn Sha said calmly. and howl as you please outside, but if anyone dares to invade my territory, I will kill them without mercy. Dinglay Lynn Shiao, try to speak more peacefully. To be fair, you&#x27;re being too aggressive with your insults.</p>
<p>Who are you referring to as you all? Who is barking wildly? Who are you calling a dog? Don&#x27;t include everyone else. It&#x27;s easy to incite public anger. Lyn Shia, I&#x27;m sorry, Ding Lay, that&#x27;s more like it. Actually, there are still many people willing to help you. If you really can&#x27;t hold on, it&#x27;s not impossible for you to bow your head and apologize to Xiao Daong.</p>
<p>Shake hands and make peace. I will mediate and do my best to accommodate you both. Lyn Shia, I&#x27;m not targeting you, Dinglay. I&#x27;m saying that everyone who mocked me just now is a dog. The chat channel instantly exploded.</p>
<p>The insults and ridicule came crashing down again. Xiao Data Ha, still pretending. Still pretending today I&#x27;ll let you die knowing why. D Chong begin. Ding.</p>
<p>Contestant Gene Dang has created a live stream room. Xiao Dataong. Everyone, we&#x27;ve created a live stream room. If you have money, please support us financially. If you don&#x27;t, please show your support by being there.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see how I deal with this arrogant brat who thinks he can do no good. In an instant, thousands of people flooded into the live stream, and the number was still rising rapidly. When the audience saw the strength of Ziao Daong and Gene Dashangs troops, they all gasped in shock. Orc veteran, a rare unit. Lizard Cavalry, a rare unit.</p>
<p>Harpy, a rare unit. Hog Rider, a rare unit. Troll head hunters, a rare ranged unit. Two squads. There are six rare unit teams in total with over 50 members.</p>
<p>This is only the second day in the newbie zone. holding a huge ax in his hand. Zhiao Datong said smuggly, &quot;Thanks for your support, everyone. This is a rare level weapon, the Black Wind Axe.&quot; Everyone was shocked. Zhiao Datang actually possessed a rare level weapon.</p>
<p>Everyone, I&#x27;m already level seven. D Chong is already level eight with the two of us and over 50 rare troops. Is this rare level weapon enough to take down Lin Shiao? Everyone was shocked, both by the high level of the two men and by their superior strength and weaponry. Immediately, Ziao Daong and Gene Dang swaggered towards Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory, right under the gaze of thousands of people in the live broadcast room. Just as Xiao Daong entered Dang, the two of them were singing in their live stream as they headed towards their destination.</p>
<p>The skinny boy Heay and the white stocking lowly Tu Shawn by Chin also rashly and hastily led 23 flower fairies to an unfamiliar place. The two of them are now in a mountainous area. At this moment, the two were even in a monster&#x27;s lair looking down the mountain. Surprisingly, they didn&#x27;t encounter a single monster along the way. Occasionally, you can see traces of monster blood on the ground that haven&#x27;t yet been refreshed by the main god system.</p>
<p>Due to the distance and the fog of war, he couldn&#x27;t see anything clearly. But Tu Shan by Chin was looking into the distance with great interest, seemingly unaffected. Wow, whose manner is this? It&#x27;s not big, but it&#x27;s just what I like. Tu Shan by Chin asked in disbelief, her eyes shining. You can really see it.</p>
<p>He asked irritably. Doesn&#x27;t the fog of war affect you? Of course, my sister can see it. Tu Shan by Chian didn&#x27;t explain, but instead muttered to herself. This territory is located at the mouth of a gourd with the main gate facing directly outwards. The entire interior of Gourd Mountain is blocked by this territory, essentially making it the Lord&#x27;s backyard.</p>
<p>Excellent terrain. The territory is roughly estimated to be tens of thousands of square meters. Only such a large area can just block the mountain pass. But this area is too big for a beginner&#x27;s area. I&#x27;ve never heard of such a thing before.</p>
<p>He a rolled his eyes at Tu Sha by Chen thinking, &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect you, this big- breasted, brainless girl to know about these strategic things.&quot; Tu Sha by Chin replied irritably, &quot;Of course I understand. I&#x27;m the top student in our school strategy class.&quot; And then continued to look around. The territory has been walled off and construction is still underway inside. There are quite a few farmers but not many soldiers. Tu Shan by Chin suddenly exclaimed.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s wrong? What did you see? He a asked anxiously. I saw a really handsome guy. Uggh. Girls shouldn&#x27;t swear, but I saw a really handsome guy. He&#x27;s so good-looking.</p>
<p>Seeing Tu Shawn by Chin&#x27;s infatuated expression, Heay rolled his eyes, opened the chat channel, and planned to see what the latest news was. Immediately, he saw the news that Xiao Daong and Gene Dang were attacking Lin Shiao and had started a live broadcast. This Lin Sha is really tough. He&#x27;s got guts. Heay shook his head and clicked into the live stream.</p>
<p>He was stunned as soon as he entered the live stream. The reason is simple. He was all too familiar with the soldiers under Xiao Datangs command. Orc veterans, harpies, lizard riders, boar riders, all the same size, all the same appearance. These units even have bits of paint still on them.</p>
<p>Only the red has turned green. It was him. He killed my Yao Yao. It was Xiao Datong. Hes body began to tremble uncontrollably.</p>
<p>What? Tu Shan by Chian looked over curiously and he immediately told her about the live stream. Tan by Chin also immediately entered the live broadcast room. Uggh. Those monsters are actually Ziao Daong soldiers. I&#x27;m so angry.</p>
<p>They even wanted to rape the younger sister first and then Well, that&#x27;s a really scary thing. No, I must expose them. The live stream was filled with flattery. Two big shots with strong and welle equipped troops. Lyn Shia will surely flee at the mere mention of their names.</p>
<p>Huh, bro? Xiao Datang said disdainfully, &quot;We&#x27;ve all used our innate abilities to secretly survey their terrain. It&#x27;s inside a gourdshaped opening. It&#x27;s surrounded by mountains on three sides with only one road in front and nowhere else to run. That arrogant brat is definitely going to get a good beating from those two big shots. Huh? Let that kid be so arrogant, daring to insult anyone.</p>
<p>After you two get rid of that arrogant brat, well still need your help to eliminate the remaining demons. He Heihi, it&#x27;s nothing. Just as Xiao Datong was feeling dizzy from being slapped by Ma Di, a discordant voice suddenly jumped out to oppose him. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Xiao Datangs troops are monsters.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re the ones who destroyed my little sister&#x27;s home. They killed all their soldiers. Only my little sister survived. Xiao Datang. Who do you think you are? I just wiped out the family of a white stocking lowly.</p>
<p>The attractive girl said, &quot;I&#x27;m wearing white stockings. You pervert.&quot; The live stream room fell silent instantly. &quot;Was it the pretty girl?&quot; That vain and narcissistic woman had been silent for several hours. It turns out she was attacked by Ziao Daong&#x27;s troops disguised as monsters. Eay, I can testify.</p>
<p>Xiao Datong and Gene Dang disguised their troops as demons, attacked the beautiful girl, and then came to kill me. I almost lost my entire army, and only about 20 flower fairies were left. Xiao Datang, you&#x27;re that skinny kid. Damn it, I didn&#x27;t even get to enjoy one of those flower fairies. They all self-destructed.</p>
<p>Gene Dang, I thought to myself, what a brainless fatso. Everyone thought to themselves, isn&#x27;t this just admitting that he did it? Just as Gene Dang was sweating profusely, unsure how to handle the situation, Ding Lay spoke up in the live broadcast room. Listen to both sides of the story and you will be enlightened. I think everyone should not believe anyone&#x27;s one-sided account. To be fair, there have been a lot of monsters lately.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s possible that Zei and Hezy were being chased and their territory destroyed by monsters. In their panic, they mistook the attackers for the attackers. Isn&#x27;t that right, everyone? Ding. Dingle has gifted Gene to Shang&#x27;s live stream with 1,000 gold coins. Chapter 47.</p>
<p>The big breasted brainless Tu Shawn by Chien the Phantom Archer exposed. Dinglays remarks immediately drew a chorus of approval. Exactly. You two. One is a man who talks nonsense and never listens, and the other is a super narcissistic woman who only knows how to pimp.</p>
<p>Who knows what you&#x27;re thinking? Are you trying to ride the wave of popularity from the live stream? Ding. Honed Gene Dang&#x27;s live stream with 50 gold coins. Ding. Yi Hong has gifted Gene Dangs live stream with a rocket. The live stream was buzzing again, but this time there were more and more people condemning and doubting the two.</p>
<p>Tan Bian was so anxious she was about to cry. What do I have to say for you to believe me? Datang, stunning girl. You say I attacked you, but what proof do you have? Why wasn&#x27;t your lord&#x27;s manor captured by me? You? Because you attacked my lord&#x27;s manor. The god system will issue a regionwide announcement. What types of troops do you have? I have two teams of elitewolves.</p>
<p>Ziao. H just two squads of elite werewolves. You think you can handle so many of our rare units and still escape from the fog of war and the surrounding monsters? Too sh. Because my lord&#x27;s talent is mutation, which allows me to transform into a beast and escape. It allows me to see through the fog.</p>
<p>It allows me to avoid arousing the hostility of wild monsters. Tan by Chian regretted her words as soon as they left her mouth. But withdrawing it was useless. Tens of thousands of eyes in the live stream had already seen it, including Lin Shia, who was watching silently in the live stream. Lynn Shiao couldn&#x27;t help but curl his lips, thinking to himself that this pretty girl&#x27;s brains were comparable to Xiao Datangs.</p>
<p>Truly a hidden dragon and a phoenix chick. Ziao Datang chuckled and said to the live stream audience, &quot;You can see through the fog. I don&#x27;t believe it. Tell me, where are you right now?&quot; Tu Shan by Chian, I am currently at the entrance to Calabash Mountain, and below is a lord&#x27;s territory. Upon hearing Hulu Co.</p>
<p>Xiao Datong and Gene Dang exchanged a glance. Gene Dang gave an exaggeratedly disdainful laugh on the live stream screen and said, &quot;You&#x27;re just making up some random place to fool us, aren&#x27;t you?&quot; Tan by Chin stamped her foot in frustration. &quot;I didn&#x27;t. I saw everything clearly around the Lord&#x27;s mansion.&quot; &quot;Oh, then tell me what&#x27;s on this territory. There are quite a few farmers there.</p>
<p>Are there any defensive structures?&quot; No. What types of troops are there? There were seven or eight archers dressed in green clothes and green cloaks. Their ears were pointed. Who is the lord? I don&#x27;t know. He&#x27;s just really handsome.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re asking so many questions. Don&#x27;t you believe me? Haha. Haha. In the live broadcast room, Ziao Daong and Gene Dang were laughing so hard they were bent over. While Heay, who was next to Tu Shan by Chien, was too late to stop her.</p>
<p>Girl, don&#x27;t you have a brain here? Lynn Sha cursed under his breath. He ran straight out of the lord&#x27;s mansion and looked around. However, because the archer was not around, he could not use his lord privileges to borrow their eagle-eyed skill, so he could not see far away. That big- breasted, brainless idiot girl just now revealed his location and his forces. The beautiful girl is nearby in my territory.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha hurriedly activated his lord talent. Eternal peace. Use 1,000 points of battlefield energy to exchange for Hashia token energy. Activate God&#x27;s perspective. Lynho&#x27;s vision was instantly elevated, and the thrill of seeing the entire map once again enveloped this land.</p>
<p>Soon, Lynsha spotted those fertigures. 23 beautiful and slender flower fairies, a skinny boy in a school uniform, and a short thin girl in white stockings with a really big white rabbit. These must be them. Lynn Shaol located the nearest group of archers led by Song Ruer and immediately gave the order. Song Ruer, go to these coordinates and bring back everyone here.</p>
<p>Capture them alive. Song Ruer and the others received the Lord&#x27;s orders directly in their minds and immediately took action. Lin Shiao changed his perspective again and saw Xiao Daong Jin Dang and his groups swaggering towards his territory. Huh, they actually dare to come? They must have known my location and came straight here. The massive force with nearly 60 rare units would be terrifying to others.</p>
<p>But Lynn Shia didn&#x27;t take it seriously at all. He could kill them as he pleased. Since they dared to attack me, it means they intended to kill me and establish their authority by using me. If they attack my territory, killing them all would not be excessive. Lyn Sha quickly considered the matter, nodded, and already had a plan in mind.</p>
<p>He shifted his perspective, continued to rise, and soon found what he was looking for. Those were the territories of several lords surrounding him. The lord&#x27;s body lay scattered on the ground with obvious signs of vandalism, looting, and arson. If you only kill the lord, the system will only announce who died. If you only plunder the warehouse, the system will not make any announcements.</p>
<p>The invaders did not occupy the Lord&#x27;s mansion in order to prevent the god system from announcing who did it. This shows that the intruders were a group of bandits who killed and looted and then ran away. They were definitely not monsters. The monsters are so destructive that they will eventually destroy all the buildings and then the god system will declare that the territory is now unclaimed. Lynho&#x27;s gaze grew colder and colder.</p>
<p>He took several screenshots using his god-like perspective. And just as he was about to log off, he spotted a small inconspicuous figure in the distance. Meanwhile, in the live stream, Ziao Daong and Gene Dang were laughing so hard that tears were streaming down their faces. Harah, you beautiful girl. Don&#x27;t you know you&#x27;re right near Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory? Thank you for revealing Lin Xiaos information to us.</p>
<p>What did you just say? Lyn Sha has seven or eight long-eared archers in green. Huh? I thought Lyn Sha was some kind of wandering lord all alone. So, it turns out that only by having special military units can we set records and resist the demonic tide. Does his lord&#x27;s manners still have any heroes? Beautiful lady, could you check and let me know? By the way, where is the beautiful heroine? Tell me, is it beautiful or not? Xiao Datong unleashed his full power, relentlessly mocking him. Everyone laughed and agreed.</p>
<p>For a moment, the live stream room was filled with a joyful atmosphere. &quot;Hey, everyone in the live stream, what kind of unit is that greenclad long-eared archer?&quot; Gene Datong asked casually with a laugh. The live stream went silent. What? Nobody knows. The long-eared one is an elven archer, and the long-eared one is wearing green clothes.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s phantom shooter. Someone with better academic performance commented in the live stream. Phantom shooters. There are seven or eight of them. Gene Dang maintained his smile, but cold sweat suddenly broke out on his face.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t that an elite unit? Xiao Daong realized what was happening and exchanged bewildered glances with Gene Dang. I see. I understand now. The viewers in the live stream realized what was happening and someone immediately jumped out to speak. The Phantom Archer is a neutral, leaning towards the benevolent faction.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha must have used his peace skill to reduce hostility and bewitch a team of Phantom Archers. Coupled with being born near a resourcerich area, he was able to clear the wilderness quickly and accumulate resources. Thus, he became the first to upgrade his lord&#x27;s mansion and set a record. That&#x27;s right. That&#x27;s what I think, too.</p>
<p>Phantom archers aren&#x27;t good at close combat. While Lin Shiao is the number one in the Jangdong Province martial arts competition, and his close combat ability is no less than that of elite soldiers. With one melee fighter and one range fighter working together, they&#x27;re like a tiger with wings. The insightful analysis was appreciated by many viewers in the live stream, including Dinglay. Dinglay, excellent analysis.</p>
<p>This also explains how they survived the demonic tide. Lin Sha and his hero melee fighters stood in front. The phantom archer was behind. This combination is indeed very powerful in the beginner area. But this demonic tide was too dangerous.</p>
<p>As a result, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s first hero was killed and Lin Shiao himself was seriously injured and had to seek out life restoring potions. The phantom archer was also reduced to only seven or eight. That&#x27;s right. That&#x27;s exactly it. Dingle is awesome.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like seeing it with my own eyes. 666,666. Dinglay. He simple analysis. It&#x27;s just a trivial skill.</p>
<p>Basic operations are not to be taken lightly. Chapter 48. The trump card is revealed. Come out and face your death. That&#x27;s well said.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha also in the live stream thought to himself expressionlessly. He didn&#x27;t need to explain anything. Someone else would explain everything for him. Now that there are reasonable guesses about how he got first place and how he set a record, it would be perfectly reasonable for him to do anything else. Reporting to the Lord, a deep gruff voice rang out from outside the Lord&#x27;s mansion.</p>
<p>It was Song Ruer. Bring all 24 women and one man here. Lyn Sha walked out of the Lord&#x27;s mansion, his gaze gloomy. There were 23 slender women with transparent fairy wings and surrounded by green leaves. A thin young man in a school uniform with dark circles under his eyes and a little girl in a lolita dress, animal ears on her head and white stockings on her feet.</p>
<p>It was the flower fairies he and the beautiful girl. The pretty girl was still muttering to herself complaining to Heay. You your flower fairy self-destruction is pretty powerful. Why didn&#x27;t you use them to self-destruct? and then escape. &quot;Idiot.</p>
<p>The ones capturing us are ranged units. Well just die if we charge in. What&#x27;s the point of self-destructing?&quot; Eay replied irritably. The flower fairies also glared angrily at the beautiful girl with a creaking sound. As the door opened, the surroundings quieted down.</p>
<p>The flower fairy and the beautiful girl noticed at the same time and immediately looked up where they saw Lynsha. &quot;Wow, so handsome,&quot; the flower fairies exclaimed in unison. Handsome guy, you must be Lin Sha, the big boss. Let&#x27;s add each other as friends. The pretty girl immediately swooned.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha didn&#x27;t give these people who had trespassed on his territory and were so talkative and brainless a friendly look and gave the order. Song Rule, tie all these people up. Leave two phantom archers to guard them and eight phantom archers to defend the base. The rest of you come with me. Lynn Shiao has already urgently mobilized Saulin, who will be back in 10 minutes at most.</p>
<p>Saulin, with 28 phantom archers, can defend against any invading enemy in conjunction with the base&#x27;s defenses. He say, &quot;You beautiful girls. I&#x27;ll deal with you when I get back. If you dare to spout any more nonsense and reveal my information, I will kill you all to silence you.&quot; the 10 divine arm archers who had just returned along with 10 phantom archers and immediately walked out of the gate of his territory. Behind them came the voices of a group of flower fairies.</p>
<p>Wow, he&#x27;s so handsome even when he&#x27;s angry. He&#x27;s so handsome even when he&#x27;s stern. Yao Yao really wants to be punished by him. Shut up. Have some backbone, will you? He&#x27;s angry voice echoed from afar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the live stream criticizing Lin Shiao was in full swing. But the two parties involved, Ziao Dataong and Gene Dang, were somewhat hesitant. Damn it, they actually have some elite units, though there are only seven or eight of them. If we want to take them down, we&#x27;ll probably have to bleed a little. Xiao Datong muttered to himself, afraid of losing face in the live broadcast.</p>
<p>We might even get ourselves killed, Gene Dang thought faster. Our rare troops numbering nearly 60 are definitely not afraid of eight elite troops. But those are the fastest firing phantom archers. Perhaps the two of us will lose a significant portion of our troops, losing nearly half their strength. Was it worth it to kill Lyn Sha? As the two whispered to each other, Dinglay suddenly sighed in the live broadcast room.</p>
<p>Dinglay sigh. Lyn Sha, I advised you to reconcile, but you wouldn&#x27;t listen. How can you fight them with so few phantom archers? Phantom archers are physically fragile and most vulnerable to close combat. Orc veterans can charge in and take down two of them at once. Despite its high rate of fire, it&#x27;s practically useless against heavily armored tanks or enemies like ghosts and skeletons that are immune to arrows.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao Lin Sha, what a pity. We were once equally famous, but it seems you are destined to be forgotten. Xiao Daong and his companions eyes lit up instantly. They immediately thought of their props. Book of the Dead ability consumable.</p>
<p>When used, it summons 20 elite skeleton archers and 20 elite skeleton warriors, all of which are level 10 rare quality units. Duration 24 hours. It perfectly counters Lin Xiao&#x27;s Phantom Archer. Skeleton soldiers are just skeletons, so arrows might not hit them. And even if they do, they won&#x27;t do much damage.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re so great just because you have a few phantom archers. I&#x27;ll tell you that luck is nothing compared to true strength. Today, you must die. Ziao Daong made a boastful statement in the live stream, and Gene Duchang immediately used the book of the dead. A flash of dark light appeared and 40 terrifying skeleton soldiers with green flames shooting out of their eyes immediately emerged from the ground.</p>
<p>The live stream chat erupted in another gasp. Xiao Datang and Gene Dang actually have a hidden trump card. They now have a 100 rare units. My god. And this is only the second day in the newbie zone.</p>
<p>Who can resist them? And judging from the flames in the eyes of these skeleton soldiers, they&#x27;re probably at least level 10. Lyn Shia, you&#x27;re in trouble. The enemy has ranged units and undead. Your phantom archers have no chance at all. Xiao Daong walked with his head held high, wearing a fine suit of armor and holding the rare weapon Black Wind Axe.</p>
<p>He led nearly a 100 rare soldiers on the main road. Not far away was Hulu Pass. He said to the live stream viewers, &quot;Brothers, I&#x27;m almost there. Watch me wipe out Lin Shia. If you like it, give me a like, comment, and share.</p>
<p>sending you some hearts. The live stream was immediately met with a flood of likes. Let&#x27;s go teach Lin Sha a lesson. Let this arrogant fool learn a lesson. Seeing this scene, Ziao Datong was filled with heroic spirit and roared to the sky.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao, come out and face your death. He was met with a swift and accurate reign of arrows. Whoosh! Ding! You have lost one harpy. Ding! You have lost one hog rider. Your loss.</p>
<p>Before Xiao Datang could react, the first wave of arrows swept over, and seven or eight of his soldiers had already fallen to the ground. Each of them had been pierced through the heart by two or three arrows at the same time. Damn it. Enemy attack. Charge.</p>
<p>Ziao Daong roared, his fighting spirit ignited, and he activated his Lord Talent, leading his troops in a charge. The enemy is right above Hulu Pass. We can take them out if we charge up. Whoosh! Another neat volley of arrows rained down and seven or eight soldiers were killed on the spot. Charge with me.</p>
<p>Whoosh. Charge. Whoosh. Charge and retreat. Whoosh.</p>
<p>Grasp. Whoosh. Ding. Player. Xiao.</p>
<p>Daong in the newbie zone number 89757 has been eliminated. H. Everyone in the live stream gasped in shock. The giftgiving suddenly stopped. Tu Shawn by Chien who were tied up but still managed to sneak into the live stream to watch exchanged a horrified glance had tormented both families to the point of death was easily killed on the spot by Lyn Shia with just a few volleys of arrows.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t even get to see Lin Shia and the phantom archer. Is Lyn Sha really that terrifying? Is this the true strength of the number one genius in Daang Dong? At this moment, the live stream room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Gene Dang shouted and the last 40 skeleton soldiers immediately surrounded him. He dared not move. The rain of arrows stopped.</p>
<p>On a distant hillside, a tall, handsome man in dark armor with a radiant presence slowly descended the hillside, accompanied by 10 elven archers dressed in green and wielding long bows and 10 strange soldiers clad in heavy armor and carrying giant crossbows. It&#x27;s Lyn Sha. Lyn Shao slowly walked past the corpses scattered on the ground. He didn&#x27;t even stop when he passed Xiao Datang, who was covered in arrows and died with his eyes wide open in disbelief. It was as if a stray dog had just passed by.</p>
<p>He led his troops, hands behind his back, expression calm, and slowly walked to a spot not far in front of Gene Duchang. He walked right in front of the live broadcast room. At that moment, he appeared like a god descending to earth in the live stream. Chapter 49. A powerful figure appears in Lanon district.</p>
<p>The Gene family patriarch appears. Don&#x27;t come any closer. Gene Dang even forgot to turn off the live stream and just shouted in terror. You monster. You actually killed Xiao Datang.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t you afraid of punishment? What is the punishment for invading my territory and lawfully killing someone? Lyn Shao stopped and said loudly, he who kills will be killed by others. Gene Dong, you and Xiao Dang killed so many lords in the chaos. Now you can taste the bitterness of death. No need to thank me. You&#x27;re talking nonsense.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t kill anyone. Lyn Shia didn&#x27;t say anything, but directly threw several screenshots from his god-like perspective into the live stream. Those were photos of lords who had been brutally murdered and the remains of their territories. Strangely, the lord&#x27;s mansions were not occupied, but everything else was destroyed. Monsters aren&#x27;t that smart.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#x27;t leave the lord&#x27;s manor untouched. Without a doubt, what he told the beautiful girl earlier was the truth. There was a wound on a corpse that was even the same as the one on the Malay sword in Gene Dashangs hand. Xiao Datang and Gene Dang did indeed commit the heinous act of ambushing and massacring their own clansmen without any reason. Tu Shawn by Chiian, who were secretly watching the live broadcast, immediately burst into tears, feeling that their wrongful convictions had been overturned.</p>
<p>But they dared not utter a single word because Lyn Sha had said before he left that if they uttered even one more word, he would kill them to silence them. Having witnessed Lin Xiaos terrifying strength, the two dared not disobey him in the slightest. Upon seeing Liaos picture, Gene Deng broke out in a cold sweat. You have no right to judge me. I&#x27;m not here to judge you.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m here to kill you. Lyn Shiao said coldly, leading his troops forward. This This charge. Phantom archers can&#x27;t handle skeleton soldiers. Ziao Daong pushed all the skeleton soldiers out at once.</p>
<p>He then turned and fled. Whoosh! Splash! A volley of arrows swept across the battlefield, striking the powerful skeletons one by one. Unable to withstand the impact, they disintegrated instantly. 40 rare units were instantly reduced to ashes. How is this possible? The viewers in the live stream were shocked once again.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t skeletons immune to arrows? It&#x27;s those weird units. They&#x27;re the ones who fired, someone in the live stream replied. I saw 10 soldiers clad in armor like iron towers with only their eyes showing wielding giant crossbows who pierced through several skeletons with a single arrow. What kind of unit is this? So fierce. Wouldn&#x27;t that be even more powerful than the phantom archer? Lyn Shia truly deserves to be called the number one genius in Jangdong.</p>
<p>He really did have a trump card up his sleeve. Lyn Shia is awesome. No, don&#x27;t kill me. Don&#x27;t kill me. Seeing the skeleton soldiers being easily crushed, Gene Duchang could no longer hold on and suffered a mental breakdown.</p>
<p>I still have a teleportation talisman. I&#x27;ll run back to my territory. You can&#x27;t kill me. Tried to open a portal using a teleportation talisman, but his hand trembled and the portal opened in the distance. He cried and crawled toward the portal, screaming all the way, &quot;Do you think I&#x27;ll let you off the hook?&quot; Lyn Sha sneered and led his troops step by step slowly and deliberately to catch up with Gene Dang.</p>
<p>Hey Lyn Sha, stop now. Dinglay spoke up in the live broadcast room. Leave a way out for others so you can meet again in the future. You have already killed Xiao Daong who accidentally trespassed into your territory. Why go to such lengths to exterminate him and relentlessly pursue Gene Dang as well? You&#x27;ll be in big trouble if you anger Dong Dang Academy.</p>
<p>To be fair, Gene Dang must not make things difficult for Lin Sha in the future. Lyn Shia will give Gene Dang 2,000 gold coins as compensation for Gene Dashangs troop losses and then we&#x27;ll call it even. How about that? Dingle&#x27;s prudent and fair words also brought a glimmer of hope to Gene Dang. With tears streaming down his face, he retreated towards the portal, his voice trembling with sobs as he loudly echoed, &quot;Yes, let me go. I&#x27;ll forgive and forget.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I can&#x27;t guarantee your personal safety. I have powerful connections. Dingle Lynn Sha were equals both geniuses. This time, please do me a favor and also give yourself a way out. I&#x27;m doing this for your own good, idiot.</p>
<p>You think you&#x27;re worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as me? Lyn Sha interrupted directly. How come I&#x27;ve never heard of this before? Then Lynn Sha turned his head and looked coldly at Gene Dashang again. Terrified, Gene Dang cried and crawled into the teleportation portal. Lyn Sha led 20 soldiers and stepped inside. The live stream switched instantly taking place in Gene Dashangs territory.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop him!&quot; Gene Dang shouted and scrambled toward the Lord&#x27;s mansion like a madman. From his territory, another squad of wild boar riders charged out. It turns out that Gene Dang had been holding back all along. But how could such a rare unit be a match for Lin Sha and his group? In less than 3 seconds, all the boar riders were dead. Gene Dang bought himself some time and ran into the Lord&#x27;s mansion.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha unhurried and with an imposing gate led his troops slowly into Gene Dashangs Lord&#x27;s mansion. Gene Dang wailed. Lyn Sha, you&#x27;ve invaded my territory. You&#x27;ve broken the rules. You will be punished.</p>
<p>Idiot. I know the battlefield laws of 10,000 races better than you do. Lyn Sha said disdainfully. If one side uses a punitive talisman against the other, either side may continue fighting until the very end, unless both sides agree to a ceasefire. Killing you is permitted by the rules.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha walked slowly forward, getting closer and closer to the isolated and helpless Gene Duchang. What do you want from me to let him go? A deep voice rang out from inside the Lord&#x27;s Manor. Everyone in the live stream was suddenly startled. It turned out that Gene Dang had made a call to someone and that person then requested that the call be made public so that he could speak directly with Lin Sha. Gene Dashangs backer has arrived.</p>
<p>Gene Dangs communication interface appeared in the live broadcast room and a figure with his face covered only his eyes showing appeared on one side. His ID has been disabled and is not being displayed. Although his face was not visible, his arrogant demeanor and aura reminded everyone that he was a ruthless and skilled person. Everyone in the live stream quieted down, waiting for the next scene. I advise you to stop now lest you get yourself into trouble, the masked man said.</p>
<p>Who are you? Lyn Sha asked. Me? Huh? I&#x27;m someone you can&#x27;t afford to mess with. Lynn Sha turned his head, and the archer behind him raised his hand and fired an arrow which pierced through Gene Dashangs right arm. Gene Dang immediately let out a pig-like scream. You talk too much nonsense.</p>
<p>You I am a top 100 expert lord in the Lan region. How dare you do this to my face? Lyn Sha turned his head again and two archers behind him fired two arrows, piercing Gene Dangs legs. You stop. The masked man shouted angrily. You dare mess with our international bilingual school.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t force me to break out of my current server and wipe you out in the newbie zone. Wrong answer. Lyn Shia pouted regretfully and the two archers raised their crossbows again and fired two arrows. Swish. Swish.</p>
<p>Bang. The sound of crystal shattering rang out. As expected, Gene Duchang was not shot through the heart. The crossbow bolts were deflected. Immediately a low guttural laugh rang out and a blood red shadow slowly rose from Gene Dang who had already fainted from fright.</p>
<p>He this junior has some skill. He actually managed to break the protective charm of a collateral descendant like me. Tens of thousands of people in the live stream gasped again. The air seemed to freeze for a moment. The way that blood red figure appeared was so shocking.</p>
<p>This is the standard way a demon makes his entrance. On the other end, the masked man, who claimed to be among the top 100 in the Lnon region, also showed an expression of reverence as he watched the blood red figure slowly rise. The phantom archers and the divine arm archers immediately went on high alert and surrounded Lin Shiao. Chufinga&#x27;s words echoed in Lin Xiaos ears. Xin Dang and his companion have powerful backers.</p>
<p>The forces behind them are complex and intertwined with some even connected to the Jang Bay city lord&#x27;s mansion and the official district. Lynhos expression was stern. Xene Dang and the other man were tyrants who had committed numerous bloody crimes in the Long Kingdom and were now locked in a life ordeath struggle with him on the battlefield of the myriad races. Lynn Shiao had already anticipated the worst case scenario when a self-proclaimed top 100 expert from the official server appeared, so he wasn&#x27;t panicked. Now, another powerful looking blood shadow ancestor had appeared.</p>
<p>How should this matter be resolved? Lyn Xiao&#x27;s brain raced, and finally he gritted his teeth. Throughout Chinese history, those who achieve great things have always possessed ruthlessness. If you back down now, there will be no future. Upon seeing that the crimson figure had completely solidified, the masked man respectfully shouted. Ancestor, &quot;Holy crap!&quot; The crimson shadow twitched.</p>
<p>&quot;You scared the hell out of me, masked man. Live stream room Lyn Sha.&quot; The blood red figure glanced at the masked man on the communication interface behind him, seemingly not recognizing him, shook his head, then looked around and saw the unconscious Gene Dashang. What an incompetent descendant. weak and useless. Don&#x27;t I know my own talisman? Did I give him too much? As for you, brat, who intends to kill my descendant, your strength is quite impressive.</p>
<p>And the phantom archer is also helping out. Not bad. Very good. Even in the early stages, you&#x27;re considered one of the strongest units. You have great potential.</p>
<p>The crimson figure looked around as if no one else was there. Then suddenly, its eyes lit up. Your unit is quite interesting. What&#x27;s it called? In the live stream, tens of thousands of people held their breath, waiting for Lyn Xiaos answer. This is an upgraded version of the Phantom Shooter.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao glanced at Song Ruer and his group, who were as large as two Phantom archers, and slowly said, &quot;Rolls-Royce Ghost Shooter, short for Gusta Archer.&quot; Beneath the heavy armor mask, Son Ruer&#x27;s lips twitched involuntarily. How was it upgraded? The blood red figure seemed to have a strong desire to learn and explore. Simple. Just have the phantom archer practice singing and archery while wearing overalls for 2 and 1/2 years, Lynsha replied. Practicing while wearing overalls.</p>
<p>Such a bizarre way of leveling up is something I&#x27;ve never heard of before. The crimson figure muttered to itself. If I weren&#x27;t bound to this other world and unable to unleash my power, I would love to return to the blue star realm right now and give it a try. Lyn Sha said calmly. You can&#x27;t use your power.</p>
<p>The crimson figure nodded. Exactly. Alas, we won&#x27;t be able to return to the blue star realm anytime soon. With a whoosh, a crossbow bolt struck Gene Dang squarely in the heart. Ding.</p>
<p>Player Gene Dang from the newbie zone number 89757 has been eliminated. Ding. The live stream has been closed due to the homeowner&#x27;s death. Chapter 50. Gusto&#x27;s rise to fame.</p>
<p>What are you talking about if you can&#x27;t even use your power? You old showoff. With Gene Duchang&#x27;s sudden death, the masked man communicating with him was forced to stop the communication. The live broadcast room was shut down and the blood red demonic shadow vanished in an instant. Lyn Sha curled his lip and led the archers out of Gene Duchangs Lord&#x27;s mansion. It wasn&#x27;t that he was inherently reckless, but rather that as a top student, he clearly understood using a conquest talisman against someone is like entering a life or death arena.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a possibility of being killed in return. This is very common on the battlefield of all races, and there&#x27;s no moral risk involved. Most lords will simply think it&#x27;s a good thing they killed them. The punitive talisman has been issued right above our heads. How can we maintain our position among the lords if we don&#x27;t fight back? Another point is that those who can leave the blue star realm to fight in other realms are all prehistoric giants.</p>
<p>But returning to the blue star realm is extremely troublesome. Moreover, he noticed that the Gene family patriarch seemed a bit dim-witted. If you don&#x27;t cut the weeds at the root, they&#x27;ll grow back in the spring. Anyone who dares to lay a hand on me must be punished. With tens of thousands of people watching this time, I reckon there will be far fewer clueless guys messing with me in the 89757 newbie zone.</p>
<p>Now comes the harvest time. Break through their warehouse. Yes. Archer immediately drew his bow and used the five elements arrow to blast Gene Dashangs warehouse with a fire arrow. Ding.</p>
<p>You have breached Gene Dangs warehouse, obtaining 3,451 units of wood. 3,685 units of stone, 1558 units of iron ore, or 1,774 units of copper or 130 units of gold or 15,478 gold coins and 568 units of wild beef. You have quite a lot of gold coins. Did you get them from the live stream tips just now? Huh? This kid doesn&#x27;t farm at all. He relies entirely on hunting and robbing in the wild.</p>
<p>and he&#x27;s got quite a lot of resources. Robbing one&#x27;s own kind is indeed a good way to get rich. Lynn Shiao gave another order. Song Ruer, use eagle-eyed skill to find any empty territories nearby. Xiao Datongs might be among them.</p>
<p>These two are in cahoots and inseparable. I suspect their territories are adjacent to each other. Yes, my lord. Over here, Lynn Sha shot and killed Gene Dang with an arrow. The live broadcast room was shut down and tens of thousands of people were completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Immediately, the crowd with nowhere to go flooded into the chat channel, causing it to explode instantly. My god, did you see that? Lyn Sha killed Xiao Datong and Gene Dang. He slaughtered them with ease, like killing a dog. Is this something a lord with only frank talent can do? Or is Lin Sha a hidden master? Lyn Sha is so handsome. Add me as a friend.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll warm your bed. Hey, upstairs. Stop thinking about it. Lyn Shia has a pretty girl who&#x27;s already moved in with him. You&#x27;re too late.</p>
<p>O, I wouldn&#x27;t mind warming the bed with a pretty girl. That&#x27;s right. That&#x27;s right. Boss Lyn Sha even has a beautiful heroine certified by the God system. He doesn&#x27;t mind.</p>
<p>You bunch of infatuated girls. All you can see is looks. Can&#x27;t you see the important thing? Why is Lynn Sha so powerful? Wasn&#x27;t he seriously injured and searching the world for life restoring potions? Yeah, he didn&#x27;t look injured at all. Didn&#x27;t boss Ding Lay analyze that Lin Sha was already injured? Dinglay, the big boss. The chat channel was very active, but Ding Lay remained silent.</p>
<p>Hey, what&#x27;s the deal with Lin Sha, you guys? At first, you said he was a genius from Jangdong number three middle school and the top scorer in the Daangdong provincial unified examination. later. You said he was a good for nothing with only F- level lord talent and could only be a wandering lord, but everyone just saw it. He has two squads of soldiers, each more powerful than the last. Exceptional phantom archers and an upgraded version of the phantom archers, something ancient.</p>
<p>Gust the archer. This name sounds a bit strange, but it&#x27;s really powerful. One arrow can kill several rare skeleton warriors. Has anyone seen this type of soldier before? No. Didn&#x27;t Gene Deshangs ancestor also never see him? He was quite a formidable figure.</p>
<p>The chat channel was quiet for a while. Then the conversation turned to the blood red figure and the atmosphere suddenly became a little awkward. Everyone knows how the live stream was eventually shut down. Lynn Shia seems to completely disregard this ancestor of the Gene family. Gene Dang, the nth generation leader, died in vain.</p>
<p>And that masked guy in the official server claiming to be a top 100 expert lord. Lyn Sha didn&#x27;t give him any face at all. He directly killed Gene Dang. Cool. Fearless of power.</p>
<p>Boss Lyn Sha is awesome. Some people admired Lyn Sha. Huh? An answer my foot. Some expert lord even came from another region to cause him trouble. Lyn Sha is probably in deep trouble this time.</p>
<p>Master Lord. That&#x27;s a title for someone ranked in the top 100 in the official server. To be ranked in the top 100 in an official server with tens of millions of players, that&#x27;s the ultimate master. Lyn Sha is doomed. With such a high ranking, it&#x27;ll be difficult for him to even leave the live server.</p>
<p>Have he abandoned his foundation? Stupid. A big shot like that has countless underlings. Just send his underlings. The two sides started arguing. One side admired Lyn Sha, marveling at how someone with an F-level talent could achieve such success and had begun calling him big boss.</p>
<p>The other side still looked down on Lyn Sha, believing he was too bloodthirsty and would soon be killed by experts from the official region. Suddenly, a notification from the main god system came through. Ding. Dinglay, a player from the L nan region of the blue star realm, has successfully recruited the first hero, becoming the ninth rookie lord in the L nan region this year. System reward, one excellent treasure chest.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s Dinglay, so he&#x27;s trying to climb the charts. In the battlefield of the myriad races, there are various rankings. The regular ones include the first hero recruited, the second hero recruited, and the first hero to reach level three. The special ones include the tasks that are released at a regular intervals in the battlefield of the myriad races. Therefore, people generally refer to the act of recruiting heroes as rushing to the rankings.</p>
<p>Dinglay everyone. I&#x27;m unworthy to be the second person in our newbie zone to recruit heroes. But this time, the chat channel wasn&#x27;t as full of compliments as I&#x27;d expected. Dinglay is awesome. Dinglay is still as stable as ever.</p>
<p>There were very few people who came to offer their congratulations. A hint of disappointment flashed through Ding Lays mind. And he said again, &quot;Everyone, to be fair, even though I&#x27;m only ninth in all the newbie zones in the Lan region, as you all know, this is extremely difficult. It&#x27;s impossible for anyone in our region to be the first to recruit. Today, Ding Chufinga, a player from the Long Nan region of the Blue Star Realm, has successfully recruited the first hero, becoming the 10th New Lord in the Lan region this year.</p>
<p>System reward, one excellent treasure chest. Everyone, huh? Meanwhile, in the open space of Lin Xiao&#x27;s Lord&#x27;s Manor, Hay and Tu Shan by Chien, who were bound hand and foot, were laughing so hard they were almost out of breath. The two dared not speak in the live stream or chat channel, but they were not prohibited from chatting verbally. Dinglay was really too pretentious. Didn&#x27;t he get slapped in the face in a flash? I&#x27;ve disliked him for a long time.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a pretentious showoff who always likes to say things like, &quot;Let me speak the truth.&quot; But he&#x27;s not fair at all. He&#x27;s just pulling one side down while putting the other down. Harah, it&#x27;s all thanks to my boss, Lyn Sha, who saw through his true colors long ago and slapped him in the face several times. He said with a laugh. What? Your boss, Lyn Shao? When did Lin Sha become your boss? Tu Shan by Chian rolled her eyes and said sourly, &quot;You forgot.</p>
<p>I He confronted Xiao Dong and stood up for boss Lin Shiao in front of everyone three times.&quot; &quot;Boss Lin Shiao definitely remembers me.&quot; Oh, but didn&#x27;t you chickenen out right away? You&#x27;ve become a laughingstock. You Lyn Sha is definitely mine. I&#x27;m quite pretty, and I&#x27;ve already expressed my feelings to him. He&#x27;s bound to fall for me. The flower fairies nearby protested, chattering.</p>
<p>The fairies are even more beautiful. Lord, you&#x27;ll definitely love the fairies. He&#x27;s a Whose lord are you talking about? Me or Lyn Sha? Quiet. The phantom archer who stayed behind finally couldn&#x27;t help but shout, &quot;Behave yourselves.&quot; Once everyone quieted down, the phantom archer muttered something else. &quot;A bunch of vulgar beauties.</p>
<p>How could the Lord possibly take a liking to you? You two shan by Chin immediately exploded. Even the rope binding her couldn&#x27;t stop her chest from heaving. Her face puffed up, making her look incredibly cute. My beauty is already one in a million. How many people in this world are more beautiful than me? The flower fairies chattered amongst themselves.</p>
<p>The fairies are the most beautiful. Without the angels, no one can compare to their beauty. Quiet. The phantom archer once again stopped everyone, rolled his eyes, and didn&#x27;t bother to answer. Just then, a commotion arose at the territory gate.</p>
<p>The Lord has returned. Lyn Sha returned in a great hurry, leading a large group of soldiers. One of the men, a burly man clad in heavy armor, had an unconscious figure on his shoulder. Chapter 51. All of you better shut up gracefully.</p>
<p>He and Tu Shan by Chian immediately shut up and looked at the group of people who came in. Lyn Sha glanced at the two of them indifferently, then walked straight into the Lord&#x27;s mansion. Those who returned with Lynn Shiao included the Phantom Archers, the Gust Archers, dressed like tin cans, and a squad of burly soldiers wearing thick shiny armor resembling fish scales and wielding massive 3 m long weapons. The captain of the leading unit put the unconscious figure he was carrying on his shoulder down to the ground, then stood aside without saying a word, holding his weapon. The unconscious figure was a young man who appeared to be a lord in the newbie zone.</p>
<p>However, he was seriously injured at the moment with several hideous wounds on his body. Although they had been simply bandaged, blood was still slowly seeping out. He and Tu Shan by Chin were unsure of Lin Xiaos intentions, so they simply sat quietly on the ground, awaiting their fate. At this moment, the flower fairy beside her whispered a few words. My lord, look.</p>
<p>This person is emitting a green glow. Heay turned his head to look and saw specks of green mist slowly seeping into the unconscious man&#x27;s body. He frowned and then relaxed as if he had thought of something. Lyn Sha entered the lord&#x27;s mansion and saw the stunningly beautiful enchantress Baoi sitting on a long bench with a frown. Upon seeing Lyn Sha return, Ba quickly rose and bowed.</p>
<p>My lord, you&#x27;re back. No need for formalities, Baoi. Lyn Shao reached out and helped Baoi up, secretly marveling at her amazing charm, which was far more captivating than any of the 24 female creatures outside combined. He reached out and handed Ba a dark red potion, saying, &quot;Take this and see if it can relieve your pain.&quot; Baosi suddenly looked up, her clear and bright eyes meeting Lin Xiao, and said, &quot;My lord, this this is a secret recipe for the battlefield where all races v for supremacy. I learned about it from a friend.</p>
<p>Give it a try.&quot; Ba&#x27;s heart fluttered. The Lord had actually worried about her such a small matter. Seeking medicine and medical help. In an instant, her pain seemed to ease considerably. She immediately thanked Lin Sha and took the medicine.</p>
<p>The pain subsided immediately after the medicine entered her throat. Seeing Lin Xiao&#x27;s concerned gaze, Baoi was even more moved. Reporting to my lord, I am much better and can no longer feel the pain. I am ashamed. My lord, you must have gone to great lengths for my lowly body.</p>
<p>Ding. You have resolved Ba&#x27;s health issues. Ba sees two elements reversal. Luck value has now increased to minus 85. Hearing the voice of the main god system, Lynsha was somewhat taken aback.</p>
<p>This had increased his luck again. Lyn Shiao had previously tried to purchase a life-healing potion but failed. Ziao Daong even tried to humiliate him by using it. After Lin Sha killed Ziao Daong and Gene Dang, demonstrating undeniable power, several people immediately contacted him, offering to send him life healing potions. Lynn Shiao didn&#x27;t stand on ceremony.</p>
<p>He refused the freebies and bought five tubes directly at the market price of 100 gold coins each. The ordinary spirit field, fine breastplate, fine leg armor, attack claw, and birch longbow that he had listed on the auction house were all sold immediately. However, the black long sword has remained untouched to this day, perhaps because it is too sensitive. You don&#x27;t need to overthink it. Lynsha said, &quot;This life healing potion is a common potion.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t take me much effort to obtain it. Bae, this battlefield of myriad races is full of wonders, and anything is possible. Once you come here, you can forget your past experiences and live a happy and fulfilling life. Whether she was a concubine or not was secondary. What he still couldn&#x27;t figure out was whether the muffled groan in his mind was a hallucination or something someone had done on purpose.</p>
<p>The main thing is that if you&#x27;re happy, your rule level skills can be used to my advantage instead of harming me, Lyn Sha thought to himself. Besides, I can only make money if you&#x27;re happy. With tears in her eyes, Baoi bowed again, looking charming and touching. Lyn Sha nodded, accepting Bao&#x27;s gratitude. If you&#x27;re feeling better, tell me more about what happened with the ancient demons.</p>
<p>I want to know more details. With that, he pulled Bao Sei down to sit with him. Yes, my lord. Baoi nestled naturally in Linhaos arms and began to speak. Outside, he tu Shan by Chiian and the flower fairies felt extremely uncomfortable under the watchful eyes of the various military units.</p>
<p>Apart from the phantom archer, who has a relatively gentle appearance, the other two soldier types are all tall and burly, covered in iron armor, exuding a murderous aura. Seeing that Lin Shao had returned, the two dared not say anything more. They were in the wrong, both morally and logically. They had invaded Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory. Hereafter clarified, the place where a lord resides is called the Lord&#x27;s mansion.</p>
<p>The area inside the Lord&#x27;s mansion and a host of functional buildings plus defensive measures such as walls constitutes the territory. The mines occupied by the lord outside as well as a certain radius outside the territory also belong to the lord and are called territory. Furthermore, Tu Shawn by Chin&#x27;s brainless leak of Lin Xiaos troop information nearly caused a major disaster. If it were a more ruthless lord, it would be normal for them to be killed outright. So, the two of them could only stare at the unconscious man on the ground with nothing else to do.</p>
<p>Just then, footsteps sounded and another figure arrived at the Lord&#x27;s Mansion Square. The man&#x27;s robes appeared somewhat disheveled, stained with blood. A pale blue, long, single-edged sword was tucked into his waistband, and a stench of blood emanated from the sword. Upon closer inspection, however, they saw that the man was wearing a light blue robe that neither of them had seen before, but which they subconsciously found very attractive and endearing. He had a tiger-striped gold belt around his waist, and his long hair was neatly tied back.</p>
<p>Below his eyebrows were bright eyes, and he had a slender figure. He was not old, but he looked dashing and handsome. The flower fairies could even utter their wow. He turned around and glared at them fiercely, causing them to shut their mouths. The group of men and women in the square.</p>
<p>Mr. Payman. Upon seeing this man, the soldiers all bowed in greeting. Just as he and Tu Shan by Chan were pondering, the unconscious man on the ground slowly woke up. He first quickly sat up, checked his injuries, and found that he was basically unharmed.</p>
<p>Then he looked around and saw a crowd of people watching him. After a few seconds of silence, the man looked at Pay Min. Are you the Lord? Pay Min shook his head. The man looked at Song Ru and Tangg Yi, both of whom remained silent. The man looked at Hay and Tu Sha by Chen again.</p>
<p>He wanted to ask them a question, but when he saw the two of them tied up, he curled his lip and turned back. Hey, what&#x27;s with that look you&#x27;re giving me? He immediately protested. Why don&#x27;t you ask me if I&#x27;m the Lord? Too weak? The man replied without turning his head. What about me? Why didn&#x27;t you ask me? You&#x27;re a pretty girl, but you&#x27;re too stupid. You tu Shan by Chian was angered again.</p>
<p>You then he changed his tone. I&#x27;ll accept it if you call me stupid as long as I&#x27;m the most beautiful. Both the man and Heay couldn&#x27;t help but slightly purse their lips. Seeing that the flower fairies were about to start arguing again. The phantom archer who was guarding the side immediately understood what was about to happen.</p>
<p>Quiet. The phantom archer shouted, then reported. Captain Saul, the women here, as prisoners have no self-awareness and always like to argue about who is the most beautiful. Upon hearing the archer&#x27;s report, Soldering also came over. In any case, as elves, we should not treat ladies in such an inelegant manner.</p>
<p>Ladies over here, please stop talking about such pointless topics. Yes, there&#x27;s no need to discuss it at all because my little sister is the most beautiful. Tan by Chin raised her chin and said proudly. The flower fairies retorted again, &quot;No way, you big- breasted, brainless woman. The fairies are the most beautiful soldering.</p>
<p>All of you shut your clever mouths up gracefully. With a creek, the gate of the Lord&#x27;s mansion opened and two people walked out. The flower fairies and two Shan by Chin snorted coldly and turned to look. Upon seeing this, everyone&#x27;s mouths immediately gaped open. Chapter 52.</p>
<p>This kid is ruthless. The people who came out were Lin Sha and Ba. Lyn Sha was tall and handsome with a calm and composed demeanor. His dark armor gave him an air of mystery that inspired a desire to follow him. But Tu Shan by Chian Heay and all the flower fairies were focused on another person.</p>
<p>It was a woman wearing a dark red cloak. She had already lowered the hood, revealing a face of unparalleled beauty. She was both pure and ethereal, yet alluring and seductive, possessing a charm that blended innocence and allure. Her hair was as black as a waterfall, and her face was as white as if it were carved from ice crystals without any flaws. Even though she was wearing a cloak, people could still feel the figure sealed beneath it, which aroused endless imagination.</p>
<p>The feeling she gave people made their hearts pound as if they had seen the white moonlight in their hearts. This This is Lin Xiaos beautiful heroine. Heay murmured. Wow, she&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous little sister. Compared to her, I&#x27;m really just slightly better looking.</p>
<p>Tu Shan by Chin couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Can I add you as a friend, sister?&quot; &quot;Wow, even angels aren&#x27;t this beautiful.&quot; Yao Yao has seen a woman even more beautiful than an angel today. The flower fairies chattered excitedly, their eyes shining. Even the man who had remained silent after the questioning stared intently at Ba. After a few seconds, he finally reacted, lowering his head deeply as if he dared not look directly at her. The phantom archer standing guard nearby curled his lips slightly, revealing his inner thoughts.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the two emerge, all the soldiers in front of the lord&#x27;s manner bowed in unison. Lord, Miss Ba Soldering smiled at Tu Shawn by Chin and the flower demon. Ladies, now you know why your arguments are pointless, don&#x27;t you? Lynn Sha waved his hand, signaling everyone to be quiet. Then he walked to the front and looked indifferently at the crowd who were still bound hand and foot. Hey pretty girl, what&#x27;s your name? Tan.</p>
<p>Tan by Chian. The beautiful girl still looked at Bao Si with her eyes filled with both admiration and a hint of jealousy. She didn&#x27;t understand why she felt this way. Very good. Lynn Shiao turned to the mysterious man.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s your name? The mysterious man&#x27;s wounds had healed considerably and his spirits had returned to normal. He said in a low voice, &quot;Chan Ningming.&quot; Lin Sha nodded, then turned to look at Heay and Tu Sha by Chian. He tu Shan by Chiian, you two have trespassed into my territory and leaked information to Xiao Datang. Do you know what punishment you will receive? Heay was taken aback and said, &quot;Boss Lin Shiao, it was Zay May who leaked the information. I was trying to stop her.</p>
<p>You invaded with 23 flower fairies while the beautiful girl came empty-handed. You are quite a threat.&quot; Heay was on the verge of tears. Brother Lin Shiao. That&#x27;s because Zay May wasn&#x27;t capable enough. Her troops were all killed by Xiao Datang and the others.</p>
<p>I had 100 flower fairies protecting me as I escaped. And this is all that&#x27;s left. 100 flower fairies. One recruitment token gives you 10 flower fairies. So Heay didn&#x27;t bring anything with him into the battlefield of the myriad races except for 100 flower fairies.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha glanced at heay&#x27;s thick dark circles and thought to himself that this kid was just like a time management master. He could handle 100 flower fairies. He wouldn&#x27;t even need makeup to play the empty prince. Tu Shan by Chin said, &quot;Brother Lin Sha, we didn&#x27;t do it on purpose. I was attacked by Xiao Datong before my guard captain died.</p>
<p>He told me to run north. On my way to escape, I met Heay who was also attacked. So we escaped here. Little sister didn&#x27;t invade. Please don&#x27;t punish Little Sister.</p>
<p>Punishment. Yao Yao wants punishment. The flower fairy whispered. Soldering immediately glared at them and the flower fairies shut their mouths. Lyn Shiao shook his head and looked at Chun Ningming.</p>
<p>What about you? Tell me about your experience. Chun Ningming was a thin and gloomy man among the lords who entered the battlefield of 10,000 races. He was considered young. His facial features were very deep, but his brows looked very gloomy. Am I a prisoner, too? You are not.</p>
<p>But I saved you, so I need to get to know you. Shuning Ming, a new lord, level five lord talent is graceful liberation, had two squads of ordinary militia and one squad of peasants, all of whom were killed in action. My territory was breached by monsters, and it turned out that it was another new lord in disguise. I was seriously injured and almost died when the god system announced the death of another lord. The lord who attacked me thought I was dead.</p>
<p>So he went to plunder my resources. I waited for them to leave, intending to follow them and expose their true colors. But I fainted on the way and ended up here. Chun Ningming didn&#x27;t waste any words, revealing his experiences, current condition, and even his lordly talent, which surprised Lin Sha and the others. This person was one of the nearby lords he saw when he opened his divine perspective.</p>
<p>He was already unconscious at the time, but his limbs were still crawling involuntarily. When Lyn Sha saw that this person had such a tenacious will to live, he felt compassion and helped him up. Whether he lived or died was up to fate. You were attacked and are on your last breath. Yet you still want to track them down.</p>
<p>Lynch asked, &quot;Yes, we must avenge every wrong. Even if I die, I will drag them down with me. He&#x27;s ruthless. Everyone thought this was the unanimous assessment. You don&#x27;t need to fight anymore.</p>
<p>The lords who attacked were Xiao Datang and Gene Dang, and they have already been killed by our boss, Lin Shiao,&quot; he said with a touch of emotion. &quot;All right, I&#x27;ll remember this favor.&quot; After saying that, Shan Ningming shut his mouth and sat on the ground without moving with only wisps of green light constantly seeping into his body. Lin Shiao gave Chun Ningming a deep look, then addressed the crowd in a loud voice. I won&#x27;t waste any more words. I am neither a bloodthirsty person nor a weakling.</p>
<p>He a Tu Shan by Chiian. Your territory has been breached. Your men have been wiped out. You have mistakenly trespassed on my territory and you have even leaked my information. Lyn Sha stared at the two of them.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll give you two choices. One is to accept the punishment and then sign a confidentiality agreement with me in the god system, promising not to reveal a single word about me here. In the other, I&#x27;ll let you go. These two have already met the archers with divine crossbows, the iron guards with long swords, pay men and ba. This information must not be revealed.</p>
<p>Punishment. Punishment. Yao Yao needs to be punished. The flower fairy started chattering again. My dear sisters, please stop talking.</p>
<p>Heay immediately turned around and shouted to stop them. Lyn Sha felt a slight headache and continued. The second option is to become my vassel lord and sign a 6-month service contract. During this period, you will obey my orders and I have the right to use your resources. Is it the kind of vassel that the Lord has to give Yao Yao to whenever he wants? Stop talking.</p>
<p>I am your lord. He continued to suppress the flower demon. I choose the second one, a deep male voice said. Lynn Shiao turned his head in surprise. You can leave as long as you don&#x27;t expose my secret.</p>
<p>No, Chining Ming said, &quot;You saved me, so I should repay you. Besides, you were able to kill Ziao Daang and his men, so you must be very powerful. I want to become your vassel lord.&quot; Lyn Sha nodded and looked at Heay and Tu Shan by Chian. Those who know how to eat are heroes. He stammered.</p>
<p>I admire Lynn Shiao and am willing to follow him, so I choose the second option. Upon hearing the previous sentence, Lyn Sha was slightly taken aback and nodded. Little sister, I came here to seek refuge with boss Lynn. I chose the second option. When can you untie me? Tu Shan by Chin also said, &quot;Okay.&quot; Lyn Shao gestured for the phantom archer to untie everyone.</p>
<p>After everyone was untied, Lin Shaol looked up at the sky and said calmly, &quot;I&#x27;ll ask you one last time. You can still back out now. If you want to become my vassel lords, sign the contract directly. There&#x27;s nothing to regret.&quot; The three of them shook their heads, stepped forward, and signed their names under the standard contract of the god system. &quot;Very good,&quot; Lyn Sha smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Judging by the time, it&#x27;s about time.&quot; &quot;What do you mean about the same?&quot; Eay asked, somewhat curious. At this moment, the announcement from the main god system sounded. Ding. Serverwide announcement. Player Black Flame from the LN region has used a server-breaking talisman to launch an attack on player Lin Sha from the 89,757 newbie zone.</p>
<p>The server-breaking event will take place in 10 days. This is it. Chapter 53. Undercurrents and reactions from multiple parties. After Lin Sha shot and killed Gene Datong with an arrow in front of tens of thousands of people in the live broadcast room, it caused quite a stir not only in the 89757 newbie zone, but also in the long stable LN zone.</p>
<p>Just before the announcement of the district&#x27;s opening, inside a magnificent Gothic mansion, a man in a floral shirt leaned quietly against a large, comfortable sofa, his posture relaxed yet exuding the aura of a superior. Behind him stood a stunningly beautiful angel, her wings pure white, her long golden hair cascading down to her waist, radiating an aura of holiness. Even though the angel stood motionless by her side, the radiance she slowly released still filled the entire living room with bright light. Opposite the man in the floral shirt, a man dressed in black sat respectfully. He was the masked man who had spoken with Lin Shao earlier.</p>
<p>He was not wearing a mask at the moment, revealing a face with a thick beard and a hooked nose. So that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve seen? Yes, sir. Although Gene Duchang is just an insignificant member of our collateral branch, he still has a connection with the Gene family of Jang Bay. Lynn Sha in front of tens of thousands of people ignored my warnings and the Gene family patriarch and shot Gene Duchang dead. If we don&#x27;t retaliate for this, people in the underworld will laugh at us.</p>
<p>The man in the floral shirt chuckled. This newbie has some guts. Not even putting you. Who&#x27;s ranked 100th in the official zone? In his eyes. Sir, it&#x27;s the top 100.</p>
<p>The hook-nosed man said with utmost respect. The man in the floral shirt waved his hand, not wanting to dwell on the topic, and after a moment&#x27;s thought, said, &quot;You&#x27;ve been heavily involved with highranking figures in Japan lately, and that woman from Lsha domain is keeping a close eye on you. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll do. You personally select someone to handle this matter. Make sure you choose someone capable enough and have them lead enough troops and equipment to completely crush that kid.</p>
<p>Let all the newbies in the beginner zone know the consequences of offending a pro in the official zone. Yes, sir. My lord, I have a choice. Black flame. Dealing with that brat is a sure thing.</p>
<p>But but what? The man in the floral shirt asked, his voice trailing off. But the troops under my command can&#x27;t demonstrate the abilities of our noble faction. Huh? You little rascal. I knew you&#x27;d make it. So tell me, what kind of unit do you want? The man with the hooked nose chuckled and said humbly, &quot;Sir, that kid has a team of phantom archers and a team of enhanced phantom archers, the Guggist archers, which is why he was able to strike first and easily defeat Gene Dang and his group.</p>
<p>The Phantom Archers are strongest in rapid fire and long range shooting, making them difficult for most unit types to deal with. The men I send out with a full complement of units will definitely win, but there may be losses. I would like to borrow two units of epic troops from you, sir. The ace unit of the British Empire, the British Long Bowman. In this way, Black Flame can crush Lin Shia without taking any damage.</p>
<p>This battle will show our might. Let everyone know that the dignity of our noble lineage cannot be challenged. Having said that, the man with the hooked nose looked at the man in the floral shirt with a burning gaze and an excited expression. He unexpectedly the man in the floral shirt laughed. Wong Su, you&#x27;re still a bit lacking.</p>
<p>The man with the hooked nose paused, then continued. Don&#x27;t you guys remember that Lin Sha was the first hero recruited this year? What reward did the God of War give him? A beautiful heroine, but no one has ever seen one. What&#x27;s so special about such a pretty face? No matter how beautiful she is, can she compare to the angels under your command, sir? Madness, the man in the floral shirt shouted, startling the man with the hooked nose, who immediately sat up straight. Which year&#x27;s top player in the entire region doesn&#x27;t receive an epic treasure chest as a reward? Didn&#x27;t this regionwide announcement mention that? Gust Archer. Gust Archer practicing archery while wearing overalls.</p>
<p>You actually believe that nonsense? Lynn Shia has only been in the battlefield of 10,000 races for a short time. Yet, he&#x27;s been training phantom archers for 2 and 1/2 years. Do you think 2 and 1/2 years can be passed by just singing and dancing? The man with the hooked nose broke out in a cold sweat, then suddenly realized something. What does the master mean? Those so-called gust archers are the units that Lynn Sha recruited using epic recruitment tokens obtained from opening epic treasure chests. They are epic units.</p>
<p>With a loud bang, the hook-nosed man felt a jolt in his brain and his whole body stood frozen and swayed. So that&#x27;s how it is. No wonder those archers were so powerful. They were actually epic units. I the adult seeing that the man with the hooked nose had realized what was happening.</p>
<p>The man in the floral shirt didn&#x27;t say anything more and continued. Don&#x27;t get cocky just because you&#x27;ve made it into the top 100 and forgotten the most basic rules and knowledge. You still have a lot to learn. Upon hearing that he was ranked 100th on the list, the man with the hooked nose seemed to have something to say. But seeing the cold look in the man&#x27;s eyes, he held back and lowered his head.</p>
<p>You said you wanted to equip Black Flame with the undying Longbow Bowman, and I agree. The man in the floral shirt said, &quot;I&#x27;ll lend you two squads of undying long bowman. Perfect counters to phantom archers so the newbies in the beginner zone can see what the longest range really is. In addition, I will lend you a legendary gold unit with the hooked nose suddenly looked up, utterly astonished. This legendary golden unit is rare even for the man before him.</p>
<p>Even among the top 10 experts in the region, they all treat it like a treasure. yet he&#x27;s willing to lend it to me. In this battle, I&#x27;ll crush this arrogant brat before he comes to see me. In the 9527 newbie zone, a stunningly beautiful, aloof, long-haired woman also heard the announcement of the condemnation issued throughout the entire zone. 10 days.</p>
<p>I never sensed such a murderous aura from him when we were in school. The solitary woman muttered to herself. Lyn Shia is a smart man. Even though he knew the consequences, he still did it. So what exactly gives him his confidence? The aloof woman waved her hand and a dashing female soldier immediately stepped forward.</p>
<p>Mississippi. Two things. First, investigate the strength of this black flame and is backing. The more detailed, the better. Yes, Mississippi.</p>
<p>Second, go ask Marlinia if the crimson corruption on her body has been suppressed. If it&#x27;s gone, we can go kill some monsters now. This time, I don&#x27;t want to come in second place again. After answering, the female soldier hesitated and said, &quot;Miss, every minute and every second is extremely important. Since you are aiming for first place in the second tier university entrance exam, why help the man who took first place from you in the first tier university entrance exam?&quot; The aloof woman turned her head and looked at the female soldier calmly.</p>
<p>I want to win against him fair and square. No one but me will do. Furthermore, if you ask me this kind of question again, I&#x27;ll punish you by making you stand guard for a month. Yes, miss. The female soldier shrank back, not daring to say anything more.</p>
<p>At the same time, the announcement of the district&#x27;s expansion resounded throughout the Lon district. Some people gloated, some sighed inwardly, and some acted as if nothing had happened, keeping quiet about it. Chu Yusi, the city lord of Jangdong city, seemed quite surprised after hearing the announcement from the god system. He quickly found someone and asked them the reason. Slowly, Chu Yusi&#x27;s expression changed from surprise to confusion and then from confusion to anger.</p>
<p>Chufinga, you little red-haired monster. Didn&#x27;t I tell you to keep a close eye on Lyn Shia and help him properly? How could you let him act so recklessly and now he&#x27;s brought retaliation upon himself? Wouldn&#x27;t you be eager to do something that would attract so much hatred? Huh? You brat. Answer the phone now. Chapter 54. The abilities of Tu Shan by Chian Heay and Shin Ningming.</p>
<p>Back to Lin Xiao&#x27;s side. The announcement of the server breaking was heard. He&#x27;s expression slowly changed from questioning to astonishment. I feel like I&#x27;ve been scammed. No wonder Lin Shia asked the three of them a second time before quickly signing the contract.</p>
<p>He was afraid they would back out. idiot. Seeing Heay&#x27;s expression, Tu Shan by Chian rolled her eyes. Lin Shiao killed Xiao Daong and Gene Dang in front of tens of thousands of people in the live broadcast room, which slapped the face of that top 100 official district lord. He will definitely suffer retaliation.</p>
<p>Revenge is fine. Xiao Datang and the others are dead, which is perfect for dealing with their backers. My sister joined Lin Xiao&#x27;s gang partly out of revenge. He was somewhat surprised. You&#x27;re not stupid anymore, beautiful girl.</p>
<p>Tan by Chin said, &quot;People are never stupid when it comes to strategy.&quot; Okay, so it also exposed Lin Xiaos troop strength. I&#x27;ve been wrongly accused and I&#x27;m so angry. Tu Shan by Chin said agrievedly. Sigh. It&#x27;s because of you that my luck has run out.</p>
<p>He could only shake his head. Now that I&#x27;m already on board, I have nothing left to lose, so I&#x27;ll just follow boss Lin Shiao. Shan Ningming remained silent and unresponsive, as if the announcement had nothing to do with him. His expression remained gloomy, yet he exuded a menacing aura, fearless and undeterred, like someone with nothing to lose. Lynn Shiao asked curiously, &quot;What&#x27;s your reason for having a partner?&quot; &quot;Beautiful lady.</p>
<p>My other half,&quot; he This is it. Tu Shan by Chian immediately rushed over and hugged Baoi, who had been standing quietly beside Lin Shao. Huh? Ba didn&#x27;t even have time to react before she was suddenly embraced by a cute little girl in a white Lolita dress. Sister smells so good. Wow, sister is so wellendowed.</p>
<p>Before Tan by Chin could finish speaking, Lyn Sha grabbed her ear and pulled her away. Unexpectedly, this beautiful girl actually developed feelings for him. But it seems that her feelings weren&#x27;t directed at him. So, does this mean I&#x27;m going to have to compete with women for women? Lynn Shiao shook his head inwardly, dispelling his unfounded speculation. Behave yourself, pretty girl.</p>
<p>Tell me what lordly talents you and he a possess. Lyn Sha gave the orders, and the troops immediately dispersed to take up their posts, leaving only the lord and the hero nearby. Now that you have become my vassel lords and pledged your allegiance to me, we should share some information so that we can work together to deal with the official district lords who have broken into our territory. However, you don&#x27;t need to worry too much. The target is me, and they won&#x27;t kill you.</p>
<p>If I die, our contract will be void, and you will be free. But if anyone betrays me during my time as my vassal lord, their fate will be the same as Xiao Datangs. Lin Xiaos face darkened and Hay and Tu Shawn by Chian immediately recalled the terror of being dominated by Guster Archer in the live broadcast room. Immediately the three of them turned serious. They knew that Lynn Shia never hesitated to kill.</p>
<p>My lord talent is beast transformation to Shan by Chin replied a B-level talent which allows one to transform into a white fox demon. When transformed into a fox demon, movement speed increases by 100%. Also, due to the special nature of the demon beast, one can pass through monster occupied areas and see through the fog of war without arousing the hostility of most wild monsters. &quot;His perfect scout talent is a compliment to my god-like perspective,&quot; Lin Sha thought to himself. &quot;I just don&#x27;t know if Tu Shan by Chan is smart enough.</p>
<p>She was provoked in the live broadcast and spilled almost everything. He&#x27;s a my lord talent is flower fairy, a seale talent and also a family inheritance talent. In the battlefield of the myriad races, some families inherit talents, some strong and some weak. Those who encounter strong family talents are certainly lucky to be born into a good family. But those who encounter weak talents can&#x27;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>They are born that way and have no choice. He&#x27;s talent is sea level, so he probably isn&#x27;t very strong. Tan by Chin suddenly realized why the school boy in the school uniform had brought 100 flower fairies into the battlefield and why they were all so loyal. I can boost the flower fair&#x27;s combat power and health, and I can also develop some of their special abilities. Heay paused a little embarrassedly.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha glanced indifferently at Heizays dark circles under his eyes. He wondered if the special function developed was the one that caused Heizay&#x27;s dark circles. It&#x27;s just that my level is too low, so I can&#x27;t unlock many functions yet, and the bonus to the flower fairy isn&#x27;t high enough. Currently, it only increases the flower fairy strength by about 10%, which is why I got beaten up by Xiao Daong and the others. Len Shia nodded, then looked at Chuning Ming.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of your talent name before. Is it a new talent? Lord talents are unique to people in this world. Every year all sorts of new talents appear. So it&#x27;s not surprising that people are unaware of them. Graceful liberation.</p>
<p>This is the name of the talent that the main god system told me after I entered the battlefield. Shuning said, &quot;When I took the lord&#x27;s talent test, the test stone tablet only flashed with light representing a sea level talent. There was no other information.&quot; After saying that, Shin Ningming directly displayed the description panel of the graceful liberation skill for Lin Shiao and the other lords to view. Granted liberation rating C. Explanation: When the Lord attacks, there is a 0.1% chance to deal 100 times the damage to the enemy, but it must hit to take effect.</p>
<p>It ignores magic immunity, defense reduction, and shields. Note, critical strike potions, other lords critical strike auras, critical strike skills, and critical strike equipment bonuses only apply to normal critical strikes and do not apply to critical strikes from graceful liberation. All three lords were stunned by this skill. First, it ignores magic immunity, ignores defense reduction, and ignores shields. Three ignores, which is the standard A-level skill template.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s more, it also deals 100 times the damage. It&#x27;s practically at the threshold of an S-Ele skill, but upon closer inspection, the trigger probability is only 0.1%, which is an extremely low one in a,000. Imagine you have to slash the enemy a,000 times to trigger 100fold damage, which translates to a, 100 slashes, but only increases your combat power by 10%. Besides, who can fight you for a thousand rounds in exchange a thousand blows? No wonder the god system only gave this talent skill a C rating. He and two Shan by Chin both side in unison.</p>
<p>The talent is great, but the chances of it happening are too low. Shan Ningming was clearly aware of his talent deficiency, so he didn&#x27;t make any large movements and just stood there quietly without saying a word. Critical strike potions didn&#x27;t work and neither did the break the boats skill infused with Xiang Yus heroic spirit. Lyn Shao pondered silently for a while but couldn&#x27;t come up with a good solution. This time he recruited three followers.</p>
<p>Only two Shawn by Chen a B rank is barely worth mentioning. The other two, both C rank seemed to be just bystanders in the battlefield of 10,000 races. Indeed, if they hadn&#x27;t encountered him, they would all be dead. But it doesn&#x27;t matter. The main reason for recruiting followers is for resources.</p>
<p>All I need is someone to help me secure resources because I&#x27;m about to face the challenge from the official server. To prevent anyone from having poor grades, Lynn Shia changed the subject. I&#x27;ll reiterate the rules for breaking through districts so you can prepare for what I&#x27;m going to ask you to do next. The group fell silent. So Lynn Shiao, the big boss, had even remembered such a rule.</p>
<p>Breakthrough zone conquest newbie zone. To prevent overly evil newbie lords from wreaking havoc in the newbie zone and causing irreversible damage, the god system has established a rule that allows official server lords to enter the newbie zone and engage in raids after paying a certain price. At any given time, only one person can participate in a raid against a particular newbie lord. Due to the limitations of the underlying rules, the lord level in the official server will be suppressed to the highest level that can be accommodated in the newbie area, which is level 30. In the official server, a lord can only bring a maximum of three heroes, and the hero level is also suppressed to level 30.</p>
<p>In the official server, lords can only use skills, equipment, items, etc. that are available in the beginner zone. The official servers lord will arrive in the new server, which will take 10 days. In the official server, lords cannot build structures in the newbie zone and will return immediately after completing a raid. The maximum number of troops a lord can bring in the official server.</p>
<p>1,000 people. Chapter 55. A complete inventory of all resources. Lynn Shiao had long since memorized all the rules big and small of the battlefield of the myriad races vying for supremacy. After Chufunga reminded him and he realized that Xiao Desang and Gene Datong were mortal enemies with him, he had deduced the worst possible outcome.</p>
<p>It means that skilled players from the official server have broken into the game and are coming to attack me. The highest level for the lord&#x27;s mansion in the beginner area is level three, which corresponds to level 30 for the lord, the hero, and all wild monsters. When a normal person recruits one hero, the other party will at most bring three level 30 heroes. 1,000 troops, enough to deal with 10 mo Iron Guards, 10 divine arm archers, and 42 phantom archers. But no matter how many regions you conquer, it will still take 10 days.</p>
<p>These 10 days are enough for me to get a lot done. Tier one allows you to build farmhouses and recruit farmers. Tier 2 allows you to build barracks and recruit your existing troops. You can also build hero specific buildings and equip your hero with their own unique troops. With just three books, you can build stables to produce war horses and barracks can produce cavalry.</p>
<p>Resources. We need a lot of resources to produce these units with the bonuses from eternal peace. peace 100% increase in construction upgrade and production speed of all buildings plus 100 defense of all city defense systems and eternal peace conflict 20% increase in attributes and abilities of all troop types divine beasts and heroes plus 20% increase in loyalty of all troop types divine beasts and heroes plus 100% increase in troop production you can quickly produce troops but you will need more resources Besides the difference in the number of troop types, the difference in the level of one&#x27;s own side is also a big problem. This also requires a huge amount of experience. In short, the solution to this problem is to overcome force with force, leaving no room for shortcuts.</p>
<p>In previous years, there have been countless cases of novice lords being attacked and subjugated by established lords, with very few novice lords emerging victorious. But those who did win invariably became powerful overlords or formidable villains. I entered the battlefield with the goal of becoming number one in the newbie zone, then entering the official zone and even the dragon summer domain and blue star realm to achieve great things. How can I be afraid and lose my edge just because some petty people are blocking my way? Therefore, Lynn Xiaos choice to confront the invasion head-on can be seen as a testament to the backbone of the Chinese people he has cultivated in both his previous lives. First, resources.</p>
<p>Second, experience. These are the things I need most urgently. Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;In my memory palace, I have only occupied less than onetenth of the resources in my entire Calabash mountain range. Hi, Tu Shan by Chian and Chun Ningming are all my neighbors. Taking them as vassal lords can not only protect my territory, provide early warnings, and ensure safety, but also help me occupy and exploit resources.</p>
<p>As for experience, go all out and grind monsters. No need to overthink it. Let&#x27;s get started. Lyn Shia immediately opened his resource panel and carefully reviewed all his resources. Having survived the S level demonic tide and having sent out heroes and troops to kill monsters and then killed Xiao Datang and Gene Dang, gaining some spoils of war, his resources are now vastly different from what they used to be.</p>
<p>Lords all resources panel experience 9,654,100, nearly 2 million from the Demon Tide settlement, plus several million experience from the Demon Tide itself. Gold coins 139,864. Baoi smile cost over 10,000. Ziao Datang and Gene Dang won over 20,000. And the Demon Tide settlement yielded over 60,000.</p>
<p>Excellent treasure chest five rare treasure chests. Three excellent treasure chest three epic chests. Zero legendary treasure chest zero items purple excellent quality defense charm. One fine quality spirit field one common quality leader charm two green fine quality recruitment charm three green fine quality hero token one blue rare quality hero token one epic quality recruitment charm one teleportation charm two gold legendary hashu building blueprint one now hero recruitment for tier 2 and tier three heroes is available with hero tokens but recruitment tokens and civic tokens are relatively scarce and in high demand And in the newbie zone, equipment, black long sword, rare weapon on auction. Malay sword, highquality weapon.</p>
<p>Black wind axe, rare weapon. Critical strike bow, rare weapon equipped by soldering. Dance of fine snow, rare weapon equipped by Pay Min. Horse slaying saber, rare weapon equipped by Tang Yi. Life amulet, superior equipment.</p>
<p>Demon suppressing shield, superior equipment. Scale rock shoulder pads, scale rock breastplate, scale rock belt, scale rock leggings, purple excellent set for fifths complete. Knight&#x27;s lance lilac epic weapon. Falian epic weapon. Forest witch&#x27;s cloak special epic equipment.</p>
<p>Ba is wearing it. Bold text can be removed. Special Battlefield of all races energy 6200. 1,000 was consumed when using the celestial perspective. Resources: Timber 35740, stone 29542, iron or 13532, copper or 1 9730, silver or 3854, refined iron 3951, refined copper 5187, gold or 370, sulfur 250, gemstone or 150 food 5,320 units of superior spirit rice, 550 units of lava giant lizard, 150 units of wild beef, and 300 units of flame ram.</p>
<p>These are all of Linhao&#x27;s resources. Also, regarding levels, I am level 10. He did a quick calculation. The current 41 phantom archers are level 11. Saulin is one level higher.</p>
<p>The nine iron guards of the Mod Dao are level six. Tang Yi is one level higher. And the nine divine archers are level five. S Ruer is one level higher. Upgrading these troop types to level 30 would probably require a massive amount of experience and 10 days might not be enough.</p>
<p>Some choices must be made. If everything goes smoothly during this period, some new units will be recruited and those units will also need to be upgraded. As for the two heroes, Ba is level one and Pay Min is also level one. Pay Min, who is gazing at him with a sorrowful expression. It seems that I have sent out Pay Min, the legendary hero of the Tang Dynasty and a level one swordsman to wipe out the gathering points of various level 30 epic creatures.</p>
<p>Reckless? That&#x27;s incredibly reckless. After the demon tide, Payman could have leveled up to at least level 10 in one go. Reckless as to challenge a level 30 opponent. Only a hero like Pay Min, who specializes in attack power, would dare to do it. Lynn Sha hurriedly walked towards pay men only to see that his blue robe was stained with blood stains and his dance of fine snow aura was also filled with blood but his overall spirit and temperament were still quite good.</p>
<p>Pay men were you injured in the battle with the nest demon? Lyn Sha asked earnestly reporting to my lord I am unharmed. The ice attribute attack dance of fine snow given by you is precisely what counters the nest demon. Next time it would be better if you, my lord, let me level up a few times. H, he and Tan by Chin gasped. They knew about the nest demon.</p>
<p>The lowest level 30 epic monsters were boss level monsters in the beginner area. This hero of Lin Sha named Pay Min dares to face a level 30 nest demon monster. And judging from his tone, it seems he even won. What kind of hero is Pay Min? The two exchanged a glance, both secretly glad that they had decisively sided with boss Lyn Sha. This Lin Shia is unfathomable.</p>
<p>The female hero is as beautiful as a flower, and the male hero is invincible. I&#x27;ll level everyone up in a bit before we go out to farm monsters. Lyn Sha could only chuckle in response for supremacy among all races. Only lords can upgrade their subordinates, which is indeed somewhat inconvenient. By the way, my lord, after I killed the nest demon lord, this is one of these things.</p>
<p>Payman was 29 levels higher than the level cap, and he also obtained the most items. Most of the talismans were dropped by Pay Min. Payman took out separately. Normally, the items that dropped just flashed with white light and flew into the lord&#x27;s warehouse. Payman reached out and took out a miniature version of the monster.</p>
<p>The monster was entirely red, writhing in his hand like a jellyfish. Chapter 56. Mini nest demon. Legendary spirit field. This is a mini version of a nest demon.</p>
<p>Mini nest demon. Race demon. Level one. Quality epic. Attributes.</p>
<p>Strength 25, spirit 15, constitution 25, soul 15. Combat power rating 20 stars. skills, regeneration, infection, flame immunity, reproduction. Note: Nest demon cubs can grow by feeding them large amounts of flesh and blood. Lyn Sha was taken aback after slaughtering all the nest demon lords.</p>
<p>A small nest demon actually dropped. In Lyn Xiao&#x27;s memory, there were no nest demon nests in the newbie zone that allowed him to recruit nest demons once he captured them. Otherwise, he would have really wanted to recruit a few to fight against the upcoming official zone lord. But what&#x27;s with this little nest demon? It actually looks kind of cute. The little nest demon bounced and swayed in Payman&#x27;s hands, but showed no aggression, perhaps because it was intimidated by the murderous aura emanating from Pay Min.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha shook his head helplessly and said, &quot;Since it wasn&#x27;t directly put into the god&#x27;s warehouse, it&#x27;s a special item. Seeing how much this little guy likes to follow you. Pay Min, you can keep it for now. Pay Min didn&#x27;t mince words and chuckled in agreement. Lynn Sha turned to Hi, Tu Shan by Chian and Chun Ningming and said, &quot;Your territory has been almost completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Now that you have become my vassal lords, I have an obligation to help you rise again. I also have two ordinary quality leader tokens, three green excellent quality recruit tokens, and two weapons dropped by Xiao Daong and Gene Dang, a Malay sword and a Black Wind axe. Each of you will receive one citizenship token and one recruitment token. Whoever doesn&#x27;t want the citizenship token will get a weapon and can exchange it for a citizenship token at the auction house. There are three vassal lords and Lyn Shiao can only divide them up in this way.</p>
<p>In fact, Linja&#x27;s other option was to keep the recruitment token for himself and use the Hasha summoning to turn it into a top tier Hasha recruitment token to summon Hasha troops. However, doing so would greatly slow down the recovery speed of the three people. Moreover, he could wait until the three people recovered, then give them the recruitment tokens and then summon Chinese soldiers. The three exchanged glances. He asked, &quot;Brother Lyn Sha, does your lord&#x27;s manner here have a healing function?&quot; Lynsha nodded.</p>
<p>His legendary lord&#x27;s manner had several functions, and healing was just one of them. Tu Shan by Chin and Chun Ningming immediately understood why Chun Ningming was seriously injured, but he has now visibly recovered a lot. It turns out that those wispy green lights were the healing effects of Lord Lin Xiao&#x27;s manner. He visibly breathed a sigh of relief. Brother Lynn Sha, give me a piece of spirit field, just a regular quality one, and put it in your territory.</p>
<p>This way, I won&#x27;t need the lord&#x27;s token and the recruitment token. My lord&#x27;s talent is flower fairy, and I&#x27;m best at using the flower fairy. Lynn Shia didn&#x27;t know what he wanted it for. But since he didn&#x27;t want farmers or soldiers, it would be easier for him to distribute them to the other two. So he reached out and gave Heay a piece of highquality spiritual land and a Malay sword dropped by Gene Data.</p>
<p>Heay was overjoyed and immediately left to go farming. Lyn Shao then gave Tu Sha by Chin an ordinary civilian talisman and two excellent soldier recruitment talismans and Shiningming an ordinary civilian talisman and an excellent soldier recruitment talisman. In addition to Ziao Datangs weapon, the Black Wind axe with her petite frame. Zay may really couldn&#x27;t wield the Black Wind axe. It would even hinder her agility.</p>
<p>Now that they had the resources to make a comeback, the two were eager to return to their territory and rebuild. Please wait here for a while and Shin Ningming can continue to heal for a period of time. I&#x27;ll give you something in a moment, then you can leave. After saying that, Lyn Shao walked into the Lord&#x27;s mansion. After receiving the gift, the two began to wander around Linia&#x27;s territory.</p>
<p>over here. Shufinga with his red hair led two teams of berserkers and just managed to kill the last monster in front of them. Phew. A B-ranked demonic tide is already quite difficult for me. I really don&#x27;t know how Lynn Shao managed to deal with that sky full of meteor fire rained demonic tide.</p>
<p>I wonder what level of demonic tide that fierce woman Dugu Jaolon was dealing with. This hall must have been pretty good. With a nonchalant smile, Shufinga slowly opened the resource panel, checked his resources, and then slowly opened the chat channel to see if he had missed any information recently. Gradually, his expression changed from relaxed to serious, and then from serious to a bitter face. Oh no, dad&#x27;s probably going to kill me now.</p>
<p>Chufinga switched to the communication channel and sure enough, saw dozens of missed calls and a message from Chui. You unfil son, come to me at once. Chin Ningming was a gloomy man who rarely spoke unless necessary. So Tu Shan by Chin chattered incessantly as she watched. Wow, Lyn Xiaos territory is huge.</p>
<p>What kind of Lord&#x27;s mansion can occupy such a large territory? Wow, Lyn Xiaos troops all look so cool. Not a single person even glanced at me. That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re not charming enough. Wow, boss Lin Shia already has several farmers building houses. Is he preparing to expand the population? Tu Shan by Chan rubbed her eyes and then saw several farmers tilling the land.</p>
<p>Why are Lyn Xiaos farmers so fast? I saw them swinging their hoes so fast they were almost blurry. Ridiculous. If a hoe can leave after images, then if I gave my talent to this farmer, wouldn&#x27;t he be able to kill a boss? Chin Ningming said dismissively. His powerful sounding but ultimately useless Lord talent is his eternal pain. There it is over there.</p>
<p>Chin Ningming looked in the direction Tu Shawn by Chin pointed. A few seconds later, he silently rubbed his eyes. Since Lin Sha built the legend farmhouse this morning, two legend farmers have been produced every hour, and now eight legend farmers have been produced. What the two saw was several legendary farmers cultivating the legendary farmland. This is a legendary farmer.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao had walked over unnoticed, holding three scrolls in his hand. he said calmly. Be more efficient at work. Upon seeing his farmers tending to the spirit field, Lin Sha immediately checked the attributes. Linken quality legendary output 126,000 units.</p>
<p>Time 12 2.4 hours. Special effect one. When consumed randomly increases one of the following attributes by two points, strength, spirit, body, or soul. This effect can only be applied once every 24 hours. Special effect two, when consumed, there is a very small chance to increase the user&#x27;s skill level up to a maximum of B level.</p>
<p>Special effect three, when consumed, there is a very small chance that it will increase the user&#x27;s lifespan and maintain a youthful appearance. Lyn Sha nodded secretly. Legend has it that the spirit rice is even better than the spirit fish in the epic pond. Not only does it add two attribute points when you eat it, but it also has a small chance to increase the lifespan and keep you young forever. With the legendary spirit field, the super fast production speed combined with my talent has meant that I haven&#x27;t had to worry about food shortages for some time now.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s practically a bug. Moreover, this legendary spirit rice when fed to troops and heroes can transform mediocre troops and heroes into powerful ones and can also increase lifespan and maintain appearance. No wonder the legendary spirit rice on the market can sell for exorbitant prices and is almost entirely monopolized by major forces in the official server and above. That&#x27;s why many season masters such as the rumored queen of dragon summer domain still look like young people and their ages are hard to guess. This can be considered one of the benefits of the battlefield where all races v for supremacy.</p>
<p>Although only the top management can enjoy it because of the legendary farmers. Each person can directly cultivate a plot of such spiritual land. At this moment, Tu Shan by Chin and Chin Ningming seemed quite uncomfortable. legendary farmer. Tu Shan by Chin and Chun Ningming exchanged a glance, both seeing the shock in each other&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>Could this be recruited by an F-ranked talent lord? Lyn Sha, as expected, is incredibly well hidden. I&#x27;ve made the right choice and following him. But to be told such a confidential matter like this, are we all knowing too much? If we leave Lin Xiao&#x27;s company, will we be silenced? Tu Shan by Chian immediately broke out in a cold sweat while Chun Ningming was somewhat better but still dared not move. Seeing their expressions, Lin Sha knew what they were thinking without even having to guess. It wasn&#x27;t that he revealed it randomly.</p>
<p>Rather, it was rumored that in his subsequent plans, the farmers would be sent to various places to mine resources and his subordinate lords would eventually find out. By the way, where&#x27;s he? Did he finish farming? He also got a share of these scrolls. Yes, yes, my little sister is also looking for Heay. Tu Shan by Chin immediately found a reason and hurriedly pulled Chun Ningming away. The charming cheers of the flower fairies could be heard and he shouted from afar, &quot;It&#x27;s done.&quot; His voice was filled with undisguised excitement.</p>
<p>Chapter 57. These flower fairies are all mine. It turned out that he and the flower fairies were arranging a spiritual field in front of them. The flower fairies scattered poisonous seeds which were originally intended to attack enemies, but now they all fell into the spirit field. The fine spiritual field was emitting faint green light, and many plants that no one recognized were growing inside.</p>
<p>These plants absorbed the spiritual energy contained in the spiritual field while extending their roots to devour the seeds sewn by the flower fairies. Then these plants grew wildly, quickly, reaching about the height of a person and even sprouting huge flower buds. The giant flower swayed from side to side, and he and the flower fairy shouted excitedly at that moment. Lyn Sha led Tu Shan by Chin and Chuning Ming closer and saw that the entire spirit field was full of huge plants, and the flower buds on the plants beat rhythmically like a human heart. Master Lynsha, he was delighted to see Lyn Sha arrive.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve come at the perfect time. Thanks to your spirit field, I&#x27;ve successfully grown a flower fairy. Lyn Shia had a premonition that a flower fairy was being grown. But he never expected that this kid was actually growing a flower fairy. The knowledge I learned in class was that flower fairies were produced in wild nests or in the fairy forest.</p>
<p>I had never actually grown a flower fairy. I understand. So, this is how flower fairies are grown. Tan by Chin exclaimed. No wonder you don&#x27;t need recruitment tokens anymore.</p>
<p>You can produce flower fairies endlessly just by using your spirit fields. Is it an ability inherited from your family? Lynsha asked. He Lyn Shiao is truly amazing. He saw right through her at a glance. What does this pretty girl know? He laughed.</p>
<p>In the entire Dragon Sa Kingdom, only our family&#x27;s flower fairies are cultivated. Other family&#x27;s flower fairies are either wild or recruited, unlike ours. As he spoke, Heay straightened his hair and stood upright in front of Ling Tion. Underneath his school uniform, he actually had a fairly handsome face, though his dark circles marred some of his good looks. The enormous plants had stopped growing while the flower buds grew larger and larger, throbbing faster and faster.</p>
<p>With a tearing sound, a flower bud that had swelled to its fullest extent made a sound, and a pair of slender hands reached out from inside. Then the petals were torn open and a beautiful and alluring elf&#x27;s head emerged. The first thing she saw was he standing in front of her smiling. He he lord I knew you were all right. The newborn flower fairy broke free of the petals and emerged completely from the bud.</p>
<p>She was now the same size as the other flower fairies. She shook her fairy wings and flew to Heay. My lord, those red-skinned monsters were terrifying. Thankfully, you are safe and sound. My lord, didn&#x27;t I ask you to forget about me? You still insist on cultivating me.</p>
<p>So, what should I be called? Your name is Yao Yao, Heay said with a smile, his expression calm. The sound of flowers being torn apart echoed, and one flower fairy after another emerged. Does my lord remember my name? Your name is Yao Yao. Wow, Lord Yao Yao still remembers Yaoya. Yao Yao is so touched.</p>
<p>My lord, I killed a wild boar during the battle. Haven&#x27;t you forgotten me? Of course, I haven&#x27;t forgotten. You&#x27;re my little devil. What about me? Yao Yao, I miss you so much. And what about me, my lord? You&#x27;re Yao Yao.</p>
<p>With a warm, gentle smile, he responded earnestly and sincerely to each of the flower fairies. Lin Shiao, Tu Shan by Chien, and Chun Ningming stood blankly behind them like wooden figures. Looking at Heay&#x27;s deep dark circles and slender build, combined with his smile that could captivate any girl, Lin Sha couldn&#x27;t help but feel a pang of emotion. This works. In other words, the time management master didn&#x27;t come into this world.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he would probably have deeply understood a principle. I&#x27;m not a jerk. I just want to give every girl a home, and I have the ability to do so. The three of them watched quietly as he welcomed each newborn flower fairy until all the buds matured and burst open. Then, smiling, he turned around with a multitude of flower fairies and bowed to Lyn Sha.</p>
<p>This is boss Lyn Sha. He&#x27;s my lord. You should call him Lord. A large group of flower fairies immediately bowed gracefully and respectfully said, &quot;My lord. A sound suddenly came from behind Lyn Shao.</p>
<p>It turned out that Chun Ningming had coughed up blood from his nose. It turns out that those newborn flower fairies had just emerged from the flower buds and were completely naked. Such a large group of flower fairies bowing in unison is a sight to behold. What young spirited man could possibly resist such a sight? Fairies, hurry up and put on your clothes. He immediately understood.</p>
<p>waved for the flower fairies to leave and then explained helplessly to the group. We&#x27;re so used to seeing this that we&#x27;ve forgotten about it. Lin Shiao/chining Ming to Shan by Chian. Shameless. While the flower fairies flew back to their spawn point to find plants to cover themselves, Lin Sha asked, &quot;These flower fairies are the ones you use to self-destruct and stop the attack.</p>
<p>Are they still alive?&quot; Eay said with some pride. As long as there is one flower fairy left in our family, we can keep growing more from the spirit field. But it must be a spirit field with the function of healing. Originally, I plan to have my family replant them after returning to the real world. But I didn&#x27;t expect that boss Linhao&#x27;s territory would have healing effects.</p>
<p>So, this is a perfect way to make up for it. So, you only brought one type of unit, the flower fairy, for all 10 slots. reporting to my lord. Yao Yao is a domesticated flower fairy. She&#x27;s not only an excellent soldier, but she can also be an excellent farmer.</p>
<p>A flower fairy dressed in clothes flew over with a grin and answered, &quot;Yes, no wonder these flower fairies are so unruly. Their previous statements were so outrageous. It turns out they&#x27;re not afraid of death. They can grow back after they die. No wonder Heay wasn&#x27;t saddened at all when he made the flower demon self-destruct.</p>
<p>Moreover, the flower fairies raised by Hizay&#x27;s family are a group that are both soldiers and farmers. Judging from this, Heay&#x27;s lordly talent seems to have some potential, and he may be able to develop further in the future. By the way, he can your spirit field keep producing flower fairies. Brother Lyn Shia, I only have 10 citizen leadership tokens. The ones I&#x27;ve grown are all the 100 flower fairies I already had.</p>
<p>If I want new flower fairies, I&#x27;ll have to recruit them using recruitment tokens or citizen leadership tokens. Before he could finish speaking, Lyn Sha reached out and handed his three green highquality citizen tokens. He was stunned. No one&#x27;s selling recruitment tokens. I just snapped up all the highquality leader tokens at the auction house.</p>
<p>Keep planting flower fairies for me. I need them. Lynn Shiao said in a deep voice. Oh, I understand. Tu Shan by Chien standing to the side suddenly realized he&#x27;s flower fairies can serve as soldiers or farmers and they can even revive after dying.</p>
<p>Using them to scout, farm, and occupy wild mineral veins will be extremely efficient. You won&#x27;t even need to wait for farmers to come from your territory. He suddenly realized that upper level lords could use the troops of subordinate lords. Yes, boss Lyn Shao, I&#x27;ll go plant flower fairies right away. I guarantee I&#x27;ll plant 30 flower fairies for you as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>No, Lyn Sha said in a deep voice. The three recruitment tokens are for you to plant, and all 100 of your flower fairies are under my control. He&#x27;s a huh chapter 58 upgrade. The Imperial spirit possesses him. Within Lyn Xiaos territory, Lynn Shiao had lunch with the three subordinate lords and his two heroes before seeing them off.</p>
<p>All three of them were holding the scrolls that Lynn Shiao had given them. That was a map drawn by Lin Shiao using his own memories, a map he saw from the perspective of a god. The map encompasses the main terrain and major roads within a radius of nearly a thousand km centered on Lynch and marks important locations and dangerous wild animals. The main problem is that the area is too vast, making it unrealistic to create a detailed map. Lyn Shao could only mark key areas.</p>
<p>Of course, Lynsha did not draw any of the areas inside the Calabash Mountains. In his eyes, this place had long been his own private domain, and he would not allow anyone else to encroach upon it. Even so, when the three maps were handed to the group, everyone was still stunned. First came the powerful and mysterious Gust Archer, then the towering armored soldier, and finally the mysterious hero who could fight the nest demon alone, and the golden peasant. There is still a map covering nearly a thousand square kilm.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the mysterious number one genius of Jang Dong, Lin Shia, who is a useless person with an F-level lord talent, must have more hidden trump cards and must be a low-key big shot. The beautiful girl even imagined a melodramatic story where Lynn Shiao had to deliberately bury his talent and hide in the battlefield of the myriad races to avoid his persistent and unruly female rival. Overall, all of them achieved good results. The beautiful two Shan by Chian obtained a civilian token and two excellent recruitment tokens. Chun Ningming also obtained a civilian token and an excellent recruitment token and also acquired the rare weapon black wind axe and recovered from his injuries.</p>
<p>Even Heay didn&#x27;t come away empty-handed. He acquired a Malay sword, a piece of fine farmland, and 30 new flower fairies, which was better than when he had come in a sorry state with only 23 flower fairies. Although all the flower fairies are named Yao Yao, the group then left with the tasks assigned by Lin Shiao. give any recruitment tokens of any quality that dropped to Lyn Shia immediately. He can have as many as he wants.</p>
<p>After the others left, Lyn Shiao summoned all the troops and heroes and after calculations quickly upgraded all the heroes and troops. Without a doubt, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s strongest combat force at present, the great Tang Sword Saint Pay Min was directly upgraded by 10 levels. With a flash of light, the wandering swordsman holding the dance of fine snow and looking like a carefree rogue completed his level up. Sword Saint Payman race human. Quality golden legend.</p>
<p>Level 10. Attributes strength 108 + 22. Spirit 113 + 23. Constitution 75 + 15 soul 65 + 13. skills.</p>
<p>Sacrifice to break through illusions, Srank. Sword mastery, Srank. Sword of all things, a sword from the east. Sword dance, sword aura, a rank. Ultimate path, lord of 10,000 swords.</p>
<p>Combat power rating 110 stars. Exclusive unit type, ranger. I thank you, my lord. From this moment on, I am confident that I can defeat any enemy here. Pay Min bowed to express his gratitude, and Lyn Sha nodded and accepted it graciously while pondering Pay Min&#x27;s attributes.</p>
<p>Paymen&#x27;s main attributes are strength and spirit, which have increased by five points per level based on the current progress. His secondary attribute is body, which has increased by two points per level. Soul is the most mysterious attribute, which is vague even in textbooks, somewhat like quantum mechanics in my previous life. Many common or rare units only have around 10 points, even at dozens of levels. Soul is usually only slightly higher for mages and warlocks, and Payman only added one point per level.</p>
<p>A level 10 legendary hero already has stats comparable to a level 30 epic monster. Moreover, Payman&#x27;s skills are all incredibly powerful, making him truly unstoppable in the newbie zone. Don&#x27;t be careless. There are still powerful outdoor buildings in the beginner area, such as the monster treasure house, the destruction castle, and the house of death. The monsters inside are also very strong.</p>
<p>Continue upgrading the Mod Dao iron guards and the divine arm archers all to level 10. The iron guard of the Mod Dao Tanggi race human level 10 quality legend attributes strength 98 + 20 spirit 45 + 9 constitution 85 + 17 soul 40 + 8 combat power rating 89 stars attributes added by skills equipment lord abilities etc are not included in the combat power rating skills Divine Valor, Pillar of Strength, Bloodlust, Slash with the Momentum, Slash against the Momentum, Dragon Staff, Beginner, Divine Archer, Song Rouue. Race: Human, Hashia. Level 10. Quality: Legend.</p>
<p>Attributes: Strength: 90 + 18, Spirit 90 + 18, Constitution 70 + 14, Soul 45 + 9. Combat power rating: 90 stars. Attributes added by skills, equipment, lord abilities, etc. are not included in the combat power rating. Skills: Eagle Eye, rank A.</p>
<p>Armor penetration, rank A, long shot, composure, giant killer, five elements arrow, dragon staff technique, beginner. Lynn Shao secretly estimated that the MO Dao iron guards and the divine arm archers were both legendary units enjoying the same treatment of adding five or four points to their main attributes per level. Moreover, they had also learned the pan long staff technique which permanently increased all their attributes by 10 points. Therefore, the current panel attributes are also terrifyingly powerful, only slightly inferior to the level 30 epic nest demon, completely crushing any unit of the same level. In comparison, the MO DAO Iron Guards have higher strength and physique, making them pure melee combat powerhouses.</p>
<p>The divine arm archer has virtually no weaknesses. Its strength and spirit attributes are all top tier. All the soldiers knelt on the ground again to thank their lord. This time it was Solderin&#x27;s turn to use his phantom archers. Lyn Shia used up his remaining experience points to level up all the greenclad elves to level 15.</p>
<p>Although there are many phantom archers and their levels are high, they require less experience points than Tang Yi and Song Ruer because they are an excellent unit. Phantom shooter soldering level 15 quality excellent attributes strength 30 + 6 spirit 42 + 8 constitution 22 + 4 soul 16 + 3 combat power rating 31 stars skills rapid fire long range sniping after looking at the phantom archer stats Lyn Sha forced himself to suppress the urge to cover his face and sigh This attribute is really too bad. A level 15 phantom archer is only equivalent to a level one divine archer and the skills are also much worse. However, phantom archers are now Lyn Xiao&#x27;s main force on the surface and he needs them to show their skills on many occasions. So, Lyn Shao has also upgraded them.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao also vaguely felt that it would be best for his Chinese troops to show themselves less often. As for the other heroine, the peerless enchantress Ba and the 100 flower fairies he had stolen, Lin Shiao didn&#x27;t level them up. Firstly, because they didn&#x27;t have enough experience. Secondly, Baoi is a rule-based hero. She has not yet shown her combat ability, and Lyn Sha has not yet dealt with all of her negative skills.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether leveling up will increase the difficulty. Lyn Sha has other uses for the flower fairies, so he doesn&#x27;t need to upgrade them for the time being. Once we enter the official zone and upgrade to a higher level base, all lords can choose to let their troops freely gain experience and level up, which will reduce a lot of trouble and allocation. During this upgrade, Lynsha also noticed that the bonuses for all hero units had decreased. The reason is simple.</p>
<p>Xiang Yu&#x27;s spirit disappeared the next day and the 30% bonus to all attributes from Xang Yu&#x27;s command a level skill also disappeared. So currently his subordinates only have Lin Xiao&#x27;s eternal peace strife 20% bonus to all attributes. I still have several thousand energy points left in the battlefield of myriad races. Let&#x27;s try adding another Chinese Imperial Spirit to increase our combat power. Use the Hasha decree heroic spirit possession.</p>
<p>A golden light shone down from the sky, piercing through the endless mist on the battlefield of myriad races and shining upon Lin Sha. Chapter 59. Emperor Taizu and Emperor Taong of song have arrived. A golden light shone down from the sky, piercing through the endless fog on the battlefield of all races. A faint majestic chanting arose from the heavens and earth, making the surrounding atmosphere solid and heavy, as if one were in the midst of a battlefield with clashing swords and galloping horses, or as if residing high in the heavens, overlooking all living beings.</p>
<p>The endless spirits of Chinese emperors reappeared beside Lyn Shao, constantly lingering, flickering, and observing. Liaos consciousness had entered an unknown space. He carefully tried to identify the emperors he recognized. A figure drifted past me. Could this aura belong to Chin Shir Huang, the first emperor of all time? Lyn Shiao excitedly reached out, but Inhan seemed to only glance at Lin Shia indifferently before disappearing in a flash.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaos hand froze in midair for a moment. Does this mean they looked down on me? The emperors continued to flash, and Lyn Sha saw another emperor&#x27;s spirit with a majestic appearance and extraordinary bones piercing the top of his head, full of masculine spirit and an indomitable will. This appearance must be old Je. It turns out old Zu didn&#x27;t have a long, narrow face, nor did he look as dignified and imposing as depicted in portraits. Instead, he was ugly handsome, unforgettable at first glance.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao thought to himself and reached out to touch this heroic spirit. But the spirit only glanced at Lyn Xiaos fair and slender fingers before dodging away on its own. Lyn Shia was stunned again. Was it the spirits of Chinese heroes possessing him? Or was it a two-way journey? As he glanced around, a familiar figure approached Lyn Sha. This man had a round face, dark skin, and a tall stature.</p>
<p>He looked incredibly bold and had an extraordinary bearing. He was definitely a big strong man from the north. This was the very figure who taught Lin Shia the panlong staff technique when he first leveled up to level 10. Emperor Taisu of Song Xiao Kuang Yin. This is someone who based solely on military strength would definitely rank among the top 10 of all emperors including emperors and kings including Xiang Yu and Ran Min.</p>
<p>With Emperor Taou of Song on our side, this wave is in the bag within 24 hours. Lin Shao was overjoyed and his consciousness took a step towards Emperor Taizu of Song Ziao Kuangin. Just as the human and the soul were about to meet, a heroic figure resembling Xiao Kuangin suddenly rushed out from the side. The spirit shoved Xiao Kuangin aside and before Lin Shao could react, threw himself on top of him. In an instant, the spirits of the Chinese heroes were possessed.</p>
<p>Lin Shao snapped back to reality and immediately began to check. Emperor Taong of Song, Xiao Guangi. Ability borrowing level one. Degree of integration extremely low. Duration 24 hours.</p>
<p>Abilities click to view. Black god of slaughter. Candle shadow and axe sound. Sorghum river chariot god. Reading is beneficial.</p>
<p>Silent judgment. It was none other than Emperor Taisu of song. Xiao Kuangi. Xiao Kuangins younger brother should be all right. Lin Shiao breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario he had imagined did not occur. At least it wasn&#x27;t the king of Chong Ban Slope, General Zhu X, or the Emperor Hui of Gene who refused to eat meat porridge who came. But upon seeing the skill description, Lin Xiao&#x27;s face darkened again. Black god of slaughter. When the lord and his troops/h heroes use poison, the toxicity is increased by 100% and the recipe for the S-level poison, the poison of the machine, is obtained.</p>
<p>Candle shadow and axe sound increases all attributes by 50% in dark environments and at night, limited to the lord only. Increases hatred towards relatives by 50% due to its high degree of disguise. The loyalty of all subordinate troops and heroes with a loyalty of less than 80 is temporarily increased to 80. Gallong River Chariot God increases speed and range of any animal-drawn vehicle, horse carriage, donkey cart, ox cart, etc. by 100%.</p>
<p>Negative impact. Zia Guangi is ignorant of military affairs. All troop and hero leadership values decrease and all troop/hero attributes under his command decrease by 10%. Reading is beneficial. Increases the learning ability of the lord and all his/heroes by 20%, memory by 20% and affinity for books by 20%.</p>
<p>Decisive strategist. The history of Song praises Emperor Taong Xiao Kuangi saying the emperor was decisive and resourceful and possessed the ambition to pacify the world. Some commentators add but he was incompetent. Further note, this skill has no beneficial or detrimental effects. What kind of weird skill is that? Lyn Sha couldn&#x27;t help but want to look up to the sky and sigh.</p>
<p>reading is beneficial. So why would he send rough men like the iron guards with their long swords and archers with their divine crossbows to take the imperial examinations of the myriad races with its flickering candle light and the clanging of axes is extremely dangerous at night. Apart from their territories and the mineral resources they have already occupied, venturing out poses a great danger. Should they send him to fight headon? What&#x27;s with this level of hatred towards family members? I don&#x27;t have any family members. What&#x27;s with this unit loyalty system? Which of my units or heroes has a loyalty level above 80? The flower fairies he stole use poisonous seeds? Decisive strategist is a skill that has no effect whatsoever.</p>
<p>It has neither positive nor negative effects. So why is it listed here? The funniest thing is the Gallong river cart god. He increases the speed and range of animal drawn vehicles by 100%. Even if your donkey cart flies, what good will it do? What&#x27;s more, it even reduces all attributes by 10%. Now look what&#x27;s happened.</p>
<p>My 20% increase in all attributes has been reduced by 10%. Ziao Guangi trying to do. These skills have their pros and cons, but they don&#x27;t suit me at all. There&#x27;s also the question of why Zia Guani took his brother&#x27;s place at the last minute and squeezed into my position. With a thousand wild horses galloping through his mind, Lyn Sha took several deep breaths and slowly calmed down.</p>
<p>No amount of complaining will help. The spirit of the emperor of China possesses him for 24 hours at a time, during which he will have to work with Xiaoani. We need to turn our disadvantages into advantages. In addition, we can&#x27;t stop going out to hunt monsters and seize resources. Lyn Shao pondered, &quot;The trapping drug is an S-class poison.</p>
<p>I need to memorize this formula. The flower fairies use poison. With Xiao Guangi&#x27;s heroic spirit possessing them, their combat power has increased by a level. They can probably be used as a rare type of soldier. Besides, they are not afraid of death.</p>
<p>Not wanting to waste any time during the day, Lyn Sha quickly arranged the deployment of all the troops. Even without any buffs, their legendary units and heroes are still ridiculously strong. He now needs to grind monsters to meet his massive resource and experience demands. Tonight will upgrade directly to a second tier university. Lyn Sha then clicked to recruit 20 more golden farmers who lined up in the farmhouse to be recruited with two being recruited every hour.</p>
<p>With the first batch of legendary spirit fields ripening, there is more than enough food to recruit golden farmers. Apart from the golden legend, all farmers in the base should build houses to provide sufficient housing for the upcoming wave of farmers and troops. After building 100 houses, they can then follow orders to mine at various resource points. Golden legendary farmers are responsible for cultivating and planting legendary quality spirit fields. Tangi led all the Mod Dao iron guards along the northern route outside Hulu Pass to kill monsters and hunt wild animals.</p>
<p>He brought 50 flower fairies along with him who could not only help in the battle, but also immediately occupy the resources that were spawned. Five flower fairies were left at each resource point to mine them. Remember, if there are any areas on the map that are not clearly marked, or if you are unsure what kind of monster it is, have the flower fairy scout ahead. Pay men soldering. Leave 10 phantom archers to guard the base and take the rest of the phantom archers to the south road of Calabash Pass to farm monsters.</p>
<p>Also take 50 flower fairies and do the same. Ba, you should stay in the lord&#x27;s manor and wait for me to return. Song rule, you take all the archers with you and follow me. This time we&#x27;re going to challenge the house of death. Chapter 60.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t play by the rules. Inside a lord&#x27;s manor in the 89757 newbie zone, a tall man was quietly bandaging a wound on his arm. Although he didn&#x27;t have the handsome looks of Lin Shia and Pay Min, he still had a dashing appearance and an air of authority in his every move. My lord, we have lost nearly half of our brothers in this demonic tide. The sword dancers no longer have the morale to continue fighting.</p>
<p>The tall man pondered for a few seconds, then immediately stood up. Huh? This is a B-level demonic tide that only the most elite experts in the beginner zone can encounter. We actually managed to hold on with only half of our troops lost. Once people find out, who wouldn&#x27;t give these soldiers a thumbs up and say, &quot;We are terrifyingly powerful.&quot; But my lord, you are injured. You don&#x27;t understand.</p>
<p>I was injured while testing a new technique. The tall man picked up a long sword that was lying at his feet, twirled it gracefully, and said, &quot;I am a genius from Jangdong number one high school, someone who is on par with Lin Shiao. Do you think I would be injured by a demon? However, Lias progress lies in the fact that practice makes perfect. If I don&#x27;t test new skills in actual combat, how can these skills be confirmed to be useful and usable?&quot; The tall man gently stroked his long sword, sighing with emotion. I don&#x27;t remember where it was from, but someone once said, &quot;What you learn from books is never enough.</p>
<p>You must put it into practice to truly understand.&quot; I have long considered him a confidant, but I wish I could meet him in person. However, for the sake of the future of the entire Lang Shia and even all of humanity, I am willing to risk my life for him. What does it matter if I get injured a hundred more times in order to test better combat techniques? My lord, my lord is truly a noble person. The soldier immediately knelt on one knee, deeply moved. Upon hearing the sound of the man&#x27;s loyalty increasing before the god system, the tall man simply nodded.</p>
<p>Go tell the soldiers outside the truth. The world may misunderstand me, but I don&#x27;t want my brothers to lose heart. Yes, my lord. Seeing the troops leave, the tall man visibly breathed a sigh of relief and muttered to himself. A B-level demonic tide is really not something that can be easily withstood, especially under the circumstances before.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all Lin Xiao&#x27;s fault. He made me lose face. The communication interface suddenly flashed and a stranger initiated a communication request. The tall man hesitated for a moment before answering the call. On the other end was an arrogant man with a mask on who was the same expert from the formal district who had spoken to Lin Sha earlier.</p>
<p>Dingle, a genius from Jangd Dong number one high school who is on par with Lin Shiao. Are you interested in collaborating? He he are you the top 100 expert lord in the Lan region. He&#x27;s a top 100 expert lord. The man on the other end corrected. Ding Llay narrowed his eyes and his expression became strange.</p>
<p>Damn, I&#x27;ve met my match. The House of Death is a wilderness structure on par with the monster treasure house and the castle of destruction in the battlefield of the waring states. The house of death is divided into three levels, each with powerful monsters and bosses. You can leave after completing each floor, but you can only get the richest reward after completing all three floors. Because the monsters in the house of the dead are fixed, there is no issue of luck.</p>
<p>Therefore, the house of death is more difficult than the monster treasure house, but the rewards are also more generous. Most importantly, the house of the dead can also reward a lot of advanced resources such as fine wood, fine stone, fine iron, and fine copper, which are needed to upgrade the three levels. That&#x27;s right, Lyn Sha hasn&#x27;t even reached tier 2 yet, but he&#x27;s already preparing resources for upgrading to tier three. The Black Flame Lord&#x27;s attack has always been a huge obstacle in his path. Can descend from the broken zone are limited to a maximum of 1,000.</p>
<p>But what kind of troops will the invaders from the official zone bring? Epic or legendary? How powerful will the enemy be? The chance of a new lord winning when the powerful players arrive in the main server is less than one in a thousand. They must be strong enough to win. But Lynn Shia has studied all the cases. If the new lord has already upgraded to level three before the powerful players arrive in the main server, the chance of winning can be increased to 5%. Therefore, by preparing early, if everything goes smoothly, I can upgrade to level three, recruit heroes, and gain more confidence before the arrival of the black flame lord.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lin Shia and the archers had safely killed all the enemies on the first and second floors and entered the third floor. The sky was filled with blood red vampire bats, and amidst their eerie howls, a coffin on the roof of the death tower slowly opened. A mummy wearing a golden crown and wrapped in bandages slowly sat up. Foolish and ignorant humans, how dare you trespass into the tomb of my noble pharaoh Ramsy&#x27;s III. You disturb me.</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, 10 feathered arrows pierced the mummy&#x27;s body with a whooshing sound. Why are you not playing by the rules? Who are you? Ramsy&#x27;s III shouted angrily. Do we have to announce our names before the battle starts? Lyn Sha asked, tilting his head. Of course, this is basic etiquette among nobles. I then listen carefully.</p>
<p>I am Stormbborn, king of dragon stone, the unburnt, father of dragons, king of marine, liberator of Aapor, king of the undulser and first men, ruler of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm. K of the Dothraki on the great plains. The one who broke the chains. What kind of nobleman has so many titles? Are you kidding me? 10 more arrows came flying and the mummy teleported, barely dodging most of them, but was still covered in dirt and grime. Huh? How ignorant.</p>
<p>How ridiculous. I haven&#x27;t even finished listing my titles yet. There&#x27;s another one with an even longer title. The Bing. Kill him.</p>
<p>At Lyn Xiao&#x27;s command, the archers with divine arms drew their bows and fired again. In the gaps between the pharaoh mummies dodges and weaves, it also let out a long howl, and half of its blood red bats transformed into humanoid vampires, mingling with the swarms of bats as they charged toward Linhao&#x27;s group. Lyn Shiao was prepared for this. He brought the divine archer archers specifically to counter flying units. The divine archer archers were archery masters who could even shoot arrows into the backs of ravens in the sky.</p>
<p>And dealing with bats was no problem for them either. Charge. They&#x27;re all ranged attackers. Amidst the screech, a few vampires or vampires finally managed to reach the archer, only to find that the ranged unit in front of them was wearing thick armor and a cruel smile appeared in their eyes. Then they were cleaved in two by the ring pommel sword.</p>
<p>Even the pharaoh&#x27;s mummy was ultimately unable to withstand this group of monstrous ranged attackers and turned to ashes amidst incredulous staires. Ding! You have successfully defeated all the guards in the House of Death. Rewards are being calculated. Hearing that the systems settlement naturally included refined wood, refined stone, refined iron, and refined copper, Lin Sha nodded with satisfaction and led the archers out of the house of death. I&#x27;ve gained a lot of experience, so I can upgrade the troops again soon.</p>
<p>Next, all we need to do is deal with the death knight and destroyed castle, and we&#x27;ll have enough materials to upgrade to level three. Just then, Chuinga sent a message. Lyn Shia, connect the communication immediately. Urgent chapter 61 past events with Dugu Xiaolan. Lyn Sha then realized that he had missed Chufinga&#x27;s communication request again.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no other reason than that when using Xiao Guangi&#x27;s spirit to fight in the dark environment, he was completely focused and had no time to think about communication requests or other things. Lyn Shiao immediately dialed Chufinger&#x27;s number and the call was connected. On the other end was an arrogant young man with a full head of green hair. Fungu, why has your hair turned green? He wasn&#x27;t this all the work of your former class monitor. Chufinga pouted looking terrified.</p>
<p>Dugu Xaolon Lin Shia asked curiously. Isn&#x27;t Dugu Jaolon in another newbie zone? Is she going to come over here and shove your head underwater? Sigh. How am I supposed to know what she did? She dyed my hair green right through the screen and I didn&#x27;t even offend her. Chufinga poured out his grievances. He I know.</p>
<p>Dug a gel on. She rarely gets this angry. What did you say that you shouldn&#x27;t have? I I didn&#x27;t say anything. You urgently contacted me just for this? Lynn Shiao asked suspiciously. Chufinga then realized what was happening and said, &quot;Hey, I was so angry because of that woman Dugu that I forgot about it.&quot; Then Chufinga brought her face close to the screen, looking left and right.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha, where&#x27;s your guster archer? S Rui&#x27;s lips twitched beneath his mask. He silently walked behind Lin Sha and gave a gesture of respect to the screen with his hands clasped. So this is the Gust Archer Lin Shia Chufinga exclaimed in amazement. He looks even more imposing than my berserker. You&#x27;re something else.</p>
<p>Did you get this unit from an epic chest? Before Lynn Shiao could reply, Chufungo waved her hand again. No need to tell me. Lyn Shao, judging from your expression, I can pretty much guess what&#x27;s going on. Everyone on the battlefield of all races has secrets. This is your trump card, so you&#x27;d better keep it well hidden.</p>
<p>Heihei, can you tell me what you want to see me about? I have other things to do. Lynn Shiao said with a faint smile. Chufunga immediately replied, &quot;It&#x27;s urgent. I came here because of your urgent matter.&quot; Chufunga chuckled and leaned back, saying, &quot;Lin Xiao, I didn&#x27;t expect you to be so good at causing trouble. I&#x27;ve only just come out after breaking through to the first level and fighting against the demonic tide.&quot; And I find out that you&#x27;ve killed those two bullies.</p>
<p>Well done. Well done. But Lynn Shiao, do you remember when I mentioned their backing? I remember. I also calculated that if their backers really want to deal with me, my chances of winning might not be very high. Lyn Shao said calmly.</p>
<p>But we are already at odds, so the only option is to kill them. Chufunga looked at Lin Sha in silence, her green hair gleaming in the light. After a moment, he said, &quot;I can&#x27;t see a trace of fear in your eyes, Lyn Sha.&quot; Although Ding Lay likes to pretend, he is right about one thing. The battlefield of the myriad races is a battlefield of iron and blood. I am devoted to the great Dao and have no fear of life and death.</p>
<p>Good, Lynsha. Just for those words, this old man will definitely protect you, Chufinga exclaimed. Old man Heihei, it&#x27;s Chu Yusi, the lord of Jangdong City. It&#x27;s him. Lyn Sha suddenly realized.</p>
<p>I knew you were extraordinary, but I didn&#x27;t expect you to be this extraordinary. The famous madman of Jangdong is your father. Sai, let&#x27;s not talk about that nickname. He&#x27;s a thing of the past, having faded from the battlefield of the myriad races struggle for supremacy. Chufungo waved his hand and said, &quot;However, with the power of the Jangdong city lord&#x27;s mansion, protecting you is no problem.&quot; Lyn Xiaos eyelids twitched when he heard the idiom that Chufunga uttered.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha, do you know that when you were resisting the demonic tide, my old man came to me about it? They contacted you. Lyn Sha frowned slightly. He said that Jabbron, the first prophet under the queen of dragon summer domain, has taken notice of you because of the extraordinary magical tide. He said that although you only have F-level talent, you have great potential and are worth focusing on cultivating. Then my old man asked me to help you out a lot.</p>
<p>Chufinga said apologetically. I didn&#x27;t expect that I had just turned around and made a breakthrough to a higher level when you wiped out the enemy. Sigh. I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to make a move. On the other side of the screen, Lin Sha appeared calm on the surface, but his heart was in turmoil.</p>
<p>When did I manage to attract the attention of the highest levels of Lia? And why was I being referred to through the Jangdong city lord s connections? They watched silently as he fought and killed Xiao Daang and his men. What are they trying to do? What do they know? Or do they simply think they&#x27;ve triggered the demonic tide through a series of coincidences and that their own potential makes them look at them differently without any other intentions? What does Lord Chu want me to do? Lyn Sha asked calmly. Nothing else, Lyn Sha. Chufinga said casually. We&#x27;ve been brothers for years.</p>
<p>How could this old man dare to harm you? He just wants me to tell you to come see him. You can set the time. The sooner the better. Here&#x27;s his ID number, Chufinga said. Then sent Chu Yusi&#x27;s number to Lin Shia.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry. This time will definitely protect you. Chufinga said nonchalantly. We beat up their little ones, and now the old ones are here. We have older people here, too.</p>
<p>Why can&#x27;t we send in more people? Who&#x27;s afraid of who? Seeing Chufinga&#x27;s posture and hearing his witty remarks, Lynn Shia couldn&#x27;t help but chuckle. Please thank Lord Shu for me. I will look for him. Lyn Sha said sincerely. Why not use the powerful figures around? Although he didn&#x27;t want to rely on them to solve everything.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s always good to have an extra layer of protection. As long as the big shot won&#x27;t affect me. All right, I almost forgot. Chufinga was happy to see that Lin Shia was willing to go to Chu Yusi, but then she remembered that there was another thing. Dug Jalon contacted me and gave me a bunch of documents.</p>
<p>She said she would pass them on to you. That&#x27;s really strange. Why didn&#x27;t she just contact you directly? She could have asked me for my ID. Shufinga shook her head and said, &quot;You originally promised to go find my old man, so it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you need these materials or not, but after all, it was the class monitor&#x27;s good intention. I&#x27;m sending it to you now.</p>
<p>Please receive it.&quot; Lyn Sha looked at Chufunga suspiciously, feeling that there was something Chufunga hadn&#x27;t told him yet. While transferring files, Chufinga kept muttering. Lyn Sha, I&#x27;m relieved that you&#x27;re doing so well in the newbie zone. This time, I guarantee you won&#x27;t become a vassal lord by joining the old man. You&#x27;ll remain independent.</p>
<p>Then, the two of us will dominate the Lnon region. Also, it&#x27;s normal for a grown man to have a few concubines on the battlefield of 10,000 races. Once he returns to the Dragon Sea Kingdom, his wife usually won&#x27;t object. If you object, then let&#x27;s find another one. Some people are really fierce.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ll unleash their full power at the slightest disagreement, throwing a skill at your face, and they also have powerful backers. I don&#x27;t know if you can accept marrying into their family. But you&#x27;re an orphan, so there&#x27;s nothing wrong with marrying into the family. All the documents are sent. Hey, why does your face look so dark? Lynn Shia on the other side of the screen had a face so dark it could drip ink.</p>
<p>Chufinga, I don&#x27;t know how your hair was turned green by Dugu Jaon, Lyn Shia said expressionlessly. But if I were Dugu Jaon, I&#x27;m afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to resist either. Huh? Just for such a small matter? Chufinga asked in surprise. I thought it was because I asked her last time how to relieve menstrual cramps. Lyn Xiaos eyes widened.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re asking about her, Chufinga? Yeah, I&#x27;ve already slept with all my ex-girlfriends. She&#x27;s the only one who happens to be resisting the demonic tide. Who else should I ask if not her? I was afraid she would beat me up, so I said I was Lyn Xiao&#x27;s beautiful heroine. Lyn Shiao silently reached out and turned off the communication. Chapter 62 information about the black flame lord.</p>
<p>Dugu Xiaolan, the perennial second place student at Dangdong number three Middle School, is also Lin Xiao&#x27;s class monitor. She was stunningly beautiful with a cool and aloof demeanor and was exceptionally proud and independent. Although he has a strong sense of pride in his conduct and dealings with others, he is not arrogant. He is a prominent figure at Jangdong number three middle school and one of the top students. Unfortunately, throughout her entire academic career, all her achievements were overshadowed by Lin Sha until the day of the Lord&#x27;s talent test.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao knew that she must have awakened a considerable talent. So, he was immediately taken away by the director and made a seed player, keeping her talent a secret. Speaking of which, Dugu Jalon and Lynn Shiao didn&#x27;t have much interaction. Although they were in the same class, one was a block head and the other was an ice queen. During their school life, the two were always competing for first place and didn&#x27;t have much interaction with each other.</p>
<p>But handsome men and beautiful women are popular figures at school. So wouldn&#x27;t some rumors and gossip circulate? Even Lin Sha himself couldn&#x27;t quite explain his feelings for Dugu Jaolon. It&#x27;s impossible to say that there was something going on between the two, but over the years of competition, Lyn Sha felt that they had some mutual affection. However, he knew from his past life that men&#x27;s intuition is very inaccurate. Based on his experience of living two lives, Lynsha also discovered that Dugu Jaolon was by no means a simple academic genius.</p>
<p>From her good upbringing and speech, as well as the seemingly insignificant security personnel entering and leaving the school, Lyn Sha could guess with his toes that she had a very strong background. At this moment, Lyn Sha gleaned even more information from Chufinga&#x27;s gossip. He shook his head. The Dugu Jaolan he remembered wouldn&#x27;t lose his composure so easily, getting so angry that he died, chewing his hair green through the screen. However, Lin Sha couldn&#x27;t help but chuckle.</p>
<p>This version of Dugu Jaolon was indeed more humane. Opening the file sent by Dugu Jaolon, Lin Shiao side slightly, thinking to himself, &quot;As expected, this is it. This document contains the personal information of Black Flame, a top player from the official server who is about to break through the server and come to punish him, as well as information about the people behind him. Black Flame, official district lord, graduated from a noble school, real name unknown. I entered the battlefield of the myriad races 3 years ago.</p>
<p>The most recent level I can find is 65. My headquarters is level six, and I have six heroes. Among them, the strongest hero is the Predator Nano, an epic level hero whose revealed skills are speculated to be. Black Flame&#x27;s troop types include Blackflame&#x27;s own lord Talonis. Blackflame himself is cruel and bloodthirsty.</p>
<p>During his time as a novice lord, he entered the official server as the second ranked player in the new server, during which time he killed at least 10 of his fellow human race. After entering the official server, he used the extermination token 59 times, killing 55 lords. Last year, I broke into the newbie zone and killed the newbie lord. This person&#x27;s past competition honors. Lynn Shiao slowly finished reading the document and couldn&#x27;t help but admired Dugu Jaolans meticulousness and dedication.</p>
<p>To be able to gather so much information in just a few hours, squad leader, you must have some powerful backing. Lyn Sha shook his head and continued reading. Wong Su, official district lord, lord of black flame. Rank and life details unknown. Note, due to time constraints, please understand.</p>
<p>Wong Su is suspected to be a member of the celestial beings organization, a powerful alliance formed by members of various noble schools in the Dragon Sa Kingdom. Wong Sus most recent display of strength placed him at number 100 on the LN region&#x27;s overall leaderboard. Note, ranks to 150 are called expert lords. Ranks 49 to 11 are called master lords. And the top 10 are called chief lords.</p>
<p>Lynsha nodded silently. So this was the masked man. He claimed to be a top 100 expert lord. Suddenly Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;What does please understand Miss mean? Who is Miss Dugu? Jaon and there&#x27;s also Wong Su. This guy is such a vain person who loves playing word games.</p>
<p>What exactly are the top 100? They are the top 100. How much exactly? 100 people. Lyn Sha continued reading. Due to access restrictions, very little information is available for this celestial beings organization. Current information suggests that the Celestial Beings organization has close ties with Japan and possesses a diverse arsenal due to its wealthy members.</p>
<p>Its leader is suspected of commanding angelic soldiers of legendary quality, making it a legitimate force in the Dragon Summer domain and one of the Dragon Queen&#x27;s formidable potential rivals. After reviewing the information, Lin Sha silently looked up. The information sent by Dugu Jaolon is very timely. With this information, I have a general idea of the strength, troop composition, and troop distribution of the Black Flame. You have to be prepared for anything.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never pinned my hopes on the protection of a big shot. If the negotiations fall apart, at least I can face the consequences on my own. Seeing that it was still early, Lynn Shia decided to continue grinding monsters, accumulating experience, and seizing resources. The cool down period will be over by tonight. So, I&#x27;ll upgrade directly to tier 2.</p>
<p>As for contacting Chu Yusi, that will have to wait until night when I have plenty of time and can no longer farm. As the last rays of sunlight set behind the mountains, Lyn Sha led the archers with divine crossbows back to his lord&#x27;s manner. Whoosh! Whoosh! Everyone was panting. Kill more monsters. Lynn Shiao timed his time down to the second and destroyed an extra cobalt lair.</p>
<p>At the last moment, the archer with the divine arm, wearing a 60- lb heavy infantry armor, ran back to the camp like a brown bear. Because Lin Sha possessed the heroic spirit of Emperor Taong of Song, Xiao Kuangi. Although he wasn&#x27;t as good as Xiang Yu, his attributes were still increased by over a hundred, so his performance was still respectable. He looked up and saw Baoi waiting anxiously for Lin Xiaos return, her fair and delicate face filled with worry. &quot;My lord, you&#x27;re back.&quot; Baoi ran happily over to Lin Xiao upon seeing him, ignoring the large group of muscular men around her and threw herself into Lin Xiaos arms.</p>
<p>Sensing Bao&#x27;s excitement and feeling her soft, boneless touch, Liaos heart also burned with passion. He held this stunning beauty quietly, feeling all his weariness vanish. Baoi, are you feeling all right today? Lynn Sha led Baoi to the open space in front of the Lord&#x27;s mansion. There, several farmers had already cooked legendary spirit rice porridge and roasted some wild sheep and barbarian beef, the aroma of which was very enticing. My lord, Ba is well.</p>
<p>Ba&#x27;s face was flushed. The first thing Lynn Shiao did upon returning was to inquire about her health, which made her feel flattered. After chatting with Baoi for a while, Lynn Shiao invited everyone to eat spirit rice porridge and roasted meat. Ding! You have consumed legendary grade spirit rice, gaining plus two to body. The notification from the main god system sounded, and Lin Shia nodded with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&quot;This spirit rice porridge is great. It&#x27;s fragrant, sweet, and chewy, and it can also increase attributes. The muscular men sitting around the fire were also full of praise. Needless to say, they also felt the improvement in their physical attributes. Legend has it that there&#x27;s enough spirit rice, so I&#x27;ll feed my first batch of crew members to their hearts content.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ll randomly gain two attribute points every day, and over time, the bonus will be quite terrifying. At this moment, his vassal lord he sent him a message. Boss Lin Shiao, that big- breasted, brainless woman, Zay May, has caused trouble again. Chapter 63. Tu Sha by Chian causes trouble.</p>
<p>Trouble? Can&#x27;t Tan by Chian be a little more reliable? That was Lin Xiaos first reaction. Even so, Lyn Shao immediately initiated a communication with Heiz. On the other end, Heay scratched his head sheepishly. Boss Lin Shiao Ding Lay has his eye on that beautiful girl. Lyn Xiaos expression changed and he quickly asked for the specific reason.</p>
<p>As he continued his rambling explanation, Lin Shiao finally understood. It turns out that after Tu Sha by Chin returned, she immediately recruited soldiers and farmers to restore production. She was also extremely lucky and soon obtained a rare weapon, the Moon Spirit Shortsword. Speaking of that pretty girl, she&#x27;s really lucky. She almost caught up with me, the chosen one of destiny.</p>
<p>No, I mean the younger brother of destiny. She wants to learn from Lyn Xiao&#x27;s methods and tame neutral monsters. If she can&#x27;t tame them, she&#x27;ll just fight them. After all, she has rare weapons. A hint of envy flickered in Heay&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>Then she led two squads of troops to the centaur&#x27;s lair. Unfortunately, there was an exceptional centaur leader stationed there. Terrified, the beautiful girl immediately transformed into a fox spirit and tried to escape. Unexpectedly, the beautiful girl who could transform into a demon beast did not arouse the hostility of these halfhuman half beast uh centurs. The two sides simply sat down and chatted for a bit, and then the centaur leader along with his 30 rare centaur archers joined the beautiful girl&#x27;s side.</p>
<p>This was completely a brainless act of recklessness and had nothing to do with luck. Lyn Sha thought to himself. He continued, &quot;The beautiful girl whose strength had greatly increased happily called me to show off. Then, right in front of me, she mounted a centaur, riding off into the mortal world.&quot; Lyn Sha waved his hand. &quot;Get to the point.</p>
<p>What trouble did she get into?&quot; She wanted to make a name for herself and planned to hunt some more powerful monsters. She had just run to the destroyed castle when she encountered Ding Lays army passing by. Hearing Heay use the phrase made a name for himself, Lyn Xiaos eyelids twitched involuntarily again. But there were more important things to do at the moment. Ding Lays army.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia frowned and asked, &quot;Why do you call it an army?&quot; Dingle has a full 10 squads of rare troops and two squads of superior troops, 120 troops. and everyone knows that he is also a lord with A-level talent. The beautiful girl was immediately surrounded and the two sides were locked in a tense standoff for quite a while. Dinglay realized that taking her in would be too troublesome, so he wanted the beautiful girl to surrender. The beautiful girl also wanted to conserve her strength.</p>
<p>In the end, the two were locked in a stalemate for too long and the beautiful girl was ambushed by Ding Lay and captured. The moment Ding Lay captured the beautiful girl, he cut off all her communications. But the beautiful girl never closed her communication with me. I switched to voice communication and didn&#x27;t make a sound. That&#x27;s how I found out about all this.</p>
<p>So Tu Shawn by Chin has been captured. Lyn Sha asked. That&#x27;s right, he said. The pretty girl didn&#x27;t have a chance to call boss Lyn Sha, but she should know that I overheard what happened. Captured, Lyn Shao pondered.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a rare sight on the battlefield of the myriad races vying for supremacy, especially a prisoner of 50 soldiers. But Zay&#x27;s soldiers definitely can&#x27;t beat Ding Lay. He said anxiously. Wait a minute. You just said the castle was destroyed.</p>
<p>Yes, boss. The destroyer castle is located in a fairly central location on the map. When did he and the beautiful girl encounter it? About an hour ago. Lyn Shao immediately entered the memory palace in his mind and began searching. Then he suddenly discovered a problem.</p>
<p>An hour ago, if the beautiful girl had ridden her horse at full speed, she could have run back to her territory. Dingles rare and excellent troops must be just as good. He asked, puzzled. Boss Lyn Sha, what does this have to do with anything? The connection is that there&#x27;s no Lord&#x27;s manor near this destroyed castle you mentioned and it&#x27;s already dark. Lyn Sha said in a deep voice after Tan by Chin and Ding Lay encountered each other.</p>
<p>Their standoff wasted time and neither of them could go back. That&#x27;s right. Boss Lin Sha is right. He realized that the battlefield of the myriad races at night was extremely dangerous and those too, they should still be inside the destroyed castle. Lyn Sha nodded.</p>
<p>Perhaps Zay&#x27;s situation isn&#x27;t as bad as we think. I&#x27;ll go find Dinglay. Lyn Sha hung up the call and opened the chat channel. At night, everyone was chatting idly. Dingle, this is Lyn Sha.</p>
<p>Are you there? Lyn Sha didn&#x27;t waste any words and directly tagged Ding Lay in the public channel. He he boss Lyn Shao. What can I do for you? As soon as Ding Lay replied, the entire chat channel fell silent. These two are both prominent figures in the 89,757 newbie zone. One is the first hero recruited in the beginner zone and the other is the second hero recruited in the beginner zone.</p>
<p>One is a genius from Djangdong number three middle school and the other is a big shot from Jangdong number one middle school who is said to be his equal. Moreover, the two of them had an unpleasant incident during the day. Dinglay gifted gold coins to Gene Dangs live stream and publicly tried to mediate between Lin Shia and Xiao Dataong but failed and was retorted by Lin Sha. The two are now suddenly arguing online and this is happening right after nightfall while everyone is having dinner. Hurry up and grab a stool.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s eat some melon seeds and watch the show. Dingle, are you destroying a castle right now? Lyn Sha cut to the chase and asked directly, &quot;How did you know? Are those pretty girls also in your hands? Yeah, I just tied him up, planning to subdue him and make him a vassal lord. How did you know? Wow, Dinglay tied up the pretty girl. No wonder she hasn&#x27;t shown up in so long. I heard she&#x27;s a white stocking lowly.</p>
<p>All looks and no brains. What&#x27;s Dinglay up to? Also, how do you subdue it? Dinglay Zme is my vassal lord. You can&#x27;t subdue her. It turns out that the beautiful girl has become a vassal lord of the powerful Lin Sha. The beautiful girl has indeed joined forces with boss Lyn Sha.</p>
<p>And what&#x27;s more, boss Lyn Sha already has beautiful female heroes and he&#x27;s already added another member to his herum on just the second day. This is going to be interesting. Two big shots fighting over one woman. Even Heay found himself inexplicably excited. And the flower fairy beside him handed him a handful of melon seeds.</p>
<p>Master, have some melon seeds. He sure enough, Ding Lay was silent for a moment, then slowly said, &quot;I see. No wonder the pretty girl made a comeback so quickly. But now that she&#x27;s in my hands, why should I give her to you?&quot; Ding still remembers Lin Xiaos attitude towards him during the day. You&#x27;re still destroying the castle, and with your strength, you can&#x27;t even get past the third level.</p>
<p>Lin Sha said calmly. There are no monsters on the first floor of the destruction castle, but the monsters on the second and third floors are extremely powerful, but the castle will be forcibly upgraded every 4 hours, and you&#x27;ll be forced to fight the monsters on the second floor at midnight. At that point, you&#x27;ll only have two choices. Either expend a large number of troops to finally win on the second floor, or be killed by the death knight on the third floor. Otherwise, it&#x27;s either now or after clearing the second level.</p>
<p>We risk running out and being swallowed up by the knight of the battlefield where all races v for supremacy. Release the beautiful girl and I&#x27;ll let her fight alongside you. Then you can defeat the death knight and get through this night in peace. Chapter 64. Dinglay.</p>
<p>Watch me go in and out seven times. Dingle fell silent. He hadn&#x27;t expected Lynn Shia to see through the truth so quickly. That&#x27;s right. He has indeed kidnapped a beautiful girl, but he is currently facing a dilemma of destroying the castle and has no solution.</p>
<p>Although he had a large number of troops, including some exceptional units, he felt he was still no match for the death knights. The best outcome would be a pirick victory. After all, the destroyer castle is even more terrifying than the monster treasure house and the house of death, making it the most difficult outdoor building in the beginner area. avoid the situation because he had wasted a lot of time encountering a pretty girl unless you add the beautiful girl&#x27;s troops. The beautiful girl&#x27;s superior unit, the centur chieftain, is up to level 20 and comes with a thorn&#x27;s aura, which can greatly increase their chances of winning.</p>
<p>If the beautiful girl refuses to help, Dinglay&#x27;s only option is to kill her and all her troops. Otherwise, he was afraid that the pretty girl would ambush him from behind while he was fighting the monster. Damn it, my talent was weakened because of Lin Shiao. Otherwise, Ding Lay glanced at the beautiful girl sitting dejectedly on the ground and at the beautiful girl soldiers who had been eyeing him menacingly from the outside. He only managed to take down the pretty girl with a sneak attack.</p>
<p>But these soldiers are still loyally following her. This is also why Ding Lay doesn&#x27;t dare to take action rashly. However, if we deal with the beautiful girl and her troops first, our losses will be even greater, and we will be in a dead end in the destroyed castle, we have no choice but to take this gamble. Lyn Sha, on the other hand, had already planned everything out. The combat power of 100 rare units and 20 exceptional units, the combat power of the death knight, the existence of the beautiful girl, and her unit types, these are all unstable factors.</p>
<p>Dinglay had no choice but to accept his offer if he wanted to get out of here alive. If you were truly a top student, you should have left immediately upon realizing you couldn&#x27;t easily win over a girl with at least a B-grade talent. So, you could have returned to your own territory. Instead of being forced into a doomed castle and facing an unsolvable situation, Lyn Sha thought to himself and shook his head. He was waiting for Dinglays reply.</p>
<p>Heh he lin Dinglay replied from the other end. Do you think I wouldn&#x27;t know about destroying castles? A topic that will be tested when students are divided into classes in the second year of high school. Lyn Sha was taken aback when Ding Lay spoke again in the chat channel. Friends across the region tell me, do you think I Ding Lay wouldn&#x27;t understand this kind of knowledge? Everyone was taken aback. Huh? Showing off again.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll show you what a medium and large cup really are. He on the other end was about to jump up and reply when he was held tightly by the flower fairy beside him. Teacher He, please don&#x27;t do this. Please don&#x27;t do this. Teacher He in the chat channel.</p>
<p>A few people still managed to jump out and take sides with Ding Lay. Dinglay, the big boss, definitely knows these points. Dinglay is a top student at Daang Dong number one high school, so there&#x27;s no doubt he understands. He must be here to do something big. Lynn Shiao, you underestimate Ding Lay.</p>
<p>He must have his reasons. After seeing Ding Lays speech, Lyn Sha fell silent. Is this kid still trying to save face? He Lin Sha Ding Lay continued, &quot;Destroying the castle is dangerous, but I, Ding Lay, am definitely not the weakling you imagine. I, Ding Lay, am on par with you, Lin Shao, both geniuses of Jaong Province. Even without the help of the beautiful female soldiers, I can defeat the deaf knight.</p>
<p>Do you believe me or not? Lyn Sha frowned. He didn&#x27;t reply. He felt Ding Lays current behavior was a bit strange. Lyn Shiao, do you acknowledge that we are both geniuses from Jangdong? Dinglay asked again. Lyn Xiaos face was practically a huge question mark.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but there was only one genius who could be my equal in school, and that was Dugu. Jaon. Lyn Shao remained calm and composed. He never considered Ding Lay a rival, and he had no idea what it meant to be on par with someone of equal renown. Like Xiao Fong in the north and Mong Fu in the south, Dinglay was far from that.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. Lyn Sha had once again proven them wrong. Dinglay remained silent, and the silence from the other end of the line chilled everyone to the bone. Since that&#x27;s the case, Dinglay slowly typed a few words. Dingle.</p>
<p>A hero doesn&#x27;t dwell on past glories. Things at school are completely different from the battlefield of 10,000 races. On the battlefield, I was just an ordinary lord who had awakened an F- level talent. Lyn Sha spoke up. In the battlefield of all races, you are the second in the 89757 newb zone.</p>
<p>It is really beyond my expectations that you can rank ninth among the 10 newb zones in L naan this year. I must admit, you are stronger than I thought. Lyn Shao pondered for a moment before slowly saying, &quot;Among all the opponents I&#x27;ve encountered, besides Dugu, you are second to none. You admit that I am your opponent.&quot; Dingle immediately took over. &quot;Yes, and I will deal with you seriously.&quot; Harah, very good, Lynsha.</p>
<p>Those words from you are enough. I will show you that my name, Dingle, will resound throughout the battlefield of all races. Ding Lays speech was full of doineering confidence. Lyn Sha, watch closely. See how I lead a beautiful girl in and out of the destroyed castle seven times.</p>
<p>He a feels like a car will is running over my face. Dinglay. Now I&#x27;ll lift the censorship on the pretty girl and let her see the true strength of the genius from Jangdong number one high school. After a moment of silence, the chat channel erupted in discussion again. Ding Lays words were so powerful.</p>
<p>H as expected of a master who has been known as a genius for many years. It seems that I was wrong to think that he was just a showoff. I&#x27;m a fan now. Dinglay, we don&#x27;t have anything planned for tonight. So, let&#x27;s watch you solo destroy castle.</p>
<p>The attractive girl finally jumped out. Boss Lyn Shia little sister&#x27;s fine. Dingle is untied her, but she&#x27;s still by his side. Should I give her a sneak attack? Everyone, is that how you ask a question? Can&#x27;tt you just send a private message? Lyn Sha, no. He&#x27;s been honest and upright with us, so we should be just as honest and upright.</p>
<p>Dinglay well said. Lyn Sha, you truly are the opponent I&#x27;ve chosen. The pretty girl started commentating. Dingle has reached the second level. He led his troops up.</p>
<p>Wow, he&#x27;s so strong. I can&#x27;t even see Ding Lays skills clearly. It&#x27;s over. Everyone was shocked. the pretty girl exclaimed.</p>
<p>Dingle, he&#x27;s already wiped out all the monsters on the second floor of the castle. He&#x27;s cleared the second floor. Everyone was shocked again. The exclamations of Ding Lelay is awesome were endless. The Holy Alliance is awesome.</p>
<p>Some members of the organization that Dingle had just started building also straightened their backs and began to wave flags and shout. Before everyone could catch their breath, the pretty girl continued her broadcast. Dinglay led his troops straight to the third level. The death knight has appeared. My god.</p>
<p>He instantly killed one of Ding Lays elite units with a single death coil. The death knight has summoned an army of the undead. Dinglay is surrounded. Wu. My little sister is surrounded too.</p>
<p>A tense atmosphere filled the air. Everyone was focused on waiting for Tu Shawn. By Chin&#x27;s report, everyone knew how terrifying the death knight was being such a powerful monster. Can Dinglay pull through? Dingle, are you sure you can handle this? Someone asked. No sooner had she finished speaking than the pretty girl exclaimed.</p>
<p>Dinglay has been slashed. Dinglay is awesome. He dared to solo the castle of destruction. He may have lost, but he&#x27;s still glorious. He a seized the opportunity and made a sarcastic remark.</p>
<p>The pretty girl said, &quot;Ding Llay slashed the death knight with a backhand.&quot; Dinglay, what level are you? How are you going to fight a death knight? Run. Beautiful girl. Dingle got slashed again. Everyone was speechless. Just then, the main god system suddenly issued an announcement.</p>
<p>Ding. Player Ding Lay has created a live streamer. Lyn Shia was stunned and everyone else was stunned. Everyone rushed into the live stream and witnessed a scene that shocked them. Ding Lay holding a long sword stood amidst the mountains of corpses and seas of blood in the destroyed castle.</p>
<p>His body covered in blood, his eyes resolute. Before him stood the incomparably powerful yet panting death knight. Lyn Shiao keenly noticed the flickering light on Ding Lays body and the slight trembling of his hands and feet. Dinglay stood tall and spoke slowly. Death Knight, Earth Dog, Waji years.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ding Lay seemed to represent an indomitable spirit. There was a moment of silence in the live stream. Then it exploded wildly. So cool. Absolutely so cool.</p>
<p>Ding Lay is awesome. Amidst a chorus of praise, Ding Lay, his body shimmering with starlight, leaped up and cleaved the death knight in two with a single strike. Amidst the blood red sky, the wounded Ding Lay stood leaning on his long sword. He slowly turned his head and coldly looked at the live broadcast room. So cool.</p>
<p>Awesome. 666. Is this guy still putting on airs? Amidst a barrage of comments, Lyn Sha slowly opened his mouth. It&#x27;s a clay chicken and a clay dog, not a clay dog, and an excavator. Puff.</p>
<p>Dingle, who was posing for a moment, coughed up a mouthful of blood and swayed. Chapter 65. Another upgrade. Sudden changes. In front of everyone in the live broadcast room, Ding Lay, who had killed the death knight, released Tu Sha by Chian and led his remaining troops and Tu Sha by Chians army to set up camp and rest at a safe distance.</p>
<p>The castle of destruction is safe tonight, and Ding Lay and Tu Shawn by Chen did not fight. This guy really enjoys showing off, but he wouldn&#x27;t break a promise in front of tens of thousands of people. Seeing that the situation was settled, Lyn Sha quietly withdrew from the live stream amidst the sickopantic comments from the audience. He immediately called Lynsha. Brother Lynsha, it seems that Ding Lay is quite capable.</p>
<p>He on the other end still looked indignant and unconvinced. He was originally a master with A-level talent. Lyn Sha said, &quot;He certainly has the strength, but I think I&#x27;m still far from being as good as Lin Sha.&quot; Heay continued. Ding Lelay destroyed the castle, losing at least half of his troops. Heay glanced at Lin Shia discreetly, noticing his expressionless and indifferent look, and said, &quot;I suspect that if Lin Sha wanted to clear the castle of destruction, he wouldn&#x27;t have lost so many troops.&quot; &quot;Yes, that&#x27;s right.&quot; Lyn Sha didn&#x27;t give a direct answer, but simply said, &quot;It&#x27;s not that hard to clear a place like that.</p>
<p>You can just skip it along the way.&quot; Eay thought to himself. Just as I thought, I&#x27;ve chosen the right person to follow. He originally thought that Lin Sha might admit it was a bit difficult, perhaps by giving a smaller number of casualties, but he didn&#x27;t expect Lin Sha to just say that he could just grind it along the way. What makes a master? This is a true master. Considering that Lyn Sha wasn&#x27;t like Ding Lelay, who liked to boast, he was certain that if Lin Sha said he would just swipe there on the way, then he really meant it.</p>
<p>Overjoyed, Heay immediately added, &quot;By the way, boss Lyn Sha, I got three recruitment tokens this time. One of excellent quality and two of common quality.&quot; Brother Lin Sha, I used my superior grade recruitment token. Can I have your ordinary grade recruitment token instead? Can Lyn Sha was a little curious since he hadn&#x27;t even gotten a recruitment token yet while he already had three. It&#x27;s important to know that recruitment tokens are extremely sought after in the newbie zone. Everyone is scrambling for them and everyone uses them as soon as they get one.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s practically impossible for anyone to sell them. This is because you can only build a barracks after reaching tier 2. And before that, most people can only replenish their troops by using recruitment tokens. Lyn Sha also invested first, giving a few of his subordinates recruitment tokens before he could reap the rewards. You&#x27;re pretty lucky you&#x27;ve got three recruitment tokens so quickly.</p>
<p>He Heay scratched his head sheepishly and said, &quot;I always thought I was the chosen one.&quot; Lyn Sha was speechless. He waved his hand, ending the conversation. He immediately initiated the transaction and sent over two recruitment tokens. Lyn Shia held the recruitment token, but only to use it to summon Chinese troops with the Huasha summoning skill. So, the quality of the troops was not important to him.</p>
<p>Quantity was the key. As long as there are enough troops and the power of China, he can recruit soldiers at will. He still has an epic recruitment token that he hasn&#x27;t used yet. I spent the whole afternoon grinding and accumulated quite a bit of experience. To prevent any unforeseen circumstances, let&#x27;s continue upgrading the troops.</p>
<p>Night fell at the camp and all their heroes pay men and ba and their troops returned unharmed. It brought Lin Sha a wealth of experience and resources. Lyn Sha waved his hand and upgraded. Paymen leveled up to level 12. The MO Dao iron guards and the divine arm archers were all upgraded to level 11.</p>
<p>All phantom shooters are level 16. Thank you, Lord. Amidst the crowd&#x27;s gratitude, Lyn Sha nodded and Tu Shawn by Chin&#x27;s communication came through. Boss Lynn shout. Over there, a cute little girl dressed in a white Lolita dress, wearing white animal ears and white stockings, leaned against one end of the destroyed castle, wearily looking around amidst the surrounding soldiers.</p>
<p>Tu Shan by Chian, how are things on your end? Lyn Sha asked calmly, his voice bringing strength to Tu Sha by Chian. Boss Lin Sha Dinglay is still a trustworthy guy. He&#x27;s resting with his troops on the other side. Tu Shan by Chin whispered. He was really amazing just now.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s so strong. I feel like he could have taken on me and these 50 soldiers all by himself without his troops. What should I do? I&#x27;m so scared. Don&#x27;t worry. Dinglay made a promise in front of tens of thousands of people, and he won&#x27;t easily go back on his word.</p>
<p>Be on your guard tonight, and I&#x27;ll keep you safe. Tu Shan Bai Chin breathed a sigh of relief, patted her towering chest with lingering fear and said, &quot;By the way, brother Lyn Sha, I also have a recruitment token here. I&#x27;ll send it to you.&quot; &quot;All right.&quot; Lyn Sha accepted Tu Shan by Chin&#x27;s recruitment token without further ado. &quot;You&#x27;re lucky,&quot; Lyn Sha casually asked. He That&#x27;s because she&#x27;s a woman of destiny.</p>
<p>&quot;Brother Lyn Sha, what did you mean by correcting Ding Lay with those four words at the end?&quot; Tu Shan Bachin asked changing the subject. It&#x27;s an idiom. A clay chicken and a tiled dog. So Ding lay misspoke. Idioms.</p>
<p>They sound impressive. I&#x27;ve never heard of them before, but they feel somewhat familiar. Tu Shawn by Chin thought for a moment, then gave up, realizing her brain couldn&#x27;t process them. Boss, I&#x27;m going to take a break. You should get some rest, too.</p>
<p>Um, the pretty girl doesn&#x27;t know what idioms are. This thought suddenly flashed through Linhaos mind. How could that be? Lin Shiao was about to make a call to Chu Funga to ask. The main god system notified him again that an email had been sent. It was Chun Ningming, this tacetern kid who sent over a regular recruitment token.</p>
<p>Chun Ningming is quite fast, too. My luck seems pretty good. Lynn Shia rubbed his temples. It seems like I&#x27;m the only one who&#x27;s been having bad luck lately. No, it should be.</p>
<p>Why are all the underlings I recruit so lucky? I was lucky enough to get some good gear recently. Baoi came to Lin Xiao&#x27;s side and draped a cloak over his shoulders. My lord, the night is growing cold. Please take care of yourself. Feeling the gentle care of the beautiful woman beside him, Lynn Shiao gradually relaxed.</p>
<p>Okay, you can go ahead and get busy. Arriving at the battlefield of all races, he discovered some things he hadn&#x27;t noticed before. intricate and complex with countless threads. He talked about his own talents, his Chinese imperial edict, ba idioms, and the strange phrases occasionally uttered by people in the chat channel. I never thought of these things when I was on Earth.</p>
<p>He he don&#x27;t think too much about it. Funu also asked me to contact Chu Yusi, the city lord of Jangdong. It&#x27;s night now and the battlefield of the myriad races has basically subsided. It&#x27;s a good time to go find him. Lynn Sha opened the communication interface and entered Chu Yusi&#x27;s ID number one by one.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he felt a cool breeze blow past him, lifting his cloak. Lyn Shao turned around but saw nothing. The Mod Dao iron guard stood guard behind him. The divine arm archers patrolled in the distance. Pay Min was sitting with Saldin chatting and boasting.</p>
<p>And even Baoi must have just entered the Lord&#x27;s mansion. And it was unclear what she was busy with. Lyn Shao entered the number Chu Yui had given him again. Another gust of cold wind blew by the moment Lin Shao pressed the communication button. A thunderous boom erupted in Lin Xiaos mind and countless images flashed and replayed before his eyes.</p>
<p>He saw everything that happened after he entered the battlefield. He saw the demonic tide and the two succubi that emerged from behind it. He saw one of the succubi making eye contact with him. Then everything went black and I drifted to an unknown place. Chapter 66.</p>
<p>Did the ancient demon mistake someone? In that instant, Lyn Sha drifted to an unknown place. Strangely, Lyn Sha felt that although this place was unfamiliar, it was also somewhat familiar. Ba&#x27;s voice echoed in his mind. It looked ethereal and indistinct with no clear east, west, south, or north. There were no sun, moon, or stars in the sky, and no mountains or rivers on the ground.</p>
<p>There were buildings and pavilions there, and many people dressed in black. They were dressed in black and shrouded in black mist. Lyn Shao gradually regained consciousness and slowly came to his senses. He originally intended to call Chu Yusi, the lord of Jangdong city. But the moment he pressed the call button, he found himself in this mysterious place, the abode of ancient demons.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha slowly examined himself and discovered that he was currently just a mass of consciousness. Although he had a physical form, he could not move and was simply floating slowly. I reckon my body is still standing in front of my lord&#x27;s manor right now. What a brilliant tactic, Lynn Sha muttered to himself. I was actually dragged to the dwelling place of ancient demons.</p>
<p>What do they want to do? Before him lay a jumble of buildings, both real and elucory, a chaotic sky, a shattered earth, and gusts of cold wind blowing through the fragmented air. Chaotic, dilapitated, secluded, and strange. That was Lin Xiao&#x27;s first impression of this place. Between the overlapping real and elucory buildings, some figures like black mist drifted about just as Lyn Sha was observing. Three figures dressed entirely in black slowly floated over.</p>
<p>The three black figures were shrouded in black mist, revealing only a pair of inhuman eyes that emitted an eerie glow. A black sky and earth, a broken and overlapping space, an endless black fog, and eerie figures drifting by. He he. An eerie laugh rang out. The shadowy figures were all taken aback.</p>
<p>Second brother, you laughed first again. It wasn&#x27;t me. Third brother, is that you? I thought it was the boss laughing. Suddenly, all three dark figures turned to look at Lyn Sha, who was floating ahead. Lyn Sha awkwardly touched his nose.</p>
<p>Sorry. Seeing this opening made me want to have a laugh with everyone. The dark figures opposite him contracted sharply at the same time. Although they had no expression, Lin Shiao still felt a trace of embarrassment coming from them. The two remained silent.</p>
<p>Cough, cough. It seemed that Lyn Xiao&#x27;s preemptive judgment had ruined the atmosphere created by the shadowy figures. So, the shadowy figure known as the leader had no choice but to forcefully break the silence. Do you know who we are? Ancient demons, Lynsha said calmly. Aren&#x27;t you afraid of us? Lyn Sha glanced around.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m more curious about why you&#x27;ve brought me here since I&#x27;m completely defenseless right now. You could easily have dragged me into this place. If you wanted to harm me, you could have done so at any time. The leader of the shadowy figures nodded, a very calm judgment. The second shadowy figure, and he&#x27;s very bold.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha knew that he was still bothered by his strange laughter earlier, so he remained silent and waited to see what would happen. The third shadowy figure said, &quot;We&#x27;ve come to you to tell you a crucial ancient secret.&quot; Lyn Shaol, can I not listen? The third shadowy figure asked in surprise, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because I know that secrets mean trouble, especially the secrets of ancient demons, and I don&#x27;t want to get into trouble.&quot; The third shadowy figure and the other two exchanged a glance, looking somewhat at a loss. The shadowy leader, &quot;You&#x27;re very shrewd.&quot; the second shadowy figure. But you&#x27;re not shrewd enough. Have you forgotten how you came to this world? Lynho&#x27;s thoughts slowly settled down.</p>
<p>These ancient demons knew how they came to be, and their innermost speculations gradually became reality. He raised his head and stared straight at the dark figures opposite him, trying to discern something from their eyes. But the people on the other side were all shrouded in black mist, indistinct, and their expressions were impossible to discern. Seeing Lynn Shiao engrossed, the leader of the shadowy figures spoke again. I think we should build more trust in each other.</p>
<p>You must have thought about a lot of things and have many questions to ask. Let me tell you a secret first and you&#x27;ll know that we&#x27;re not enemies. Your token was given to you by us. Okay, if you have any other questions, feel free to ask. Lyn Sha thought to himself.</p>
<p>Just as I thought. He accidentally touched a Chinese token on Earth and was transported to this world to live in the body of a six-year-old orphan with the same name. It turns out that this was the work of these ancient demons. Who are they? What do they want? Who are you? Lyn Sha asked the question that concerned him most. He We are from ancient times.</p>
<p>He was slapped across the face by the leader of the shadowy figures interrupting him. The leader of the shadowy figures. You want to know who we really are? We are Chinese. The third shadowy figure&#x27;s voice was filled with size. Chinese? Wait, he&#x27;s Chinese? Not from Liao? A Chinese from Earth in Lin Xiaos previous life.</p>
<p>Fellow villager? Lyn Shiao asked in surprise. Fellow villager, I&#x27;m not from the same village. The leader of the shadowy figures shook his head. The second shadowy figure said, you&#x27;re way too familiar with yourself. You&#x27;ve only known us ancient demons for a short time, yet you&#x27;re already calling us so intimately.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re shameless, Lynn Shiao. You&#x27;re not from Earth, the shadowy figure asked. And what is this earth? Lynn Shiao. The country on Earth is called Hasha, and the country on blue star is called Lia. You two didn&#x27;t travel from another time.</p>
<p>The shadowy figure asked, &quot;What do you mean by time travel?&quot; The atmosphere between the two sides fell into an awkward silence once again. They ran towards each other, but when they got to each other, they realized they had mistaken one for the other. Or I raised a lion, let it grow up, and then released it back into the wild. Years later, I ran into it by chance and realized I&#x27;d mistaken it for a lion. Ahem Lyn Sha, aren&#x27;t you Chinese? The leader of the shadowy figures broke the awkward silence once again.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#x27;m Chinese, but you Chinese people don&#x27;t even know about Earth. Lyn Sha narrowed his eyes. This is too suspicious. You&#x27;re fake Chinese. The three dark figures looked at each other and for a moment they also showed a hint of weariness towards Lin Sha.</p>
<p>The second shadowy figure said, &quot;You don&#x27;t look Chinese either. We&#x27;ve never heard of the words you&#x27;re using.&quot; The third shadowy figure. Exactly. This kid might be a traitor&#x27;s creation to lure us in. He&#x27;s a fake Chinese brother.</p>
<p>The traitors might have discovered our hiding place. The shadowy figure suddenly became very nervous. For a moment, tensions rose between the two sides, and the atmosphere became extremely tense. After a moment of silence, the leader of the shadowy figures slowly raised his hand and said, &quot;Even if they are traitors, they don&#x27;t need to use such methods to lure us in.&quot; Using a rookie, &quot;Lynshia, are you being polite?&quot; The leader of the shadows said, &quot;How about this? We might have misunderstood each other. We can exchange secret signals to confirm if we are the same kind of people.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the words code, Lynhia&#x27;s expression became serious yet somewhat expectant. There are secret codes like the kind in time travel novels. I never expected to encounter this kind of scenario myself. It is truly a godsend for online novel readers. I&#x27;ve memorized countless codes just waiting for this day.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia, I&#x27;ll go first. Odd changes even stays the same. Three dark figures. What the hell? Chapter 67. The most powerful code.</p>
<p>The code that Lin Sha blurted out stopped in midair. If odd changes and even remains the same, it won&#x27;t connect. The shadowy figures behavior was completely unexpected. This made the atmosphere between the two sides even more tense. The leader of the shadowy figures remained silent for a moment, then slowly said, &quot;My turn, stranger.</p>
<p>If you can&#x27;t answer the code, you&#x27;re not the one we&#x27;re looking for. No matter who you are, whether you are a spy trained by a traitor or an innocent person who has strayed here by mistake, you must die to ensure the survival of our people and to keep our secrets. The third shadowy figure. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t reveal the secret. Second brother, shut up.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaos brain was also working at lightning speed. Could it really be a misunderstanding? Were the ancient demons not of Chinese descent? At this moment, he was dragged here by the shadows, which are the ancient demons, and he was left with only his consciousness unable to move. If the ancient demons wanted to kill him, it would be as easy as turning their hands at that time. Will my body turn into a vegetable during the battle for supremacy among all races? Poor Baoi hadn&#x27;t even had a chance to enjoy her healthy, youthful body. Lyn Xiaos thoughts were still racing when the leader of the shadowy figures slowly spoke.</p>
<p>The bright moonlight shines before my bed. What? Lin Xiao slowly leaned back, an expression of disbelief on his face. That&#x27;s it. Seeing Lyn Xiaos actions, the leader of the shadowy figures opposite assumed he couldn&#x27;t answer and raised his hands with lightning flickering amidst the swirling black mist. &quot;Is it frost on the ground?&quot; Lyn Sha said slowly.</p>
<p>The leader of the shadowy figures suddenly lowered his hands, puzzled, and said, &quot;You are indeed Chinese, but why don&#x27;t we understand what you&#x27;re saying?&quot; They actually used such childish poetry as a code. In an instant, a guest flashed through Lin Xiaos mind like lightning. He fired off a barrage of questions. Imperial jade liquor. The third shadowy figure shook his head.</p>
<p>Never drunk it. 30 years east of the river, 30 years west of the river. The second shadowy figure. Hey, that has a certain artistic conception. Is it from Wu Jingz? The scholars revitalized the Northwest.</p>
<p>The leader of the shadowy figures said, &quot;This is how China should be. We should not abandon our beautiful land.&quot; Lyn Xiaos guest gradually took shape, and his expression became playful. It&#x27;s almost certain. A few more code words. Lyn Sha, holding the sun and moon in my hands, plucking stars from the sky.</p>
<p>The leader of the shadowy figures. This poem is quite good with a very impressive momentum. Lynn Shiao continued. Watch closely. This slash is going to be really cool.</p>
<p>The second shadowy figure. What nonsense are you spouting? You&#x27;re an ideologist. How could you possibly have a knife? Lyn Sha unleashed his ultimate move. Rise again, my love. The three figures in black were all stunned and then they felt an extremely absurd and indescribable sensation rush from the soles of their feet to the top of their heads.</p>
<p>They all shivered then bent over and began to gag. What kind of code is this? It&#x27;s so unsettling. Sure enough, even the ancients couldn&#x27;t withstand the power of this certain da thinking to himself, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s guess has been confirmed. So, you are the ancient Chinese? The leader of the shadowy figures finally caught his breath and said weakly, still shaken, &quot;If you say we are ancient Chinese, that&#x27;s not wrong. After all, it&#x27;s been more than 5,000 years, and China has long become an outdated name.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve asked us for so many secret codes in one go, and even something as cruel as this lover. We need to ask you a few more secret codes, too.&quot; Lynn Sha nodded as you see fit. Hearing Lynn Sha use an idiom, the leader of the shadowy figure&#x27;s eyes lit up, seemingly somewhat pleased. He slowly asked, &quot;The country may be broken, but the mountains and rivers remain.&quot; Lyn Sha, in spring, the city is overgrown with weeds and trees. The leader of the shadowy figures nodded with satisfaction, and the second in command continued, &quot;He can draw his bow as full as the moon.&quot; Lyn Sha, looking northwest, I shoot the heavenly wolf.</p>
<p>The third shadowy figure, an ancient road, a west wind, and a lean horse. Lyn Sha, the sun sets in the west. A heartbroken traveler is at the ends of the earth. After the three lines of Tang poetry, song lyrics, and Yuan opera were used as coded messages, the three dark figures all breathed a sigh of relief. Second and third brothers, that should be right.</p>
<p>These are our fellow Chinese. After the war of betrayal more than 5,000 years ago, it would be wishful thinking for foreigners to memorize so many poems. The leader of the shadowy figures said with a hint of excitement. Brother, this is just junior high school poetry. Anyone from my country could answer it.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re making it sound like some kind of martial arts secret. Lyn Sha thought to himself. The second shadowy figure nodded repeatedly. That&#x27;s right. Even among the people of Long Shia, no one can remember a war of traitors more than 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Have the dragon Xiao people forgotten the Chinese people? Lyn Sha felt confused again. This didn&#x27;t match history, so he quickly asked a question. Lyn Sha, wait, who was the last emperor of China? The third shadowy figure sneered. If the Eizenjoro clan can be considered emperors of China, then the last emperor was Eizenjoro Zikian. Zaition, not Pi.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know him. Where was Empress Daertishi? Of course, she died of old age. After that, old hag died. Zaitian returned to the court and took power until the arrival of the god system. Did Empress Daajer Sishi not poison Emperor Guanchu? Did Guanu return to court? And also the main god system descends.</p>
<p>Wait, are you Chinese from blue star? Lynsha asked back. Otherwise, what? The third shadowy figure asked curiously. Are there other Chinese? Looks like I&#x27;ve encountered a parallel universe. That explains everything. Lynn Shia muttered to himself.</p>
<p>No wonder you don&#x27;t know modern memes, but are so familiar with Chinese history. The leader of the shadowy figures, however, keenly understood Linhaos meaning. You mean you&#x27;re a Chinese from another place? That&#x27;s right. Lynsha nodded and said, &quot;I am a Chinese from Earth. I am a Chinese from another planet, but my history is basically the same as yours.&quot; The three dark figures exchanged a glance, and the third one whispered, &quot;It seems we&#x27;ve lost the Hasha token a bit too far.&quot; The leader of the shadowy figures raised his head and looked at Lin Sha quietly, while Lin Sha looked at him quietly in return.</p>
<p>A moment later, the shadowy elder said, &quot;It&#x27;s all right. I felt the same blood flowing in his veins.&quot; Lyn Sha nodded. &quot;I can also feel your Chinese bloodline. We are all Chinese.&quot; After this exchange, the two parted ways and formally confirmed each other&#x27;s identities. &quot;Now, do you want to hear our secret?&quot; The leader of the shadowy figures said with a smile, &quot;It&#x27;s no use if you don&#x27;t listen because you are Chinese and you are ultimately on our side.&quot; Lyn Sha nodded.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d like to hear the details. With a wave of his hand, the leader of the shadowy figures vanished instantly along with three other figures. An endless sea of lava. Fiery lava spewed forth. Boiling steam filled the air, and a narrow, treacherous path stretched from the depths of darkness all the way to the center of the sea of lava.</p>
<p>There is a small island there. This small island stands alone amidst the lava, like a tiny, fragile boat on the waves. A stunningly beautiful succubus lay listlessly on a large bed in the palace at the center of the island. Beside her was an equally beautiful succubus who was peeling grapes one by one with her delicate hands and feeding them to her. Things are starting to get interesting.</p>
<p>The succubus swallowed the grape, tilted her long neck back and stretched. Master, has that man already met with the ancient demon? The magical mark I left has been activated. The ancient demon has already met him. The succubus lying on the bed was elegantly relaxed and simply said, &quot;How impatient master, what race are the ancient demons? From what I observe, they are no different from humans. So why are they called ancient demons? Eh, they were indeed a group of humans, or at least they used to be.</p>
<p>They once dominated all the heavens and myriad realms. Even we were once subjugated and trembled at their feet. Then they were betrayed by humanity. Betrayed by the very people they were protecting, utterly destroyed. Even history was erased and names became taboo just like us.</p>
<p>Chapter 68. The traitor&#x27;s historical shielding plan. Lynn Shiao and the three shadowy figures arrived at the elucory buildings and pavilions and entered a magnificent overlapping hall. Please sit down, you Chinese from another world. The shadowy leader and Lynn Shiao took their seats and began to slowly recount the story of the Chinese people in this world.</p>
<p>It turns out that the Chinese civilization on Earth and the Chinese civilization on blue planet are no different. They both started with the three sovereigns and five emperors and both had Chin Sher Huang, Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Taong of Tang and Emperor Taizu of Song. Even their experiences were the same. However, during theQing dynasty, Emperor Guangshu was not poisoned by Empress Daajard Sishi for some reason, but instead regained power after her death. Then, less than 10 years later, the main god system arrived.</p>
<p>On that day, the entire planet Earth seemed to plummet into the heavens, rising higher and higher until it plunged headlong into a different universe. Then all the nations and all the humans on the entire planet Earth who had awakened the Lord&#x27;s talent joined this endless battle that had been going on for countless millennia. As they continuously entered the battlefield of all races and fought against alien races and peoples, the world order was constantly changing. Gradually, those countries that were already powerful and those with real abilities became outstanding. Taking this opportunity, China also broke free from the poverty and weakness of the lateqing dynasty, shook off the Eisenjoro clan and established itself as the Chinese nation with a completely new organizational form of the battlefield of all races.</p>
<p>Finally, a human alliance was formed on Earth, led by many powerful nations such as China, Japan, Korea, India, Nanua, the British Empire, the Holy Roman Empire, Russia, the United States, and the Arab world. Together, they fought for supremacy against other races and species from all over the world in the battlefield of the myriad races. The human race of Blue Star entered the battlefield of all races more than 7,000 years ago. Lynn Sha nodded. As an Earthling, he easily and quickly accepted the explanation from the shadowy fellow villager.</p>
<p>After encountering the god system, this world on Earth not only failed to develop technology, but its technology even regressed because the rules of magic altered certain physical rules. Technology could no longer work. Instead, powerful lordly talents and supernatural powers run rampant. The human race of Blue Star has been involved in the battlefield of the myriad races for more than 7,000 years. Lynn Sha asked curiously, &quot;Then why is the human race still in the ninth heaven?&quot; Of the myriad races, has nine heavens.</p>
<p>Unlike Earth, the ninth heaven here is the most basic and introductory level. He, the leader of the shadowy figures, laughed, a laugh that was both weary and helpless. The second and third shadowy figures clenched their fists while the other looked up at the ceiling. &quot;This is the secret we&#x27;re going to tell you.&quot; &quot;Blue star once swept through everything and stormed into the third level of the battlefield of the myriad races,&quot; the leader of the shadowy figures said in a deep voice. &quot;And the main force of blue star at that time was none other than us, the Chinese military.&quot; &quot;What? Chinese military units once existed in this world? China once led the entire planet to dominate the battlefield of myriad races and even broke into the third heaven.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha frowned and said, &quot;Is the current situation caused by the traitors you mentioned before?&quot; The leader of the shadowy figure&#x27;s side exactly. We Chinese are born hardworking and brave and we are also influenced by the Confucianism of self-improvement. Even when theQing dynasty was temporarily ruled by the manshes such as Eisenjoro which led to the decline of our national strength and being bullied by other countries, we quickly turned against them after entering the battlefield of all races. And we Chinese in less than 200 years have become the most powerful race on earth in the battle for supremacy among all races. The leader of the shadowy figures stood with his hands behind his back, his head slightly tilted back as if reminiscing or longing for that era.</p>
<p>For the next 2,000 years, we Chinese led the human race of Blue Star to conquer all directions. We soared straight to the seventh heaven. The second shadowy figure continued, &quot;Haha, punching orcs, kicking undead. A glare from him and goblins and gnomes cower in terror. A roar and giants and trolls lose their minds.</p>
<p>Colonial dark elf girls, domesticated vampire noble women, exploited forest witches. Mermaids come to massage our feet with the flick of a finger. Angels are merely our servants guarding our homes, and devils are simply our protectors in our conquests. The capital of women of all realms and races. Before the second in command could say anything more, the eldest slapped him across the face again.</p>
<p>Shut up. You&#x27;re making us sound like some ancient demon. The third shadowy figure said, &quot;But second brother is right, eldest brother. You also have quite a few private photos of dark elf ladies. Get lost.&quot; The leader of the shadowy figures kicked the third brother hundreds of meters away.</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, then slowly brushed off imaginary dust from his body and regained his composure, saying, &quot;As you know, the Chinese are a peaceloving nation. They&#x27;re definitely not as evil as those two guys make them out to be. In short, you&#x27;ll know that the Chinese people in just 2,000 years led the entire human race into the third level of the battlefield of the myriad races vying for supremacy. Humanity has become a shining new star on the battlefield of all races. The shadowy figure paused again, then said, &quot;Until that war of traitors 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>That year, we were preparing for a great war with the protos in the third heaven.&quot; Right then, the shadowy figure became agitated. The Japanese, Korean, British, and other nations on Earth have suddenly joined forces to betray us, betray humanity. They launched a sneak attack on China from behind. They sold our intelligence to alien races and on several battlefields they joined forces with alien races to capture China&#x27;s strongholds. Chinese warriors counterattack immediately.</p>
<p>The earth shook and the stars shifted as the sun set. This battle lasted for a full 10 years. But the Chinese nation never expected to be betrayed by its own human compatriots and ultimately suffered a crushing defeat. At the last moment, the great powers of China used their might to open a space-time rift, leading the remnants of their army into it. But those traders still refuse to give up.</p>
<p>They want to completely annihilate US and destroy China. China still has countless citizens, and China once dominated the world for nearly 2,000 years. How easy is it to destroy China? At worst, the entire nation of China will fight to the death, and everything will perish. Therefore, the traders used the promise of not hunting down the Chinese warriors who were hiding in all the heavens and myriad worlds as a bargaining chip to carry out a 5,000-year long historical erasure of the Chinese nation. The leader of the shadowy figures said sadly, &quot;And you&#x27;ve seen the result,&quot; Lyn Sha suddenly realized.</p>
<p>&quot;No wonder he felt something was off after arriving at the battlefield of the myriad races in the Dragon Sea Kingdom. No one studies history, but no one objects as if it&#x27;s perfectly normal. Even he, who had lived two lives, did not feel anything strange. It was only when he arrived at the battlefield of the myriad races and was freed from his constraints that these unusual things kept echoing in his mind and aroused his vigilance. The entire Lia Kingdom has been shielded by top experts from the traitorous nations who have jointly set up a barrier to erase the history passed down through thousands of years of Chinese civilization.</p>
<p>The leader of the shadowy figures seemed to know what Lin Sha was thinking. And he slowly said, &quot;Schools don&#x27;t teach history. Family genealogies and county chronicles are all confiscated and destroyed in a fire. There are no oracle bone inscriptions, no Tang or song poetry, no Chinese myths or legends, no mythical creatures from the mountains and seas. The people of Lia only know Jesus and God, but they don&#x27;t know kuau chasing the sun.</p>
<p>No emperors or generals, no idioms or illusions, no famous works to be passed down. Even the entire land of China has been renamed Dragon Sa. The military units of Dragon Sa have all become westernstyle troops, even western monsters. Everything rever the west. Everyone bows down to western and Japanese culture.</p>
<p>The leader of the shadowy figures said with great distress, this is the current state of Langia. Within a few hundred years, the original inhabitants of Langia will be completely colonized just like the sudras and outcasts of the Indian tribe due to the loss of their culture. Chapter 69. Baoi could do whatever she wanted. Lyn Sha listened quietly.</p>
<p>Although he wasn&#x27;t a Chinese person from this world, he and the shadowy figure could feel a connection. The traitors have a grand scheme to go to the point of destroying the most powerful nation on Earth. They have been implementing a cultural shielding and cultural invasion plan for thousands of years. But when I was fighting against Jiao Daong and the others, didn&#x27;t they also say trust me or trust Chin Shir Huang? Dingle, Chufunga, and Hay have all used idioms. Lin Shiao immediately raised his question.</p>
<p>My fellow countrymen of Liao, our descendants are ultimately stronger than we imagined. Hearing Lyn Xiaos question, the leader of the shadowy figures, felt a sense of relief. The power of habit is great. Even with the shield that covers the entire Long Shia, even though we have not studied history for 5,000 years and have been constantly eroded by Western and Japanese culture, a few Lshia people will still occasionally utter an idiom and mention the names of one or two people. These idioms and names are already considered taboo knowledge passed down from aristocratic families.</p>
<p>But if you ask them, they definitely won&#x27;t know who Chin Sher Huang is or what the idiom means. Not to mention uttering a single line of poetry. Lin Sha finally understood that the inaccurate idioms he had encountered and the nonsensical appearance of Chin Sher Huang were all due to the traitors historical shielding. No wonder there are no Chinese military units in this world except for ourselves. Hei, we&#x27;ve been chatting for too long.</p>
<p>The shadowy leader said, I have something important to discuss with you. As you know, in order to protect us, this group of ancient Chinese warriors hiding in the rifts of time and space, the dragon people abandoned their own history. But the traitors did not keep their promise. For the past 5,000 years, they have never ceased their pursuit. The third shadowy figure said angrily.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve even been dubbed ancient demons. For nearly a thousand years, some unsuspecting Long Sha people have even joined the hunt. This is absolutely outrageous. This is a heartless act. These traitors have gone too far.</p>
<p>Aside from the title ancient demon, I actually quite like it. He Before the second shadowy figure could finish speaking, the eldest and third brothers slapped him on the forehead. Seeing this, Lyn Sha shook his head and slowly said, &quot;So, what do you want me to do? It&#x27;s too early to tell you what to do now.&quot; The leader of the shadowy figures said in a deep voice, &quot;It took us 3,000 years to create the Hashia token, which can summon the heroic spirits of emperors and generals of China over thousands of years. You have already witnessed its power. We originally intended to entrust the Hasha token to the most powerful warrior among the surviving ancient demons, but some suggested that it should be given to the current dragon Sia domain lord, that young lady, as she might still possess the Hasha heritage.</p>
<p>But the first time we used the Hasha token, it flew towards you on its own initiative and chose you, the third shadowy figure said in a deep voice. Listen to Lin Xiaawuas order. It is the key to saving the Chinese nation and ensuring the survival of Chinese civilization. It is also the key to helping the Lia people regain their cultural confidence and become true descendants of the Chinese nation. If you have lofty ambitions, the Hasha decree is still the key to bringing the Hasha race and even the human race back to the pinnacle of the battlefield of all races.</p>
<p>The leader of the shadowy figures chuckled twice. Without our China, these traitors and even the entire human race of blue star can only survive in the ninth heaven. It&#x27;s truly disappointing. But the leader of the shadowy figures changed his tone. Our only requirement for you now is survive.</p>
<p>Hide your true strength live until you are fully grown. Don&#x27;t trust anyone. The three figures in black spoke in unison. Their voices extremely serious. That&#x27;s why I came to inform you in advance.</p>
<p>The shadowy elder said. Although no Chinese warriors have appeared for 5,000 years, there are still some immortal traitors on the battlefield of all races. They might still remember the name of the Chinese warriors if they discover you and us. Any connection with our ancient demons will be nipped in the bud. Therefore, preserve your strength, survive, and wait until you are strong enough.</p>
<p>Once you are strong enough to overthrow the traitors, you can rightfully make a name for the Chinese military. On this battlefield of myriad races, there are many geniuses who can create their own troops and countless lord talents. As long as you use some techniques, you can hide yourself very well. Most importantly, don&#x27;t get into conflicts with people casually, the leader of the shadowy figure said earnestly. Also, don&#x27;t reveal your Chinese military branch casually.</p>
<p>The second shadowy figure earnestly instructed. Add one more thing. In the battlefield of all races, one must always keep a low profile. The third shadowy figure added. Lyn Sha, you should have said so earlier.</p>
<p>Three shadowy figures. We&#x27;re late, aren&#x27;t we? Lyn Sha shook his head. It&#x27;s all right. I&#x27;ve taken care of it. If you eliminate the people causing the conflict, the conflict will cease.</p>
<p>If you kill anyone who sees the Chinese soldiers, then no one will see them anymore. Once everyone who knew I wasn&#x27;t Loki is dead, no one will know I wasn&#x27;t Loki anymore. Who exposed himself with the divine crossbow was merely called the Gust Archer. Lyn Sha now knows the real reason why the ancient demon sought him out. It was to warn him to be careful and not to expose himself.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lyn Sha remembered something else. You sent Ba here, but then she failed you at the crucial moment. Was that your doing? He he that s right? The second shadowy figure laughed. Why do this? Lyn Sha thought to himself. Sure enough, Ba&#x27;s inexplicable period is definitely related to these cackling Chinese elders.</p>
<p>Get Ba&#x27;s loyalty to 100 before taking her down. It will be more beneficial for you. The second shadowy figure gave a knowing look. Lyn Shia, they&#x27;re already at 90% loyalty and can do whatever they want. Is this still not allowed? Also, aren&#x27;t you from another universe? How come you also use the word push down? The shadowy figure remained silent.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha shook his head again and asked, &quot;Is there anything else you wanted to say to me this time? Be wary of any attempts to win us over. Don&#x27;t join any of Lshia&#x27;s organizations, not even the official ones. We don&#x27;t know how deep the waters run here or how many traders have already infiltrated, the shadowy leader said slowly. That&#x27;s why we went to the trouble of using magical markings to find you in advance. Also, this time when you&#x27;re aiming for a second tier university, don&#x27;t try to be number one again.</p>
<p>If you compete for first place, it will likely break records. The god system will announce it throughout the entire blue star. Moreover, winning first place twice in a row could attract the attention of the entire blue star. At that time, you won&#x27;t be able to keep a low profile even if you want to. Lynn Sha suddenly remembered, &quot;Was it you who changed the last announcement about the god system?&quot; Lynn Sha remembers that the announcement was downgraded from a worldwide announcement to a regionwide announcement, and even the legendary treasure chest reward was reduced to an epic treasure chest.</p>
<p>Exactly. The third shadowy figure replied. Then why not just keep making changes this time? The third shadowy figure said helplessly. It&#x27;s too tiring to revise it once. I don&#x27;t have the strength to revise it a second time.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m so tired. I don&#x27;t have the strength to revise it a second time. So they told me not to compete for first place. Lyn Sha shook his head and another thought popped into his mind. This is truly a kind yet weak ancient demon.</p>
<p>Chapter 70. the secrets to using the Hasha decree, seemingly sensing Lin Xiao&#x27;s doubts, the third shadowy figure added. Don&#x27;t worry, you can still snatch the top spot from the third tier universities. I know the first place reward in the threebook system is very important to you since it adds a hero slot and once you enter the official server, you won&#x27;t be able to upgrade your manner to recruit a hero. We&#x27;re just reminding you that the chances of a novice winning three consecutive titles are very high, attracting the attention of the higher realms.</p>
<p>For you right now, the risk is very high. Lynn Sha remained silent. He had also learned about people in school who ranked first in the entire region across all three levels of university entrance exams. These people were being described by the shadowy figure as winning three consecutive top honors. However, all of these people later became prominent figures on the entire blue star and even in the ninth heaven.</p>
<p>The shadowy figures warning was very timely because I&#x27;m going to be promoted to a second tier university tonight. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, thanks to my powerful eternal peace talent, I&#x27;m guaranteed to be number one in the second tier university again. Now, I have no choice but to give up first place. Fortunately, the first place in the second tier universities only gets a reward chest. &quot;All right, if there&#x27;s nothing else, I&#x27;ll head back now,&quot; Lin Sha said calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Is the flow of time here the same as outside?&quot; &quot;Of course, they&#x27;re the same. We&#x27;re also a rift in the nine heavens. How could there be a difference in the flow of time?&quot; The third shadowy figure asked in surprise. &quot;Could there be places where the flow of time is different?&quot; Lyn Sha felt that whenever technical issues were discussed, the third shadowy figure would answer them quite enthusiastically. Unexpectedly, the third shadowy figure seemed to have a new world opened up to him because of his question, and he fell into a days.</p>
<p>The flow of time can be different. He kept muttering to himself, &quot;Never mind. I&#x27;ve never actually seen a place where the flow of time is different. I&#x27;ve only heard about it.&quot; Lyn Sha thought to himself. I&#x27;ve heard about this in online novels.</p>
<p>But since the flow of time is the same, and I&#x27;ve been talking to you here for quite a while, the people in the territory must be worried about me. Seeing this, the second shadowy figure understood and said, &quot;He, young friend, Lyn Shia, are you worried that Ba is plotting something against you? Don&#x27;t worry. Even without 100 loyalty points, you can still force your way in.&quot; The leader of the shadowy figures tried to raise his hand, but the second in command quickly dodged the attack. &quot;Speaking of Baoi, you actually stopped me and Baoi from consummating our marriage,&quot; Lin Shao said suspiciously. &quot;So that means you can use the Hasha token to see my activities.</p>
<p>If something happens between me and Baoi, you won&#x27;t spy on me, will you? I can&#x27;t see it,&quot; the shadowy elder said. We can only sense your approximate location and the status of the Hasha order. Then why was the timing of Bao&#x27;s period so coincidental? That&#x27;s the succubus princess&#x27;s magical mark. It&#x27;s visible. The leader of the shadowy figures was somewhat embarrassed.</p>
<p>Then she passed it on to us. Lyn Sha remained expressionless. Then we did something shady. Lyn Sha, but don&#x27;t worry. The magical mark has been ineffective since you came here.</p>
<p>From now on, we&#x27;ll use our own secret code to communicate. The leader of the shadowy figures quickly uttered a coded message, then said, &quot;Indeed, it&#x27;s getting late. I&#x27;ll take you back now to avoid any further complications.&quot; &quot;Okay,&quot; Lyn Sha added. &quot;Since the Hasha token was created by you, what are the tricks to using it? Please enlighten us, Ancient Demon Senior.&quot; Lyn Shiao immediately told the shadowy figure about his confusion regarding summoning the heroic spirits of China. Oh, that&#x27;s the problem.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s no big deal. I&#x27;ll show you how to use it right away. He the Hasha token can be upgraded and there will be more usage tips after the upgrade. Goodbye, young friend from China. We&#x27;ll meet again someday.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, the leader of the shadowy figures sent Lin Xiao&#x27;s consciousness plunging into a spatial temporal turbulence once more on the verge of losing contact with this place shrouded in black mist. Suddenly, Lyn Sha shouted again, &quot;What does that succubus have to do with us?&quot; It was just mutual exploitation. The leader&#x27;s voice came from afar. Then, everything spun around and Lynn Shia returned to his body. He was already standing in front of the Lord&#x27;s mansion in the battlefield of the myriad races vying for supremacy.</p>
<p>Beside him, Baoi and Pay Min watched him nervously. Not far away, Tang Yi and Song Ruer along with a group of burly Chinese men surrounded him, vigilantly observing the surrounding area. Upon seeing Lin Shiao open his eyes, both Baoi and Pay men were overjoyed, and Baoi immediately pounced on him. My lord, it&#x27;s so good to see you&#x27;re all right. Ba&#x27;s voice trembled slightly.</p>
<p>Whether it was a genuine expression of emotion or the nature of a vixen, it was hard to tell. A warm feeling flashed through Linhaos heart. How long have I been standing here? Reporting to the Lord, it has been more than half an hour. Pay Min replied, the hour or so was roughly the same as the time it took me to go to the ancient demons place. Do I have any other abnormalities? My lord merely stood silently and I was unable to rouse him.</p>
<p>So I waited until young master pay Min and Tang Ye were free before summoning them. Lyn Sha realized that Baoi was the first to notice his abnormality. Wait a minute. Can you free your hands now? What happened? Lyn Sha asked. Just now while the Lord was in meditation, a large group of demons and monsters suddenly attacked from the darkness outside the territory.</p>
<p>Ba replied. Young Master Pay Min and his soldiers immediately organized a defense and the killing was completed just half an hour ago. That there were still traces of blood on the swords of Tang Yi and the others who were surrounding them to be attacked by monsters at night for no reason. This is an unheard of phenomenon. The battlefield of all races is very dangerous at night.</p>
<p>But in the newbie zone, apart from specific settings such as triggering demonic tides and beast tides, there are no other attacks at night. Lyn Sha immediately led everyone to the entrance of the territory. From the territory gate to the outside of the wall, there were still many remains of bones and remains that had not yet been melted or refreshed. That must have been a defensive battle organized by Pay Min. The MO Dao iron guards held the gate while the divine arm archers and phantom archers fired from behind, successfully defending against the attack.</p>
<p>Lynsha looked at the remains and bones. There are many of them, mostly low-level demons and orcs, plus some exceptional units like fierce demons and berserkers. It&#x27;s probably equivalent to a C to be level demon tide difficulty. With the presence of the Chinese troops, the formidable swordsmen pay men and bao sees breathtaking beauty holding the line should be a close call. After a moment of contemplation, Lyn Shao nodded and said to everyone, &quot;Thank you all for your hard work.&quot; Just now, I had a sudden inspiration and gained some insights, and I instantly entered a meditative state.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to everyone who defended the Lord&#x27;s manner. We swear to serve our lord to the death. The crowd shouted in unison. Ba also glanced at Lyn Sha as if she knew something, but her eyes were full of trust and loyalty to Lyn Sha. Looking at the beautiful woman beside him, Lynsha nodded.</p>
<p>He would have a good chat with this peerless enchantress about human nature. Later, unfortunately, the second shadowy figure said it&#x27;s best to reach 100% trust before taking her down. This defensive battle fought without his presence was easily withstood. Lynn Shiao couldn&#x27;t help but marvel at the strength of his troops and their invincible heroism. With Bowsi around, defending the city is much easier.</p>
<p>Just the 100% increase in health and then never retreat. Perk is enough to get you a lord talent of a rank or higher. Since everyone has been so supportive, a reward is definitely in order. Everyone follow me. Tonight, we&#x27;ll cook some spirit rice porridge and roast some barbarian beef to treat you all.</p>
<p>Long live the lord. Chapter 71. Three choices. Meanwhile, inside the destroyed castle, Dinglay, who had already turned off his live stream, was leaning against the wall, bandaging his wounds. He glanced at Tu Shawn by Chin in the distance from time to time, and noticed that the little girl was also watching him wearily.</p>
<p>Just then, a communication call came in. A masked man appeared on the other end of the communication. Excellent performance. Your strength is even greater than I imagined. The masked man affirmed in a low voice as soon as the communication connected.</p>
<p>They actually managed to defeat the death knight. You flatter me. It was just a bit of luck. Nothing to brag about. Dinglay said casually.</p>
<p>Huh? Still with that arrogant attitude. Seeing him makes me want to punch the masked man. Did you get any good gear after killing the death knight? the masked man asked. After all, it was your first time playing, and you were challenging someone of a higher level. He he guessed.</p>
<p>Dinglay did not give a direct answer. The masked man narrowed his eyes, seemingly increasingly disliking Ding Lay&#x27;s nonchalant demeanor, and said again, &quot;That stupid, beautiful woman is still in the castle, right? Just capture her, and if you can&#x27;t, kill her on the spot. You have a slaying talisman, right? You won&#x27;t be punished for killing her.&quot; Why? Dinglay remained indifferent. You ask me why? The masked man raised his voice. I gave you so many troops precisely so you could deal with Lyn Shiao, didn&#x27;t I? Liaos vassal lord is not far from you now.</p>
<p>Killing her, even without Lyn Xiaos help, is a piece of cake for your strength just now. That stupid woman may not have many troops, but her centaur lord is quite powerful in the beginner area. By doing this, you&#x27;ve wiped out one of Linhao&#x27;s arms. He Dinglay laughed. I won&#x27;t do it.</p>
<p>Why? The masked man retorted. The deal we made is to deal with Lyn Sha, not anyone else. But the beautiful woman is also a vassal lord of Lyn Sha. Wouldn&#x27;t killing her weaken Lyn Sha. If she were on the front lines fighting against me, Lyn Sha would have a legitimate reason to kill her, but that&#x27;s not the case now.</p>
<p>Dinglay wiped his long sword and slowly sheathed it. Besides, I promised not to lay a hand on her in front of tens of thousands of people in the liveream. A promise? What&#x27;s a promise worth? There&#x27;s no contract. He Dinglay slowly stood up, put his hands behind his back, and looked up at the sky. Wong Su, the top 100 expert lord in the Lan region, may not have a promise to you, but he may have no promise to others, but to me, it&#x27;s very valuable.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re in the top 100,&quot; the masked man snapped angrily. &quot;And you have no right to bargain with me. You took my recruitment token, so you have to work for me. Got it. I&#x27;ll handle dealing with Lin Sha.&quot; Dinglay abruptly shut down the communication.</p>
<p>Huh? My talent doesn&#x27;t allow me to do this kind of thing. I can only use my own methods. With this weapon, we are even more confident in dealing with Lin Shiao. After saying that, Dinglay took out another weapon from his spatial storage. An iceb blue long sword surrounded by wisps of cold air.</p>
<p>A ferocious skull was also carved on the hilt of the long sword. Meanwhile, while the heroes and soldiers were happily eating and drinking, Lyn Sha quietly left and went to the lord&#x27;s mansion. I promised Fongu I would contact Chu, you see, so let&#x27;s do it now. Lyn Sha pressed the ID number again, and this time the call finally went through successfully. On the other end of the communication interface, a middle-aged man in a suit and tie with an extraordinary demeanor appeared on the virtual screen.</p>
<p>Hello, Lord Chu. Lyn Shia, I&#x27;m so glad you came to see me. Chu Yusi wore a warm smile. Fungu and I have mentioned you many times and told me about your situation. Let&#x27;s get straight to the point.</p>
<p>Chu Yusis expression turned serious regarding your dealings with Xiao Daong and Gene Dang. This time you did not make any mistakes in terms of the rules of the battlefield of 10,000 races. However, you were a little too hasty in terms of actual operation. Lyn Shao was slightly puzzled. The city lord here to demand an explanation.</p>
<p>Seeing Lin Xiaos confusion, Chu Yusi&#x27;s tense face relaxed and he slowly said, &quot;If it were me, I would deal with Gene Dang, who was live streaming first and then take down Xiaoang. That way I would minimize the impact of the situation. Those two scumbags deserve to die. You did the right thing. Having said that, Chu Yusi looked up to the sky and laughed loudly.</p>
<p>Hara, well done. Lyn Shia breathed a sigh of relief. If they weren&#x27;t here to interrogate him, then they were here to win him over. Chu Yusi spoke quickly. The reason I asked you to come to me this time is actually nothing more than that I&#x27;ve already heard the announcement that the black flame lord of the official district is going to break through the district and deal with you.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid of the arrival of the broken zone. I can also arrange for a master to arrive to protect you. If there&#x27;s not enough time, I can provide other assistance. Even if that sneaky masked lord or some top 100 lord comes down in person, I can make sure he never returns. Shu Yui truly lived up to his reputation as a madman from Jangd Dong.</p>
<p>This disdainful attitude of his son was passed down to him. Thank you, city lord, but I don&#x27;t want to trouble you. Lyn Shao pondered for a moment, then slowly spoke. What? Chu Yui seemed not to have heard clearly. What did you say? Lyn Shia did not want to trouble the city lord.</p>
<p>He only wanted to deal with the lord who had broken through the district this time on his own. Why do you say that? I didn&#x27;t even negotiate any conditions. I was just offering you protection. Chui asked puzzled. You made this mess, so you have to take responsibility for it.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao said slowly. One should take responsibility for one&#x27;s own actions. I don&#x27;t want to involve the city lord and phone go. Chu Yusi stared blankly at Lin Shiao for several seconds, then suddenly realized, well, Chu Yusi nodded slowly. Not long ago, Jabbron came to me and said that I had three choices.</p>
<p>One was to accept my offer without hesitation, even though my help was unconditional. But if you choose this path, you can at most grow into a top ranking ranger lord in the dragon summer domain, fighting for the dragon summer domain in the blue star realm. Second, ask about my conditions, negotiate with me, or only ask for limited assistance and repay it quickly. Someone like you could become a topranked ranger lord on the blue star battlefield, conquering the ninth heaven. The third option was to politely decline my help after clarifying my conditions.</p>
<p>Chu Yusi&#x27;s face was grave, but a sharp glint flashed in his eyes. The prophet said that you will suffer endless hardships, but as long as you survive, you may become a great hero of the blue star world. I didn&#x27;t expect you to refuse my help without even asking my conditions. Do you know something? Or what makes you think you can do this? Chu Yusi&#x27;s expression grew colder and colder and his aura slowly emanated, reaching Lin Shiao through the screen. The madman of Jang Dong, the city lord of Jang Dong, sincerely tried to recruit him, but was rejected by a greenhorn who had just started out, and they rejected him without even hearing his conditions.</p>
<p>Where does that leave him with his pride? Lyn Shao first gave a ry smile, then calmly said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think about whether I can succeed. Since I have chosen the distant horizon, I will only brave the wind and rain to get there.&quot; Lord Shu Lyn Sha has no disrespect for you. But this disaster was caused by me, and it will end because of me. If I need to ask for help, even for a simple trial in the beginner zone, how can I ever achieve my goal of becoming the ruler? Chapter 72. send someone to protect him.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think about whether I can succeed. Since I&#x27;ve chosen the distant horizon, I&#x27;ll just brave the wind and rain to get there. If I need to ask for help, even for a simple trial in the beginner&#x27;s area, how can I ever achieve my goal of becoming the dominant force? Chu Yusi pondered Lin Xiaos words, lost in thought. That&#x27;s wonderful. Having chosen the distant horizon, I braved wind and rain to reach it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never heard this saying before, yet it&#x27;s so philosophical. This is the masterpiece that made a modern poet famous in my world, Lynn Sha thought to himself. Chu Yusi was, after all, a decent person. He wouldn&#x27;t really be angry because Lyn Sha refused his help. On the contrary, he admired Lin Sha even more because of his integrity.</p>
<p>Is this why you with only an F rank lord talent were able to get first place in a book and even create the Gust Archer, becoming the first lord this year to create a new troop type. Kid, you&#x27;re really good. Chu Yusi nodded appreciatively. I originally intended to send people to help you without imposing any restrictions on you. It was just an investment.</p>
<p>The only thing you would have to give up was that you would be labeled as part of the Gangdong City Lords faction in the future. This is a good thing. It will make countless villains think twice before they want to mess with you. But it&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing because you will have fewer trials and tribulations. You have the ability and the ambition.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s good, but this will make you very tired and your road ahead will be full of hardships. Chu Yusi sighed, his eyes seemingly filled with emotion. If only Chufinga had your level of awareness. Although he&#x27;s arrogant, he still has his own talent to back him up. and I&#x27;m there to support him.</p>
<p>How many people in this world can truly rely solely on themselves? Chu Yusi shook his head and added, &quot;Since this is your choice, I can only respect it. This crisis is entirely up to you.&quot; To use a trendy phrase, &quot;It&#x27;s like saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand, but I respect it.&quot; Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;Do you think I don&#x27;t want to rely on powerful figures? But now the ancient demons are telling me that the Chinese troops can&#x27;t be easily exposed and I have to endure it until I reach the official server. The map there is huge. Even if you&#x27;re exposed and attacked, you might not be able to find the coordinates. Thank you, Lord City Lord.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha remained calm on the surface, waiting for Chu Yusi to hang up the communication. Lyn Sha, is there some secret? Chu Yusi shook his head, then dialed another person&#x27;s number. After a short wait, the communication was established. A cold, authoritative voice came from the other end, &quot;What&#x27;s the situation?&quot; Chu Yusi lowered his head slightly and said in a respectful tone, &quot;He refused my help. A third option, no.&quot; He didn&#x27;t even hear the end of my conditions.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence on the other end of the communication. &quot;Send a few people. Protect him secretly.&quot; Shu Yui suddenly looked up. &quot;Could it be that you want to?&quot; Chu Yusi extended his right hand, clenched his fist, raised his thumb, and pulled it from his left shoulder to his right shoulder, making a throat slitting motion. A moment of silence, a cold voice, tinged with annoyance, said, &quot;Chui, stop making such vulgar gestures in front of me.</p>
<p>And where did you learn your skill of guessing what your superiors want?&quot; Chu Yusi was somewhat surprised. Could it be that I guessed right? The cold voice rose three octaves. What do you think? He he just kidding. Your majesty always has such a serious face. I&#x27;m just trying to help you relax.</p>
<p>Before Lqings voice could fully erupt, Chu Yusi quickly said, &quot;I will definitely send someone to protect Lin Sha in secret. But since he has chosen not to need help, why should we keep pestering him?&quot; The cold voice slowly said, &quot;I will only tell you that Jabbron told me that he observed that Lias fate was inextricably linked to this boy. My first prophet Lord, he has never been wrong in his predictions. Therefore, if he is loyal to Lang Shiao, we must help him become a regional hijgemon. But if he is recruited by other countries or forces and goes astray, Chu Yusi raised his head and saw the current number one person in the Dragon Sia domain on the other side of the screen slowly making a throat slitting gesture.</p>
<p>Chu Yusi. Meanwhile, Lyn Sha finished communicating with Chu Yusi. He then simply inspected his territory and took stock of his resources. Open the resource panel. Lords all resources panel.</p>

<p>Hero, Sword, Saint Pay Min, level 12. Ba, level one. I have already met the conditions for upgrading my lord&#x27;s mansion to level two. Lynn Shia opened the panel and confirmed it again. Upgrade requirements.</p>
<p>Prerequisite buildings. Tavern 1/1. Spirit field May 1st. Saved. Required resources 5,000 wood, 5,000 stone, 3,000 iron or 3,000 copper or 500 refined iron, 500 refined copper.</p>
<p>Saved. Let&#x27;s listen to the shadows this time. Let&#x27;s not upgrade yet. Let&#x27;s postpone it until tomorrow morning. If there are no calculation errors, Dugu Jaolan should have used a very rare acceleration spell and will complete the upgrade to tier 2 between tomorrow morning and noon.</p>
<p>I clicked to upgrade again in the morning and it took 12 hours until 8 or 9 p.m. for the upgrade to be completed. If we can&#x27;t get first place, we can still get into the top 10. At the same time, I also need to get into a third tier university as soon as possible. This the resources for the three levels are hard to obtain.</p>
<p>I was originally going to farm the destruction castle again tomorrow and be able to collect most of the materials for the three levels, but Ding Lay actually farmed the destruction castle first. Thinking of Ding Lay and his unusual behavior, Lyn Shao casually dialed the number of the beautiful girl. Chapter 73. in-depth communication with Baoi. As soon as the call connected, two Snow White figures came into view on the other end of the screen.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha was suddenly shocked. What a deaf perspective is Tu Shan by Chin doing? Upon closer inspection, Lyn Sha realized they were two fluffy snow white animal paws. Tu Shan Chen, what are you doing? Boss Lin Sha, keep your voice down. I&#x27;m observing Dinglay. Tonchian said in a low voice.</p>
<p>She had transformed into a snow white fox perched on the centaur leader&#x27;s back and was secretly watching Ding lay opposite her. Through her perspective, Lyn Sha could also see the man opposite her who had just gone through a major battle. After the little sister turns into a fox, she can see farther and is not greatly affected in dark environments. So that&#x27;s how it is. No wonder Tu Shawn by Chin style suddenly changed so drastically.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha thought to himself, secretly confirming Tu Shan by Chins point and thinking that this woman did have some brains. He didn&#x27;t do anything to you, did he? No, boss. Lin Shiao Ding Lay seems to be quite law-abiding. Tu Sha by Chin whispered. He seemed to have received a call just now, but it was too far away for me to hear what he said.</p>
<p>Is there anything else unusual? H I think I saw Ding Lelay get a weapon and he just took it out to clean it. Tan by Chin chuckled. He thought I couldn&#x27;t see this side, but I can see it perfectly clearly. It was a great sword that looked a lot like the weapon in the hands of a death knight. It was ice blue and looked very sharp.</p>
<p>There was also a skull on the hilt. Could this be that weapon? Lyn Sha had a guess in his mind. That&#x27;s a very dangerous weapon. Be careful, Lyn Sha warned. If Ding Lay brings it up again, you must observe it carefully, and it would be best to take a screenshot for me.</p>
<p>Okay, boss Lyn Sha. After ending his communication with the beautiful girl, Lynn Sha returned to the Lord&#x27;s manor. I went over all the matters in my mind one last time. It&#x27;s late at night. It&#x27;s time to rest.</p>
<p>Upgrading to a second tier university will be tomorrow morning. As Lyn Sha walked into the bedroom, a beautiful figure suddenly appeared before him. This humble servant will attend to the lord&#x27;s bath. The stunningly beautiful enchantress Ba had just bathed. Her black silk cascaded down her shoulders like a waterfall, and her face was fair and flawless, as if sculpted from ice crystal.</p>
<p>With a blush and shinyness on her face, she bowed deeply and came over to remove Lyn Xiaos armor. Not far away, behind a screen, a bathtub was already filled with hot water. Feeling the service of the stunningly beautiful woman, Lyn Zhiaos emotions gradually stirred. He looked at Baoi, but Baoi seemed to know his thoughts. Her head was lowered deeply, and the blush on her face extended to her slender neck.</p>
<p>Bowsi was not wearing the forest witch&#x27;s cloak, but only a close-fitting undergarment with a light gauze overlay. Lyn Shao was immediately filled with admiration and fascination. Ba Lyn Xiaos voice was gentle and captivating. Grown-ups. Baosi let out a soft moan and almost leaned against Lin Sha.</p>
<p>Did you run the bathwater? H, it was I who did it. Did you move this huge bucket here? Yes, you&#x27;re really strong. Lynn Sha patted Ba on the shoulder to show his approval. Ba stood there dumbfounded. Lyn Shiao, by the way, did you wash it? Huh? This humble servant dares not accept that your highness&#x27;s soup is fresh.</p>
<p>Oh. Taking advantage of Bao&#x27;s dazed state, Lyn Sha took off all his clothes and jumped into the bathtub. The comforting hot water made Lynn Sha feel completely relaxed from his toes all the way to the top of his head, and he couldn&#x27;t help but groan with satisfaction. A pair of warm, slender hands then rested on Linhao&#x27;s shoulders. Gently gather, slowly twist, smear, and pick.</p>
<p>First, it&#x27;s the rainbow skirt, then the six melodies. Is my technique satisfactory, my lord? Satisfy. Lyn Shao closed his eyes and lay in the bathtub, enjoying the comfort of the beauty. Although Bao&#x27;s technique was clumsy, her seductive talent was undeniable, and even a casual pinch was enough to feel comfortable. Lynhos tense nerves, which had been stretched taut since entering the battlefield of myriad races, were relieved at this moment.</p>
<p>He relaxed, his mind blank, and rested freely. After a moment, Lyn Shao asked, &quot;Baoi, I saw an ancient demon today.&quot; The little hand behind her back paused for a moment. &quot;Is this the time for the Lord to enter meditation?&quot; &quot;Exactly.&quot; Ba remained silent for a moment, then slowly said, &quot;My Lord, although I was saved by an ancient demon, I do not understand them. I am grateful to the ancient demon for bringing me to your side, but I am utterly loyal to my lord.&quot; Lynsha kept his eyes closed, his hands resting on either side of the bathtub. The rising steam brushed against his face, making him appear exceptionally handsome.</p>
<p>He spoke slowly, his magnetic voice remarkably calm. Do not panic, Ba. You&#x27;ve told me everything you needed to say. I believe you. The hands behind his back seemed to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>This time, I specifically asked the ancient demon a question about you. About me? Ba&#x27;s voice was filled with curiosity. Your menstrual period was caused by ancient evil spirits. They triggered a mark in your body, causing you to have your period early. Oh.</p>
<p>Ba covered her mouth in surprise. How could this be? Why is that? Because they said that once your loyalty reaches 100 points, they can take you down and I can get a bigger benefit from it. Ba was at a loss for words after Lynn Shia bluntly asked her, &quot;What do you mean pull down? This humble servant already belongs entirely to your highness. You already belong to me completely? Lyn Sha asked deliberately. Ba&#x27;s voice was barely audible.</p>
<p>The kind where you can do whatever you want. Ba&#x27;s voice was almost inaudible. Ding. You have aroused Ba&#x27;s shyness. Ba sees two elements reversal.</p>
<p>Luck value has increased to minus 83. Lyn Sha was overjoyed. Had it improved again? He guessed its loyalty had increased a bit too. Why is this vixen even more shy than me in some ways? Let&#x27;s strike while the iron is hot. Lyn Sha nodded slowly and said, &quot;Since that&#x27;s the case, I have already warned the ancient demons that this will not happen again.</p>
<p>I shall not do anything to you again. Also, that mark is a one-time use item and will not take effect again.&quot; I told the ancient demons, &quot;My woman cannot be manipulated by others as a tool. Not even a touch is allowed. Ah my lord. Ba covered her cherry-like mouth tightly with both hands and tears involuntarily streamed down her innocent big eyes.</p>
<p>Ding. You have moved. Ba. Ba&#x27;s two elements reversal. Luck value has increased to minus 80.</p>
<p>Not bad. Not bad. It&#x27;s been quite effective. Lyn Shia nodded in satisfaction. He had taken enough time for a bath today.</p>
<p>Now it was time to get down to business. Sleep. Lyn Sha stood up abruptly, the splashing waters startling Baoi, who was still immersed in her emotions. As she looked up, she was immediately met with her lord&#x27;s tall, slender frame, broad and muscular chest, and sharply defined abs. Ba immediately lowered her body in embarrassment, her heart pounding in her chest.</p>
<p>Your lord&#x27;s figure is truly magnificent. Suddenly, she regretted that her behavior did not live up to the title of enchantress. So, she mustered up her courage and raised her head slightly, wanting to take another look. This time, what greeted him was Lin Xiaos eyes, which seemed to be smiling, but weren&#x27;t. He had already put on his robe.</p>
<p>What do you want to see? This concubine? This concubine? Watching like this isn&#x27;t enough? How about I perform a magic trick for you? Oh, without saying a word, Lyn Sha pulled Baoi, whose face was flushed to the bedside. Lie down, my lord. I shall return. Just lie down. Lyn Sha glanced at her indifferently, and Ba immediately dared not utter a sound, her eyes seeming to overflow with tears.</p>
<p>This magic trick is called falling asleep in 3 seconds. Oh. After Lyn Sha finished speaking, he lay down on the bed, kicked his legs, closed his eyes, and immediately fell into a deep sleep. Before going to sleep, Lynn Sha had only one thought in his mind. Damn it, it&#x27;s only been a day, and these ancient demons are truly awful.</p>
<p>Chapter 74. Objective: The four rare resources. Just as Lin Sha was fast asleep. Midnight. In a well-ordered territory with towering walls and sharp arrow towers, a tall, beautiful, and aloof girl sat with her legs together, quietly examining a turquoise sword in her hand.</p>
<p>A fine sword. A magnetic female voice rang out, and a woman of extraordinary stature slowly approached. She had messy, flowing, fiery red hair and wore a beautifully designed golden helmet with two wings that covered the upper half of her face. She was dressed in a golden armor suit, but what was most striking was her right hand, which was a golden prosthetic limb with a long sharp sword at the end. Marleneia Dugu Jaolon said slowly looking at the approaching Valkyrie.</p>
<p>Are you feeling better? My lord, Marleneia bowed. Thank you for your help, my lord. The crimson corruption has been largely suppressed. Where the lord&#x27;s blade points, Marlinia will be invincible. Mm.</p>
<p>Dugu Jella nodded. 3 2 1. She counted silently in her mind. All right, cool down. Time&#x27;s up.</p>
<p>Time to upgrade to tier 2. That&#x27;s great. A valiant female soldier cheered excitedly beside Dugu Jaon. Miss will definitely win first place this time. Huh, don&#x27;t be too happy yet.</p>
<p>Dugjon said at our pace, it will take more than 10 hours to complete the upgrade to the second level this afternoon. Completing the second level on the third day after entering the battlefield of 10,000 races is unheard of in previous years. The female soldier said, &quot;Don&#x27;t forget someone finished one book on the first day of the newbie zone. If he keeps up his pace, he might finish two books by noon today.&quot; Dugu Jaolan was not blinded by passion, but calmly calculated everything. The female soldier said, &quot;Is it that Lin Shiao? Isn&#x27;t he being watched by Wong Su from the official server?&quot; In a few days, he&#x27;ll be forced to face the Black Flame Lord who&#x27;s breaking through the server.</p>
<p>He doesn&#x27;t have the mind to rush to build a tier 2 base right now. It&#x27;s a good thing that Miss asked me to go to such lengths to search for information for him. Dugu Jaon asked in a nasal tone. Have you forgotten what I said last time? Oh, you&#x27;re being punished by standing guard every night for a month, starting now. As soon as Dugu Jalon finished speaking, the female soldier walked out dejectedly.</p>
<p>The Valkyrie simply watched this scene with a smile. Marlenia, get some rest tonight. If we really do get first place in the second tier, the beast tide we face might be even fiercer than the first one. This time, it all depends on you. The Valkyrie smiled slightly.</p>
<p>I will obey your orders, Lord. The next morning, Lynsha had a good sleep and woke up slowly. The movement of getting up startled the beautiful woman beside him. My lord, may I help you change your clothes? No, no, I can put it on myself faster. Lyn Shiai righteously rejected Ba and his unpretentious manner won Ba&#x27;s favor once again.</p>
<p>In reality, he didn&#x27;t want to be unable to suppress his desires first thing in the morning. Thinking of this, he cursed inwardly again that the ancient demons were truly despicable. open the chat channel and see if there&#x27;s anything new. Lynn Shia opened the chat channel and as he expected, even in the dead of night, these idol new lords were all paying attention to every move in the newbie zone. Throughout the night, not a single player in any of the 10 newbie zones in the LN region successfully upgraded to level two.</p>
<p>However, there were countless reports of people dying in battle or the Lord&#x27;s Mansion being destroyed by the demonic tide. The most discussed topic was Lin Xiao&#x27;s remote duel with Ding Lay in which Ding Lay with the beautiful girl watching soloed the deaf knight in the destruction castle during a live stream. Ding Lay kept his promise and released the beautiful girl which won him a lot of goodwill among the lords and brought him a good reputation. The negative impact of his previous failure to show off after being humiliated by Lynn, Shiao has gradually disappeared. In addition to his good looks and formidable fighting ability, his current popularity is almost on par with Lin Xiao&#x27;s.</p>
<p>Ding Lay is a man of his word. He doesn&#x27;t bully the weak and his promises are as good as gold. We and Lia need someone like him. Dinglay has a brighter future than Lin Sha. I&#x27;m willing to follow Ding Lay.</p>
<p>Whether Lin Sha can handle the arrival of top experts in the official server in a few days is still a question. A big shot. I think Lin Shiao is just a grasshopper in autumn. He won&#x27;t be able to jump around for long. What? Why do you have to look down on boss Lyn Sha? Can you even handle boss Lyn Xiao&#x27;s phantom archer and Guster Archer? Exactly.</p>
<p>If you only had F-level talent, you&#x27;d be a sitting duck by now. If I had F ranklord talent, I wouldn&#x27;t be showing off like this. Most of the onlookers had already predicted Lin Xiao&#x27;s fate and began to praise Dinglay. Only a few people with lower innate lord level talents still supported Lin Shiao and didn&#x27;t want him to fail. The reason was simple.</p>
<p>If Liao&#x27;s F-level talent could reach such a level, their EDC talents might be just as good. Lyn Sha shook his head. He only treated the chat channel content as a bit of fun. I gave you one night to get a head start. Now it&#x27;s my turn to upgrade to a second tier university.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha walked out of the Lord&#x27;s mansion and waved his hand. Upgrade Lord&#x27;s Mansion under upgrade. Upgrade countdown 11 hours 59 minutes and 58 seconds. Click to pause. Seeing that the Lord&#x27;s Manor was starting to upgrade, Lynn Shiao checked the construction order of the various buildings in his territory once again.</p>
<p>If nothing unexpected happens, I should be able to complete the second level of the Lord&#x27;s Mansion tonight. Besides being able to recruit a new hero immediately, I can also immediately deploy barracks buildings. Barracks buildings can recruit existing troop types, which means you can recruit Emodo Dao iron guards and divine arm archers. Although I currently have five ordinary recruitment tokens, those tokens require the use of Chinese summoning to consume energy in order to recruit Chinese troops. According to the ancient demons usage techniques, the consumption of Chinese energy would be even greater.</p>
<p>So, we should build barracks and mass-produce troops first and then use the Chinese summoning system to replenish our troops. At the same time, I can immediately construct hero specific buildings. Recruiting rangers and songstresses. Well, songstresses are out of the question. It&#x27;s not time to keep playing music and dancing yet.</p>
<p>I already have a blacksmith shop. In addition, I need a war hall that can only be built after reaching tier 2 as a place for heroes to discuss military affairs in the future and also a building for upgrading military supplies and equipment later. With this building, I&#x27;ve completed all the prerequisite buildings for upgrading to tier three, then immediately upgrade to level three. Lyn Shia nodded and checked his resources. The barracks resources are more than enough for the hero&#x27;s exclusive buildings, more than enough for the warh hall, more than enough resources.</p>
<p>But the Lord&#x27;s Manor is still short of resources to upgrade to level three. To summarize, the most lacking resources are refined wood, refined stone, refined iron, and refined copper. These upgrade level mineral veins are relatively rare. We could have accumulated enough resources by destroying the castle, but unfortunately, Dinglay stumbled upon them by accident. Secondly, there is a lack of rare mineral veins such as crystal, gemstones, sulfur, and mercury.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha thought of something else. Recruiting ordinary troops in the barracks only requires gold, coins, and food. But starting from epic troops, you need four rare mineral veins. Every epic unit requires one of the four rare resources. The legendary gold units will require even more.</p>
<p>Although we don&#x27;t know what kind of minerals the iron guards and divine archers use, it&#x27;s definitely a good idea to capture them all. Therefore, the four major upgrade mines and the four major rare resources are what I lack most right now. Opening the map of his memories in his mind, Lyn Sha immediately planned his route. The matter was settled and Lyn Shao acted swiftly and decisively. Baoi will lead 20 phantom archers to defend the base.</p>
<p>The rest of you follow me. Chapter 75. Abyss demon brands. Fully armed. Lin Shiao wielding the holy sword.</p>
<p>Falin led pay mini song Ruer Solin and others to conquer a crystal mine. The reason he didn&#x27;t divide his forces was because he feared the monsters guarding the four rare resources would be too powerful. For example, this crystal mine is guarded by a level 30 epic monster, the crystal dragon. Unafraid of magic, piercing, or control, tireless with health points longer than Bao sees legs, Lyn Sha would rather lead everyone to attack such a monster with no weaknesses than lose one or two of his own troops. After several minutes of concentrated fire, the crystal dragon let out a mournful cry turned into crystal shards and collapsed with a crash.</p>
<p>The flower fairies following behind Lynn. Shiao immediately rushed forward and occupied the mine. He my lord, you are so brave. Yao Yao wants to follow you into battle again. Flower fairies are fast and have good stamina, making them an excellent unit.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not leading them to kill enemies, but because they are much more durable than peasants. They can keep up with my powerful troops on a fast march, and they are not afraid of death. They can also protect themselves if they encounter powerful monsters during the march. The only problem is that he&#x27;s too impulsive. Occupy this crystal mine and mine it well.</p>
<p>Farmers will naturally come to take your place later. Lyn Sha patted the flower fair&#x27;s head. Behave yourself or you can forget about going back to Heay&#x27;s side. The flower fairy, however, squinted her eyes with enjoyment, flying around Lin Shiao and showing off her graceful and nimble body. He following the Lord isn&#x27;t bad at all.</p>
<p>Has the Lord ever tasted Yao Yao as honey? It&#x27;s very sweet. Lynn Shiao shook his head and ignored him, leading his troops to defeat another group of lava dwarf warriors and occupy a fine stone mine. These superior units are incredibly easy to obtain, but the production of spirit stones is too low. We still need to continue conquering them. I&#x27;ve already connected crystal mines, refined stones, refined wood, refined iron, refined copper, sulfur mines, gemstone mines, and mercury mines into one line, and I&#x27;ll fight my way through.</p>
<p>The main force continued forward, eliminating several other monsters in the upgraded mines and sending out a few flower fairies to occupy and mine them. Within the territory, farmhouses are constantly recruiting golden legendary farmers. After each legendary farmer cultivates a legendary farmland, he will be assigned to the mines occupied by various flower fairies where he will swing his pickaxe in a blur and work hard to mine. The next rare resource mine is guarded by a level 30 epic creature, the Abyss Demon, accompanied by dozens of superior fire elves. The Abyss Demon was tall and imposing, exuding the oppressive aura of the demon race.</p>
<p>He had two twisted ram horns on his head, one of which was broken off. Strange. In my memory, the monsters guarding this spot should be a group of hell nightmare beasts. Lyn Sha was somewhat uncertain, so he checked the attributes of the Abyss demon in advance. Abyss demon brands, race high demon, level 30, quality epic.</p>
<p>Attributes: Strength 120, Spirit 60, Constitution 115, soul 40. Combat power rating 110 stars. Skills: Raging fire, blade of hatred, hate counterattack, endless hatred. The attributes are pretty good. Plus, with the incredibly fast fire sprite, this sulfur mine will be a bit challenging.</p>
<p>The abyss demon comes with a fire shield, making it immune to mind magic and fire magic. It also has high damage skills like the blade of hatred. Lynn Shiao didn&#x27;t want to fight it himself. Pay Min. This abyss demon is much stronger than the nest demon.</p>
<p>Go and teach him a lesson. Upon receiving the order, Pay Min transformed into a streak of sword light and slashed straight down. Just kidding. When he was level one, the blade master dared to take on a level 30 nest demon in a one-on-one fight. Now that he&#x27;s over level 10, even a stronger abyss demon would have to avoid his attacks.</p>
<p>Paymen&#x27;s relentless attacks of one sword from the east and sacrifice to shatter mind. The abyss demon gradually succumbed. Lyn Shiao, also wearing the fourpiece scale rock set, led the other troops and the fire spirits into battle. With Payman&#x27;s sword dao aura buff, Lin Xiao&#x27;s sword mastery reached a level, and he was able to wield the holy sword falion with ease. Finally, the abyss demon turned to ashes amidst its unwilling screams, and Lyn Sha led his troops to kill all the fire spirits.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s great that my little brother is strong. We&#x27;ve taken over the sulfur mine. were still missing the gem and mercury mines. With the highdefinition map of his memory palace, Lynn Sha didn&#x27;t need to explore and went straight to the gem mine. The gem mine is guarded by nearly a 100 elite scorpion lions.</p>
<p>The four rare mineral veins are all heavily guarded, and ordinary novice lords have no way to deal with them. Facing a 100 flying and poisonous lions, Lynn Shia didn&#x27;t waste any words. He activated the skills of the divine archer and phantom archer, including long shot, rapid fire, and sniping while the iron guards of the Mod Dao blocked the way. They quickly cleared out the mine and successfully captured it. It was already noon, and the group was in the wilderness roasting wild mutton and beef and cooking some spirit rice porridge for their meal.</p>
<p>Since acquiring the legendary spirit rice, Lynn Shia has required all troop types to eat it every day. Each day, one of the four attributes will be randomly increased by two for Pay Min, whose base stats are high, but it&#x27;s a significant boost for Phantom Archers, an excellent unit that&#x27;s only around 30 in all four stats, even at level 10 to 12. I really don&#x27;t know if I keep feeding him, the Phantom Archer will really turn into the Ancient Archer,&quot; Lyn Sha shook his head, stopping his wild thoughts. In the afternoon, the group continued to push through all the mineral veins and resources along the way and finally arrived at their destination, the mercury mine. Upon arrival, they found another abyssal demon leading dozens of fire spirits.</p>
<p>I remember it being a royal griffin. Never mind, we&#x27;ve already killed this configuration once. Killing it again won&#x27;t hurt. Lyn Shao continued to command Pay Min to fight the abyss demon alone while he led his troops to charge at the fire spirit. Just then, the abyss demon raised its hand and a rain of meteors fell.</p>
<p>Endless hatred deals minor meteor shower damage to all enemies. With quick reflexes, Pay Min immediately unleashed sword dance, transforming into a streak of light to block the meteor shower above Lin Sha and the phantom archer&#x27;s heads. The iron guards with the emo dao sword and the archers with the divine arm archers stood still enduring the attack solely with their heavy armor. This abyss demon is attacking first. Take him down.</p>
<p>Pay men rushed over immediately but the abyss demon waved his hand and the broken giant sword wrapped in iron chains in his hand slashed down fiercely with astonishing force. Hate counterattack against enemies who have severely harmed you. Counter-attack damage is increased by 50%. Pay Min dodged the attack with surprise and continued to fight the abyss demon. Why did you use the hate retaliation technique? Lyn Shiao asked in astonishment.</p>
<p>Immediately, he sensed something was a miss. This abyss demon looks almost exactly like the one that Pay Min killed and turned to ashes in the sulfur mine. Even the location of the severed horn is the same. Pay Min, this abyss demon might be from the sulfur mine. Be careful, Lynn Sha warned Pay Min.</p>
<p>No sooner said than done. In the instant Lin Sha reminded Pay Min. More than a hundred more demons suddenly burst out from between the cliffs and boulders behind Lin Shia and the others. They pounced on the group. The devil was lying in ambush around the mercury mine, waiting for Lin Sha.</p>
<p>The ferocious demon, the violent demon, the bone demon, and the nest demon are all demons of excellent and epic quality. Human, how dare you have any dealings with her highness, the princess. Prepare to die. The abyss demon roared and summoned a meteor shower once more. Meteorites rained down from the sky, crashing down on everyone, but Pay Min was facing the abyss demon and had no time to come to their aid.</p>
<p>Chapter 76. The secrets exposed in Heizay&#x27;s live stream. As the meteor shower fell, the legendary unyielding units like the ironclad guards and the divine archers paid them no heat. But the phantom archer and the flower fairy are sure to suffer heavy casualties. In the blink of an eye, Lynsha swiftly raised his sword.</p>
<p>The thought of may peace reign for all ages and may the sages continue their lost learning suddenly activated in his mind. Subconsciously, Lyn Shao immediately recalled Pay Min&#x27;s swordsmanship from earlier, and the sword in his hand moved in sync with his body. Sword dance. Rank C activated. Lyn Sha twisted the holy sword falion into a flower shape, and streams of sword energy swirled around it, forming a barrier of sword energy.</p>
<p>Boom! The sword energy and the meteor shower collided, creating a series of loud explosions. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s hastily executed sword dance actually blocked most of the meteor shower. However, since it was a sea level sword dance, some meteor showers still managed to slip through the net and hit the team. Several screams were heard. Some phantom archers had already fallen to the ground, and several flower fairies were instantly killed and disappeared in green light.</p>
<p>Hateful. Who the hell are you? How dare you hurt my men? Lynsha cursed angrily and charged straight at the demon lord. More than a hundred demons that had been lying in ambush had also rushed out. The Mod Dao iron guards and the divine arm archers quickly organized to resist them. They formed a circle protecting the vulnerable phantom archers and flower fairies in the innermost part.</p>
<p>Faced with such a formidable foe, the iron guards of the MO Dao immediately activated their pillar of strength and divine valor skills. Morale, strength, spirit, physique, and health all surged instantly. All attributes surpassed those of a level 30 epic demon who wielded his broadsword and unleashed a barrage of attacks with slash with the momentum and slash against the momentum. The entire ambush of the demon army was momentarily stunned. Even the fiercest and most ferocious demons were shocked by the Mo Dao Iron Guards fearless and relentless fighting style, which was almost always critical hits.</p>
<p>They were hit even if they blocked the attack, and they were hit even if they didn&#x27;t. The ambush was greatly reduced in effectiveness. The divine archer, calm, and giant killer are about to follow up. Composure unaffected by ambushes or mental fear effects. When the enemy is less than 10 meters away from the archer, the archer&#x27;s strength and constitution attributes increase by 30% and melee ability increases by 30%.</p>
<p>Giant slayer. The divine archer was all a giant of their time. Facing any creature larger than themselves, they possessed unique techniques to deliver critical hits. critical hit rate increased by 50% when attacking giants and the chance to hit a vital point increased by 50%. The fierce demon and the nest demon are enormous demons.</p>
<p>So when the demons plan to launch a ranged attack, the archers with their giant crossbows fired deadly bolts at the demons vital organs such as their eyes, mouths, ears, hearts, and genitals. But when the demons charged toward the archers, they were not met with panicked archers who fled in terror, but with incomparably sharp ring pommel swords. The demons suddenly realized that these ranged attackers were no less capable in melee combat than the armored warriors wielding giant swords next to them. A roar erupted as the demons and legendary units clashed in a fierce battle. Meanwhile, Lynn Sha rushed to the front of the abyss demon and joined P men in fighting it.</p>
<p>Just then, the announcement from the main god system resounded throughout the entire region. Ding. Dugu. Jaolon, a player from the Lan region of Blue Star Realm, has successfully upgraded to tier 2 and become the number one newbie lord in the Lan region this year. System reward one, epic treasure chest.</p>
<p>The long- aaited chat channel was quickly flooded with a large number of people. Wow, someone&#x27;s already at level two, and this is only the third day since the server opened. I haven&#x27;t even finished upgrading one of my books yet. Add one to the list upstairs. Haha, I just finished upgrading a book and recruited a rare hero.</p>
<p>Damn, the demon tide is coming. I&#x27;m not saying anything more. The name Dugu Jaolon sounds familiar, right? Isn&#x27;t he the genius that Lynn Sha mentioned was the only one who could rival him in school? Dugu Jaolan took first place in the second tier, wasn&#x27;t it? Lyn Sha, didn&#x27;t Lyn Shiao when the first hero&#x27;s move? Logically, he should have had the first mover advantage. He Someone scoffed. Don&#x27;t forget Lyn Sha has already been given a breakthrough token by a top player in the official zone, and he&#x27;ll be coming to attack him in a few days.</p>
<p>Yes, he&#x27;s basically a dead man. The winning rate for all newbies targeted by top players in the official zone is less than one in a thousand. The cold, hard data came out of this person&#x27;s mouth, and the chat channel fell silent for a moment. So, all we can do is let those of you with powerful connections bully and slaughter others at will without allowing anyone to resist. A lord, also a commoner, complained indignantly.</p>
<p>With a win rate of only one in a thousand, no wonder the lords of blue star are getting worse with each generation. As long as you have powerful backers, you can act arrogantly and doineeringly, and no one dares to offend you. All the true geniuses on Earth have been stifled and killed by these second generation leaders and people with powerful backers. The commoner lord&#x27;s words of grief and indignation did not elicit agreement, but rather a chorus of ridicule. Huh? You call an F-level talented genius.</p>
<p>Exactly. If he were a true genius, a whole host of powerful forces would have invited him as an honored guest and placed him under strict protection. Understand? Look at Dinglay. He suddenly has over a hundred different types of troops. He must have joined a major power.</p>
<p>Does Lin Sha have that? I&#x27;m new here and don&#x27;t know Lynn Shiao, but I think it&#x27;s already amazing that Lynn Shiao with his F- level lord talent managed to get first place once. He&#x27;s a genius. Everyone, pretty girl, stop pretending to Shan by Chian. How come you all know it&#x27;s me even though I hid my ID? He who was standing to the side also wanted to jump out and say a few words in rebuttal. I&#x27;ll just forget about it.</p>
<p>Master Lin Shiao is a hidden master far beyond your comprehension. He must have his reasons for not rushing to upgrade to a second tier university. The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. He still opened the chat channel. He a what are you all babbling about? Lyn Shia is much stronger than everyone here.</p>
<p>Even if he&#x27;s not number one, he&#x27;s definitely number two. Ding. Player Julie from the LN region of Blueest Star realm has successfully upgraded to tier 2, becoming the second ranked newbie lord in the Lan region this year. System reward one epic treasure chest. Eay, forget it.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao has always been low-key and doesn&#x27;t like to show off. Unlike Ding Lay, who always has to come out and flaunt his presence, you need to have some faith in your lord. By the way, I&#x27;m also planning to upgrade to a higher level. I should let Lin Sha know and find out what he thinks. With that in mind, Hay dialed Lin Xiaos number.</p>
<p>After waiting for half a minute without Lin Shiao answering, Hay dialed again and out of boredom open the chat channel again. Dinglay he everyone. I&#x27;m not very talented, but I&#x27;ve already started upgrading to a second tier university. If all goes well, I should be able to complete the upgrade by tomorrow morning. What? Tomorrow morning? upgrade to a second tier university on the fourth day.</p>
<p>Wow, Ding Lay is awesome. Ding Lay could definitely break into the top 10. Hara, Ding Lay is the real boss. Lynn Shiao has definitely fallen behind and will never be able to catch up with Ding Lay. Lyn Sha is useless now.</p>
<p>I heard he took in a few vassel lords. Apart from the pretty girls, the rest of them are trash. He&#x27;ll even collect garbage. He must be desperate. You guys praise Dinglay.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tolerate that. You smear Lin Shia. I&#x27;ll tolerate that, too. But why call me trash? He immediately jumped out. Who&#x27;s trash? Who&#x27;s trash? How am I He trash? Everyone, so you&#x27;re also a vassal lord of Lyn Shia.</p>
<p>I knew it. He&#x27;s trash. He shut up. I&#x27;m almost at level one. My speed is above average in this newbie zone.</p>
<p>Dinglay. Not bad. He Dinglay, I don&#x27;t need your approval. Dinglay, don&#x27;t underestimate anyone. Look at Heay.</p>
<p>Although he doesn&#x27;t look impressive, he was almost wiped out by Xiao Daong, but now he&#x27;s about to be promoted to a higher level. Everyone should learn from him. Everyone, Dinglay is indeed magnanimous, but we don&#x27;t know if he is lying or not. Dinglay, I believe in Heay. Everyone, we don&#x27;t believe it.</p>
<p>Heay, don&#x27;t believe me? I&#x27;ll go live and show you. Ding. Contestant Heay has created a live stream room. In an instant, thousands of people flooded into the live stream. Heay said to the Lord&#x27;s mansion that he was about to complete.</p>
<p>Look, look, the Lord&#x27;s manor is almost lit up. Am I lying? Just then, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s call, which he had been dialing, was finally connected. Everyone saw the communication interface between Lin Shiao and Heay. Lyn Sha stood on a giant abyss demon. One hand gripping the demon&#x27;s horns, the other fist raining down on the demon&#x27;s eye sockets.</p>
<p>What did you say? Say it again. Who slept with your princess? Chapter 77. A real man should. The audience in the live stream was stunned. How did I end up seeing such a shocking scene while watching a newbie&#x27;s live stream trying to prove his innocence? Abyss demon.</p>
<p>Appearing in the newbie zone is like being a nest demon with a minimum level of 30. Incomparably powerful and bloodthirsty. Lyn Sha, although his lord talent is f, he&#x27;s a very popular ranger lord lately. Some say he&#x27;s mysterious while others say he&#x27;s just being deliberately enigmatic. But at this moment, it was Lynn Sha riding on the abyss demon and beating it up.</p>
<p>The live stream all gasped, recalling the fear they felt when Lyn Shao calmly and effortlessly crushed Xiao Data. Lyn Shia, his fists clad in iron gauntlets, slammed repeatedly into the abyss demon&#x27;s head, shouting, &quot;Say that again if you dare.&quot; The abyss demon struggled incessantly, but Lyn Sha held it down firmly. It opened its massive m. But before the sulfurous flames could form, Lyn Sha shattered them with a single punch. You have the aura of our princess.</p>
<p>The abyss demon roared. Your scent lingers in the princess&#x27;s body. Grasp. Lynsha swore again. He felt incredibly wronged.</p>
<p>He was still a virgin in both his past and present lives. Yet he was falsely accused of indecent assault by a demon. Where could he go to seek justice? You lie again. Who the hell would go after monsters like you for no reason? Do you have such a heavy taste? And how did you know the scent inside your princess&#x27;s body? The demon of the abyss paused. Then with a flick of his only movable finger, the flames conjured an image.</p>
<p>This is our princess. The person in the center of the image has seductive eyes, fiery red lips, and snow white skin with two small devil horns on her head. Her features are soft and gentle without any aggression, making people want to cherish her at first glance. Yet, her figure is stunningly good, making people want to possess her at first sight. It also has a pair of small wings and a tail.</p>
<p>She was one of the succubi who appeared during the demon tide. Lynsha paused for a moment. That&#x27;s a good idea. Then he shook his head and roared. That devil, what does she have to do with me? I&#x27;m still looking for her.</p>
<p>Tell me, where is she? She&#x27;s caused me so much trouble. He had only exchanged a glance with this succubus and was instantly marked with a magical symbol. If the succubus hadn&#x27;t transmitted an image of the mark back, he wouldn&#x27;t have been detected by the ancient demon just as he was about to have sex with Ba, his period triggered the explosion. Now with desire burning fiercely, I can only endure it every day. The live stream room fell silent and everyone gasped in shock.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha actually has an ambiguous relationship with the succubus princess. Even Heay stood there dumbfounded, completely forgetting that his lord&#x27;s manner had already been upgraded. The abyss demon refused to speak further and suddenly struggled desperately, arching its back and throwing Lin Sha aside. Seeing the demon about to escape, Lyn Sha coldly waved his hand. Whoosh! Dozens of arrows flew past Lyn Sha from behind and struck the demon.</p>
<p>The demon let out a miserable scream and turned to ashes. Only the dead can escape from me. At this moment, Lyn Shao slowly turned around, his hands behind his back, and coldly looked at Heay. He been looking for me in a hurry. What&#x27;s wrong? Brother Lyn Sha, I&#x27;m so sorry.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m so sorry. I saw something I shouldn&#x27;t have seen. I was going to tell you that I&#x27;m about to be upgraded to a higher level. Eay said guilty. You&#x27;re not going to be upgraded to a first tier university right away.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re already at the first tier university. Lynsha said calmly. How did boss Lyn Sha know? The demonic tide is about to attack your lord&#x27;s manor. Oh crap, I forgot about that. He hurriedly hung up the communication and led the flower fairy to fight back against the demon tide.</p>
<p>The chat channel here exploded once again. Holy crap. Did you guys just go to Heay&#x27;s live stream? Lyn Sha smashed a level 30 epic abyss demon with his bare hands. Really? Is that so? Seriously, I saw it, too. Lyn Shia is practically the ceiling of combat power in the newbie zone.</p>
<p>Damn. Lyn Shia is only a level 10, but he dares to go and fight the abyss demon. He&#x27;s a real man. I&#x27;m a fan now. And there&#x27;s something even more shocking.</p>
<p>Do you know what the abyss demon said? What did you say? Lyn Sha slept with their princess. What? Lyn Sha has such heavy tastes. How could he do this? Wow. Oh, what a true hero. Real men should fight demons, dragons, and behemoths.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a fan now, everyone. Just as everyone was discussing the amazing scene they had just witnessed within District 9527, sword come. Dugu Jaon stretched out her right hand, and the Thai sword flew straight into her hand like lightning. The sword was stained with blood, which had not yet dried. Congratulations, Lord.</p>
<p>You have successfully defeated the second wave of beasts. With a swift, sweeping waterbird attack, Marlenia also killed the last few dozen screaming elite goblin warriors. Dugu Jalon nodded, but there wasn&#x27;t much excitement on his face. This first place came very well, but it came too easily. Lyn Sha, what&#x27;s wrong with you? Why didn&#x27;t you go first than me this time? Dugu Jaalon, whose entire academic career had been dominated by Lin Shiao, finally defeated Lin Sha, but felt it was somewhat unreal.</p>
<p>Is it because you&#x27;re preparing for the invasion and annihilation that your speed has been affected? Should we ask Chufinga later if we should give him some more help? He&#x27;s such a proud person, he probably won&#x27;t accept charity from others. At the same time, in the official district, a man with a large hooked nose and a thick beard visited a huge, spacious lord&#x27;s mansion filled with a sacred atmosphere. My lord, your prediction is wrong, Lynn shouted, &quot;Not when first place this time. Instead, it was a woman named Dugu from the 9527 newbie zone. He didn&#x27;t even get second place.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter. This shows that he has collapsed under this pressure and can&#x27;t even keep his own advantages. A deep, steady male voice rang out. It was the man in the floral shirt whom Wong Su referred to as the adult. I gave him such great respect, yet I was deeply disappointed.</p>
<p>Let Black Flame take the legendary and epic units. Bring 1,000 of them. This time, we&#x27;ll show everyone our power with an overwhelming force. Yes, sir. The hook-nosed man bowed and replied.</p>
<p>The man in the floral shirt stood up and waved his hand dismissively. Get out of here. Don&#x27;t bother me unless it&#x27;s absolutely necessary. Wongu immediately retreated respectfully. As he retreated to the doorway, he saw the man in the floral shirt naturally place his hand on Angel&#x27;s waist and lead her towards the bedroom.</p>
<p>Is this in broad daylight? Envy, jealousy, resentment, and greed flashed across Wong Sus eyes, forming a complex expression. Having eliminated all the monsters guarding the Mercury mine, immediately began to assess his losses. Three phantom archers were seriously injured and two were slightly injured. Seven flower fairies were instantly killed. This level 30 abyss demon is not much weaker than a legendary fire demon.</p>
<p>If any other lord encountered it, they would basically never return. Just now, sword saint paymin acted as the main force, directly piercing the demons several times. Only with Pay Min&#x27;s protection was Lin Shia, a level 10 player, able to beat the abyss demon. The demons actually set up an ambush for me. I&#x27;ve never heard of such a thing before.</p>
<p>What happened to me? How did I become their princess? I&#x27;m wondering about that myself. All right, let&#x27;s hurry back. Healing Phantom Archer is the priority. Also, tell Heay to come over when he has time and revive the flower fairy. Then I&#x27;ll upgrade directly to tier 2 and recruit my third Chinese hero.</p>
<p>Chapter 78, limited recruitment, new heroes of China. Lyn Sha arrived at the Lord&#x27;s Mansion, and it was already quite late. The wounded Phantom Archer was immediately settled down. The legendary Lord&#x27;s Mansion&#x27;s healing function could slowly heal the injuries, large and small, suffered by various units in the Battle of the Myriad Races. After a long day, everyone sat down immediately.</p>
<p>It was said that the farmers had prepared spirit rice porridge and roasted meat in advance and served them to everyone. Ba came forward and personally sliced the roasted meat into pieces for Lin Sha, feeding it to him. Such intimate gestures are perfectly natural in front of others. A lord&#x27;s spouse should be sweet and loving with their lord. This is the powerful impact of Ba&#x27;s alluring beauty skill.</p>
<p>While chewing on roasted meat, Lynn Shia checked the progress of the Lord&#x27;s manor. Check the upgrade progress of the Lord&#x27;s Mansion. Lord&#x27;s Mansion under upgrade. Upgrade countdown. 1 hour 22 minutes and 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Great. The second tier university is about to be upgraded. That&#x27;s fast. Dugu Jalon took first place this time, so it&#x27;s good that the good stuff doesn&#x27;t go to outsiders. Although the class monitor doesn&#x27;t know whether he&#x27;s considered an outsider or not, Lynsha estimated that he should have no problem getting into the top 10.</p>
<p>After all the troops had eaten and drunk their fill, Lyn Sha waited for the Lord&#x27;s mansion to be upgraded and then checked his resources for a while. I have a lot of experience. I&#x27;ve reached over 8 million again, and I&#x27;m saving it all for the second tier heroes as well as the Chinese troops recruited from the barracks. I can&#x27;t make the mistake of forgetting to upgrade people again. This time, Lyn Sha still has five ordinary recruitment tokens.</p>
<p>He can use the Hasha summoning function to directly summon the Hashia golden legendary unit. The prerequisite is that the battlefield of all races has enough energy. He then checked the energy levels of the battlefield of myriad races, 9,670 points. He sighed inwardly. His experience points were rising rapidly as were his gold coins and mineral resources.</p>
<p>However, battlefield energy is becoming increasingly scarce. Sometimes killing three or five elite or rare monsters is required to obtain just one point of battlefield energy, while killing ordinary monsters is even rarer, yielding only one point of energy per 100 monsters. However, using the Hashia token usage secrets taught by the ancient demon requires a massive amount of battlefield energy from all races. Did those three shadowy figures lower the drop rate? Is it because I secretly cursed them every day because of Baoi? Lyn Sha thought to himself without thinking. We should take a look at how many other people besides Dugu Jaolan have successfully entered a second tier university.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao thought to himself and then casually opened the chat channel. Upon seeing this, Lyn Xiaos expression gradually became blank and speechless. The chat channel was filled with the untold secret between Lin Shia and the succubus princess. Lyn Sha forced himself on a succubus only to be relentlessly pursued by the abyssal demon he had been wronged by. Lyn Sha single-handedly crushes the abyss demon.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia was able to get first place because he had connections with the demon race. Lyn Sha is the top tier fighter in single player challenges in the 89757 newbie zone. Who can disagree the hell is going on? Lyn Shia continued scrolling through the chat history and finally figured out what had happened. It turned out that Dugu Jaolan had upgraded to the second tier university before him which sparked a heated discussion in the chat channel. Then Tan by Chian and Heay both failed to speak up for themselves.</p>
<p>While dialing his own number, Heay was also provoked by Ding Lelay and started a live stream. His beating of the abyss demon and is being slandered by the demon were thus exposed. No wonder Heay&#x27;s reaction was so unnatural. He a brainless idiot too. Lyn Shiao said angrily.</p>
<p>Just then, Heay dialed Lin Xiao&#x27;s number again. Once the call connected, Hay on the other end knew from Linhaos expression that his scheme had been exposed. Boss Lin Shiao, I&#x27;m sorry, I didn&#x27;t mean to. I was afraid of disturbing boss Lin Xiaos monster hunting, so I only dared to tell Boss Lin Shia at night. I&#x27;m willing to accept the punishment.</p>
<p>Humph. Lyn Xiaos face was so dark it looked like ink was about to drip from it. You&#x27;ve already got a whole book. How many flower fairies do you have now? Not many. Not many.</p>
<p>Just 80. so far, Eay said repeatedly. Mainly because a few of the leader talismans were obtained, so I bought two more. Send over another 30 flower fairies tomorrow. They have to be just blooming.</p>
<p>Cough, cough. Just budding, Lyn Sha said with a dark face. Also, seven flower fairies died today. Come and revive them tomorrow. I&#x27;ll let you off this time because you meant well.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t need anyone&#x27;s approval. I just need to be strong myself. Think before you speak next time, and don&#x27;t expose my secrets again. Otherwise, you won&#x27;t be able to keep your flower fairy form. Okay.</p>
<p>Okay. Heay breathed a sigh of relief, glanced at Lynn Sha, and seeing that he didn&#x27;t seem to be genuinely pursuing the matter, he couldn&#x27;t help but say, &quot;Boss Lyn Sha, um, you really took the demon princess roll.&quot; It was already 8:00 p.m. when he was driven away. Lynn Sha confirmed that only five people had completed the second tier upgrade while his own lord&#x27;s manner would be upgraded in a few minutes. Finally, finally finished.</p>
<p>Pay men waiting quietly beside him. Further back were rows of neatly arranged moa soldiers, divine arm archers, and phantom archers. At the very back were the farmers and flower fairies resting, some sitting and some standing. Their postures relaxed, but their expressions carrying a hint of tension. Everyone was waiting for this moment.</p>
<p>Ding. Lynn Sha, a player from the Lan region of the blue star realm, has successfully upgraded to tier 2 and become the sixth ranked rookie lord in the Lan region this year. System reward one excellent treasure chest. The announcement from the main god system finally sounded. Congratulations, Lord.</p>
<p>The unified shouts resounded throughout the territory. This was the cohesion under Lin Xiao&#x27;s rule. Everyone, let&#x27;s begin. Lynn Shiao stood up and without any hesitation immediately began the operation. Build barracks.</p>
<p>The two legendary farmers immediately built two military camps at the location designated by Lyn Shiao. That&#x27;s right. Lynho&#x27;s resources are even enough to support the simultaneous construction of two barracks. Barracks under construction. Construction countdown.</p>
<p>23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds. Click to pause. Build a war hall. According to a legend, the farmers immediately began working. Warh Hall under construction.</p>
<p>Construction countdown. 23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds. Click to pause. Very good. By this time tomorrow night, the barracks and war hall will be completed.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia nodded in satisfaction. Next, construct the sword St. Pay Min&#x27;s exclusive hero building, the Rangers Pavilion. Three more legendary farmers went to the designated location and began building the wanderer pavilion. As a building exclusive to heroes, it can recruit heroes exclusive units.</p>
<p>The legendary pay men recruited legendary wandering knights. However, hero specific buildings require more farmers and take a long time to build. Wandering swordsman pavilion under construction. Construction countdown 47 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds. Click to pause.</p>
<p>Even with the eternal peace acceleration at 100%, the wanderer&#x27;s pavilion will still take 2 days to complete. Hero exclusive buildings are just a bit more difficult than other buildings. Lyn Sha nodded. The demon tide is about to arrive, so we need to start recruiting heroes from tier 2 immediately. Who could it be? Lyn Sha suppressed his excitement.</p>
<p>Exchange for Huasha token energy. Consume one energy point to use the Hasha token. Hasha summoning function to summon a Hasha hero. Hua immediately deducts 1,000 battlefield energy points. Then Lynn Shao continued, &quot;Continue to consume the energy of the battlefield of myriad races and set the conditions for this Hasha summoning.</p>
<p>Requirement one, recruit general type commander heroes. Requirement two, proficient in mountain warfare.&quot; A flash of seven colored light appeared and a portal appeared in the territory. A figure slowly appeared and stepped out of the portal. Lyn Sha and the others eyes lit up. Chapter 79.</p>
<p>Chin Leang Yu, the great Ming Dynasty&#x27;s female war goddess, makes her debut. A portal flashed and a tall figure stepped out. She wore a scale patterned soft armor with a bright red cape flowing behind her and her long hair was tied into a high ponytail that reached her waist. She was actually a female general. She has delicate features, a small rosy mouth and a high nose that accentuates the three-dimensionality of her features.</p>
<p>Her face, eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth are all extremely beautiful. But when combined, they reveal a vigorous and heroic spirit that makes people overlook her beauty and only feel that she is irresistible. Holding a helmet in her left hand and a gleaming white rifle in her right, she looked incredibly heroic, like a dignified female warrior. Ding! Congratulations on obtaining the Chinese hero, Shin Lang Yu. It&#x27;s her.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaos heart skipped a beat. He hadn&#x27;t expected it to be Chin Leong Yu. She is the only woman in China&#x27;s thousands of years of history who is recorded in official histories and the only one recorded in the biographies of generals. Chin Leang Yu, a female war goddess who was enabled and appointed grand protector for her military achievements. Lyn Ziaos eyes lit up instantly.</p>
<p>His unpleasantness at having 4,000 energy points deducted from his account when he used the Hasha token vanished instantly. Hasa summoning allows you to summon the heroes you want or need within a certain range subject to certain conditions. In Lin Xiao&#x27;s mind, the second shadowy figure cackled wickedly. If you set enough conditions, you can even recruit any hero. However, the more conditions there are, the more battlefield energy is consumed.</p>
<p>He in order to deal with this crisis, Lynn Shiao decided to use the ancient demons tricks to summon a Chinese hero who was suitable for him. Since it was his first time using it, Lynn Shia didn&#x27;t dare to be greedy and only specified two conditions. First, the general type hero. Otherwise, if we send out a Daji, Shishure, or Xiao Chan, not to mention whether they have magic or what their abilities are. Just the fact that we only have two enchantresses among our three heroes would probably leave us with no energy to deal with black flame.</p>
<p>Second, they excel at mountain warfare. Because his territory was located in the mountains, and the lord&#x27;s mansion was situated at the mouth of the gourd mountain, the general who fought in the mountains could fully display his talents. As it turns out, the extra 4,000 points of Hashia energy were well spent. And she&#x27;s a beautiful heroine, too. What a steal.</p>
<p>Lynh Xiaos eyes narrowed into slits as he smiled at the female general in front of him. Just then, the female general finished receiving the information from the main god system. She looked up and saw a handsome and dashing young man surrounded by people smiling at her. The female general&#x27;s pretty face flushed slightly, and she quickly stepped forward and clasped her hands in a fist salute. This humble general, Chin Leangu, greets your lordship.</p>
<p>The dashing chin Lean Yu was tall, almost as tall as Lin Shao. No need for formalities. Lean Yu, I have long awaited your arrival. Are you willing to follow me, to conquer the world with me, to annihilate foreign races, to kill alien species, and to spread the glory of China? I am deeply grateful for your kindness, Lord. Chin Leon Yu knelt on one knee, displaying a completely military bearing.</p>
<p>Lean Yu will surely die on the battlefield loyal to the Lord. Ding! Your hero Chin Lean Yus loyalty has reached 90%. Do whatever you want. Lyn Sha was stunned. What kind of operation is this? Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;Is this girl so easily loyal to her master?&quot; Chin Leang Yus loyalty level reached 90 so quickly, which is both good news and bad news.</p>
<p>The loyalty template used is the female template. So, the main god system introduction includes a do whatever you want judgment. The bad news is, if I remember correctly, Chin Leong Yu was a married woman. Lynn Shiao, who had been lost in thought, quickly regained his senses and hurriedly helped Chin Leong Yu up, saying, &quot;I told you there&#x27;s no need for such formalities, Leon Yu. From now on, this is your home.&quot; He thought to himself, &quot;Check Chin Leong Yus attributes.</p>
<p>Then he carefully examined Chin Lean Yu. Chin Leong Yu race human meow ethnic group quality golden legend level level one attributes strength 48 + 10 spirit 60 + 12 constitution 50 + 10 soul 50 + 10 skills to chieftain woman of strength queen of the mountains master of spears spearman command s rank archer command sr rank command of all troop types a rank Combat power rating 55 stars. Exclusive unit, white-shaped spearman. Excellent. Truly excellent.</p>
<p>Worthy of being called a general and a hero. Comes with three commanders: spearmen, archers, and all unit types. Both spearmen and archers are S-rank commanders. This means that all spearmen and archers will receive a 50% bonus to all attributes as long as they are near Chin Leong Yu. The A-level all troop command grants a 30% bonus to all stats of all troop types except spearmen and archers.</p>
<p>These three skills alone are enough for a legendary hero to dominate the battlefield of the myriad races. Not to mention, Chin Leong Yu has three other skills with impressive names. Although Chin Leong Yu&#x27;s personal combat ability is inferior to Pay Min&#x27;s, Pay Min had a rating of 61 stars when he was at level one, while Chin Leong Yu only had 55 stars. However, Chin Leong Yus attributes still far surpass those of other legendary gold tier units of the same level, such as the MO Dao Iron Guard and the Divine Arm Archer. Just kidding.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no such thing as a bad legendary hero, Lyn Sha thought to himself. These two heroes are not the same type. None of Payman&#x27;s skills are related to command. At most, he has a sword aura that provides a buff to friendly units who use swords. However, Payman himself has unparalleled attack power, and his attack, defense, and speed are all exceptional.</p>
<p>He dares to kill level 30 epic monsters at level one. Chin Leang Yu is a true general type hero, but her personal strength is not as great as payments, and her skills are not for one-on-one combat. The only skill that comes close is master of spears. However, she has S-level bonuses for spearman and archers, a level bonuses for other troop types, and special skills like chieftain and king of the mountains that provide high bonuses under certain circumstances. Just as Lin Sha was carefully examining Chin Leong Yu, Chin Leang Yu was also secretly watching him.</p>
<p>There was no other reason than that the man in front of him was simply too handsome. His facial features were practically perfect, possessing both masculine strength and a captivatingly gentle smile. His eyes were bright and piercing, and the curve and shape of his lips were just right. He was arguably the most handsome man Sheen Leonu had ever seen in her life. heart began to beat faster after just one glance.</p>
<p>Good jade. Hearing Lynn Sha call her name, Shin Liong Yu finally reacted and quickly clasped her hands in greeting, saying, &quot;Your subordinate is here. You&#x27;re new here. I should have given you a welcome feast.&quot; Lyn Shao said gently. &quot;But the beast tide is coming soon, so let&#x27;s fight it first, and then we can drink and celebrate.</p>
<p>Your subordinate obeys.&quot; With a wave of his hand, Lin Shiao instantly upgraded Chin Leong Yu to level 10. Her personal attributes directly changed to attributes strength 88 + 17, spirit 110 + 22, constitution 80 + 16, soul 70 + 14. Combat power rating 99 stars. Thank you very much, my lord. Chin Leang Yus gratitude was evident in her words.</p>
<p>My lord, you level me up 10 levels the moment we met. You&#x27;re really kind to me. At that moment, the century&#x27;s rough shouts could be heard from afar at the territo&#x27;s perimeter wall. Enemy attack. Demonic tide is coming.</p>
<p>The soldiers suddenly turned around and headed towards the territory gate in an orderly manner. Chin Lean Yu was about to set off, but Lyn Shao reached out and stopped her. Lyn Shao, Leon Yu, as a general, how can you come to this battlefield of 10,000 races without your own personal guards? Lyn Sha took out two ordinary recruitment tokens and waved his hand. Use Hasha summoning to consume the energy of the myriad races battlefield and summoned the Hashia exclusive unit, the white-shaped spearman. Chapter 80.</p>
<p>The bloodthirsty White Spear soldiers make their debut. Recruitment tokens were originally only used to summon troops of a certain level. One recruitment token could summon 10 troops. If you have two recruitment tokens, last time you recruited human armored infantry, the next time you might recruit elven archers, both are rare unit types, but you can&#x27;t just recruit whichever you want. immediately used the Hasha token to upgrade the few recruitment tokens in his hand and summoned the Hashia golden legendary troops because he knew that his strength was not strong enough.</p>
<p>If he summoned six or seven different Chinese troops, each with 10 people, he would not know how to use them and would not be able to bring out the maximum ability of each type of troop. Not to mention, he would waste the recruitment tokens for no reason and lose the advantage of making the Chinese troops fight in large groups. 10 Mod Dao iron guards are already very strong, but 1,000 MOA iron guards are even more invincible. Fortunately, the ancient demon told him the trick. Similar to recruiting heroes under certain conditions in China, summoned units can also be summoned by designation.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, when a lord has a certain type of unit, or when the lord&#x27;s hero has a unit that is exclusive to a certain type of unit, the lord can directly consume more energy to perform a targeted summon, summoning a unit of the same type. As Linhao&#x27;s voice fell, the two recruitment tokens rose directly into the sky, eventually becoming golden talismans engraved with auspicious five-ccoled clouds and adorned with mythical beast patterns at the bottom. The portal roared, and two groups of figures emerged from it. This group of people all carried 4 m long white shafted spears, had heavy swords hanging at their waists, wore iron-faced breastplates, and had two muscular arms exposed, exuding a murderous aura. They weren&#x27;t as tall and muscular as the Emo Dao iron guards or the divine arm archers, who were nearly 2 m tall, but they were still tough men over 1.8 meters tall.</p>
<p>Their skin was dark and some of their facial features and eye color differed slightly from those of the Hanchinese. They were actually an army composed of a mixture of ethnic minorities and Hanchinese. The white-clad soldiers armor did not cover their entire bodies, only their upper bodies and shoulders. They wore gators to protect their shins and gauntlets to protect their forearms, making them somewhat resemble the Spartan hoplights of ancient Greece. Check the attributes of the white-shaped spearman.</p>
<p>White Spearman Magua Jong. Race: Human, Chinese minority. Level one. Quality: Legend. Attributes: Strength: 28 + 20.</p>
<p>Spirit 35 + 25. Constitution 32 + 23, soul 10 + 7. Combat power rating 30 stars. Attributes added by skills, equipment, lord abilities, etc. are not included in the combat power rating.</p>
<p>skills. Bloodlust, death combat, barbarian warrior, intimidation, son of the mountain. The unit with the highest spirit stat at level one that has been recruited so far, Lynsha nodded. It was precisely because of Lin Xiao&#x27;s limited recruitment that an additional 2,000 battlefield energy were consumed, leaving only a little over 600 battlefield energy. The 20 fierce white pole soldiers from the stone pillars received the information that the main gods battlefield had been completed and they all walked towards Lin Shiao kneeling on one knee.</p>
<p>Greetings your lordship. No need for such formalities. The white spear spearman rose faced Chin Leong Yu and saluted again. Greetings madam. Chin Leongyu nodded and said on the battlefield you must call me general and you must not call me madam anymore.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Lynn Sha waved his hand. Upgrade everything to level 10. 20 White Spear soldiers were instantly upgraded to level 10, their experience points wiped out. But the White Spear soldiers immediately gained powerful attributes and could be deployed to the battlefield right away.</p>
<p>Attributes strength 60 + 42 spirit 85 + 58 constitution 72 + 50 soul 30 + 21 combat power rating 79 stars. Lynn Sha nodded in satisfaction. It was a standard golden legendary panel. The reason why the white spear soldiers have so many attributes in parenthesis is because Chin Leongu&#x27;s s level spearman command increases all attributes by 50%. And Lyn Xiao&#x27;s eternal peace increases all attributes by 20%.</p>
<p>My lord, the beast tide has been going on for several minutes. I am terrified and am willing to lead the troops to resist it immediately. Okay, go ahead. After saying this, Chin Leong Yu quickly apologized to Lin Shiao and led 20 White Spear soldiers towards the gate of the Lord&#x27;s mansion. Seeing Chin Leong Yu lead her troops away, Lyn Sha could only smile bitterly to himself.</p>
<p>Chin Leang Yu was indeed a married woman. Could it be that I, the Lord, am about to engage in an NTR scene right before everyone&#x27;s eyes? I&#x27;m a pure lord. This must be because of Heay&#x27;s influence. Lyn Shao shook his head with a formidable enemy at hand. What am I thinking? And he hasn&#x27;t even won over his own concubine, Ba yet.</p>
<p>Hey, where&#x27;s Ba? Lyn Sha looked left and right, but couldn&#x27;t see Ba, and a sense of doubt arose in his heart. But time was of the essence, and he didn&#x27;t have time to search. So, he also headed towards the territory gate. Here, a few minutes before Lyn Shao successfully upgraded the Lord&#x27;s mansion. in the chat channel.</p>
<p>The untold story about Lin Shia and the Succubus Princess had just come to an end. Dinglay, I&#x27;ve already started upgrading my Lord&#x27;s Mansion to tier 2. Dinglay is awesome. It seems that Dinglay is going to become the first player in my newbie zone to complete the second level of Lord&#x27;s Mansion. Awesome.</p>
<p>Many people haven&#x27;t even upgraded to a higher level yet. A genius is a genius. You can&#x27;t compare. Dinglay he. It&#x27;s just a tiny insignificant achievement.</p>
<p>Nothing to brag about. He say, &quot;Then why did you jump out and say you&#x27;re starting to upgrade to a second tier university?&quot; Dinglay, I&#x27;m just encouraging everyone. You should know that five people have already successfully upgraded to the second tier. Besides Dugu Xiaolan, who ranked first, there are four other experts, all of whom are from other newbie zones. Sigh.</p>
<p>You know, in the last heroic first recruitment, our 89757 newb zone took the first, 9inth, and 10th spots. Now that Lynn Shiao is exhausted from running around, it&#x27;s our duty to carry the banner of the newbie zone. Heay was speechless for a moment. The chat channel was filled with eusive praise for Dinglay. The pretty girl also sent a private message to Heay, advising him to calm down.</p>
<p>Dinglay then said, &quot;Perhaps I should have more confidence in our newbie zone. Lyn Shia and Chufinga are both top tier players. They should still be a fighting force. I also really hope that they can complete the upgrade before me. Nothing more than this.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the glory of the entire newbie zone, not just my personal glory.&quot; &quot;Wow,&quot; Dinglay is so generous. Dinglay smiled and quietly enjoyed the praise and cheers from the crowd until the main god system notification sound came immediately. Lynn Shiao has successfully upgraded to a second tier university, becoming the sixth ranked newbie lord in Lan district this year. Dinglays expression stiffened for a moment and his mood quickly sank. In the end, Lynn Sha beat him to it.</p>
<p>I failed again. But soon the feedback from the Lord&#x27;s talent became strangely more and more numerous and stronger. Dinglay realized. It turns out that the last few words I said just now perfectly saved my day. I didn&#x27;t fail.</p>
<p>Dinglay breathed a sigh of relief. Lyn Sha. Oh Lyn Sha, you truly are my destined enemy. If you don&#x27;t die, how can I maximize my talents? How can I become stronger? I even need to acknowledge you when I&#x27;m showing off just to avoid being proven wrong by you. No, I can&#x27;t let you keep running ahead of me.</p>
<p>Dinglay took out his epic great sword, examined it for a moment, and finally made up his mind. Chapter 81. The emperor&#x27;s soul possesses him again. Lyn Sha arrived at the territory gate where the war was already raging. But upon closer inspection, Lyn Sha was greatly surprised because after completing the second level, there will be a beast tide.</p>
<p>But in front of your own territory, there is still a demon tide. Demonic beasts, bone demons, nest demons, violent demons, demon children, longhorned evil spirits, nightmare beasts, three-headed hell hounds, and infected creatures. A uniform array of demonic soldiers and monsters. Sword Saint Pay Min transformed into a beam of sword light and charged into the demonic tide. Wherever he passed, no one could stop him.</p>
<p>From their first defense against the demonic tide, their soldiers were incredibly skilled and orderly on the second occasion. Despite the thousands of demons surging forward, not a single one could reach the gate. Just then, Chin Leong Yu arrived and her archer command S rank and all troop command a rank effects immediately took effect. The attributes of both the divine archer and the phantom archer are immediately increased by 50%. The iron guard with the Mod Dao Voidal will receive a direct increase of 30%.</p>
<p>20 White Spear spearman formed a line and came behind the Mod Dao iron guards. The two of them and the Mod Dao iron guards formed a group with the Mod Dao iron guards in front and the white pole spear soldiers behind. The nearly 4 m long white handled spear pointed diagonally at the sky. When the demon came in front of the MO Dao iron guard, the spear was quickly lowered and thrust out. The white spearmen were much faster than the iron guards with their long swords.</p>
<p>They wielded their spears quickly and accurately. And when two spears were thrust out at the same time, both demons were pierced through. On the main battlefield, the Mod Dao soldiers and the Bygon soldiers formed an impenetrable human wall to block all the surging demons. Seeing that all the troops were elite, their positions were cunning, their numbers were small, and Shin Leong Yu had little room to command them for the time being. With a delicate shout, she raised her white spear.</p>
<p>her cloak billowing behind her and charged into the demonic tide, unleashing powerful and sweeping attacks to kill her enemies. The main force of the demonic tide still consists of five level 30 epic nest demons. Payman has already killed one nest demon and is now dealing with the second one. Chin Leong Yu fought her way through the enemy lines, charging straight towards another epic level demon. To catch the thief, first catch the king, kill the nest demon, and the power of the demon tide will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Although Chin Leong Yu, a master of spear fighting, did not possess the same outstanding skills as Pay Min, her marshall prowess was still not to be underestimated. Her marksmanship was characterized by speed, accuracy, and ruthlessness. It was unassuming yet highly effective and lethal demon whose attributes are far superior to her own. Chin Leong Yu can still subtly gain the upper hand. As the demonic tide was wiped out one by one, my experience points steadily increased and the energy of the battlefield of all races gradually rose as well.</p>
<p>Knowing that the situation on the battlefield had stabilized, Lyn Sha put his hands behind his back and nodded secretly. At this moment, amidst the demonic tide, the ground suddenly cracked open and a stream of magma shot into the sky. A gigantic demon, entirely crimson red, wielding a broken great sword and sporting a severed horn on its head, emerged. Abyss demon. Lyn Xiaos eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
<p>It was actually the same abyss demon from before. Insignificant humans. Loly scum. Humble ants fit only for the ninth heaven. The abyss demon roared.</p>
<p>This time, I will take your dog&#x27;s life. Having said that, the abyss demon raised his hand and activated endless hatred. Another massive shower of meteors plummeted from the sky. Damn, shameless. It&#x27;s that trick again.</p>
<p>A wide area, high damage AoE skill. Lyn Shiao immediately took out the talismans from his spatial storage. Use a purple quality defensive rune. The talisman vanished instantly, and Lyn Xhao&#x27;s territory was immediately enveloped by a transparent barrier. With a deafening boom, a shower of meteors crashed down on the territo&#x27;s barrier, causing the entire territory to tremble violently.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with this barrier, the Lord&#x27;s manor was defended, and the phantom archers, whose defenses were weak, were unharmed because they were firing arrows within the territory. Upon seeing that it was this abyss demon again, Pay Min felt a chill and prepared to attack him. The ground cracked open and two more abyssal demons emerged, attacking Pay Men from both sides. The abyss demon stood calmly in the center of the battlefield, raising its hand once more. Endless hatred activated, meteor showers fall once more.</p>
<p>The ground shook violently, and the territory barrier was shaken once again. The entire barrier completely absorbed this large-scale AoE damage. The abyss demon raised its hand again, and endless hatred continued to fall. The target this time is the iron guards of the Mod Dao and the White Spear spearman standing outside the territory gates. Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;This is bad.</p>
<p>The Mod Dao iron guards had amazing defenses, but the White Pole Spear soldiers were mountain soldiers from a minority ethnic group who were exceptionally brave. However, for some reason, their armor did not cover their entire bodies, and their arms were still exposed. Boom! The iron guards with their long swords stood at the forefront to resist the demonic tide, while the White Pole spearmen wielded their spears in a dazzling display to deflect the falling meteorites. However, several white armored soldiers were still injured by the meteorites that were flying everywhere. Their bare arms were pierced and bleeding.</p>
<p>Linhao&#x27;s eyes narrowed. This is my legendary gold tier unit, and it&#x27;s the first time it&#x27;s been injured. Who commands the White Spear army is still suppressing the nest demons and has no room to maneuver or provide relief. The wounded White Spear soldier roared, igniting the fighting spirit of all the White Spear Soldier soldiers. Blood frenzy triggered.</p>
<p>Blood lust. When a white spearman bleeds, a berserk state is triggered. Strength, spirit, and constitution are immediately increased by 30% and last until the end of the battle. Moreover, as the injury worsens, the berserk state bonus will continue to increase up to a maximum of 100% for all three attributes. In addition to the wounded white spear soldiers, the uninjured soldiers nearby who also possess blood lust will enjoy a 30% bonus to all three attributes until the end of the battle.</p>
<p>In a berserk state, the White Spear Spearman enters a fearless state, becoming unaffected by mind magic and unafraid of pain and reaching maximum attack speed. The White Spear Spearman&#x27;s bloodlust was triggered, even affecting the Mo Dao Iron Guard, who also possessed the bloodlust skill. The two melee classes were unleashed with ferocity, advancing instead of retreating, pushing back against the demonic tide. A flicker of surprise crossed the eyes of the abyss demon Brans, who then waved his hand again. The meteor shower fell again.</p>
<p>The white-clad soldiers withstood the attack from above. Their fighting spirit reignited and they charged forward. In that instant, the demonic tide seemed to be tottering as if it were being counterattacked by Lyn Xiao&#x27;s dozens of troop types. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s gaze grew colder and colder. Although his legendary golden troops were incredibly powerful, whether they were the iron guards with long swords or the white spearmen, each one could take on 10 excellent demons without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>The demon tide was endless and he couldn&#x27;t kill them all in a short time. And this abyssal demon came prepared. Does it have an endless supply of mana and no cool down yet? The other two abyssal demons weren&#x27;t able to fight like that either. Payman is now fighting two abyss demons alone. This abyss demon who had dealt with Lynn Shiao twice before is hiding in the center of the map throwing meteor shower which the divine archer can&#x27;t hit.</p>
<p>For the time being there is no one who can deal with him. We can&#x27;tt let him continue like this, otherwise my lord&#x27;s manner and my troops will suffer casualties sooner or later. Lynn Shiao gritted his teeth and decided to go himself. Because of the large number of monsters killed, the battlefield energy has now reached 1,000 points. I don&#x27;t have enough energy to use the limited summoning ability of the Hasha token.</p>
<p>We can only try our luck. Let&#x27;s summon the soul of the Chinese emperor directly. Hopefully, he&#x27;s not a weak emperor. exchange for 1,000 points of battlefield energy and use the Hashia token, Emperor&#x27;s soul, to summon. A golden light shone down from the sky, piercing through the endless fog on the battlefield of all races.</p>
<p>A faint majestic chanting arose from the heavens and earth, making the surrounding atmosphere solid and heavy, as if one were in the midst of a battlefield with clashing swords and galloping horses, or as if residing high in the heavens, overlooking all living beings. In an instant, countless imperial souls surged towards Lyn Sha. Chapter 82. A great success. It was actually this emperor.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha once again saw hundreds of the heroic spirits of Chinese emperors floating before him. This time, he did not take it upon himself to choose the emperor he desired. Instead, he stood still, his expression calm, waiting for the emperor&#x27;s soul to come to him on its own. The eerie laughter of the second shadowy figure as he imparted his secrets echoed again. This emperor&#x27;s soul knows how to choose people.</p>
<p>The first person you recruited was Xiang Ji because you are from Jangdong and Xiang Ji was also from Jangdong. He had a good impression of people from Jangdong. You want to be chosen as the first emperor and the general of heavenly strategy. That depends on whether others even think you&#x27;re worthy. Otherwise, you can use battlefield energy to bombard them.</p>
<p>As long as you have enough energy and you impose strict conditions on them, it&#x27;s not impossible for Wuatin to come at you. Cough, cough. Stop fighting. The second shadowy figure dodged the first shadowy figure&#x27;s hand and add it. If you truly lack the power, then project an image of strength and profoundity.</p>
<p>There will always be blind emperors who come looking for you. He the recollection ends. This is just showing off to intimidate the emperor&#x27;s soul. Lyn Sha steadied himself and responded calmly. 1 second, 2 seconds.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha remained unmoved, exuding composure and grandeur, as if he himself were one of the emperors, majestic and profound. A man of medium build with narrow eyes, a long beard, and a broad face, exuding an aura of shrewdness and doineering presence, walked straight towards them. &quot;I sense something about you that attracts me. You need my abilities. Go forth and conquer.</p>
<p>Conquer everyone.&quot; The emperor&#x27;s spirit actually spoke. Then it instantly merged into Lin Xiaos consciousness. Lynhos eyes closed and opened. The spirit of the emperor has possessed me. All is complete.</p>
<p>Good. Lyn Shia was in a great mood. Although this heroic spirit was not good-looking, its abilities were undeniable. Emperor Wu of Wei Chow Chow. Ability borrowing level one.</p>
<p>Degree of integration extremely low. Duration 24 hours. Abilities: Click to view doineering. Srank ruthless hero in chaotic times slashcapable minister in peaceful times. Poetry composed while holding a spear.</p>
<p>All troop types command a rank. Wayi Wu Legacy note. Due to the low integration level of Chow Chow, some abilities are still hidden and cannot be possessed. With time running out, Lyn Sha quickly checked Chow Chows first few skills. Overbearing Chow Chow aderes to a hegemonic approach granting him a 50% increase in personal marshall prowess.</p>
<p>Chow Chow&#x27;s strength, spirit, physique, and soul all attributes are increased by 50%. Intelligence, political ability, and command ability. The latter three translate to increased mental agility, farming efficiency, and battlefield troop leadership for the user. A treacherous hero in times of chaos slash a capable minister in times of peace. Chow Chow never escaped this label throughout his life, but he was quite satisfied with it.</p>
<p>When Chow Chow possesses the host, the host&#x27;s wealth, experience, and energy gained in war are increased by 100%. When constructing in a territory, the output of all mineral veins, spirit fields, and troops is increased by 50%. holding a spear and composing a poem. Also known as a hero of his time, Chow Chow possessed a unique charisma that commanded respect, he could fight on horseback, govern the country on foot, pour wine by the river, and compose poetry with his spear across his hand. Chow Chow and his spirits grant a 100% increase to the host&#x27;s charm, creating a strong attraction that draws people in, inspiring emotions such as allegiance, loyalty, respect, and admiration.</p>
<p>Target audience: both men and women. All troop types command level A increases all troop types four main attributes by 30%. Lyn Sha glanced at it quickly and made a judgment in his mind. Unfortunately, Shin Leong Yu already has a level command of all troop types, so Chow Chows skill overlaps with hers and has no effect, which is a waste. Chow Chows skills are very comprehensive, Lin Sha thought to himself.</p>
<p>Not only is he intellectually gifted and politically astute, but he also possesses considerable personal combat skills. With the spirit of Emperor Wu of Wei possessing him, Lyn Sha wearing the four-piece scale rock set and wielding the holy sword Falion has the following attributes. Lyn Sha level 10. Attributes: Strength 69 + 150 + 95. Spirit 70 + 150 + 95.</p>
<p>Constitution 45 + 150 + 100. Soul 45 + 150 + 70 skills unrestricted mixed martial arts D rank all weapon mastery C rank farming C rank panlong staff technique a rank overbearing s rank treachery in troubled times/capable minister in peaceful times poetry with spear legacy of chowchow command a rank combat power rating 66 stars lord&#x27;s talent peace for all ages Click to view. Chow Chow&#x27;s spirit is not like Xiang Yu&#x27;s which directly adds 200 to 300 to strength and constitution, but it is more comprehensive with all four attributes added by 150. Lyn Sha scale rock set added 70 points to all attributes. The life amulet adds 30 points to constitution.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lyn Sha took out the holy sword falion again, and his strength and spirit attributes increased by 25 each. Lyn Sha couldn&#x27;t help but sigh. Spending money on in-game purchases is so satisfying. Being lucky is so satisfying. The excellent armor set and epic weapon that are almost complete are something that would take an ordinary lord decades or even centuries to acquire in the official server.</p>
<p>Even powerful families and top ranking lords don&#x27;t necessarily own a set. He had only been in the battlefield of 10,000 races for a few days, and he had already almost achieved it. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s attributes now far surpass those of anyone under his command. It is also far superior to the abyssal demons in the demonic tide. With the spirit of the Chinese emperor fully possessed, Lynn Sha laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Brance, come out and face your death. After saying that, Lyn Shao stepped out of the territory barrier and charged directly at Brans, who was constantly releasing meteor fire ring. When the abyss demon saw Lin Sha personally go to the battlefield, he was first delighted, then suddenly shocked. Ishi was happy because last time Lyn Sha had to rely on sword saint paymin to severely injure him before he could defeat him, and his strength was not as good as his. This time he actually dared to break into the demonic tide on his own.</p>
<p>Wasn&#x27;t this just courting death? The shock came from the fact that Lyn Sha was radiating murderous intent, constantly releasing his aura of malevolence, and his entire body was overflowing with energy. He was clearly very powerful and difficult to deal with. Lynsha stepped into the demonic tide, wielding a holy sword in his left hand and a demonic spear in his right, charging left and right. Unstoppable, it charged straight at the abyssal demon Brand. Seeing Lyn Xiao&#x27;s free and doineering attack posture on the battlefield, the abyss demon swallowed hard, inexplicably feeling.</p>
<p>Even from a demon&#x27;s perspective, this enemy is somewhat handsome. Bran suddenly realized what he was thinking. A human who dares to defile the demon princess. You must die. The abyss demon raised its massive broken greats sword.</p>
<p>Revenge counterattack activated. Damage is increased by 50% against enemies who have severely attacked you. Are you ever going to stop? I&#x27;ve already told you I don&#x27;t know your princess. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s long sword and spear clashed, easily blocking the abyss demons attacks. Was this demonic tide you&#x27;re doing? Were you behind the four rare mineral veins? You demon, you actually resort to ambush tactics? Lyn Shia was a martial arts champion in school.</p>
<p>Although his skills were not as good as those of a top general like Xiang Yu, he was definitely a master. Now, with Xiao Xiaos spirit possessing him, his combat abilities have reached a new level. Lyn Shiao s relentless pressure with his dual weapons, Brans had no choice but to retreat repeatedly. Shut up. I am a noble, high-ranking demon, just like the noble succubus princess.</p>
<p>The demon roared, but Lynn Shiao gradually overwhelmed it, leaving it powerless to fight back. Ba, what superior demon race? You&#x27;re always slandering my innocence out of thin air. When did I ever have anything to do with your princess? I, Chow Chow, only like to say pa. No, that&#x27;s not right. Today, I&#x27;ll show you just how many bowls of noodles I, Lyn Sha, have eaten.</p>
<p>Chapter 83. Why is the Succubus Princess angry? Lyn Shia launched a series of powerful attacks, putting the abyss demon in grave danger. Die. Finally, the demonic spear in Liaos hand suddenly burst into light, drawing the demon&#x27;s attention. Lyn Shao then threw it with all his might.</p>
<p>Demonic lance named Knight&#x27;s lance Brianac flew out as a streak of light, piercing straight through the head of the abyss demon. The tenacious abyssal demon coughed up blood and collapsed with a mournful howl. I will come back. Lyn Sha swung his long sword and the abyss demon&#x27;s head fell off. Then its entire body turned to ashes.</p>
<p>The villain really talks too much. Lyn Sha muttered to himself. After killing the actual leader of this demonic tide, the high-ranking demonic abyss demon brands. The pressure from the demonic tide instantly decreased. The MO Dao iron guards in their berserk state almost completely destroyed the demonic tide.</p>
<p>Your lordship is mighty. When the soldiers saw their lord personally take to the battlefield and kill the local leader, they shouted in unison, their morale soaring. The two heroes on the battlefield had also killed their respective enemies. And upon seeing this, they immediately rushed to their lord&#x27;s place. Soon, this wave of second tier university students will come to an end.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao sheathed his demonic spear, carrying only the uniquely shaped dragon bone, holy sword fal at his waist. With his hands behind his back, he stood calmly amidst the demonic tide, watching his soldiers fight valiantly. His aura was so strong that none of the remaining demons dared to attack him. His mission was accomplished. King against king, he had killed Brance.</p>
<p>The remaining killings were the business of his men. Pay Min and Chin Leong Yu approached Lin Sha and knelt on one knee. Lord, your divine might is unparalleled. We failed to arrive in time to rescue you. Please punish us, Lord.</p>
<p>The two heroes were caught off guard, and the Lord went and killed the strongest demon tide boss by himself. Lynn Shia nodded calmly. It&#x27;s all right. I came here on my own. The abyss demon branch has been killed.</p>
<p>You all should hurry and wipe out the remaining ones. Yes, sir. Pay Min and Chin Leong Yu then got up. Lin Shia intended to return directly to his territory, but unexpectedly, he spotted Chinang Yu wearing scale armor, a scarlet cloak, her long hair tied in a high ponytail reaching her waist, covered in blood, exuding a heroic and incomparably beautiful aura. At that glance, Lyn Xiaos heart pounded wildly.</p>
<p>Married women are great. an endless sea of lava. The pitch black lava path leads directly to the island. Inside the palace, a stunningly beautiful succubus listened to the report from her succubus maid, her expression gradually turning strange. That idiot brands.</p>
<p>Call him over here. Before the palace, the permanent teleportation array shone brightly. And from within the flames, a gigantic one-horned demon stepped out. The stunningly beautiful succubus stood before the teleportation array, her pretty face slightly frosty, holding a long thorny whip in her hand. Master.</p>
<p>The onehorned demon knelt on one knee, burying its head deep into the rubble strewn ground. Brans, look what you&#x27;ve done. A melodious yet murderous voice rang out, and the abyss demon dared not move, saying, Brans has been defeated. He failed to kill the human brat and avenge her highness the princess asel. The long whip fell, lashing the abyss demon and sending up a spray of lava and blood.</p>
<p>The demon could not withstand the blow and collapsed rolling on the ground. Master Bran&#x27;s strength is suppressed to level 30 upon entering the beginner area. There&#x27;s no way to Is this what I meant? The succubus lashed out with her whip again, and the abyss demon howled in agony. Brans doesn&#x27;t understand your highness. Your dog nose is really sharp.</p>
<p>You even dare to sniff my scent. But when are you going to control your dog mouth? The succubus lashed out at the abyssal demons on the ground, muttering hatefully. Your nonsense has spread throughout the entire newbie zone. What? I merely used a secret demonic technique to remotely implant a mark into that human boy&#x27;s body, so of course he will bear my aura. The succubus said coldly.</p>
<p>What are you yelling about outside? Your highness, I am terrified. I was wrong. What&#x27;s wrong with it? The succubus lashed out with her whip again. The abyss demon brand stammered. I I shouldn&#x27;t have ruined her highness&#x27;s reputation.</p>
<p>Madness. The succubus lashed out again and again, causing the abyss demon to scream in agony. When the succubus s hand was tired, she stopped angrily and handed the whip to the maid beside her. What&#x27;s wrong with it? the succubus asked again. Brans buried her head deep in the succubus s high heels, trembling as she said.</p>
<p>I am unaware. The succubus said coldly. Your mistake lies in this. It&#x27;s always been me, the princess, who has always taken advantage of respectable men. How could it be that I, the princess, have been slept with by a man? Can&#x27;t you speak properly? Abyss demon, huh? The succubus was instantly enraged and kicked the massive abyssal demon several times over.</p>
<p>This is a disgrace to our highranking demon race. Has that weapon been delivered? Brans mumbled. It&#x27;s been delivered. He killed me in a solo kill, so I guess I gave him the kill. Oh, he&#x27;s now capable of solo killing you.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s because my level is suppressed. Shut up. The succubus snapped. Even a random sycophant I could pick from the ninth heaven is better than you. Now go back to your lair.</p>
<p>A simp?&quot; The abyss demon asked, puzzled. &quot;What kind of unit is that?&quot; Roll. The abyss demon dared not ask any more questions, hastily, entered the teleportation array, and disappeared. The stunningly beautiful succubus princess stood silently, lost in thought. &quot;The term simp is really interesting, human kid.</p>
<p>How many more surprising things can you tell us? You&#x27;ve grown up so fast. It wasn&#x27;t a waste of my investment in you in advance. The succubus licked her bright red lips. I&#x27;m really looking forward to you entering the official zone soon so you can teach those hypocritical white-winged a lesson. Only then will the magical mark I cast with my lifeblood truly explode.</p>
<p>He was quickly and completely eradicated under the command of pay Min and Chin Leonu. Upon returning to his territory, Lin Sha heard the notification from the main god system. You have successfully resisted the S-class demonic tide. Rewards are being calculated. It&#x27;s still an S rank demonic tide.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha curled his lips. No wonder his White Spear soldiers were injured and their blood lust was triggered, forcing him to personally take to the battlefield. Battle results. Annihilate the following enemies. One abyss demon special.</p>
<p>Epic. Two abyss demons. Epic. Five nest demons. Epic.</p>
<p>115 violent demons, excellent. 655 fierce demons, rare. 1,00 bone demons, rare. And 1,000 horn demons, fine. Battle duration, 2 hours for minutes and 35 seconds.</p>
<p>Our casualties, zero. Special stacking, s level, demonic tide, lord personally participating in the battle, and the difference between the lords and troops levels exceeding 10 levels. and special epic level boss in the beginner area. Rewards 5,673,740 experience 98,640 gold 4,587 energy epic equipment great sword ashbringer one epic quality chest two superior quality chests one superior equipment bright silver spear. Excellent.</p>
<p>Excellent. Emperor Wu of Wei is truly formidable. Once the ruthless hero of chaos is activated, experience and energy on the battlefield increase by 100%. It&#x27;s perfect for me right now. Lyn Sha couldn&#x27;t contain his joy.</p>
<p>Thanks to ancient demon number two, his suggestion allowed me to get Chow Chow for free for 24 hours. What good luck! I really don&#x27;t know why Emperor Wu of Wei would willingly possess me. Chapter 84. The Legacy of Wei Woo. Exploding Arrow Towers.</p>
<p>This demonic tide was like sending charcoal and snowy weather to Lyn Shao because Lynsha desperately needed experience to upgrade the troops he would summon next. The demonic tide just happened to relieve Lin Xiao&#x27;s immediate crisis and even replenished a lot of battlefield energy. An epic item was also revealed and Lin Shia clicked to view it first. Ashbrer epic weapon quality orange epic attributes base attack power 580 strength plus 30 constitution plus 20 special attribute fire attribute attack critical hit rate increased by 20% accuracy increased by 20%. When attacking an enemy there is a certain chance to absorb the enemy&#x27;s life force.</p>
<p>When attacking an enemy there is a certain chance to trigger a fire explosion. Introduction. The dwarven king forged Ashbringer from a crystal purified by the followers of the holy light, thus giving the sword the extraordinary quality of carrying the holy light. Because this sword can turn the undead to ashes, it is named Ashbringer. This weapon looks familiar.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha nodded and then examined another weapon, a bright silver spear. Bright silver spear. Excellent weapon. Quality purple. Excellent.</p>
<p>Attributes. Base attack power 315, constitution plus 10. Special attribute increases critical hit rate by 20% when attacking. Just an ordinary outstanding weapon. Having seen countless epic weapons, Lyn Sha was somewhat dismissive of this exceptional weapon.</p>
<p>Give it to Chin Leong Yu. Lyn Sha had arranged a place for the weapons and planned to call Chin Leongyu back. Looking up, I saw Baoi, draped in a bright red cloak, sitting in the square, whispering with a group of flower fairies. Ba seemed to sense something and noticed Lynsha looking at her. So, she got up and walked towards Lynsha.</p>
<p>My lord, Baoi bowed gracefully. Baoi, where were you when the demonic tide attacked? Ba&#x27;s expression turned somewhat somber, but she quickly regained her composure. My lord, I activated my cloak to become invisible as soon as I saw General Chin appear. Why? Lynsha asked, puzzled. General Chin is dashing and handsome with unparalleled charm.</p>
<p>I saw that General Chen&#x27;s eyes were full of admiration for the Lord, and I did not want to spoil the Lord&#x27;s good time, so I hid away. What is this? Lyn Sha was both amused and exasperated. Lean Yu is straightforward and her womanly heroine skills make her naturally loyal to the Lord. It&#x27;s not what you think. My lord, please do not underestimate my intuition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have been unable to serve the Lord in bed these past few days. General Chen. Haha. Ba, you&#x27;re overthinking it. Look, I&#x27;ll call her over.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha directly summoned Chin Leong Yu to the square through the system. Leang Yu, this is your bright silver spear. Lyn Shao handed the weapon directly to the valiant female general. Thank you, my lord. Overjoyed, Chin Leong Yu solemnly accepted the gleaming silver spear, her delight evident in her expression.</p>
<p>Her eyebrows and eyes were exquisite, and her features were beautiful. Her smile was even more captivating. Lyn Sha felt his heart stirring uncontrollably. With a cheerful smile, he blurted out, &quot;Liong Yu, I heard the White Spear soldiers call you madam. Are you married?&quot; As soon as he said those words, Lyn Sha realized what he meant.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s wrong with me? How can I even ask such a question? It&#x27;s over.&quot; So that&#x27;s why Chow Chow actively sought to possess me. My lord, Lyang Yu is already married. Chin Leong Yu didn&#x27;t mince words and answered directly. Lyang Yu doesn&#x27;t remember who she married. She only remembers that she was married, but unfortunately her husband died young many years ago.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t remember who I married. Could it be that the god system changed it? Or is it the work of an ancient demon? Lyn Sha tends to believe that this is the system character setting for Chin Leang Yu in the main god system. When deploying heroes, the god system selects heroes based on their optimal age and memories to maximize their strength and ensure their loyalty to their lord. There are some well-known cases in a formal district. A certain chief lord whose strongest hero was Lancelot, one of the knights of the round table.</p>
<p>According to western history, Lancelot was loyal only to King Arthur. However, if the heroes summoned in this way are not loyal to the lord, the game of the battlefield of all races cannot proceed. Therefore, Lancelot, the knight of the round table, directly transferred his loyalty to Arthur to his lord, giving that lucky lord a powerful hero with high loyalty. It seems that Chin Leang Yu is portrayed as a female general who leads an army alone after her husband&#x27;s death. Sigh, he&#x27;s a man with a tragic fate.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha thought to himself. Oh, she&#x27;s a widow. Another voice in my head thought. Lyn Sha was once again reminded that this was not his true thought. Chowo Chow.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Chowo Chow. Please accept my condolences, Leon Yu. From now on, treat this place as your own home. Lyn Sha was gentle and kind.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll take care of your wife myself, so don&#x27;t worry. Another voice in his heart said. Lyn Shao suddenly shook his head. This is definitely not my own idea. Impossible.</p>
<p>Absolutely impossible. Turning his head, he saw Ba with a faint smile, as if to say, &quot;See, I told you so.&quot; The lord&#x27;s eyes are practically glowing with greed when he looks at General Chin. &quot;Damn it! Even Baoi seems less charming than Chin Leongyu now.&quot; Xiaoming, you&#x27;ve really come at the perfect time. Lyn Shao dared not look at Chin Leang Yu any longer and waved his hand, ordering her to lead her troops to clean up the battlefield. Before Chin Leong Yu left, Lin Shiao arranged for several farmers to build her exclusive residence, the Tusci village.</p>
<p>It also takes 2 days to build and will be completed in 2 days. You can produce white spearman a hem. Ba, it&#x27;s getting late. The battlefield has been quite fruitful this time. Lynn Shiao changed the subject.</p>
<p>Could you open a treasure chest for me and see if you can? Ba&#x27;s eyes crinkled into crescent moons as she smiled. Very well. I am willing to serve my lord. Ding. Your hero has opened an excellent treasure chest and obtained an excellent spirit field.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha forgot that Bao&#x27;s luck value is still negative. Ba, my lord, have I messed up? Lyn Sha? Not really. I have lots of treasure chests. Seeing Bao&#x27;s dejected look, Lyn Sha couldn&#x27;t help but say, Ba, let me tell you a joke. A minute later, Ba&#x27;s giggles like silver bells rang out.</p>
<p>A master of both advancement and retreat. A soft rice eater who stubbornly lives off his wife. Haha. The tiger of the major crimes unit. Lyn Sha breathed a sigh of relief when he heard Ba&#x27;s luck value rise to minus78 again.</p>
<p>He secretly thought to himself that he must tell Baoi more jokes so that he could reach 100 loyalty points as soon as possible and also increase his luck value. If Ba&#x27;s luck value is positive and combined with her own luck, wouldn&#x27;t she be the reincarnation of a lucky person? Now, you should open the treasure chest yourself. Lynn Sha opened the treasure chests one by one. Let&#x27;s start with the highquality treasure chests. All of them consist of ordinary resources and excellent equipment.</p>
<p>Then from the rare treasure chest, I got a teleportation scroll and a quest scroll. The rest are spirit fields and resources. Two more excellent farmer talismans were obtained from the excellent treasure chest. Well, Lyn Shia could just recruit them directly to save trouble as he was always short of farmers. The remaining excellent chests yielded some resources, bringing me one step closer to upgrading to level three.</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s finally time for the epic chests. Lyn Sha calmly opened the epic treasure chest. Obtained one blueprint for the explosive arrow tower. Nice one. Build arrow towers within your territory.</p>
<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t have to leave any troops at home to guard the base. Lyn Sha thought to himself. Place a few explosive arrow towers in your home. They&#x27;re epic level defensive structures that most enemies won&#x27;t be able to withstand. If any arrow towers can&#x27;t hold out, immediately use a teleportation scroll to return home and face them head-on.</p>
<p>Check the explosive arrow towers attributes. Chapter 85. Lynho&#x27;s plan. Dinglays actions. By learning the blueprints for the string arrow tower and acquiring the necessary materials, you can construct the explosive arrow tower.</p>
<p>Explosive arrow tower. Quality epic. Level one. Defense 15,000. Damage value 500 1 0 0 per shot.</p>
<p>Special skill can fire multiple explosive arrows at once, causing fatal damage to enemies. Building materials required 1,500 fine wood, 1,500 fine stone, 1,500 fine iron, 1,500 fine copper, five aggwood trunks. Construction time 48 24 hours. Construction requirements: epic level or higher peasants. Lynn Sha understood the arrow tower was indeed a good one, but it required far too many materials.</p>
<p>As expected of an epic building, even just these four ordinary upgrade materials would take an average lord 10 to 15 days to gather. Then they missed the opportunity to upgrade their manner and fell far behind others. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s second level is complete with a 48-hour cool down period. Before that, he has already captured several highlevel material mines such as refined iron. Now, after some calculations, even if I stop mining with the mineral resources I currently control, I will have enough resources to upgrade to level three in 48 hours.</p>
<p>A level three lord&#x27;s manor are far more than 10 times that of a level two manor, and they are all highle materials. The monsters guarding the manor are powerful and tyrannical, and most lords cannot afford to provoke them. This is also the source of Lin Xiao&#x27;s confidence to only get sixth place in the second tier universities and then directly snatch first place in the third tier universities. It&#x27;s thanks to the eternal peace mineral vein that its resource production speed is five times faster than others, while its upgrade speed is increased by 100%. He can upgrade to level three as soon as the cool down is over and no one else has been able to do it in previous years.</p>
<p>Now that we have the explosive arrow tower, we need even more resources. We also need to prepare resources for the three buildings, including the stables, in advance. As for what kind of resources are needed and how much, top student Lin Sha already had it all memorized. The main material for the explosive arrow tower is aggerwood trunk, which is usually found in only a few groves in the beginner area. It seems there&#x27;s a small grove of trees inside my calabash mountain range.</p>
<p>However, it&#x27;s quite in-depth and it conflicts somewhat with my planned route. Lyn Sha closed his eyes and recalled the map. Suddenly, a brilliant idea came to mind. It was getting late and Lyn Sha, who had made his plans, was also tired. He sold all the junk equipment he got from the treasure chest to the auction house.</p>
<p>Then put his hand on Bao&#x27;s shoulder and went back to his room to rest. Faintly, Lyn Xiaos voice could be heard coming from inside the room. He Ba. The sound of rubbing hands together. Are you eligible for marriage? My lord, I have already told you that I was once the consort of the Zhao Emperor.</p>
<p>Although we did not consummate our marriage, does my lord find me lacking? Hm. Does that count as being a wife? No, I don&#x27;t mind. Being married is a plus. No. I like you whether you&#x27;ve been married before or not.</p>
<p>The sound of freezing hands and feet came from the room, followed by Lyn Xiao&#x27;s impotent rage. Those ancient demons deserve to die. Early the next morning, Lyn Shao immediately led all the troops out of the territory to attack the wild monsters. This time, the objective has changed. It&#x27;s no longer about selecting and upgrading mines.</p>
<p>Nor is it about specifically hunting for the four rare resources. Rather, it&#x27;s based on Linhao&#x27;s memory to occupy all the mountain ridges surrounding the entire Holian Mountains. Since Lin Shiao arrived at the battlefield of 10,000 races, he has been expanding outwards, but he has only explored and occupied a small part of the vast Calabash Mountain behind his territory and monster layers here. There is also a grassland of moderate size and a sandalwood forest. There are still many places worth occupying.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia had calculated that even if he split his forces into three groups, he wouldn&#x27;t be able to clear out all the monsters in the entire valley before the black flame lord arrived. Therefore, what Lynn Shia needs to do is to occupy all the ridges of his own Hulu mountain range. Then we&#x27;ll proceed slowly and methodically to deal with the little Kurami inside. Without further ado, taking advantage of the fact that Lin Shao, possessed by Emperor Wei Wu, was equipped with magic spears and led Pay Min Shin Leang Yu and a group of powerful soldiers. They immediately began their clearing campaign.</p>
<p>Ding. Dingle, a player from the Lan region of Blue Star Realm, has successfully upgraded to tier 2 and become the ninth ranked rookie lord in Lan region this year. System reward, one excellent treasure chest. Shortly after the announcement from the main god system sounded, Ding Lay, who had defeated the beast tide, appeared in the chat channel. &quot;Gentlemen, I have successfully completed my studies and passed the second tier university entrance exam.&quot; Then, without waiting for others to praise him, Ding Lay said directly.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot has happened here since I entered the game world. Although I, Ding Lay, am capable, I have always given everyone a chance. Evil people like Ziao Daong and Gene Dang took advantage of the demonic tide to launch surprise attacks and kill their own kind, committing murder and arson. This is not only intolerable to our conscience, nor to the laws of Lang Shia, but even to the gods system. I, Ding Lelay, have been trying to give everyone a chance to reform, and I&#x27;ve been secretly advising them, but some people just don&#x27;t understand.</p>
<p>Now, I&#x27;ve already graduated from a second tier university, so I&#x27;m free to do more. Although Xiao Daong and Gene Dang have been killed by my respectable opponent, Lin Shiao, there are still some ignorant fools around. Dingho Zhu Guang Pangia, do you think no one knows what you&#x27;ve done? I, Ding Lelay, am here today with my own talisman to rid the people of this scourge. One hour later, newbie zone number 89757. Player Pangia has been eliminated.</p>
<p>A few hours later, newbie zone number 89757. Player Deng who has been eliminated. The chat channel immediately erupted into a heated discussion. What is Dinglay trying to do? I don&#x27;t understand. Ding Lay, the big boss, has started to act on behalf of heaven and eliminate evil.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s true. One of my classmates was killed by Dangho. He had a B-level talent and I didn&#x27;t dare to seek revenge. Wow.</p>
<p>It turns out I&#x27;ve been wrong about Ding Lay all along. Ding Lay isn&#x27;t a showoff. Just as Ding Lay was listing the lords and hunting them down one by one, countless people in the chat channel were cheering him on and showering him with compliments. While Chufinga was fiercely hacking and slashing, he received a message from his father. Has phone good been in contact with Lin Sha recently? Chufunga, now with his red hair restored, chopped down an attacking wild beast with a single stroke, replying as he did so, &quot;Dad, do you think I have time to contact Lyn Shao?&quot; Shu Yusi nodded.</p>
<p>This is a beast tied from a second tier university. This unfil still has some ambition. But I heard that Lin Shia and Ding Lay have already entered second tier universities before you. Chufinga. Ah, right, right, right.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll kill you. Oh, I didn&#x27;t mean to chop up your father. I meant to chop up this venomous scorpion lion. Chu Yusi acted as if nothing had happened. Well, I was actually thinking of sending you a few recruitment tokens.</p>
<p>I love you, old man. Chu Yusi remained expressionless. The recruitment warrant has been sent. Keep an eye on Lin Shia and protect him well. I heard that his Dao heart was damaged this time and he only got sixth place.</p>
<p>Sigh. Young people need more experience. Look at me. You can skull me to my face, and I won&#x27;t even flinch. Die, goblin.</p>
<p>Chufunga abruptly shut down the communication. Chu Yusi remained silent for a few seconds like a statue. Then slowly shook his head and sighed. Unfilial descendants. I&#x27;ve heard Ding Lelay is a famously filial son.</p>
<p>If only you were half as well- behaved as him. Chapter 86. Three great masters suddenly appear. Several major events occurred that day. Following Ding Lay, Shufunga achieved a second class ranking, becoming the 10th ranked student in the Lone Non-Bginner Zone.</p>
<p>Ding Lay suddenly and ostentatiously announced his intention to eliminate evil and wickedness. He then executed six notorious lords within a single day, drawing applause from countless people and greatly increasing their goodwill towards Dinglay. Even the previously lukewarm holy alliance founded by Ding Lelay has become incredibly popular with a surge in applications to join. The third thing was the sudden announcement from the newbie zone. Ding.</p>
<p>Player Julie from beginner zone 100086 has used a cross zone transfer token to beginner zone 89757. Ding. Player Wong B from the 100010 newbie zone has used a cross zone transfer token to move to the 89757 newbie zone. Ding. Player Pan Shanu from the 10,000th newbie zone has used a cross zone transfer token to move to the 89,757th newbie zone.</p>
<p>Cross region transfers are rare because they are not much easier than crossing into another region. The sudden announcement left everyone stunned. After a moment, someone tentatively asked, &quot;These names look so familiar.&quot; Eay, I also feel a sense of familiarity as if I&#x27;ve seen it somewhere before Shan by Chiian. It must have been the system announcement. I remember now.</p>
<p>Jill is the third ranked hero recruit in the newbie zone this year and also the second ranked hero to upgrade to tier 2. Everyone finally remembered. Wongbo is the fourth person in the newbie zone to upgrade to a second tier university. Pan Shan Yu is the fifth person in the newbie zone to upgrade to a second tier university. Their names were mentioned in the announcement yesterday.</p>
<p>A moment of silence. My god, these are three big shots. What&#x27;s going on? Why did these three go through all that trouble to come to our 89,757 newbie zone from another region? at Julie at Wongbo at Pan Shan Yu. Hello everyone. No reply.</p>
<p>The group tagged these three people multiple times, but no one responded. Eay, this is interesting. Our 89757 newbie zone now has six players ranked in the top 10 of the entire Lon regions newbie rankings. Second, fourth, fifth, 6th, 9inth, and 10th. He&#x27;s a I need to ask my boss Lyn Shao if he knows about this.</p>
<p>asked Lyn Shao. That coward Lin Sha hasn&#x27;t shown his face in ages. Let&#x27;s ask boss Dingle. Heay contacted Lin Sha but received no response. Having learned his lesson from last time, he dared not call again and could only wait patiently.</p>
<p>Boss Lyn Shao, you&#x27;ve been keeping a low profile lately. A few minutes later, Dinglay appeared. I was unaware of this matter. Dinglay analyzed. Such experts would have been ranked number one in their original newbie zone.</p>
<p>Their resources, status, and influence should all be top tier. They crossed districts to come here, bringing with them the mines they&#x27;d captured, their troops, heroes, and lords mansions, but they lost their original district&#x27;s status and power. Losing status and power, and rebuilding it is very troublesome. Dinglay paused, giving everyone ample time to think before slowly saying, &quot;We brought all our military force, but abandoned all our original forces. Unless Unless they&#x27;ve already basically monopolized all the resources in their original newbie zone, and then they come here to plunder new resources, establish a new power.&quot; Oh.</p>
<p>A chill ran through the chat channel as panic gradually spread. &quot;Really? What?&quot; Dinglay shook his head and said, &quot;This is just my guess. Take it with a grain of salt. Perhaps these three big shots only came here because they had no other choice. In short, everyone should be careful.</p>
<p>You should know that if any one of them were to be chosen apart from me, probably no one here could beat them.&quot; He&#x27;s a TCH Dingle. I can barely believe you, a ninth ranked player, saying you can beat a fifth ranked Big Shot. You can win even if you come in second place. Dinglay. The speed of fighting and the speed of construction are different and I am full of confidence in myself.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a Then Lin Shia can win too. He&#x27;s the number one hero in the first move. Before Ding Lay could speak, someone else jumped into the chat channel. Huh? It&#x27;s Lin Sha again. Lyn Sha is still in sixth place.</p>
<p>How can he compete with the second place? I admit Lyn Shia was once very strong, but times have changed, sir. I don&#x27;t really believe Lynn Sha will win either. He&#x27;s terrified of the approaching black flame lord and hasn&#x27;t even managed to maintain his starting advantage. Yes, Lynn Sha hasn&#x27;t said a single word in the chat channel for several days. Didn&#x27;t we see him fighting the demon yesterday? That demon actually said he was having an affair with the demon princess.</p>
<p>Do you guys remember the chaotic monsters from before? They seem to have appeared after Lynn Sha resisted the demon tide. This? You mean Lynn Shiao is really colluding with the demons? That&#x27;s terrifying. Thinking about it this way, it makes sense that he with only an F-rank talent could take first place in the first round of hero rankings. I think it might be because Lynn Shia did something wrong and is being hunted by demons. After all, he&#x27;s so handsome.</p>
<p>In short, it&#x27;s a messy situation. He a trembled with rage. You&#x27;re talking nonsense. Boss Lyn Sha has killed far more demons than you have. Dinglay stepped forward immediately.</p>
<p>Everyone, don&#x27;t label Lynn Shiao so casually. The main gods will check him when he enters the battlefield of 10,000 races. If Lynn Sha were a demon, he would have been discovered long ago. Furthermore, his daily grind of grinding monsters from dawn till dusk is also a proactive measure in preparation for the arrival of the black flame lord. Everyone immediately came to their senses.</p>
<p>Right. Right. I don&#x27;t think Lyn Sha is a bad guy either. Bostoning Lelay is right to remind me. However, the image of a miserable ranger lord who under the immense pressure of being a lord in the official district works tirelessly from dawn till dusk frantically grinding monsters for a glimmer of hope is thus established.</p>
<p>However, if Lynn Shiao is a big shot, why doesn&#x27;t he act like Dinglay, using his strength to eliminate evil and bring prosperity to our newbie zone? That&#x27;s right. Dinglay is a true leader who cares about everyone&#x27;s well-being. Lyn Shia is no longer worthy of that title. Dingle is the real boss. Dinglay is awesome.</p>
<p>The compliments of the crowd, Ding Lay logged off with satisfaction. On the other side, the masked man had been waiting for a long time. His dissatisfied tone came through. Humph Ding Lay, this isn&#x27;t how you use the slaying talisman. This isn&#x27;t how you waste time, Ding Lay said calmly.</p>
<p>Wong Su, are you still concerned about those few extermination talismans you have? The masked man was taken aback. What do you mean? Don&#x27;t you know the purpose of those three people who came from another region? Dinglay asked rhetorically. What does this have to do with me? I just want to kill Lyn Sha. Wait, you mean those three people came to help Lynn Shiao? Exactly. One of these three is Chu Yusi&#x27;s most outstanding student.</p>
<p>I heard their names at the Gangdong commendation ceremony. It&#x27;s no coincidence that all three of them came from different districts at the same time. But just now, with just a few words, I put them on the opposite side of all 89,757 newbie lords. So, you&#x27;re still worried about those few slang talismans you have? The masked man was silent for a moment, then slowly said, &quot;It seems I underestimated you, Dinglay, Dinglay. He he I&#x27;m much stronger than you think.</p>
<p>You can send reinforcements to Black Flame now, Lyn Sha. Someone might want to protect him. You&#x27;ll have to pay a higher price to deal with Lyn Sha. Give me a few more slaying talismans, and I&#x27;ll take care of those three for you.&quot; The masked man frowned. You really can take down a player ranked higher than you? Dingle, huh? A clay chicken and a clay dog.</p>
<p>Chapter 87. Not a genius versus a real genius. At this moment near the Holian Mountains around the territory of Heay and two Sha by Chian Jolie Wong Bo and Pan Sha Yu however got together. The three were clearly very familiar with each other. They didn&#x27;t exchange pleasantries upon meeting and immediately set off clearing out wild monsters as they moved towards the location of Calabash Pass.</p>
<p>There are still many monsters here that haven&#x27;t been cleared out. Jilly was a slender, tall man with long hair tied back. He wore a denim vest that revealed his muscular arms. Judging from his attire, he resembled a stylish man with ethnic minority elements. He led several squads of soldiers and two heroes walking and observing as he spoke.</p>
<p>There are too many low-level monsters left. The original lord didn&#x27;t bother farming them at all. He a rough voice responded to him. It was Wong Bo. This was a burly young man with a full beard and bulging muscles that strained his clothes.</p>
<p>He was clearly a walking embodiment of masculinity. It was all the work of those two thugs. Wong Bodeo, I heard that the lord here was killed on the second day after the server opened. So of course, no one is clearing out the monsters. Wongbo suddenly sidestepped and slashed with his greatsword, killing a dark elf thief who was trying to ambush him.</p>
<p>A mere rare unit dares to launch a sneak attack on me. Have the monsters here never encountered a true master? It seems like things will go smoothly for us from here on out. We&#x27;ll be able to get to Hulu Pass soon and see that person. The group leading their troops charged forward with great ferocity, advancing rapidly. Shau, why aren&#x27;t you saying anything? Are you unhappy about being assigned here by the city lord? Halfway through the journey, Jill asked the person at the back of the group, who looked like a cute little boy and appeared delicate and frail, remained silent for a moment before slowly saying, &quot;That&#x27;s true to some extent.</p>
<p>You said the three of us are the most sought after top newcomers in the newbie zone this year. Jolie, Wongbo, all three of us have a level lord talents. If you continue to develop in your respective beginner zones, you will eventually achieve good results and enter the official zones. In particular, Julie can strive to be the first to reach level three and obtain the reward of adding one hero slot just because of a single sentence from the city lord. The three of us rushed here to protect a novice whose lordly talent is only at the F rank.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Julie chuckled and said, &quot;We&#x27;ve been training soldiers for a thousand days to use them for one. The city lord has treated us well, and we should step forward at this critical moment. None of us are confident that we can defeat Black Flame from the official zone on our own, but the three of us together still have a chance. The three of us, three geniuses crammed into a tiny newbie zone. There aren&#x27;t even enough resources to go around.&quot; Pans Shan Yu was still somewhat dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Lord City Lord sacrificed the futures of the three of us just to protect someone of unknown strength who triggered a special demonic tide. Isn&#x27;t this a good deal? Didn&#x27;t the city lord give us sufficient compensation? Jilly still didn&#x27;t seem to care much. Anyway, I don&#x27;t think I could be a match for Dugu Jalon. Adding a hero spot is just a pipe dream. It&#x27;s surveillance plus protection, Wongbo said in a rough voice.</p>
<p>The city lord&#x27;s hint is quite clear. If Lin Shiao is indeed powerful, we will protect him. If not, we give up. If someone has the ability but goes astray, Wong Bo&#x27;s voice turned cold. Kill him.</p>
<p>As they spoke, the three of them finally arrived at Hulu Pass. Use perspective. Use eagle-eye. The three of them lay on the ground quietly observing the distance. After a long while, all three of them let out a soft sigh.</p>
<p>What do you think? Nearly half of the monsters near Hulu Pass have not been cleared, including highle, mid-level, and low-level monsters. His playing style is chaotic and disorganized. He doesn&#x27;t follow the method of starting with the easy and progressing to the difficult to improve himself. The same goes for mineral resources. There are ordinary mineral veins, rare mineral veins, and upgraded mineral veins.</p>
<p>Some have been occupied, and some have not. Why is he mining rare mineral veins now instead of systematically mining the resources he needs most? Is he going to recruit epic units? Does he have it? I think he&#x27;s lost his composure like a headless fly, frantically grasping its straws, desperately trying to find a way out. Alas, what a pity. The three remained silent for a while, then continued to observe. The fact that no military unit was seen guarding the mine suggests that his forces may be insufficient.</p>
<p>The miners are flower fairies. I&#x27;ve heard that some families train low-level troops to do other things, which is a pretty good tactic. I see the log cabins in the forest. Julie&#x27;s tone was somewhat doubtful. He did indeed take over a phantom archer&#x27;s lair, but I didn&#x27;t see any phantom archers training.</p>
<p>Wong B tilted his head. Aren&#x27;t there a few under the wooden house? But those Phantom shooters weren&#x27;t wearing overalls. Julie Dao, shouldn&#x27;t he be accelerating the training of Phantom Archer to become Gust Archer at this point? Wong Bo and Pan Shan Yu exchanged a glance, somewhat taken aback. Overalls, huh? Julie said, &quot;Look, I specially asked for a group of phantom archers, and they&#x27;ve all been trained according to his method.&quot; Julie beckoned, summoning a squad of phantom archers. white overalls hung on green leather armor, which combined with the elves flawless faces gave them a unique charm.</p>
<p>However, the phantom archer&#x27;s expressions were somewhat unnatural. Only in this way can you upgrade to become a gust archer, Julie said proudly. Wong B/Phan Yu. After a moment of silence, the group shook their heads and said, &quot;Let&#x27;s report to the city lord. Lyn Xiaosos Dao heart has been broken, and he&#x27;s in complete disarray.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s no longer the genius he once was from Jangdong number three middle school. Lord, you are truly a genius. Soldering&#x27;s excitement was palpable. We can even climb up cliffs to launch a sneak attack here. Lyn Sha led the group and swiftly and decisively wiped out a large harpy gathering point at the top of the cliff.</p>
<p>This is all thanks to Liong Yu and the White Spear soldiers. nodded to the valiant female general and Shin Leong Yu also gave Lin Shiao a crisp military salute. They are experts in mountain warfare. Also, although harpies are a rare unit, there are too many of them and they are timid. If we launch a frontal assault, a large number of harpies will fly away and flee only to return after we leave.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha said this would prevent us from capturing this terrain or we would have to spend a lot of time hunting down the banshee. You know what we need most right now is time. Soldering gave Lynn Shia an exaggerated bow to express his respect. Your lordship is truly the chosen one. He he just a little bit of common sense from ancient Chinese books.</p>
<p>Nothing to brag about. If true military geniuses and strategists like Li Jing, Sunsu, Chinqing Xi, and Juulang were to come, attacking a place like this would be child&#x27;s play of schemes. You bunch of clueless foreigners are probably going to be dumbfounded. Lyn Sha thought to himself. We&#x27;ve already taken over a third of the Holian Mountains today.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s getting late. Time to head back. Lyn Sha said, &quot;At most, we will be able to occupy the entire Calabash Mountain Range the day after tomorrow. Monsters and resources in the entire Calabash Valley will be mine. Now return to the territory and recruit Chinese soldiers.&quot; Chapter 88.</p>
<p>Dual barracks begin mass production. The joy of flame. At night, Lin Shiao, who had rushed back to his territory, took off his cloak and placed it in Ba&#x27;s hands. Then he told Ba a joke, which made her laugh so hard she trembled with joy. Hearing the system notification that his gold coins had increased by tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Linhaos eyelids twitched several times. With the bug involving Baoi, the gold coin bonus is calculated as a percentage. The more money you have, the more you get. A smile worth a thousand pieces of gold is indeed well worth it. Everyone sat down to eat spirit rice porridge and grilled fish.</p>
<p>The spirit fish in the epic pond have matured, and the golden legend farmer caught more than a dozen to nourish everyone. Feeling the attribute bonuses from the legendary spirit rice porridge and the epic spirit fish, Lynn Shia happily stretched. As long as I keep eating and have enough time, I can boost the farmer&#x27;s four stats to the point where he can instantly kill a holy dragon. No wonder the powerful families in the official district are so strong. The strong always get stronger.</p>
<p>Just then, both barracks were completed. Barracks quality average level one. Defense 2,00 recruitable unit level common. Recruitable units militia 50 food units. Spearman 100 food units recruitment speed 6 3 hours/person upgrade materials required omitted as expected ordinary level barracks can only recruit ordinary soldiers Lin Shia didn&#x27;t even glance at the upgrade materials and simply waved his hand using the Hashia tokens ascension function and adding the energy of the myriad races battlefield.</p>
<p>A double ascension is performed simultaneously ascending two identical buildings, the barracks. A flash of light and the two barracks immediately changed. The towering guard towers, sharp barricades, and magnificent barracks were quickly completed, all gleaming with golden light. Two legendary gold quality barracks have appeared. Barracks quality golden legend level one defense 50,000.</p>
<p>Recruitable unit tiers common gold legendary. Recruitable units militia 50 food units. Spearmen 100 food units. Swordsmen and shieldmen 250 food 100 wood iron ore. Swordsmen 350 food 150 iron ore.</p>
<p>Archers 500 food units 100 gold 100 wood. Emo Dao Iron Guard, 1,000 units of food, 1,000 gold coins, 1,000 refined iron, 10 gems. Divine Archer, 1,000 units of food, 1,000 gold coins, 1,000 fine wood, 10 crystals. White Shafted Spearman, 1,000 units of food, 1,000 gold coins, 1,000 fine wood, 10 sulfur. Recruitment speed, 6 3 hours/person.</p>
<p>Upgrade materials required, none. The price of legendary gold troops is high. The materials required to recruit just one troop are almost enough for other lords to upgrade a guild. Not to mention the rare materials, which most people can&#x27;t even gather. You really do get what you pay for, but I&#x27;m not worried.</p>
<p>I have enough resources and my talent is level five. I make money fast. Plus, I have a beautiful concubine whose smile can bring in tens of thousands of dollars. Lyn Sha nodded. A military camp is recruiting mo Dao iron guards.</p>
<p>A military camp is recruiting archers with sharpshooting crossbows. Tomorrow, Pay Min&#x27;s wandering knights pavilion and Chin Leangu&#x27;s Tusi village will be completed. Recruiting White Spear soldiers directly from the Tusi village should be just as fast. There are 6 days left until the black flame descends. We can recruit two people tonight and 48 more in the remaining 6 days for a total of 50 people if nothing unexpected happens in addition to the existing troop types.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiao&#x27;s theory suggests that he can obtain 60 MO Dao iron guards, 60 divine arm archers, and 60 white pole spear soldiers. Moreover, he still had several recruitment tokens left and used just in case. After finishing his business, Lin Shiao opened the chat channel. He left me a message with speculations emerging about Lin Xiao&#x27;s cowardice and whether he was colluding with the demons. Heay left a message for Lin Shiao, asking him to come out and explain himself to avoid damaging his reputation.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha carefully examined the chat channel and finally understood what had happened. Ding Lay has been shining brightly lately and has even started to become upright, having already dealt with several bloodthirsty lords. Lyn Shao pondered to himself that his strength was indeed greater than he had imagined, and he seemed to be hiding something because he appeared to have obtained an epic great sword. What exactly was he planning to do? Was he really going to eliminate evil? Dinglays subtle writing style seems to be used to belittle and isolate people. A leopard can&#x27;t change its spots.</p>
<p>As for the three experts who came from other regions, Lyn Sha saw that none of them came out to answer, so he had no way of guessing their intentions. Wait a minute. From my memory, it seems that Julie was a genius student at Gangdong City Direct School, and Chu Yusi was the honorary principal of Jangdong City Direct School. Oh, this could it be for me? Lyn Xiaos mind raced. A moment later, he left messages for Hi, Tu Shan by Chin and Chuningming, telling them to be wary of Ding Lelay and to be careful of the three experts from other regions.</p>
<p>He also advised them not to start a conflict if the other party had no malicious intent and to patrol and guard their respective territories more often and to report any abnormalities to him immediately. here. After listening to the intelligence report from Ju Lee and others, Chu Yusi, the city lord of Jangd Dong, shut down the communication. After a long while, he slowly shook his head. Lyn Shiao, are you really panicking? This doesn&#x27;t seem like what the first prophet predicted.</p>
<p>And recently, there have been rumors that you have an entangled story with the demons. Chu Yusi reopened the communication and connected with Chuunga. The next day, Dinglay killed three more notorious bloodthirsty lords, earning widespread praise. Lyn Sha still got up early to grind monsters and continued to conquer one stronghold after another on the Calabash mountain range. On the Calabash Mountains, the White Spear soldiers appeared like divine warriors descending from the heavens, suddenly appearing behind the monster at the mountaintop.</p>
<p>In a short time with the buffs from skills such as bloodlust, barbarian warrior, and son of the mountain, Chin Leong Yu led 20 white spear spearmen to successfully sweep away the 50 superior unit wyverns at the top of the cliff. Excellent. Lyn Shao sincerely praised Chin Leang Yu and her White Spear soldiers. There&#x27;s not much of the Holian Mountains left to be captured. Tomorrow, we&#x27;ll divide our forces and make sure we take the entire Holian Mountains.</p>
<p>On the third day, Lynn Sha continued to work from dawn till dusk, using the routes in the memory palace to fight monsters every second. Only the last large section of the Calabash Mountain Range remained to be conquered. Meanwhile, Dingle once again killed four bloodthirsty lords who had harmed others, and his popularity and reputation continued to soar, making him almost a representative figure who could command a large following in the entire newbie area. It&#x27;s noon now. Hey men, at the last section of the Calabash Mountains, there is a stronghold that is very difficult for a large army to reach.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha said, &quot;Chin Leong Yu and I will take another route. Pay Min, you should take the initiative and deal with the most dangerous part. The icebirds there are epic monsters, not something that ordinary people can deal with.&quot; Pay Minowed with his hands clasped in greeting and was about to leave when Lynn Sha called him back. Here&#x27;s an epic great sword, perfect for countering the frostbird. You can use it, too.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha reached out and pulled out the Ashbringer, then tossed it to Pay Min. Pay Min, who was known as the sword saint and loved swords like his first love, stared wideeyed at the sight. An epic level great sword. My lord, what is the name of this sword? Ah, just an ordinary epic weapon. Its name is the pleasure of fire.</p>
<p>Hey men, this name feels a bit strange. Chapter 89. Finding a trouble starting a war. Meanwhile, Ding Lelay, who had already become a representative figure and the de facto leader of the 89757 newbie zone, who was out farming in the wild due to a lack of resources. Get out of the way, Pans Shanu directly warned Dinglay.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m ranked fifth in the long non- newbie zone and you&#x27;re ranked ninth, so you should probably move down a bit. Don&#x27;t get in my way while I&#x27;m farming. What Pans Shan Yu didn&#x27;t know was that ever since he killed more than a dozen bloodthirsty lords who had murdered his own people, Dinglay would go live every day from time to time to let everyone see his prowess. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; Dinglay said politely on the other end. &quot;I have no intention of offending anyone, but I am in a hurry to get rid of the few scoundrels in the newbie area, so please do not hinder me.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t stop you. I got here first. This is where I farmed monsters and took over resources. Pans Shan Yu corrected. According to the rules of the battlefield of 10,000 races, I have the final say in this area.</p>
<p>You&#x27;d better take a detour. A sense of seriousness flashed through Ding Lays mind. Sure enough, none of the top 10 were easy to deal with. My friend, I really have an urgent matter to attend to. Please make way for me.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the lord I&#x27;m targeting escapes, it will be a huge threat to all the newbies in the newbie zone. Pan Shan Yu stood ramrod straight. No. Dinglays polite attitude and his willingness to humble himself to eliminate evil in the newbie zone contrast sharply with Pan Sha Yus arrogant and unforgiving manner, creating a strong contrast. The live stream was overwhelmingly in support of Ding Lelay and condemnation of Pans Sha Yu.</p>
<p>Where did this person come from? They&#x27;re not from our district, so they don&#x27;t care about us at all. Look at how eager he is to seize the mine. Could it be that Dinglay was right? He&#x27;s here to grab resources and power. Upon seeing this, Ding Lay simply smiled as if he had suddenly realized something. Dingle, my friend, you&#x27;re doing just fine in other districts.</p>
<p>Why are you coming here? We have our own resources and you&#x27;re trying to steal them from us. That&#x27;s not a good idea. Pan Shan, you think I wanted to come here? You think I wanted to steal your resources? I&#x27;m doing fine in other districts, and I&#x27;m already unlucky enough to have to come here and compete with you for resources. Don&#x27;t bother me. Ding Lays eyes narrowed sharply.</p>
<p>Friend, if you&#x27;re hindering me from upholding justice for my brothers, then I&#x27;m sorry. Pans Shan Yu also lost his temper. Ding Lay was accusing him one accusation after another, relentlessly attacking his morale. So he roared. If you&#x27;re so capable, then go for it.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re only knife and you think you can take me down. 10 minutes later, the chat channel exploded again. Ding Lay defeated Pan Shan Yu, giving all the native lords in the 89757 newbie zone a sense of relief. Lasted three moves against Ding Lay. At that moment, Lin Shiao, who was killing monsters, received a call from Chufinga.</p>
<p>Lin Shiao, tell me seriously. Don&#x27;t lie to me, Chufinga said anxiously. Are you having an affair with a demon? Fungo? Of course not. Lyn Sha responded while elegantly slaying a wild monster. His skillful archery and horsemanship making Chufunga extremely envious caused by a succubus that appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha then told Chufinga the whole story. That&#x27;s great. Chufinga breathed a sigh of relief after learning the whole story. The old man also sent three people to protect you. They reported that you were as chaotic as a fly and you even missed a lot of wild monsters near your own lord&#x27;s manor.</p>
<p>What? They&#x27;ve all gotten near my lord&#x27;s manor. Lyn Sha felt a chill run down his spine. Last time it was the beautiful girl who was lying on the edge of Calabash Mountain observing him. And today it was these three experts lying on the edge of Calabash Mountain observing him. This is because his lord&#x27;s manor is located at the mouth of the valley and anyone who goes up the mountain can see it all.</p>
<p>Things shouldn&#x27;t happen more than three times. We can&#x27;t let this happen again. Lyn Sha thought to himself. The advantage of Halians terrain is that it is easy to defend and difficult to attack, but the disadvantage is that it is easy for people to spy on it from a high vantage point. Although most of Hulu Mountain is steep cliffs, making it impossible for a large army to break through, Lin Shiao could not tolerate being constantly spied on.</p>
<p>Just then, Chufinga turned her head and glanced at the chat channel. What? Pans Shanu lost. He was defeated by Dinglay. Lyn Sha also clicked into the chat channel and browsed through it. Dinglays strength seems to be getting stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Chufinga shook his head and sideighed. I really don&#x27;t know what kind of talent this kid has. Then he said nervously, &quot;These three are all my allies after all. I need to go to the scene and try to persuade them not to fight over such a trivial matter. If it weren&#x27;t for the old man&#x27;s restrictions, they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to openly state that their purpose was to protect you, and so many misunderstandings wouldn&#x27;t have arisen.&quot; Chufinga logged off in a hurry while Lin Sha remained silent and deep in thought.</p>
<p>Dinglays actions were definitely suspicious. He deliberately incited the new lords to fight against these three, thus creating a persona for himself of protecting the new lords by driving out outsiders. Dinglay must know something. He probably guessed that these three people came for me. Lyn Sha paced back and forth.</p>
<p>Assuming Dinglay figured out that the three experts were there for me, he must have guessed that their purpose was to protect me against the black flame lord. Yet he still indiscriminately labeled them and created antagonism. Unless Ding Lay is specifically targeting me, then Dinglay is also my enemy. This explains the suspicious situation of him suddenly acquiring a large number of rare and superior units. Dinglay has already defected to others, even directly to the Black Flame Lord Wong Su or the Celestial Beings organization.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaos expression turned serious. However, Dinglay kept his word and spared Tu Shawn by Chien when the castle was destroyed. And recently, he has started using his abilities to hunt down the bloodthirsty lords who have committed crimes. From the current perspective, he hasn&#x27;t done anything obviously bad. Could it be that this is a requirement of his talent? Lyn Sha used his memory to recall Ding Lays every move.</p>
<p>From the moment he entered the beginner area, he made frequent and high-profile appearances. They make grand pronouncements, enjoy showing off in front of others, and mostly succeed. When they fail, it&#x27;s usually due to their own unintentional sabotage. Even on the night he and two Shawn by Chin were destroying the castle, he first came to him online to exchange words. Slowly, a guest began to form in his mind.</p>
<p>Dinglay, having already dealt with Pans Shan Yu, has temporarily shut down the live stream. The masked man, Wong Su called. Well done, Dinglay. We found out through relevant channels that these three are all from the Jangdong City Lords faction. Their sudden transfer to your newbie zone is most likely to protect Lin Sha.</p>
<p>All three are geniuses. If they work together, they can cause some trouble for Black Flame. Thank goodness for you. You&#x27;ve already crippled one of them beforehand. Given that Lynn Shiao has powerful backers, I have also applied to my superiors to upgrade all of Black Flame&#x27;s troop types again.</p>
<p>To ensure absolute safety, I will inform the lord that once you come up to the official area, you can officially join our organization and become a trainee member. He Ding Lay wiped his long sword and put it into his spatial storage. Well see when the time comes. The masked man paused, and Ding Lay always acted like he was very powerful, which sometimes infuriated him. Then, Ding Lay waved his hand, took out a giant sword emanating a chilling aura, and solemnly said, &quot;The truly formidable character has arrived.&quot; Ding.</p>
<p>Players Julie and Wong Bo have used a punitive token on player Dinglay. Dinglay casually opened the live stream and walked over. Chapter 90. One against three. A mysterious man appears.</p>
<p>The second and fourth place winners in the beginner area of Long Nan district used a smite on Ding Lay at the same time. Dingle, seemingly unfazed, simply opened the live stream. All the lords who had spare time quickly flooded into the live stream, cheering and supporting Dinglay. Damn it, where did these petty scoundrels come from? Seeing that our district is peaceful, they come from another district to steal our resources. Go Dinglay.</p>
<p>Show the might of our 89,757 newbie zone. Dinglay is much better than Lin Shia who only causes trouble because he helps us fight evil and eliminates evil. Dinglay, I want to have your babies. Boss Dinglay, give them a good beating. Exactly.</p>
<p>You chased one away and two more came. Are you trying to rob us outright? You&#x27;re scared now that the fifth place team has lost. Now the second and fourth place teams are coming at you together. Two against one. What kind of heroes are you? The chat channel was filled with insults and abuse directed at Julie and Wong Bo, including angry messages tagging them by name.</p>
<p>But as soon as the two crossed over to the other district, they were smeared with dirt and they couldn&#x27;t reveal the real reason why they came. They were truly suffering in silence. The two men leading the heroes and soldiers slowly walked to Dinglays position. Dinglay, according to the rules of the battlefield of all races, you are in the wrong. Julie said in a loud voice.</p>
<p>You forcibly passed through and attacked the territory that Pans Shan Yu had already occupied, which constitutes a malicious attack. Dinglay shrugged. I&#x27;m sorry. I was just doing my duty to eliminate evil for all the lords in our district. It was an emergency.</p>
<p>Look, after I defeated Pans Shan Yu, I went and killed a bloodthirsty lord, didn&#x27;t I? Julie said loudly. But it was indeed you who started the trouble first, so it&#x27;s perfectly justifiable for the two of us to use the punitive talisman on you. This time, we&#x27;re just asking for Dinglay interrupted. You just want to kill me. Jill was stagnant for a time.</p>
<p>Dinglay rattled off a string of words. So you don&#x27;t need so many reasons to avenge Pen Shanu. Just because you are strong and we are weak, do you have the right to oppress us? You three top experts, aren&#x27;t you just here to steal resources from our district? Anyone who gets in your way, you take them down. For everyone you take down, two stronger ones will come. Come on.</p>
<p>I, Dinglay, would rather die than surrender. I&#x27;d rather stand and be killed by you than bow my head and beg for mercy. Dingles words evoked a profound sense of sorrow and shared experience among everyone in the 89757 newbie zone. The rage of all the lords who were living in fear in the newbie zones was ignited. Defeat these three outsiders.</p>
<p>Outsider, get out. Go Dinglay. Seeing that the situation was out of control and that Dingle was constantly labeling them, Wong Bo, who already had a short temper, could no longer tolerate it and rushed forward. Fine, fine. I&#x27;ll let you die standing up now.</p>
<p>Wong Bo pulled out a large cleaver with a flick of his wrist. His burly figure combined with the weapon that gleamed with purple light gave him an overwhelming sense of intimidation. Both of his heroes are also exceptional strength type heroes, and the soldiers they lead are either muscular barbarian warriors or mountain giants. Dingle, along with his two outstanding heroes and their troops, also went to meet them. Jolie watched silently from the sidelines.</p>
<p>His original intention was just to teach Ding Lay a lesson, but he never expected it to develop to this extent. They made themselves look like they were against all the lords in the entire 89,757 newbie zone. Wong Bo and Dingle are locked in battle, an outstanding hero against another outstanding hero, and their troop types are basically evenly matched. On one side are the shameful and barbaric invaders. On the other side are the defenders forced to fight back to protect their homeland.</p>
<p>In the live stream and chat channels, everyone was cheering for Ding Lay and applauding him. Just a few moves. With a loud bang, Ding Lay raised his great sword, knocking away Wong B&#x27;s large cleaver and then kicked him more than 10 m away. Dinglay has once again defeated top players from other regions. And it&#x27;s Wong Bo who&#x27;s ranked fourth.</p>
<p>Damn it. Wongbo wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and charged forward again. Then he was knocked away again. Enough, Wongbo. Dingle pointed his great sword diagonally at the enemy, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll spare your life since you haven&#x27;t harmed our district&#x27;s lord.</p>
<p>I, Dingle, am not a person who kills indiscriminately.&quot; In the live broadcast room, Dinglays charm captivated countless young women. Julie, you&#x27;re next. Frustrated by the various setbacks since crossing the border, Julie snorted coldly, pulled out two long narrow curved blades and said, &quot;Dinglay, my troops and heroes are all better than yours, and I won&#x27;t bully you. How about we duel one-on-one between the lords, Dinglay, I don&#x27;t need your fake pity. You&#x27;re seriously underestimating me.</p>
<p>How can I weaken you if I don&#x27;t kill your troops?&quot; Dinglay thought to himself. His recruitment tokens were all given to him by Wong Su, so he didn&#x27;t care if his soldiers died. Julie still tried to resolve the dispute. Dingle, the three of us came here not to seize resources. In fact, what we&#x27;ve occupied are simply absolute private territories near the Lord&#x27;s manor.</p>
<p>Shut up. If you want war, then let&#x27;s fight. Stop with all this nonsense. Dinglay drew his giant sword and charged out once more. At that moment, his image fighting for all the lords in the newbie zone was deeply etched in everyone&#x27;s minds.</p>
<p>At that moment, Dinglays image and reputation in everyone&#x27;s mind reached their peak. The light stung Lin Xiao&#x27;s eyes as he quietly watched his performance in the live stream. Dinglay leaped up and chopped with all his might. Just one strike. The Julie simter was cleaved away.</p>
<p>The man was also sent flying backward before Julie could make another move. Dinglays giant sword was already pointed at his throat. I&#x27;ve lost. Julie looked dejected. He couldn&#x27;t understand how his powerful talent could have led to a loss to Dinglay.</p>
<p>Could Dinglay possibly possess an S-rank talent? I can spare your lives, but you all must get out of here. Dingle stood high above like an unassalable king. You three, and you call yourselves top players in the newbie zone. You&#x27;re utterly pathetic. Even if all three of you attacked together, you wouldn&#x27;t be a match for me.</p>
<p>Now go back to where you came from. At this moment, Ding Lay is majestic and all inspiring. Dinglay turned around and faced the live broadcast room. Everyone, how does Ding Lay compare to Lin Sha? The live stream fell silent for a few seconds, then erupted into unanimous praise. Ding Lay is the absolute pinnacle of combat power in our region.</p>
<p>Although Lynn Shiao can smash the abyss demon with one hand, Ding Lay can take down three top experts all by himself, Ding Lay is clearly superior, Ding Lay is awesome. Lyn Shia, who is quietly watching Ding Lay in the live stream, also twitched at the corner of his mouth. Dinglay really seems to harbor resentment towards himself. If you don&#x27;t bother me, fine. But if you do, then I won&#x27;t be polite.</p>
<p>Just then, Chufinga arrived with his troops. Upon seeing this scene, he immediately became anxious. Stop, Ding Lang. Chufunga roared. You have no right to drive them away.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re just here to help. Dinglay smiled faintly. Oh, then ask everyone if they agree. Shufinga didn&#x27;t need to open the chat channel to know that public opinion was surging and all of it was to drive these three people away. The old man&#x27;s plan was ruined just like that.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia is in danger this time with no one to help him. Dinglay is just too strong. Isn&#x27;t he? Julie, Wong, Bo, and Pan Shan Yu are all wellestablished masters who have been in the top 20 of the martial arts competition. They are much stronger than Ding Lay, who is ranked outside the top 50 in the martial arts competition. But Dinglay seems to get stronger the more he plays.</p>
<p>Although Chufingo was arrogant, he believed he had no way to defeat Julie. And at this moment, he had no confidence to fight against Ding Lay. In an instant, in this small area, five top experts gathered together and hundreds of soldiers faced off against each other, eyeing each other menacingly, creating an extremely tense atmosphere. No, we must save these three friendly soldiers. Chufinga gritted her teeth and decided to reveal the secret.</p>
<p>Just then, a clear voice rang out. Excuse me, everyone. Could you please make way? You&#x27;re blocking my way to Grind Monsters. A man dressed in a long white robe with his long hair tied back, a gentle and refined appearance, sharp features, and a handsome and sunny demeanor, walked out slowly with his hands behind his back. Chapter 91.</p>
<p>Who exactly are you? Just a hero? Everyone was startled. Who is this? No one had ever seen him before. It&#x27;s like a group of dogs fighting and suddenly a nonchalant cat tries to cross the road. The dejected wanderer tilted his head, seemingly surprised that no one was going to let him pass, and continued on his way. Treat everyone as nothing.</p>
<p>Stop. Dingle couldn&#x27;t tolerate anyone challenging his authority. Who are you? The man did not answer and continued walking. Stop. If you take another step, I&#x27;ll attack.</p>
<p>Dingle pointed his great sword at the man. Are you the reinforcements these three foreign lords brought here? The man didn&#x27;t even lift his eyelids. A good dog doesn&#x27;t block the way. Dinglay paused. Realizing this was blatant mockery.</p>
<p>It would have a huge negative impact on his talent. He had to fight back. Without saying a word, his dozens of elite troops rushed forward. Before anyone could see what was happening. A flash of white light appeared and dozens of soldiers were instantly decapitated.</p>
<p>The viewers in the live stream gasped in shock. The two heroes charged out simultaneously, one in front and one behind to sandwich the man. Another flash of white light, and the two heroes fell to the ground, coughing up blood. The chat channel went silent instantly. Dinglay snorted coldly.</p>
<p>You killed my men without a second thought. You deserve to die, gentlemen. Watch me slay this fiend. Dinglay wielded his frost great sword with lightning speed, launching a charge and leaping slash. Even the formidable Julie had fallen victim to this move.</p>
<p>A look of amazement flashed in the white-clad man&#x27;s eyes. Another flash of white light, and the white robed man now held a massive iceblue sword. Dinglay coughed up blood and was thrown dozens of meters away. How? How could he be so strong? Dinglay couldn&#x27;t believe it. Tens of thousands of people in the live stream fell into a deathly silence.</p>
<p>The man in white held the ice blue great sword in his hand, overjoyed. This is truly a fine sword. What&#x27;s the name of this sword? Dingle was furious. This is my Frostorn. Give it back to me.</p>
<p>After saying that, he clenched his fist and charged forward again. Then it bounced back even faster, spitting out another mouthful of blood. Who exactly are you? Dinglay asked an alarm. Are you Dugu Xiaolan, the top student in the second tier university? No, she&#x27;s a woman. You are a player who quietly descended upon the official zone.</p>
<p>Everyone in the live stream was stunned. Just now, Ding Lay defeated Julie in one move, displaying unparalleled skill and unstoppable power. But this man in white defeated Ding Lelay in one move, and no one could see how he made his move. This level of skill is something only top players in the official server can achieve. But exactly when did a top player from the official server quietly descend upon this newbie zone? No wonder, no wonder.</p>
<p>The man in white did not answer Dingle, but instead quietly examined Frostorn and slowly said, &quot;No wonder that sword is called Flame of Delight. It was meant to be a pair with Frostorn.&quot; The man in white raised his head, &quot;Thank you for your gift. I&#x27;ll gladly accept this sword.&quot; Ding Lay lay on the ground shouting with a fierce but weak voice. Who are you? You stole my sword. This is outright robbery.</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t let you get away with this. None of the lords in the entire 89757 newbie zone will let you get away with this. The man in white smiled faintly and said slowly, &quot;Rob, you sent your troops to attack me first. I was defending myself and gained the spoils. I did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>and you&#x27;re really good at labeling people. Were those three lords also falsely accused and slandered by you in the same way? Unfortunately, in the face of absolute power, your petty tricks are not worth a second glance. As soon as he finished speaking, &quot;Holy crap, that&#x27;s dazzling. Such a showoff.&quot; Dinglay couldn&#x27;t help but spit out another mouthful of blood. &quot;Who exactly are you?&quot; Dingle was powerless to ask.</p>
<p>He had been utterly defeated. Upon hearing this, the man in white smiled faintly and said calmly, &quot;I am just one of Lin Xiaos heroes.&quot; Ding Lay felt as if he had been struck by lightning. He stood there like a statue, stunned and stammering. &quot;You, you, you.&quot; Dinglay pointed at the man in white. &quot;Someone as powerful as you is merely one of Lin Xiaos heroes.&quot; &quot;Am I powerful?&quot; The man in white was taken aback, then smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>This boy&#x27;s abilities are less than 1% of yours, Lord. Having said that, the man in white withdrew Frostorn, straightened his body, and said in a deep voice, &quot;Now, please make way. I still need to grind monsters, otherwise the Lord will punish me.&quot; With a whoosh, everyone stood in neat rows, making way for each other. The man in white slowly walked away. &quot;Your abilities are less than 1% of mine.&quot; Lyn Sha smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Payman really knows how to talk. I&#x27;ll give him another five levels when he gets back. Lyn Shia then left the still completely silent live stream and slowly turned around. Gentlemen, Sword Saint Pay Min has eliminated the most difficult mountaintop, Frostbird. Only the last small section of the Calabash Mountains remains, just a minor epic level Cyclops cave.</p>
<p>Follow me and charge in. All the soldiers responded loudly and followed Lynn Shiao as he charged into battle. On the mountain side, an epic quality cyclops had just emerged from a cave when the divine archer unleashed a volley of fire. Giant slayer, the divine archer was all a giant of their time. Facing any creature larger than themselves, they possessed unique techniques to deliver critical hits.</p>
<p>Critical hit rate increased by 50% when attacking giants and the chance to hit a vital point increased by 50%. The Cyclops died on the spot. The MO Dao iron guards immediately rushed forward and blocked the entrance to the cave. Another Cyclops charged out in a line, roaring angrily. Then Tang Yi slashed him on the head.</p>
<p>This cyclops was massive and had a lot of health. One strike didn&#x27;t kill him. Instead, it fueled his ferocity. He was about to roar and retaliate when in a split second a flash of light appeared and Tang Yi, the iron guard of the Mo Dao, struck again. Reversal slash activated.</p>
<p>The Cyclops fell down in disbelief. Two more Cyclops charged out, wielding giant wooden clubs made from tree trunks, ready to smash them down on the iron guards of the Mod Dow. Soldering and his phantom archers launched a swift attack, activating sniper. The cyclops had no choice but to raise his hand to block, avoiding having his only eye pierced. Chin Leang Yu let out a sharp cry, holding her bright silver spear.</p>
<p>Seizing the opportunity, a flash of cold light appeared first, piercing through both cyclops simultaneously. Excellent. Lyn Xiaos eyes lit up. Chin Lang Yus combat strength had greatly increased after fighting in mountainous terrain. The effects of the King of the Mountains are remarkable.</p>
<p>Several more cyclopes rushed out of the cave, wielding huge stones, ready to smash them down on the group. Several white spearmen had somehow appeared above the cave. With a roar, they activated barbarian warriors. Barbarian warrior. The white spear warrior can unleash a terrifying roar, stunning all creatures without mental resistance for 1 to 5 seconds, depending on the warrior&#x27;s strength and level.</p>
<p>After unleashing the roar, the White Spear warrior gains a 20% increase to both strength and constitution. It also directly triggers blood frenzy. Just as the Cyclops was reeling, the White Spear soldier leaped down from the cliff, his White Spear plunging straight down, and the Cyclops instantly fell to the ground. One Cyclops after another charged out, but with the combined efforts of Lin Shiao and his legendary units, they were utterly crushed and killed. Finally, a deep resonant voice echoed through the cave.</p>
<p>Stop fighting. We surrender. Chapter 92. Heated discussion. Who is the ceiling of combat power? The Cyclops surrendered.</p>
<p>Their cave was also considered a Cyclops lair where a Cyclops leader was stationed. At this moment, he was dejected. He led the few remaining cyclopes out, discarded the tree trunk and stones, and lay prostrate on the ground. Very well, I accept your surrender. Lynn Shiao checked the Cyclopses attributes.</p>
<p>Argos the Cyclops race giant level 25, quality epic. Attributes: Strength 95, spirit 45, constitution 70, soul 30, combat power rating 80 stars. Attributes added by skills, equipment, lord abilities, etc. are not included in the combat power rating. Skills, throwing boulders, uprooting trees, siege, bloodlust, and brutality.</p>
<p>A standard epic creature with decent main attributes. Lyn Sha immediately arrived at the cave and took over the nest. Now, there are only five cyclopes left, which is not enough. Recruit Cyclops. Three cyclopes emerged.</p>
<p>The epic level Cyclops reaches level 20 with all four stats being quite high. Lyn Sha said to them, &quot;You should stay here with the original leader.&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot; Argos asked, puzzled. &quot;My lord, we are all first rate warriors. Why don&#x27;t you recruit us into your army?&quot; Lyn Sha waved his hand. &quot;No rush.</p>
<p>There will be tasks for you when the time comes. For now, stay at home and act as if nothing has happened.&quot; Oh, Argos with his kind yet ferocious face had no choice but to lead the other seven cyclopes back. Remember this. I&#x27;m sending you back so you can rest and recuperate. If you dare to rebel against me, my troops will come back for you.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha gave him a warning from behind. Argos hurriedly turned around and saw the iron can holding a giant crossbow, the fierce man holding a long knife, and the dark-skinned man with his arm exposed holding a white shafted spear. He couldn&#x27;t help but shiver. What kind of evil spirits are these? He immediately fell to the ground again, hurriedly saying, &quot;I dare not. The Cyclops is forever loyal to the Lord.&quot; Ding.</p>
<p>Your unit, the Cyclops Argos, has had its loyalty increased to 70. Obedience is key. Ah, intimidation is also very effective in dealing with barbaric and brutal troops. Lyn Sha nodded in satisfaction. That&#x27;s more like it.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go. It was getting late, so Lyn Sha led everyone back to the Lord&#x27;s Manor. Today was the perfect day to upgrade to level three. Just as Lin Sha was heading home, little did he know that a heated discussion had erupted in the chat channel. Oh my god, did I see that right? Dingle has lost.</p>
<p>Having defeated three masters in a row. Even the nine Lee were no match for him and he was actually defeated. Still defeated in one move and he&#x27;s completely unfazed. That man was merely a hero. But that hero is so cool, someone exclaimed.</p>
<p>Although I&#x27;ve never seen him in clothes like that before, I feel a faint sense of familiarity, as if I&#x27;ve seen him before. Stop focusing on the clothes. Didn&#x27;t you see that heroic air about him? He&#x27;s one in a million. After suppressing his frustration for so long, he finally had a chance to speak. Huh? Such a hero isn&#x27;t even under my command.</p>
<p>Boss Lin Shiao. Tu Shan by Chin. That&#x27;s right. Didn&#x27;t you hear him say that his abilities are less than 1% of boss Lynn Xiao&#x27;s? Now, who would dare to underestimate boss Lin Shiao? The smuggness of the two men was palpable, but no one tacitly refuted it because that hero is just too strong. If what he said is true, just how strong is Lyn Sha? The image of Lin Sha single-handedly crushing the abyss demon that day resurfaced in my mind.</p>
<p>I think Lin Shiao is the absolute pinnacle of combat power in our district. While Ding Lay is very strong, Lyn Sha is clearly stronger. Wow, our district is truly full of hidden talents with so many masters. Someone exclaimed. Master Dinglay can sweep aside three top masters, and Master Lyn Xiaos hero can sweep aside Ding Lay.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a pity I still prefer Ding Lay. After all, he&#x27;s a champion of the people, fair and upright. Someone still tried to defend Dinglay. It boss Lynn shall have the power to fight evil and uphold justice for us. Yet he doesn&#x27;t support the weak.</p>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t he know that with great power comes great responsibility? Right? Just as everyone was agreeing, Tu Shan by Chin suddenly asked, &quot;Ding Llay, were you making an anonymous comment? You have the nerve to try and make excuses for yourself. I&#x27;m ashamed. Will you die if you don&#x27;t show off?&quot; He&#x27;s a retorted in rapid succession. The moment you arrived, you accused three skilled players who hadn&#x27;t shown any hostility towards us of stealing resources. And then you started picking fights with them, didn&#x27;t you see that even a hero could see through it? Those bloodthirsty lords don&#x27;t have red names unless they kill a certain number of people.</p>
<p>How did you, Dinglay, know they were bad guys? You still want to morally blackmail boss Lyn Sha? He&#x27;s busy dealing with the official district lords, and he&#x27;s also going around the world looking for bad guys to kill, which delays his progress. Your intentions are despicable. Their remarks also startled everyone. Some people have also noticed something a miss. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>How would Dinglay know who did bad things? A few victims revealed the killer&#x27;s name before they died, but most of the bad guys work in secret, and nobody knows. Furthermore, the reasons given for the conflict with Julie and the others are indeed far-fetched. That&#x27;s right. That&#x27;s right. I&#x27;ve wanted to say this for a long time.</p>
<p>According to the rules of the battlefield of all races, Ding Lay is the one who broke the rules. While healing his wounds within his territory, Ding Lay, who was secretly using the chat channel, spat out another mouthful of blood. You I&#x27;ve been proven wrong again. This time, I&#x27;m seriously injured. Dinglay shakily closed the chat channel, but the masked man&#x27;s call came in again.</p>
<p>I should have known better than to do a live stream. It&#x27;s embarrassing. Wong Sus tone was cold, and Ding Lay swayed again upon hearing this. You can&#x27;t even beat one of the heroes. You were so impressive when you defeated Jolie.</p>
<p>That hero is too strong, Ding Lay roared. And I was careless. I didn&#x27;t dodge. Dinglay thought to himself. He seems to know the weakness of my talent.</p>
<p>The masked man, Wong Su, snorted coldly. No matter how strong he is, he&#x27;s still just a hero. Didn&#x27;t you say that Lynn Shiao has no foundation and can&#x27;t even afford a decent hero token? Listen, I don&#x27;t know what happened either. Dinglay said. Lyn Sha is too lowkey.</p>
<p>All I know is that he has a beautiful female hero, which was mentioned in a system announcement, etc. It&#x27;s an epic chest, Dinglay exclaimed. It must be from the reward epic chest that dropped an epic hero token. Lynhiao&#x27;s tier 2 hero is an epic quality hero. That must be it, the masked man said coldly.</p>
<p>His Guster Archer was obtained from an epic treasure chest. That&#x27;s a demonic tide, Dinglay said. After Lin Sha finished writing the book, there was a powerful demonic tide. It might be a rank. He defended it with his own strength.</p>
<p>The reward might even be an epic treasure chest. The masked man frowned. This kid has way too many epic treasure chests. His luck is just too good. He then shook his head and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>No matter what, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s trump card of having a powerful hero has been revealed. Looks like I need to report this and get the hero and troop configurations reinforced again. There are still a few days left. I hope the adults will agree. If I had known, I would have personally broken through the server and descended here.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a top 100 expert lord. Ding lay curled his lip thinking. Damn it. It really doesn&#x27;t feel good to be ridden around like that. Chapter 93.</p>
<p>Reactions from all sides. The story of the filial son. That concludes the entire account of this incident. He has more cards up his sleeve than I thought. After Chu Yusi finished his report, there was a long silence on the other end.</p>
<p>Chu Yui and the three from Julie have been exposed. But what surprised me even more than their exposure was that the three of them combined still couldn&#x27;t defeat Ding Lay. And Ding Lay couldn&#x27;t even last a single move against one of Linhaos heroes. I can&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;What exactly happened to your star pupil?&quot; A cold yet subtly authoritative voice came from behind, and Chu Yusi shrank back. &quot;Lord of the domain, it is my fault for not raising them properly.</p>
<p>They have been protected too much and have lost the ability to deal with complex situations. Then let them learn. It is the domain lord. After a long while, a voice came from the other end again. You revealed your intention to protect and support Lynch.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the Celestial People organization in order to humiliate us and weaken us, they will only continue to increase their troops and upgrade their units and heroes. The difficulty of the enemy Lynn Sha faces this time will continue to increase. Prepare your son to be prepared and get him involved if necessary. You must have secretly given him quite a few nice things. It is the domain lord.</p>
<p>Chui wiped his sweat. My son is mediocre and has always grown up under my protection. This mission was dangerous, so I had no choice but to give him two epic recruitment tokens. I didn&#x27;t mean to pursue this matter, the cold voice said. In this battleground of the myriad races, who doesn&#x27;t give their own children special treatment.</p>
<p>Execute this mission well, and don&#x27;t make any more mistakes. Lyn Sha has already proven his potential and mystique. It is the domain lord domain and whose appearance was like that of a young girl yet who exuded the dignified aura of someone who had long held a high position leaned back on the luxurious sofa resting her chin on her hand and talking to herself. A genius unparalleled in Jangdong who only achieved anlevel talent in the Lord talent test yet repeatedly created miracles. First, he took first place in a book, which triggered an S-level magic tide.</p>
<p>Then, he led a mysterious troop to kill Ziao Daong and achieve great success, ignoring the threat of the celestial being Wong Su, which triggered the breaking of the server., it has now been revealed that even one of his heroes possesses the combat power to sweep through the newbie zone. According to that hero, his strength is even greater. There are really many things about him that are hard to understand. I should go and ask Khalil Jabbron again. Gallen, no wonder you&#x27;re so obsessed with beating him.</p>
<p>Kids like that are really fun. At the same time, in an exceptionally luxurious Lord&#x27;s Mansion in the official server of the Lan region, a man in a floral shirt yawned and walked out with a charming young woman in a kimono in each arm. Wong Su, what do you need me for? Seeing the impatience on the man in the floral shirt, Wong Su felt a pang of jealousy. First an angel, now a special supply from Japan, indulging in pleasure day and night. It&#x27;s too decadent.</p>
<p>Could it be that your superpower is related to this? My lord, Wong Su, with his hooked nose, bowed respectfully. The matter is urgent, and I have no choice but to report it in person. The man in the floral shirt listened quietly to Wong Sus report, remaining silent for a long time. After a long silence, the man slapped the two girls buttocks hard and chased them away. Then he slowly said, &quot;Lynn Shiao, is he really that powerful?&quot; His hero defeated Ding Lay in a single move, and Ding Lay even defeated three members of the Jolie tribe in succession.</p>
<p>It is indeed my subordinate suspicion that Ding Lay himself also made a mistake. Regardless of the circumstances, it is an undeniable fact that this young man possesses a powerful hero. The man in the floral shirt side. It was originally just a petty squabble over saving face. Lyn Sha killed my underling&#x27;s underling, ruining my organization&#x27;s reputation, so I killed him as a warning to others.</p>
<p>But now Lyn Sha is actually backed by Chu Yusi, my old rival of many years. Domain lord of Lia domain. The man in the floral shirts gaze grew increasingly cold. Our relationship with the Lia government has always been one of mortal enmity. In Lang Shia, they hunt us down on the battlefield of all races.</p>
<p>We have the support of the Eastern Kingdom so we can go toe-to-toe with them. The fact that Chu Yusi secretly sent three experts to protect Lynn Shiao this time fully demonstrates Lin Xiao&#x27;s importance. Does your excellency mean to agree to upgrade some heroes and troop types? Wong Sus face lit up with joy. He, the man in the floral shirt, laughed. Upgrade all units and heroes to the highest level, except for a team of legendary gold units.</p>
<p>Everyone else is epic. Equip black flame with my epic weapon, too. Wong Su was taken aback. Sir, aren&#x27;t you placing far too much importance on that kid? You&#x27;re wrong. I wouldn&#x27;t give you these troops just for the sake of saving face.</p>
<p>But now it&#x27;s all about striking at that woman, Lord Lia, killing Lin Shiao, killing Ju Lee and the others, and giving that pretty woman a good beating in the face. The man in the floral shirt squinted his eyes, looking completely captivated and said, &quot;Ah, I can&#x27;t wait any longer. I&#x27;m going to slap her hard. Slap her hard.&quot; Seeing the man in the floral shirts expression, Wong Su awkwardly shifted his gaze. The man in the floral shirt then added.</p>
<p>Also, besides Ding Lay bribe more lords in the newbie zones, Dinglays performance is very inconsistent, and I don&#x27;t really trust him. Yes, sir. At night, Lin Sha, who had already returned to his territory, first waved his hand. Upgrade. Pay Min who had been waiting in the territory smiled and gave Lin Sha a bow with his hands clasped.</p>
<p>This junior thanks the Lord. Well done, Pay Min. Lyn Sha praised Pay Min a few times, then reached out and took the Frost Sorrow to examine it closely. My lord, what sword is this? Why does it exude a chilling aura? Ba asked curiously from the side. This sword is called Frostorn, Lynsha.</p>
<p>I never thought I would actually see the real Frostmore. Seeing that Baoi was still full of curiosity like a kitten, Lyn Sha took advantage of the time when everyone was sitting and eating spirit rice porridge and spirit fish to introduce them to everyone. He briefly recounted the story of a game he had played in his previous life. And just like that, this idiot killed his own king father. You know what? This western tradition of patraside has actually persisted.</p>
<p>In the end, this powerful weapon also got a nickname. What nickname? Soldering asked filop piety sword. Upon hearing this, everyone lowered their heads, trying hard to suppress their laughter. The idiot also got another nickname. What nickname? Ba played the role of a perfect straight man.</p>
<p>A very filial son. Several soldiers and heroes couldn&#x27;t help but chuckle while many others trembled with excitement. Finally, Jana, the idiot&#x27;s former lover, also got a nickname. Lyn Sha looked around and seeing the surprised look mixed with everyone&#x27;s focused expressions, said with satisfaction, &quot;Her new nickname is a great filial daughter.&quot; &quot;Gleg,&quot; Ba couldn&#x27;t hold back any longer and covered her mouth, laughing non-stop. Hearing the system notification that he had gained 100,000 gold coins at once, Lyn Shiao was in a great mood.</p>
<p>Just as the time was up, Lynn Shiao waved his hand. Upgrade the Lord&#x27;s mansion to level three. Chapter 94. The Lord composes a poem and Shin Leong Yu follows him to the death. Now, Lin Shiao has begun upgrading the three lord&#x27;s mansions.</p>
<p>When upgrading to the second tier, he heeded the advice of the ancient demon and didn&#x27;t try to be number one. But you absolutely must be first to upgrade to tier three because it adds one hero slot. His resource extraction speed is five times that of others. So what is an enormous amount of tier three resources for others? Lynn Shiao has already accumulated by clearing the house of death and occupying the upgrade mines. His cooldown period for his second tier base was just right.</p>
<p>So he immediately confirmed the upgrade. With the addition of his talent, 100% increase in leveling speed. He only needs 48 hours. And by tomorrow night, the three lords mansions that originally took 96 hours to upgrade will be completed. Then I recruited three heroes and was able to build a stable immediately to try recruiting and training cavalry.</p>
<p>Everything will wait until tomorrow. After pressing the three upgrade buttons, Paymen&#x27;s exclusive building, Wandering Knight Pavilion, and Shin Leongu&#x27;s exclusive building, Tusi village, were also completed. Great. Now we can go recruit hero specific units. Lin Shiao excitedly led Pay Min Baoi and Chin Leong Yu to their private building.</p>
<p>Pay Min, this is your exclusive building, the wanderer&#x27;s pavilion. Lyn Shiao said, &quot;Zhiao guest wears a silk tassel. Wuhuk sword shines like frost and snow. Silver saddle shines on white horse, swift as a shooting star. Go.</p>
<p>From now on, you can live here and together with your chivalous companions, fight against evil and right wrongs. Pay Min&#x27;s eyes shown with emotion as he bowed deeply to Lyn Sha, saying, &quot;Pay Min thanks you, Lord.&quot; When Baoi saw Lin Sha casually recite an ancient Chinese poem, she looked at her lord with her beautiful eyes, sending him flirtatious glances. Lyn Sha checked the attributes of wandering swordsman pavilion. Yosha Pavilion quality gold legendary the exclusive building of a legendary hero is directly legendary level one defense 50,000 recruitable unit tier gold legendary recruitable units white horse ranger 5,000 units of food 5,000 units of gold 1,000 units of refined iron 1,000 units of refined copper 10 units of crystal 10 units of gem 10 units of sulfur 10 units of mercury. Recruitment speed 48 24 hours/person note a stable is required.</p>
<p>Lin sha was stunned and pay min was also stunned. The wandering knights pavilion need stables. Wandering knights need horses. Lynsha said in astonishment and this white horse wandering knight is too expensive. No wonder the wandering knights in the novels spend money like water.</p>
<p>So this money comes from here. You don&#x27;t have a horse yet, Pay Min mumbled. Unable to recruit any wandering knights. Lynn Sha had no choice but to give up. Well have to wait until we have three books before we can recruit the White Horse Ranger.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha comforted Pay Min. Don&#x27;t be discouraged. We&#x27;ll go to Zuikinlu for a couple of drinks later. I&#x27;ll be your chivalous friend. Drunken Immortal Pavilion is a building that Lin Sha upgraded yesterday using the Huasha token ascension skill.</p>
<p>Its predecessor was the tavern. Today, the drunken immortal pavilion has risen from the ground, standing five stories high and covering an area of nearly 10,000 square meters. The soldiers no longer have to sit on the ground in front of the Lord&#x27;s mansion to eat. Because of the quality of the golden legend, dining at Drunken Immortal Pavilion can accelerate the recovery of spiritual energy, magic, injuries, and stamina, and can also automatically produce dozens of craft beers, ranging from excellent to epic. Lyn Sha arranged for several Golden Legend farmers to serve as cooks, and also arranged for 10 flower fairies to enter the drunken immortal pavilion as waitresses.</p>
<p>Graceful flower fairies flitted among the crowd, serving wine and dishes, creating a delightful scene. My lord, you are still my master. Please don&#x27;t flatter me. Pay men dared not agree to drink and call Lin Shia his brother and quickly declined, but I couldn&#x27;t suppress the joy and emotion in my heart. The group arrived at another hero exclusive building, the Tusi village.</p>
<p>Lyang Yu, do you know the Chongjan Emperor of the Ming Dynasty? Chin Leong Yu shook her head. When Lyang Yu was in another world, the emperor was the Wanly Emperor. It seems that Chin Liang Yus memories are from her youth. Lyn Sha nodded. Then I&#x27;ll give you a poem.</p>
<p>Lin Shaing said, &quot;Learn the eight trigrams formation of Western Sichuan. He held the military tally hidden in his Mandarin duck sleeves. Women have always been willing to accept this. Why must a general be considered a man? Let&#x27;s carve this poem on the entrance of the Tusi village. Holding the military tally in the sleeves of a Mandarin duck, why must a general be a husband? Sheen Leon Yu slowly repeated.</p>
<p>And this bright and beautiful woman who was so heroic and decisive had tears welling up in her eyes at some point. Does the Lord know all the grievances in my heart? My unwillingness to stand out from the crowd and my obsession with not being weaker than men. She raised her hand and gently wiped her face, then immediately knelt on one knee before Lin Sha. I am deeply grateful for your kindness, Lord. I, Lean Yu, swear to follow you to the death.</p>
<p>Ding. Your hero, Chin Lean Yus loyalty has reached 100%. She&#x27;ll follow you to the death. Lyn Shiao quickly helped Shin Leong Yu up, his shock no less than hers. He had only gotten a poem by Emperor Chong for free.</p>
<p>And this girl had already reached 100 loyalty points. 90 points means you can do whatever you want. 100 points means you&#x27;ll be with me through thick and thin. This married woman is much easier to seduce than Ba. Lyn Sha shook his head violently.</p>
<p>What was he thinking? It must be a side effect of being possessed by Emperor Wu of Wei. There&#x27;s no need for such formalities. Lean Yu, I told you you can consider this place your home. Chin Leong Yu looked up at the familiar Tusci village and nodded emphatically. Yes.</p>
<p>Check the attributes of the Tusci village. Tusci village quality golden legend. Level one defense 50,000. Recruitable unit level, gold legendary. Recruitable units.</p>
<p>White-shaped spearman, 1,000 units of food, 1,000 gold coins, 1,000 fine wood, 10 sulfur. Recruitment speed, 6 3 hours/person. The conditions and speed of recruiting White Spear soldiers are indeed much more normal. Recruit White Spear soldiers immediately. Then, Lynn Sha summoned all the soldiers to the square.</p>
<p>After 2 days of intensive recruitment, plus the original soldiers, he now has 18 MO Dao iron guards, 18 divine arm archers, and 20 white pole spear soldiers. There are 42 Phantom archers, and we can recruit seven more tomorrow. Seven per week. There are eight cyclopes, and we can recruit three more next week. Three per week.</p>
<p>The Cyclops didn&#x27;t come. Lynn Shiao had them stationed in the cave at the top of the Calabash Mountains, but they could still see their attributes. In addition, there are there are over 50 golden legendary farmers, 10 excellent farmers, 40 rare farmers, and 30 common farmers. There are 130 flower fairies. Besides, after several days of fighting and grinding monsters, I have eight recruitment tokens of various levels in hand for any eventuality.</p>
<p>Progress is correct. In 4 days, the Black Flame Lord will break through the region and descend at my own pace. I can just gather 50 each of the MO Dao iron guards, divine arm archers, and white spear soldiers, and I&#x27;ll be able to get into a third tier university in 2 days. After completing the third set, I will have two more heroes. There are even two days to prepare.</p>
<p>There will probably be even more surprises for Black Flame. Man, the enemy is all level 30, so my men can&#x27;t be any lower level either. Without saying a word, Lin Shia glanced at all his resources and immediately started upgrading all his troops and heroes. Chin Leong Yu has leveled up to level 15. Upgrade all Mod Dao iron guards to level 15.</p>
<p>Upgrade all archers to level 15. Upgrade all white-shaped spearmen to level 15. Upgrade all phantom shooters to level 20. Okay. Ba.</p>
<p>Upgrade BI to level two first. Chapter 95. Tang Ya&#x27;s obsession. Ba se&#x27;s little trick. Pay Min is already level 15.</p>
<p>The Cyclops is level 20 and Lyn Sha hasn&#x27;t leveled up yet. A flash of light swept through and all the soldiers were bathed in it. Feeling an indescribable sense of comfort. Lyn Sha stared nervously at Baoi, slowly observing her, but saw nothing unusual about her. He then clicked to check Ba&#x27;s attributes.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s still the same as before. Attributes that should be replaced with are still replaced with only the soul stat has been increased to 105. Does leveling up grant plus six to attributes or is it the most difficult attribute to improve soul? Lyn Sha thought to himself that Bao was indeed not simple. Just as he was about to ask Ba if she wanted to level up again, he saw her gently shake her head. The implication was as if to say, &quot;I am utterly powerless, my lord.</p>
<p>Please use your experience where it is needed.&quot; Lynn Shiao chuckled softly, realizing that he seemed to have a great understanding with Baoi. Seeing that all the troop types had completed their upgrades and feeling his own increased power, Lynn Shiao declared loudly, &quot;Gentlemen, we have captured the entire Holition Ridge. Starting tomorrow, we&#x27;ll be going to deal with all the monsters in the entire Calabash Valley. Before the Black Flames descend, we will occupy the entire Calabash mountain range, gather our strength to fight the enemy, and make all those who dare to invade us suffer a crushing defeat. We swear to serve our lord to the death.</p>
<p>The soldiers shouted. Lyn Sha nodded, telling everyone to go and rest while he himself took charge of inspecting the territory. He arrived at the war hall. This is where future discussions about the military region will take place. He can observe the sand table here with his heroes and unit leaders to formulate combat strategies.</p>
<p>Of course, the war hall will also issue some missions triggering upgrades to military equipment, etc. Lynn Sha waved his hand. Use the Hashia order ascension function to ascend the Warh Hall. The Warh Hall has been upgraded to the highest level. Warh Hall quality golden legend.</p>
<p>Level one. Defense 50,000. Researchable projects. None at present. Awaiting activation.</p>
<p>Current mission. Your Mod Dao iron guard is brave and invincible. Ironblooded and fierce. Wielding the MO DAO, you can defeat any flesh and blood enemy in the world. However, their armor is a combination of scale armor and chain mail.</p>
<p>So, there is still room for improvement in terms of protective capabilities. The MO DAO Iron Guard has long coveted the 60 lb infantryman&#x27;s armor, the Divine Armcher. Please grant his wish and let the Mod Dao iron guard unleash even greater power. Task one. Use the Mod Dao iron guard to kill legendary or higher level lords troops known for their defense.</p>
<p>Reward, you can research and upgrade all Mod Dao iron guards to bright armor. Mission two, use the divine arm archer to kill more than 10 times the number of epic level or higher lords troops in melee combat. Reward, you can research all the MO Dao iron guards upgraded infantry armor. Lin Shiao was delighted after reading the posted task. It seems Tang Yi has been unable to forget Song Rule and his group s infantrymen.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. Skill lies in being a brave warrior charging into battle. The armor of the Mod Dao soldiers was slightly inferior to that of the divine arm bow, a ranged weapon that claimed to be weak. Tanggi was naturally resentful. Lyn Shao smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>This task requires dealing with the Lord&#x27;s troops. Simply grinding monsters won&#x27;t work, which adds a bit of difficulty. Never mind. I&#x27;ll just focus on completing the task and fulfilling Tang Yas wish. Besides the warh hall, Lin Sha also used the ascension function to upgrade the blacksmith shop the day before yesterday, but he hasn&#x27;t had time to check it yet.</p>
<p>Ascension has a 24-hour cool down period, which Lin Shia generally doesn&#x27;t waste, and he ascends one building every day. Blacksmith shop quality golden legend level one required blacksmith farmer function produce any weapons and equipment of legendary quality or lower requires additional resources and a master blacksmith repair and maintain farm tools, weapons and armor. Replenish consumables such as arrows and javelins. Defense 50,000 upgradeable items. weapons.</p>
<p>Ring pommel horizontal sword LV2 requires 50,000 gold coins, 50,000 refined iron, 1,000 crystals. Long Dao LV2 requires 50,000 gold coins, 50,000 refined iron, 1,000 gems. Divine Arm Bow LV2 requires 50,000 gold coins, 50,000 refined iron, 1,000 sulfur. White shafted spear LV2 armor fish scale armor LV2 requires 20,000 gold 20,000 refined iron and 1,000 mercury chain mail LV2 requirements omitted. Infantry armor, barbarian iron armor, wargeears, none.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t met a master blacksmith yet, and I don&#x27;t have a blacksmith&#x27;s talisman. I&#x27;m still missing out on blacksmithing skills. Although it is still impossible to produce weapons or armor for the time being. However, the upgrade project is unique to the golden legend blacksmith shop. The blacksmith can upgrade whatever weapons your lord&#x27;s troops have.</p>
<p>This is a very good feature. As long as you have enough resources and time, you can further improve the combat strength of your troops. But the resources we have now are still not enough. Lyn Sha closed the blacksmith shop panel. Let&#x27;s save it for upgrading to level three and building stables.</p>
<p>We should use the money wisely. When playing Starcraft, is it more important to save resources to build a battle cruiser or to upgrade the attack of 10 tanks at home by one level? After inspecting the territory, Lynn Shiao summoned several farmers and instructed them to build something at daybreak the next day, pointing out the location to them. After finishing all this, Lyn Sha headed home to rest. The thoughtful Baoi had already prepared the bathwater and was waiting for her lord. For many days, Baoi had been serving Lin Shao everyday, helping him bathe and go to bed.</p>
<p>My lord, I was impressed by your quick wit and eloquent speech today. You recited two ancient poems, and your talent was truly unparalleled. As Baoi massaged Lin Xiao&#x27;s shoulders while he soaked in the large bathtub, she said enviously, &quot;Baoi also liked ancient poems. But in the Chinese history that the ancient demons instilled in Baoi, there were only a few poems. Baoi pressed her face against Lin Xiao, her breath sweet as orchids.</p>
<p>If your lordship has the time, could you perhaps write a classical poem for Baoi as well? A hint of surprise flashed through Linhaos mind. Ba of the Zhao dynasty actually liked ancient poetry. I also need to write a poem for her myself. The enchantress is really proactive. She should just ask the Lord what she wants.</p>
<p>Does she want her own body? After a pause, Lyn Sha was surprised that this online novel plot of composing poems to woo girls could happen to him. Even though Baoi was already his catch. Upon seeing Bao&#x27;s stunningly beautiful face and expectant gaze, her eyes as innocent as a fawns, Lin Xiaos heart stirred. Ba, I have a poem here that suits you perfectly. Of course, it&#x27;s the poem that every person who travels back to ancient times has to memorize to pick up girls.</p>
<p>When the clouds resemble her clothes and the flowers resemble her face, which woman wouldn&#x27;t be captivated? Just as Lin Sha was about to speak, he noticed a hint of cunning in Ba&#x27;s expectant gaze. Do you know what kind of poem I want to write? Lyn Sha blurted out. Oh, this concubine did not know that your highness wished to write the chimping tune for this concubine. Ba realized she had spoken out of turn and covered her mouth. Hei, &quot;How come you know about Chimping Tune?&quot; Lyn Shao, having exposed Ba&#x27;s scheme, was not annoyed, but instead asked with a smile.</p>
<p>The ancient demon senior emphasized the four great demones and four great beauties of China and also instilled in me this poem describing the beauty of Sister Yang. Guay Bi blushed and said, &quot;I was just thinking that the Lord should read it aloud as well so that I could also experience what it feels like to be pampered.&quot; As soon as she spoke, Ba&#x27;s eyes reened and tears welled up in her innocent eyes, making her look pitiful. Seeing Bao&#x27;s shy yet pitiful appearance, Lynn Shaighed softly, &quot;Come, I&#x27;ll write a poem for you myself.&quot; After saying that, Lynn Shao reached out and pulled the panicked Baoi into the bathtub. Chapter 96. A poem presented to a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Warm bed chamber. Chingping Dao was written by Lee Bi at the behest of Emperor Schwanzong of Tang about Yongu Fei. The clouds resemble her clothes, the flowers her face, the spring breeze caresses the ballastrade, the dew is heavy. If not seen at top Mount Shuanu, then met beneath the moon on the jade terrace. Back then, because of this poem, the beauty of the imperial concubine was sung throughout the land, and her elegance and nobility were loved and respected by all.</p>
<p>The love that Emperor Schwanzong of Tang had for Yangu Fei is praised by the world. But the story of their separation by death is another matter. Despite being labeled a fim fatal, Baoi was forever burdened with infamy. Baosi&#x27;s heart simply longed for the person she loved to recite this poem to her. Let her experience what it feels like to be pampered.</p>
<p>For some reason, the straightforward Lin Shiao suddenly had a flash of inspiration and immediately understood Ba&#x27;s thoughts. He pulled Baoi into the bathtub, gently pressing her shoulders to stop her struggles and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll write it for you right away.&quot; Ba quieted down, her long jet black hair half floating in the water. Her face, a blend of allure and innocence, was irresistibly charming under the steam. The curve of her collarbone was soft and crystallin. She sat obediently and quietly opposite Lyn Sha.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha leaned against one end of the bathtub, looking into Bao&#x27;s nervous yet expectant eyes and slowly recited. A painted carriage and a carved saddle meet on a narrow road. A heart-wrenching sound from behind the embroidered curtain. Ba&#x27;s small mouth immediately opened slightly and surprise was written on her pretty face. Lord, you&#x27;re saying that your chance encounter with him was a destiny ordained by heaven.</p>
<p>The battlefield of myriad races is so vast, and the chances of people from two different worlds meeting have been so small over thousands of years, but I&#x27;ve run into the Lord. Isn&#x27;t this a classic case of meeting on a narrow path? Is that heart-wrenching cry a sign that the Lord is worried about her voice? Ba&#x27;s heart pounded. Lynn Sha closed his eyes, tilted his head back slightly, and continued, &quot;My body lacks the wings of a colorful phoenix to fly with me. Those who are of one mind understand each other perfectly.&quot; Bowsi instinctively covered her mouth. Isn&#x27;t this just talking about how the Lord saw through his attempt to get the Lord to recite the chimping tune? The two people didn&#x27;t speak, but they both understood each other&#x27;s meaning.</p>
<p>Lord. She actually said that she and he were of one mind and understood each other perfectly. A meeting of minds. What a beautiful phrase. What a fitting metaphor.</p>
<p>Ba&#x27;s breathing became rapid. In the large bathtub, Lynn Sha, eyes closed and naked, leaned against her. The rising steam made his handsome, sunny face even more captivating. Her perfectly proportioned face, slightly flushed from the hot water, combined with her long neck and muscular chest, exuded a captivating aura. Ba&#x27;s gaze involuntarily widened.</p>
<p>This poem, such a masterpiece, was written for himself. Ba felt that her life had been worthwhile. A house of gold, a cage of jade. Lyn Sha, still with his eyes closed, continued. Cars flowed like water.</p>
<p>Horses galloped like dragons. There&#x27;s more to the story. The poem isn&#x27;t finished yet. A house of gold, a cage of jade. Does this refer to her life of luxury and extravagance as a concubine of the Zhao Emperor? Ba thought to herself.</p>
<p>Cars flowed like water and horses galloped like dragons. It means that his life back then was prosperous and luxurious. But does that mean she&#x27;s surrounded by a constant stream of men? Although I have never had physical intimacy with any man, my lord still cares, doesn&#x27;t he? With men coming and going like a flowing stream, all having designs on her, who would still believe she is still pure and innocent. As expected, I am still not worthy of the Lord. Ba&#x27;s tears flowed out in a flash.</p>
<p>Her tears fell like pearls from a broken string, pattering down her face. My lord, this humble servant. Just as Baoi was about to choke out a sob, Lyn Sha reached out and gently cuped her face, tenderly wiping away her tears. Don&#x27;t rush. It&#x27;s not over yet.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha slowly opened his eyes, his clear and gentle gaze meeting Bao&#x27;s moist eyes. He softly murmured. Lin Lang already laments the distance to Pongai Mountain. And beyond that, countless mountains separate us. Ba was stunned for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Then suddenly realizing what was happening, tears streamed down my face again. My lord. Ba threw herself into Linhaos arms without hesitation. My lord, my lord. Ba, nestled in Lyn Xiaos arms was speechless, only repeating this one sentence over and over again.</p>
<p>The last two lines of Lin Xiao&#x27;s poem are saying exactly what Lin Shiao wanted to pursue her just like he wanted to go to the distant Punglai Mountain to seek immortality and enlightenment. That place was so far away and difficult to reach. The distance between them was even greater than that of the distant Punglai Mountain tens of thousands of miles away. Lynn Shiao as a lord is as sacred and majestic as an emperor or monarch on the battlefield of all races and is inviable. Baoi was merely a vixen, an ominous figure who brought disaster to countless people.</p>
<p>Lord Lynn Sha not only didn&#x27;t care about her past, but also lowered himself to say that pursuing her was as difficult as pursuing a distant immortal mountain tens of thousands of times more difficult. What a sincere feeling this is. Lin Lang already laments the distance to Pongai Mountain, now separated by tens of thousands of Pongai Mountains. Is my position in the Lord&#x27;s heart really that high? I had just thought the Lord looked down on me. Ba&#x27;s emotions at this moment were beyond words.</p>
<p>All the grievances, sadness, and self-deprecation I felt just now have transformed into an even more overwhelming surge of love. Ba wrapped her arms around Lin Xiao&#x27;s neck and kissed him directly. Ding! Your hero Bao&#x27;s loyalty has reached 100%. She&#x27;ll follow you to the death. Ding! Due to triggering a major emotional fluctuation in Baoi, breaking the shackles that had bound her heart for many years, Bao&#x27;s luck value has increased to zero.</p>
<p>In the past, the system notification would have elicited a few complaints from Lin Shia, such as, &quot;This poem is more effective than dozens of jokes. Why aren&#x27;t my gold coins increasing?&quot; There were also comments like, &quot;This girl is obviously not cultured enough and is easy to fool. If she memorizes one more poem, she won&#x27;t be able to recognize you.&quot; And so on. But at this moment, Lyn Sha had long forgotten about the system notification sound. His eyes were only on the beautiful woman in front of him.</p>
<p>After a long and passionate kiss, the two parted. Ba blushed and only dared to bury her head in Lyn Xiaos arms. She released Lin Xiao&#x27;s neck and was about to move away from him to apologize for her rude behavior when I accidentally bumped into something in the bathtub again. Wow, how magnificent. Ba blushed even more, her head almost burying itself in the steaming hot water.</p>
<p>You think you can just run away after you&#x27;ve teased me? Lyn Sha pulled Baoi back again, causing a large splash of water. After a long while, the two parted. Lin Xiao was about to do something else when he heard Baoi whisper, &quot;My lord, I have been gone for 2 days.&quot; Lynhos breathing suddenly stopped, then became rapid. He scooped Baoi up in his arms and carried her directly to the bed. Ba! Lord Lin Lang, the spring night is warm under the tent, and her hair is swaying like lotus blossoms.</p>
<p>Click to view hidden content. At this moment, the two were inseparable. Chapter 97. the invaders in the peaceful valley. In the valley of Calabash, the fog of war drifted and lingered, a vast expanse of white mist.</p>
<p>This place is filled with bird song and fragrant flowers. And everywhere you look is pristine natural scenery. Here you&#x27;ll find tall trees, rugged boulders, winding paths, and flowing streams. In the center of the valley, there is a vast, lush green grassland. This place is home to a wide variety of species which is truly breathtaking.</p>
<p>Green goblins who love and cherish human women and often appear in various harmonious novels and comics. There are strong and sturdy centaur raiders who also frequently appear in hentai comics serving as the leaders of a certain section. There are pacifists orc smashers who only occasionally kill humans who invade their homes to protect their layers. They love to eat eggs. There are also bandits and thugs who live in harmony with nature and roam the forest year round.</p>
<p>They are quite rare as human monsters. There are also bloodthirsty witches with eerie and beautiful appearances who enjoy relieving men&#x27;s worries and often forcibly relax the muscles of young men. In short, this place is home to a wide variety of creatures and species, boasts abundant resources, and has a beautiful environment. It is truly a paradise on earth and a haven for wild animals. Of the myriad races lived happily in this gourd valley, enjoying a life of mutual fighting and constant turmoil.</p>
<p>Until this day, the iron hoves of the shameless invaders shattered the already chaotic lives of all the monsters. More than 100 invaders armed with weapons stepped into this beautiful and fertile land. Then in order to defend their homeland, the monsters launched a brave and resolute counterattack against the invaders. The cowardly goblins did not lose their courage this time. They were the first to rush forward like a green tide.</p>
<p>Then they were pinned down one by one by a dense and swift barrage of arrows without even reaching the invaders. It must be condemned that the archer was none other than our former neighbor, the phantom archer who lived on the ridge. This time, however, the phantom shooters put on white overalls and became ruthless. They forgot their former neighbors. The last goblin was also shot down.</p>
<p>He let out a whale and no one could understand the goblin language. Only that the sound seemed to be. Little Blackie has made some brazed chicken feet. Do you want some? And some fried dough sticks. Do you want some? Then came the tragic centaur raiders who encountered a group of fierce looking brutes who slashed at the centur&#x27;s heads.</p>
<p>The centur&#x27;s proud length was thus cut off. Every strike is a critical hit. The Orc&#x27;s shredders suddenly rushed out from behind and ambushed the group of archers at the very back. The giant axe swung up from bottom to top, all for this long- awaited moment. Clang.</p>
<p>The archers slowly turned around, staring coldly at the bewildered orcs. The giant ax cleaved through their layers of armored plates without causing any damage. These archers raised their fists as large as sandbags and covered in armor plates and slammed them down at the orcs. Bare-handed, he smashed the orc as head. Hundreds and thousands of bandits and thugs also rushed out, intending to engulf the invaders.</p>
<p>But from behind the bandits and thugs, a small group of soldiers wielding white spears rushed out and stabbed anyone they saw, killing the bandits and thugs who were running around in all directions, clutching their buttocks. Massacre. It was an absolute one-sided massacre. At this moment, several people stepped out from the invading group. The leader was a handsome young man.</p>
<p>His facial features were practically perfect, possessing both masculine strength and a captivatingly gentle smile. His eyes were bright and piercing, and the curve and shape of his lips were just right. He stood with his hands behind his back, calmly observing everything. Beside him were a man and a woman, one on his left and one on his right. The man was dressed in white and was only slightly less handsome than him, also dashing and unrestrained.</p>
<p>The woman wore silver soft armor and a bright red cloak, looking heroic and incomparably beautiful. What a good-looking team of intruders. I&#x27;m here today to do only three things. The leading man held up three fingers and said loudly, &quot;Kill the ugly ones. Leave the beautiful ones.</p>
<p>Kill all the men. Leave the women alive. Kill all who resist. Leave those who surrender.&quot; After thinking for a moment, the man added, &quot;Goblins surrendering doesn&#x27;t count. Kill them all.</p>
<p>These disgusting creatures are an eyesore. During the new year, I never want to see goblins in my notebook again. I&#x27;d rather they all be wiped out. The man behind him tilted his head. My lord, what is a dincshi? It&#x27;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>The leader of the invaders waved his hand. The shameless invaders began their massacre. The peaceful and tranquil valley was shattered by screams. The kind-hearted, relatively kind, indigenous people of the valley were subjected to a one-sided massacre and could only flee while crying out. No monster could withstand a single blow from the invaders.</p>
<p>Even the demon natives, who were the absolute backbone of the demon race, such as the powerful tyrant demon and the ferocious three-headed hellhound were mercilessly killed. When all the surviving native monsters were chased into a corner by the invaders with nowhere to escape, the leading man strolled over leisurely, his hands behind his back. Behind him stood two heroes, a man and a woman. The man&#x27;s sword was stained with blood, and the woman&#x27;s spear gleamed coldly. The bloodthirsty witch leader was so frightened that she knelt down.</p>
<p>&quot;Spare us! Spare us! Please let us go! Well do anything!&quot; After saying this, the witch crawled up to the male intruder who was leading the group, grabbed his leg, and pressed her beautiful, bewitching face against his foot. The bloodthirsty witch twisted and turned, her voice seductive and alluring. &quot;My lord, spare our lives. Let us go and well do anything you ask. After saying that, she stuck out her blood red tongue and licked the leader&#x27;s boot, her alluring eyes gazing at him seductively.</p>
<p>All the indigenous people in the valley were filled with grief and indignation upon seeing this scene. Its own valley s most beautiful member is begging for food from the intruders just to survive. The silver armored woman behind the intruder&#x27;s leader instantly flared up, her pretty face turning frosty, her silver spear pointing directly at the bloodthirsty witch. Slaughter them all now. The bloodthirsty witch turned deathly pale with fright.</p>
<p>No, don&#x27;t kill me. I really can do everything. My sister is good, too. She learned from succubi and is very good at attracting them. Shut up.</p>
<p>What foul language. The woman in silver armor was furious and was about to stab him with her spear. Don&#x27;t be impatient. The leader of the invaders calmly stopped the silver armored woman, muttering to himself. She didn&#x27;t say what she was smoking.</p>
<p>Why are you getting so worked up? Then with a warm smile on his face, he blew towards the blood which like a spring breeze in a valley. Are you really willing to do anything? Really? A seductive light began to appear in the blood witch&#x27;s eyes. All right, let&#x27;s see how sincere you are. The blood witch&#x27;s hands had already reached up from the man&#x27;s thighs. The slaughtered valley monster closed its eyes in despair.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s as if some kind of minotaur drama is about to begin. The intruder kicked the bloodthirsty witch away and shouted, &quot;All the monsters who want to surrender, I&#x27;m giving you a chance now. Go deep into Calabash Valley and have a good talk with all the wild monsters that live there.&quot; Chapter 98. resource solution. Calabash Valley completely conquered.</p>
<p>I will conquer the entire valley. Whether it&#x27;s the monster gathering points or their layers, whether you are evil creatures, benevolent creatures, or neutral creatures, the intruder proclaimed, &quot;If you want to survive, surrender obediently. Accept my reorganization. I guarantee that all surrendering monsters will live a life of luxury.&quot; A tall, burly minur asked timidly, &quot;Should we still kill the man? Those who surrender to me will not be killed.&quot; The minur breathed a sigh of relief and said in a low voice, &quot;Ah, then I don&#x27;t need to pretend to be a girl anymore.&quot; Hearing the powerful, muscular minur&#x27;s clapper-like voice. The invader leader was taken aback, then waved his hand, and more than a dozen arrows pierced through the minur.</p>
<p>Whether they&#x27;re human demons or bull demons, they must be killed. Having resolved the farce, the invading leader said calmly, &quot;Four-fifths of the resources produced will be mine, and 1/5if will go back to the original owner.&quot; &quot;After I conquer your stronghold, if I need to conscript soldiers, I will pay you the normal fees. It&#x27;s only right to risk your life for money. You&#x27;ve suffered no losses, and you no longer need to worry about me killing you all. then you will be brought under my control and you will not be allowed to wage war against each other unless there are special circumstances.</p>
<p>Your safety will also be guaranteed. From now on, you and I will be the masters of this valley together. Wouldn&#x27;t that be wonderful? The blood witch kicked to the ground and the other monsters looked at each other in bewilderment. Then she spoke cautiously. My lord, after you seize the mine, our resources are only 1/if of what they were before.</p>
<p>How can there be no loss? The male leader of the invaders did not blame them, but nodded gently. Very good. If you have any questions, you should raise them. We are messengers of peace, not vicious demons. Everyone agrees, right? The monsters looked at the minotaur lying on the ground.</p>
<p>Then looking at the intruder&#x27;s 3meter long, gleaming, long-handled giant swords, the 2- m tall giant dressed like he was wearing a metal can and smashing an orc&#x27;s head with his bare hands. Looking at the dark-kinned man with the 4 m long white spear, looking at the phantom shooter wearing overalls. You say it&#x27;s not brutal? Okay, the last one wasn&#x27;t really brutal. It was even a bit funny. But the monsters still dared not utter a sound.</p>
<p>The male leader of the invaders then looked at the blood witch, &quot;What mineral veain have you captured?&quot; The bloodthirsty witch said gracefully, &quot;My sisters and I have occupied two mines. One is a fine iron or mine, and the other is a mercury mine. What do you mean by slave? Where did you learn that from?&quot; Bloody witch. Huh? Isn&#x27;t that what all demonistes say after they&#x27;ve been subdued? The leader of the intruders shook his head helplessly and said, &quot;Then try your vein. Give me the ore, the bloodthirsty which opened her innocent looking eyes, desperately trying to elicit sympathy from the handsome human lord.</p>
<p>But when the human lord drew a long sword made of dragon bone, the blood which had no choice but to obediently hand over the mine with a flash of light, the mine had been seized by the invading lord. Continue mining. I&#x27;ve already given you the authority. The blood witch leader sent her sister witches dejected to mine the vein. They had barely entered when they screamed in surprise.</p>
<p>Wow. What&#x27;s going on here? The mining speed of this vein has increased dramatically. It&#x27;s five times faster than before. The monsters were terrified. The blood witch leader&#x27;s eyes darted around rapidly before she suddenly collapsed at the feet of the invading lord once more.</p>
<p>Sherry is willing to surrender. From now on, she will be the lord&#x27;s exclusive meat and exclusive witch. The invading lord was taken aback at first. then nodded in satisfaction. Although I think I misheard some important word just now.</p>
<p>All right. From now on, you will be one of my subordinates. I will not kill you again, and you can let your sisters go back. The leader of the blood witches was overjoyed and let her witches away quickly. Those monsters with a brain figured out the reason behind it.</p>
<p>This lord can give his mine a 5x production bonus. Then he takes four fifths and the original owner takes 1/5. It&#x27;s essentially a no- loss situation. Although they have lost their freedom, the Lord said he would restrict and prevent them from killing each other, and it seems like the monsters didn&#x27;t have a choice either. Seeing that the monsters all seem to be deep in thought, the invading lord continued, &quot;Hurry up.</p>
<p>You should be grateful that you have met such a benevolent lord as me. I can accept a ferocious cyclops, and I don&#x27;t shy away from cunning and bloodthirsty witches. So, what else do you have to worry about?&quot; As soon as the words were spoken, the surrounded monsters saw several tall cyclops appear behind the invaders. This is an epic creature, one of the fiercest creatures guarding the high ridge of Calabash Mountain. Yet, it has surrendered to the invaders.</p>
<p>If you stubbornly resist, thinking you can fight head-on, you&#x27;ll end up like this bunch of goblins. They will be genocide, the leader of the invaders proclaimed. Now half of you stay as hostages and the other half go and persuade your monster neighbors to surrender. Those who fail to bring back their neighbors to surrender will suffer the same fate as the goblins. I&#x27;ll be waiting here for you to come back with good news.</p>
<p>The invading army immediately made way for them. With a loud bang, the monsters scattered and ran into the valley, fearing they would become hostages. Seeing this scene, the leader of the invaders smiled with satisfaction. The leader of the invaders was naturally Lynn Shiao. He couldn&#x27;t be bothered to send his own soldiers to subdue the wild monsters.</p>
<p>A lord to recruit wild monsters are complicated. Not to mention, not only do they lack manpower, but they also monsters might take advantage of your isolated units and attack to eliminate them. Even the lowest ranking phantom archer would be heartbroken to lose one of his own. This is absolutely unacceptable. Moreover, the valley is very large, and even if all of our own manpower were put in, we would not be able to complete the task.</p>
<p>So, Lynn Sha led his troops to blatantly hunt monsters, blocking most of the wild monsters in front of the valley, killing a batch and letting the rest enter the valley as scout stones. Monsters that they can quickly cover the entire valley, and he won&#x27;t feel any remorse if they die. These are wild monsters, not troops you recruited yourself. And so some of the wild monsters returned, conveying Lyn Xiao&#x27;s policies and military might and also bringing news of the surrender of other wild monsters. Some of the wild monsters failed to return and were devoured by the powerful unyielding monsters in the valley.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha waved his hand and led his elite troops to find these tough nuts to crack. And then with the help of the legendary Chinese troops, they crushed and annihilated them. As night was about to fall, the entire Calabash Valley officially completely. It was taken over by Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha sent flower fairies and farmers to mine the vacant mines that had been emptied after the massacres.</p>
<p>The wild monsters that already occupied the area continued to occupy it. And at the same time, the wild monsters continued to mine the resources. These places don&#x27;t have a single farmer or flower fairy of their own. Wild monsters just go there to mine on their own initiative. After mining, the majority of the resources have to be handed over.</p>
<p>We should thank Lyn Sha for that. This is something that would make capitalists weep and bosses ashamed. Even working people who have to go to work on New Year&#x27;s Eve would feel like committing a crime after seeing this. Lyn Sha opened the resource panel only to see that all the resources on it were experiencing an explosive increase. The numbers were jumping up every second.</p>
<p>At this point, Lyn Sha possessed all the resources and mineral veins of the entire Calabash mountain range. Inexhaustible, inexhaustible. He has completely occupied the entire Hulu mountain range and Hulu Valley. The major resource problem has been completely solved. Chapter 99 has only two days left until the black flame lord breaks through the region and arrives.</p>
<p>Evening. Dugu Jaolon led his troops back to his territory and immediately began upgrading his lord&#x27;s mansion to level three. Upgrade the lord&#x27;s mansion to level three. Upon seeing the notification that the lord&#x27;s manor was being upgraded, Dugu Jaolon continued to use talismans. Use the speedup spell.</p>
<p>With everything settled, Dugu Jaolon breathed a sigh of relief. The chattering female soldier beside him kept talking. Miss will definitely be number one again this time. Few people could match this speed in previous years. Dugu Jaalon shook his head.</p>
<p>Not necessarily, because I don&#x27;t have enough resources for the upgrade. After the second tier lord&#x27;s manor was cooled down, I spent a few days accumulating resources. If someone has more resources, they might be able to catch up later. Even Miss Lean has been collecting upgrade resources for several days. Others will only need more time, the female soldier said confidently.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know about others, but he has already created several miracles. Dugu Jaalon raised his head, half reminiscing and half sighing. The female soldier was a little indignant and wanted to say something, but she was afraid that she would continue to be punished by standing guard and working the night shift, so she swallowed her words. The Valkyrie beside him seemed to know who Dugu Jelon was referring to and nodded, saying, &quot;His hero is very strong. to defeat Dinglay, who was capable of defeating three lords with just one move, his strength should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Judging from what that hero in white said, he can only get stronger. The Valkyrie with slight surprise. You&#x27;re interested in this kind of thing, too? Marlenia smiled faintly. I&#x27;m interested in any kind of battle. How do you think you compare to that hero in white given your abilities? Marlinia was silent for a few seconds before slowly saying, &quot;I can easily defeat the three lords, and I can also defeat Dinglay.</p>
<p>In fact, if it were a race, I could probably take them all out even faster.&quot; Marlenia then shook her head and said, &quot;But if I want to finish the battle quickly without killing them, I&#x27;m not as good as that hero in White, so I don&#x27;t know who is stronger or weaker between the two of us.&quot; Marlene a flicked her golden prosthetic arm, a long narrow golden sword slicing through the air, and said, &quot;Perhaps a head-to-head confrontation is needed to determine who is superior. Is this your evaluation? It&#x27;s so high.&quot; The aloof and elegant Dugu Jaon, like a lotus flower untouched by the world, was slightly surprised. He really does have a lot of secrets, and even that Archer Gust feels strangely familiar to me. I have a feeling that we will meet him in the official district. What&#x27;s so great about that kid? He always steals first place from the young ladies.</p>
<p>I wish he would never go to the official area. Unable to hold back any longer, the female soldier finally spoke. Dugu Jalon slowly turned around, startling the female soldier who quickly lowered her head. Miss I. A faint rhythm of heaven and earth resonated around them and Dugu Jalon spoke.</p>
<p>You are hereby ordered to complete further investigation of the celestial beings organization&#x27;s information today and submit it to me. The female soldier opened her mouth in surprise. Huh? At the same time, Ding lay in the 89757 newbie zone was sitting blankly in his lord&#x27;s mansion. I lost. I lost again.</p>
<p>He was defeated by just one of Lin Xiaos heroes. Ding Lay was distraught as if he had lost his parents. He recalled the masked man and what he had said and the complete 180° turn in his attitude. Wongu no longer values me. He has given away a large number of recruitment tokens to those scum who slaughtered their compatriots.</p>
<p>At least several thousand rare and exceptional units in total. That&#x27;s quite a generous investment. Dingle clenched his fist. Those bloodthirsty lords were originally just low-level henchmen of the celestial beings organization. They were thrown into the newbie zone and made to kill a certain number of lords each.</p>
<p>Only those who could survive and enter the official zone could join the celestial beings. Become a trainee member. What a despicable organization, the celestials. They&#x27;re using the newbie zone as a training ground for assassins. Dingle was lost in thought, his expression complex.</p>
<p>My original intention was to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the heavenly people organizations attempt to win me over and to seize the chance to compile a list of these scoundrels who have harmed our compatriots and to eliminate them one by one. But Wongu only gave me information on some insignificant minor characters, most of whom were weak and bloodthirsty lords who were destined to be eliminated because they were clumsy and exposed or whose talents and skills were not strong enough. In this way, I gained fame by defeating the blood lord, and Wong Su was happy to have someone clean up the incompetent and defective products. It seemed like a win-win situation, but I didn&#x27;t achieve my goal at all. How could a topranked expert in the official region fall for my trick so easily? Ding Li tried to pull out his Frostorn, but found it empty, only then realizing that his beloved weapon had been stolen.</p>
<p>He sighed, unsure of what to do. Although I Dingle consider myself not a good person, I am definitely not a bad person without principles. I suppressed dissident, I provoked conflict, but everything I did did not harm the interests of the lords in my district. I have never harmed any innocent people, not even the pretty girls. Except for Lyn Shao, Dinglay looked somewhat conflicted.</p>
<p>I have targeted Lyn Shao several times, starting with Xiao Daong. And just a few days ago, I even attacked his hero. Judging from how Lin Shiao wiped out Xiao Daong and Gene Dang without a second thought, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve really made an enemy of him. But what can I do? That&#x27;s just my talent. Most of what I&#x27;ve done is for this damn talent.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia is so powerful now, and he will become even more powerful. He has also made an enemy of mine. If I can&#x27;t eliminate him as soon as possible, all that will remain for me is eternal pain and fear. It won&#x27;t be long before Lynn Shiao kills me. Just then, Wong Su called again.</p>
<p>Here are five excellent recruitment tokens and five rare recruitment tokens. Dingle. Wong Sus voice was extremely cold. This is the last time I&#x27;ll support you. There are only two days left until Black Flames campaign against Lin Shiao.</p>
<p>You know what to do. If you lose again this time, you can forget about ever joining our celestial beings organization again. Oh, I understand. Dinglay replied calmly, saying that he still needed to maintain his public image. Seeing the masked man Wong Su hang up the phone with a look of utter disgust, Ding Lay felt a surge of satisfaction, and his talent received a boost of positive energy.</p>
<p>After a moment&#x27;s thought, Ding Lay gritted his teeth. If you&#x27;re going to do something, do it all the time. Let&#x27;s just go all the way down this path. If you&#x27;re not going to deal with Lynn Shiao, you might as well kneel down and lick his feet, begging him to spare your life. Would you do that if you were in my shoes? Chapter 100.</p>
<p>The game between the city lords faction and the celestial beings. At the same time, Julie, Wong Bo, and Pans Shan Yu also gathered together. Their troops suffered heavy losses, but as the chosen ones, they were too embarrassed to ask the city lord for support. Chu Yusi also wanted to curb the arrogance of these geniuses, so he didn&#x27;t bring it up. Fortunately, Chufinga had long understood the three situation.</p>
<p>He asked the old man for some recruitment tokens and gave them to the three to replenish their troops. Now, their forces are almost as strong as when they crossed regions and may even be stronger. The task assigned to us by the city lord was sabotaged by Ding Lelay before it even began. Young Pan Shanu looked worried. The three of us have A-level talent.</p>
<p>So why can&#x27;t we even defeat Ding Lay, who is also an A-level talent. Wong Bo didn&#x27;t speak. He just crossed his arms and his face was dark. Ever since he was defeated by Ding Lay, he has been full of resentment. Perhaps Ding Lays talent lies in rising to the occasion against strong opponents.</p>
<p>But to be honest, we were also careless and underestimated our opponents. Only by knowing your weaknesses can you catch up. Julie comforted everyone, saying, &quot;We still have time, so we can use this time to gain more experience. Gaining experience can also level us up, and once we reach a certain level, our combat power will also increase. But what about resources? If we focus on experience, we&#x27;ll fall behind in resources, and we won&#x27;t be able to quickly advance to the third tier.</p>
<p>At a time like this, why are you still worried about resources, Jill Dao? We are all part of the city lord&#x27;s faction and our honor and disgrace are all tied to the city lord. To put it bluntly, what others consider unattainable, such as the excellent recruiting token or even the epic recruiting token, is not a rare thing for the city lord. As long as we complete the task well, there will naturally be a reward. Jilly slowly said, &quot;Besides, do you think it&#x27;s worthwhile for us to try to reach level three now? We only have 2 days. Even if we manage to complete level three, we&#x27;ll still have to deal with the demonic tide after recruiting heroes.</p>
<p>By the time we&#x27;ve dealt with the demonic tide, Black Flame will probably have already hung Lin Xiaos corpse on the flag pole. The mission has failed completely, and the city lord will not let us off easily. Wong Bo and Pans Shan Yu remained silent. Wong Bo, how many types of soldiers do you have? The burly Wong Bo said in a deep voice. 100 are rare, 50 are outstanding.</p>
<p>I am rare at 80, outstanding at 50. Pansyu replied, I have 120 rare units, 60 excellent units, and 10 epic units. Wong Bo and Pans Shanu suddenly looked up at Julie. You used your family&#x27;s troops. Julie nodded slowly.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. Pans Shan Yu suddenly asked, &quot;Is it worth it? It&#x27;s just protecting Lyn Sha. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re going to fight a full-fledged district lord one-on-one. WBO also said, &quot;Based on past experience, the lords who arrive after breaking through a region usually only bring a few hundred troops. Even if you bring a full force of 1,000 people, mostly rare and superior units.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s enough to crush any lord in the beginner area because epic level units are extremely rare, even in the official zones. So with our troops plus Fong Ji&#x27;s troops, we have several hundred rare troops and more than 200 outstanding troops, which should be enough to save Linhao&#x27;s life. The destruction of the region will last for 3 days. If we just help it hold out for 3 days, everything will be over. And you you actually used all your own epic units? No.</p>
<p>Julie shook his head. We were exposed the moment Ding Lay specifically targeted us. So, I had a feeling this time wouldn&#x27;t be so simple. Perhaps we don&#x27;t need so many powerful troops to deal with Lin Sha. But what if we could also weaken Lord Shu&#x27;s power along the way? And don&#x27;t forget, although Dinglay lost, since the Celestials can support Ding Lay, they might be able to support even more people to launch an attack in coordination with Black Flame.</p>
<p>Wong Bo and Pans Shan Yu exchanged a glance, their expressions grave. Now that things have come to this, we have no choice but to fight with all our might. We must prove our worth so as not to disgrace the city lord. The three looked at each other and finally nodded emphatically at the same time. All right, let&#x27;s go grind experience tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Monster treasure house, house of the dead, and soul tower. Anywhere that gives a lot of experience and can drop recruitment tokens will go grind. At the same time, the barracks will continue to recruit soldiers. Strive to upgrade all troop types to the highest level in two days. Defeat Dinglay, defeat Black Flame, and avenge our defeat.</p>
<p>At this moment, within the official area, the masked man, Wong Su patted a man of medium build with small eyes, thin lips, and a scar on his face. Black Flame, it&#x27;s time for you to make contributions to the organization again. Understood, brother. Black Flame&#x27;s voice was as horse as a male ducks, as if his throat had been injured. I have participated in 59 large and small district conquests and never lost.</p>
<p>I have killed 55 novice lords. The remaining four barely escaped with their lives. This was just an accidental crushing of an ant. Why make such a fuss, brother? No, no, no. Wong Su shook his head.</p>
<p>Although Lin Shiao is strong, he&#x27;s nothing special. But the master&#x27;s intention is to take advantage of Chu Yusi&#x27;s ignorance and wipe out his entire force. Xioli, Wong, Bo, and Pans Shan Yu are also targets that must be eliminated. I heard that Chu Yusi&#x27;s son is also in that newbie zone. If he doesn&#x27;t show up, fine, but if he does, you can take care of him while you&#x27;re at it.</p>
<p>Black Flame&#x27;s eyes flashed with a sharp light, and he nodded heavily. We&#x27;ve been suppressed too much in the Dragon Sea Kingdom. This time, we&#x27;ll fight back on the battlefield of all races. Very good. Wong Su took out a long broadsword and handed it to Black Flame.</p>
<p>This is Black Flame&#x27;s tiny eyes widened in surprise. That&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s one of your epic weapons, the sword in the stone. I&#x27;ll lend it to you for now. Keep this safe.</p>
<p>Take this sword. chop off Linhaos doghead head and let everyone know the power of us celestials. Although it was only a temporary loan, Black Flame was still filled with excitement and couldn&#x27;t help but hold the sword in the stone and examine it closely. I will definitely kill Lin Shia, that fool who doesn&#x27;t know his own death, and bring glory to the heavenly people organization. Wong Su hummed in agreement and continued to ask, &quot;Are all the troops ready?&quot; Black Flame laughed, sheathed the sword in the stone, and said, &quot;Of course, of course.</p>
<p>This time, the master has really gone all out. With this troop configuration, I&#x27;m almost confident I can break into the top 100 in the official server, and he&#x27;s using it to fight a newbie lord.&quot; Wong Su drawled out the sound. Black Flame understood and hurriedly smiled apologetically. &quot;Brother, please calm down. I meant that our troops are extremely powerful.</p>
<p>How easy is it to get into the top 100 in the official zone? Wongu said dissatisfied. Young man, you still need to mature and gain more experience. Brother is right. Black Flame nodded and bowed as the two arrived at their own square. Looking at the neatly arranged and disciplined troops before him, Wongu nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>The celestial beings organization has really gone all out this time. You can only bring 1,000 troops, but here are 100 legendary gold troops and 900 epic troops. Haha, big brother. I knew the adults were being too cautious. 100 epic units are enough to wipe out all the lords in the entire newbie zone.</p>
<p>As a result, the adults gave me 100 legendary gold units and 900 epic units. I&#x27;ve never even dreamed of leading such a powerful army. When the topic of this unit came up, even Black Flame&#x27;s gloomy face lit up. I now have chapter 101 summoning new heroes of China, unparalleled Patriot. I now have 100 legendary gold level Templar knights, a fortress that is said to be impregnable.</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s also the longest range archer on the entire battlefield, the one who never sets in the world. This is a national treasure of the British Empire, Black Flame proudly declared. And then there are the dwarven mountain warriors, the best at mountain warfare. These are all epic level mountain warfare experts. They could easily surround Lynsha.</p>
<p>His cowardly turtlike posture is practically his own prison. The strongest ground spearman of epic rank, the Blazing Sun Spearman. The strongest epic level attack power, Ironclad Crusader. There are even epic assassin units specifically designed to counter Lin Xiao&#x27;s overalls archers and Gust archers. Which of these troop types isn&#x27;t famous and renowned? A force to be reckoned with on the battlefield among all races.</p>
<p>Even if the level cap is lowered to 30, who can fight in the newbie zone? The level cap in the newbie zone is 30. To be honest, the adults are being too cautious. Haha. Faced with the black flames ecstasy, arrogance, and even disdain. Wong Su simply smiled and shook his head, he felt the same way.</p>
<p>With these troops, we&#x27;re completely safe. Three heroes stood upright in front of a neatly arranged ranks of soldiers. And these three heroes, big brother, Black Flame explained. Neagano the Predator. My all-around strongest hero.</p>
<p>The sword saint of limitless swords. E the strongest one-on-one fighter. The master specially lent him to me temporarily. I refuse to believe that Lyn Xiao&#x27;s whiteclad hero can be stronger than him. And this esteemed Grandmaster of the Knights of Rome.</p>
<p>Black Flame bowed slightly in respect. This is the captain of the Golden Legend team, the Knights Templar, a Golden Legend hero. Rome. Wong Su also bent down, a esteemed Germanic hero of pure blood. Rome didn&#x27;t look to the side and nodded slightly in response, but Wong Su and Black Flame didn&#x27;t care at all.</p>
<p>The two were overjoyed to finally see the prepared troops and heroes. With this setup, I really can&#x27;t imagine who could beat me. Does your excellency wish to establish your prestige through a battle? Wong Su said. Chu Yusi and the others thought we would just use some rare and excellent units as usual, but they didn&#x27;t expect that the Lord would send out the most elite, epic, and legendary units. This time, we&#x27;re going to catch him completely offguard.</p>
<p>Besides you, there are many other bloodthirsty lords in the newbie zone, and I have already made arrangements for them. At least several thousand rare and superior units will cooperate to attack Lin Shiao and Chu Yuzi&#x27;s forces. My god, this is powerful. This time it could really wipe out the entire newbie zone. No, no, don&#x27;t wipe them all out.</p>
<p>The female lords in the newbie zone are quite a treat. After all, they&#x27;ve all just come of age. Haha. So, once we enter the newbie zone, we must be high-profile. Let everyone see how powerful we are.</p>
<p>Yes, brother. There are only two days left until the black flames descend. Night. The Lord&#x27;s Mansion at the entrance of Holian Mountain. As before, Lyn Shao sat quietly in the square, waiting.</p>
<p>Behind them stood a neatly arranged, disciplined army. At the very front were his own white-clad swordsmen, Pay Min, and the redroed female general, Chin Leonu. Next came the iron guards with long swords, the archers with divine arms, the white-shaped spearmen, the phantom archers, and the flower fairies. There was also a bewitching and beautiful bloodthirsty witch who stood behind the soldiers trembling with fear yet forcing herself to muster her courage. The three lords mansions is about to be completed.</p>
<p>What follows is recruiting three heroes, building stables, and fighting against the demonic tide. Then 2 days later, we&#x27;ll deal with the black flame. Of course, there is also a high probability that he will have to deal with Ding Li and many more novice lords bribed by the Celestial People organization. At the same time, Lyn Shiao is never arrogant, nor does he underestimate his enemies. He constantly calculated all his resources and possessions in his mind and planned for every possible loophole.</p>
<p>Lords all resources panel experience 68,759,462 over 60 million gold coins 5,876,910 over 5 million. Ever since she finally consummated her marriage with Baoi, she was in a great mood like a newlywed bride and a joke could often make her giggle. Now Ba chases after Lynn Shiao everyday. Let him tell a joke from a TV series. My mom is a jam.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m ashamed of myself. Zerum has also worked very hard this year. However, Lynn Shiao didn&#x27;t see any benefit from the ancient demon&#x27;s promise of 100 points of loyalty being broken. He planned to ask the ancient demon about it next time he met him. Treasure chest.</p>
<p>Excellent treasure chests, zero. Rare treasure chests, zero. Excellent treasure chest zero. Epic chests zero. Legendary treasure chest zero.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha opened all the treasure chests and they were mostly filled with resources and equipment. Nothing particularly outstanding. He gave the ordinary equipment to his subordinates and sold the rest. But he still couldn&#x27;t collect his own scale rock set. Props.</p>
<p>Two purple excellent quality defense runes. One blue rare quality hero token. Seven common recruitment tokens. Three rare recruitment tokens. One epic recruitment token.</p>
<p>Teleportation scroll three. Camp scroll two. Golden legend. Hashiatalu building blueprint one. Perspective symbol two.</p>
<p>Sky curtain symbol one. Lyn Sha used all the civilian talismans as soon as he got them. But he kept the recruitment talismans on hold, waiting to fill in any gaps. Equipment. No changes slightly.</p>
<p>The only difference was the addition of frost which had similar attributes to ashbringer and Lynn Shiao gave it to pay men to use. He himself wields the holy sword falin and the magic spear Bryan. Special battlefield energy of all races 8750. Resources absolutely no shortage. Details will be omitted if there are no special resources later.</p>
<p>Food not much absolutely no shortage. units. Iron guards with the MO Dao sword, all at level 15, with divine crossbows, all at level 15. There are 49 phantom archers, all at level 20. 34 White Spearmen, all level 15.</p>
<p>Hero, Sword, Saint Pay Min, level 15. Ba, level two. Chin, Leong, Yu, level 15. I have enough experience now to upgrade all my units and heroes to level 20, but I still need to save some experience for my tier three heroes and units. As for the equipment for the three heroes, it is indeed a bit scarce.</p>
<p>If it is a hero who uses a gun or a sword, I can lend him one of my own weapons. I still have a total of 11 recruitment tokens, which can summon 110 legendary golden units of China at any time as long as I have enough energy. The current energy level is 87,500. Hopefully, that&#x27;s enough because Lynn Shia wanted to set conditions, summon specific Chinese heroes. This attempt will be even bolder.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha went through all his resources again to confirm that everything was correct. Just then, the tier three lord&#x27;s mansion was upgraded. Ding. Lyn Shao, a player from the L Nan region of Blue Star Realm, has successfully upgraded to tier three, becoming the top tier three player in Lan region this year. System reward plus one hero slot.</p>
<p>System reward, one epic chest. The moment the announcement from the main god system sounded, Lyn Shia immediately stood up. Send a farmer to build a stable immediately. Then he took out a hero&#x27;s token. Exchange for Hashia token energy.</p>
<p>Consume one energy point to use the Hasha token. Huha summoning function to summon a Hasha hero. Hasha immediately deducts 1,000 battlefield energy points. Then Lynn Shiao continued, &quot;Continue to consume the energy of the battlefield of myriad races and set the conditions for this Hasha summoning. The description of the hero to be recruited is unparalleled hero.</p>
<p>Ding. Your Hasha token energy is insufficient. Chapter 10 O2. Sealing the wolf and dwelling in the wilderness. Not enough energy.</p>
<p>87,500 energy points. Enough for 87.5 regular summons. And you still don&#x27;t have enough. Hearing the system notification that the Hasha tokens energy was insufficient. Lynn Shia was not discouraged, but continued, &quot;The requirements for this Hasha summoning event have been changed.</p>
<p>The hero description to be recruited must be a paragon of virtue. Ding. Your hua token energy is insufficient. Lyn Sha broke out in a slight sweat. Just as expected.</p>
<p>The requirements for recruiting Han Xen and Li Jing were too high. One is a military genius, the other a military god. They certainly weren&#x27;t so easy to recruit. Even during the Lunar New Year, you might not have this luck. Let&#x27;s try again with two more candidates.</p>
<p>The requirements for this Hasha summoning event have been changed. The hero to be recruited must be Marque Wuan. Ding. The words used by Marque Wuan are incorrect. Please replace them with more relevant words described as human butcher.</p>
<p>Ding. Your Hasha token energy is insufficient. Lyn Sha returns. The requirements for this Hasha summoning event have been changed. The hero to be recruited must be described as the author of the art of war.</p>
<p>Ding. Your Hasha token energy is insufficient. Another failure. Lin Shiao tried all the people he considered to be in the top tier, but none of them worked. Time is of the essence.</p>
<p>The demonic tide is imminent. Then let&#x27;s use the second tier candidates. The requirements for this Hashia summoning event have been changed. The hero to be recruited must be described as fang juu. Ding.</p>
<p>Five people have been found who meet this requirement. Your hasha token energy is insufficient. Lynsha took a deep breath. Calm down. Calm down.</p>
<p>The condition is that there are five people involved, meaning all five are counted together. So, the Hasha order&#x27;s energy is insufficient. It&#x27;s not that the Chinese nation&#x27;s energy is insufficient as described in the phrase sealing the wolf and residing in the sue. In Chinese history, there were five people who achieved the feat of sealing the wolf&#x27;s lair. Let&#x27;s add another limiting condition to narrow down the scope.</p>
<p>Additional conditions for this Hasha summoning event. The hero to be recruited is described as follows. Condition one, Fun Langu. Condition two, the Shu have not been destroyed. How can I have a home? Ding.</p>
<p>Summoning successful. After Lin Sha finished speaking, a seven-colored light flashed, and a gate of light appeared in the territory. It&#x27;s done. A figure riding a white horse slowly stepped out of the portal. He was dressed in golden helmet and armor with a silver white fur trimmed cloak tied around his shoulders, fluttering and rustling in the wind.</p>
<p>He was tall and strong with fair skin and clear bright eyes. He was indeed a handsome young general. He held a long spear in his hand, sat proudly on his horse, and looked majestic. The golden armored young general tilted his head, and within seconds, the god system had fed him all the relevant information about the battlefield of the myriad races. He immediately dismounted and walked towards Lyn Shao.</p>
<p>Lynsha immediately went to meet him. This humble general, Hitsubing, pays his respects to your lordship. I am willing to serve your lordship. The young general in golden armor knelt on one knee and immediately swore allegiance to Lyn Sha. Great.</p>
<p>It really is Hoiting. Lyn Sha suppressed his excitement and helped up the hero he had painstakingly recruited. Then he thought to himself, &quot;Check Hoitsubings attributes. Marquee of championing. Race human.</p>
<p>Quality golden legend. Level level one. Attributes strength 60 + 12 spirit 60 + 12 constitution 42 + 8 soul 38 + 8 skills sealing the wolf&#x27;s nest drinking horses from the vast sea. Using war to sustain war supreme charm/heaven&#x27;s jealousy unrivaled courage raid cavalry command assess rank. Click to view.</p>
<p>Combat power rating 59 stars. Exclusive unit type all cavalry. His combat strength is rated 59 stars which is slightly above average. He is slightly stronger than Chin Leang Yu but not as strong as pay men. The body attribute is too low and the soul attribute is too low.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why Huubing died young. Lyn Sha thought to himself. Hitsubing should eat more spirit rice and spirit fish to nourish his body. Because he needed to prepare for the impending demonic tide, Lin Shiao could only briefly check a few skills. Finland Jakutsuing as the first person to create the strongest honor for military generals throughout history enjoys a lofty status among all soldiers.</p>
<p>Hitsubing and his troops deal 50% more damage to any non-han race. They deal 100% more damage to the race of any enemy that has severely harmed any race under the Lord&#x27;s command. An unprecedented sense of honor. The loyalty of the troops led by Huubing increased by 20%. Goodness, it directly increases the damage of the entire race.</p>
<p>In this world, only the Han Chinese exist, meaning that Hoitsubings damage to anyone he attacks is increased by 50%. If a certain race has seriously harmed him, will deal 100% more damage when he attacks them. This is twice as powerful as the abyss demon&#x27;s skill. No wonder it created the magnificent feat of sealing the wolf&#x27;s slayer. Unparalleled charm/heaven&#x27;s jealousy.</p>
<p>Hitsubing was 18 years old when he became a cavalry captain. He led 800 cavalrymen deep into the desert and twice achieved the greatest merit in the entire army and was in theft as the marquee of champion. His charisma not only captivated his subordinates but also his enemies. When Hitsubing persuades cavalry type enemies to surrender, the success rate increases by 50%. Hitsubing could lead any type of cavalry.</p>
<p>Negative impact. Hoitsubing was envied by the heavens and although he was healthy, he was always at risk of dying young. Seeing this, Lyn Shao sighed and shook his head slightly. Heaven is jealous of heroes. In short, Lyn Sha was extremely satisfied.</p>
<p>Yubing was simply the ultimate template for a cavalry general. It even included the only SS level commander Lin Shiao had ever seen. Cavalry command. SS level increases all attributes of all cavalry under your command by 100%. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Absolutely unbelievable. Subing, please rise quickly. Four general type heroes. The main god has changed their allegiance, making them naturally easy to recruit. Lyn Sha helped Huubing up.</p>
<p>What a fine young general. After saying that, he took a talisman from his own body and immediately hung it around Hoitsubings neck. Life protecting amulet quality purple excellent attribute increases constitution by 30 improving the wearer&#x27;s wound healing speed and body recovery speed. Introduction This is a talisman blessed by a necromancer. Its origins unknown.</p>
<p>No matter how weak a person is, wearing this life protecting amulet will grant them a physique comparable to a bison. However, never remove it lightly. The weakness experienced when leaving it will cause excruciating pain. The moment the talisman was removed, even someone as strong as Lin Sha felt a slight pain, but he still smiled and personally put the talisman on Hoitsubing in front of him. Hoitubing stood there dumbfounded.</p>
<p>He hadn&#x27;t expected his lord to pull this stunt right from the start. Have endured unparalleled pain to remove him. My lord Chu Bing, no need for further words, Lyn Shao said in a deep voice. I know you are brave and strong, but being brave and strong is what the soldiers expect of you. Taking care of your health is what I expect of you.</p>
<p>Hoing swayed slightly, then immediately knelt down on one knee again and shouted. Subing is willing to die for your lord. Ding! Your hero Hoyings loyalty has reached 100%, ready to go through fire and water. Lynn Sha nodded happily. You may die for me later, but to kill the enemy for me is the opportunity.</p>
<p>Chu Bing, the demonic tide is coming soon. I&#x27;ll recruit troops for you. Lyn Sha was about to take out the recruitment token and use the Hasha token to recruit cavalry when Upon closer inspection, he was horrified. Chapter 103. The Guan Ning iron cavalry makes their debut.</p>
<p>Upon inspection, Lyn Shao discovered that his hua order myriad races battlefield energy had dwindled to only 11,500. Just now, in order to recruit Huubing, I set certain conditions which directly consumed 76,000 battlefield energy. This general is really expensive, but worth it. 1,000 battlefield energy can be exchanged for one Hasha token energy and one Hasha token energy can be used once for Hasha summoning. My Lord&#x27;s Manor is only at level three and the demonic tide is about to strike.</p>
<p>The stables have just been built and will be completed in 48 hours. It&#x27;s too late to build hero specific buildings now. The best solution is to immediately use the recruitment token to replenish what Yubing&#x27;s troops. Hoits Yubing&#x27;s exclusive troop type was cavalry without specifying any particular type of cavalry. Any cavalry unit could shine under Hitsubs command.</p>
<p>I happen to have 11 recruitment tokens left. Should I use them all to summon soldiers in China and gamble on my luck? Are you betting that he&#x27;ll summon only cavalry? No. Although Lynn Shiao possesses the fortune to bring peace and prosperity to all generations and has great luck, he doesn&#x27;t want to gamble. Because luck manifests in many ways. If the 11 recruitment tokens summon 11 different golden legendary Chinese soldiers, Lyn Sha doesn&#x27;t know who could command them well in the absence of Han Xen or Li Jing.</p>
<p>After a moment&#x27;s thought, Lyn Sha decided to use only the simplest limiting conditions. He took out five recruitment tokens. Use Hwasha summoning to consume the energy of the myriad races battlefield and summon a Hashia exclusive unit limited to cavalry of the same type. As soon as he finished speaking, Lyn Xiaos battlefield energy was completely exhausted. As long as it&#x27;s a legendary gold tier cavalry unit, it can&#x27;t be bad.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao thought to himself. Iron Pagod, Iron Falcon, Bayway Army, Great Han Champion Cavalry, White Horse Cavalry, Tiger and Leopard Cavalry, or even the Eight Banners Iron Cavalry would be fine. As Lin Xiao&#x27;s voice fell, the five recruitment tokens rose directly into the sky, eventually becoming golden talismans engraved with apicious fivecolored clouds and patterned with mythical beasts at the bottom. The portal roared, and the sound of horses hooves approached. The lead knight leaped out of the portal and jumped out on his horse.</p>
<p>A tall imposing horseman clad in iron armor with a long sword at his waist, a lance on his horse, and a sword in his hand. Three-eyed musket. Ding. Congratulations on obtaining the legendary gold unit, Guan Ning Iron Cavalry. So it was the Guan Ning Iron Cavalry.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaos heart, which had been hanging in suspense, finally settled down. These knights rode their war horses forward with agility. One, two. Their war horses were tall and powerful, covered from head to body with studded cotton armor. The knights wore studded cotton armor on the outside, interlocking iron armor underneath, and iron helmets on their heads.</p>
<p>A breastplate was embedded in the cotton armor, revealing two iron armored arms. The knights were well equipped and complete, each carrying a bow, a quiver of arrows, a long sword, and a long spear. But the most eye-catching item was the long-handled three-barreled musket, which was more than 2 m long. The upper part was a musket that could fire three shots at once. After firing the musket, it could be picked up and used as a mace.</p>
<p>50 knights leaped out of the portal on horseback and instantly received information from the god system. The knights dismounted simultaneously, their movements perfectly synchronized. 50 knights lined up and came before Lin Shiao, kneeling on one knee. Greetings, Lord. Check the attributes of the Guan Ning Iron Cavalry.</p>
<p>Guan Ning iron cavalry. Lieng race human. Level one. Quality legend. Attributes.</p>
<p>Strength 35 + 7 spirit 28 + 6. Constitution 30 + 6 soul 10 plus two combat power rating 31 stars attributes added by skills equipment lord abilities etc are not included in the combat power rating skills peerless warrior spirit three-eyed musket breakthrough charge soldiers follow generals courage behind them the patrolman&#x27;s warnings rang out the demonic tide was surging in Lyn Sha knew there was no time to look at the skills and attributes of the Guan Ning Iron Cavalry. So he immediately waved his hand and upgraded Hoitsubing and the Guing Iron Cavalry to level 15. The Guing Iron Cavalry, &quot;Your future general is this man, Marquee of Champion, Hitsubing.&quot; Lyn Shao pointed and the Guan Ning cavalry looked at each other slightly taken aback. One of the lead knights raised his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, my name is Liing Long and I am the squad leader. Please enlighten us, your lordship, that marqueeing is a famous general of the Han dynasty, a hero in our hearts, and we will not allow anyone else to impersonate him. The Guan Ning Iron Cavalry is indeed unruly, Lin Sha thought to himself. But as long as the general is strong enough, the Guan Ning iron cavalry can be used very smoothly. Historically, the Guan Ning cavalry was more like a private army or household guards, only fierce when fighting alongside their lord.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha laughed and pointed to the side. This is the Tang Dynasty&#x27;s Mod Dao Wal weapon. He then pointed to the other end. This is a master archer from the Great Song Dynasty. Pointing to a spot not far away, he said, &quot;These are the White Spear soldiers from your era.</p>
<p>This is General Chin Leangu. Do you remember her? Now you understand, right? This is the battlefield where all races v for supremacy. The person before you is none other than the champion marquee, whose bravery surpassed that of the three armies thousands of years ago. The knights hesitated for a moment, then looked at the golden armored general standing in front of them. He had a handsome face, fair skin, and clear features.</p>
<p>He wore golden armor and a silver fur trimmed cloak, looking majestic and imposing. Although he was only a young man in his early 20s, his eyes were firm and he looked around with self-confidence, showing a unique charm. The knights finally realized that the person in front of them was indeed Hitubing. Greetings, Marquee Champion. The Guan Ning Iron Cavalry are willing to follow you to the death, my lord and marquee champion.</p>
<p>The knights shouted in unison. Hitsubing accepted the knights respect without hesitation. He was 100% loyal to Lin Shiao and naturally had no worries that Lin Shiao might fear his achievements overshadowing his master. Hoing incorporated the Guan Ning iron cavalry, instantly increasing all cavalry attributes by 100%. The demonic tide has reached within 500 meters of Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory.</p>
<p>My lord, allow me to fight the enemy and defend our country. Go everyone, follow me and crush the demonic tide. Hitsubing immediately led the Guan Ning cavalry away. With only 50 cavalrymen, their galloping momentum was like that of a thousand troops. Here, the iron guards of the MO Dao, the archers of the divine arm archers, the white-shaped spearmen, and the phantom archers are all ready to meet the first wave of the demonic tide.</p>
<p>This time there are still endless monsters and demonic creatures led by nest demons and abyss demons twice as many as in the second level. But Lynn shouted not see the onehorn brands. The demonic army is less than 200 m from the territory. Just as the archer was about to fire his arrow, he heard a whoosh of wind and saw a knight in golden armor leading 50 cavalrymen charging out into the demonic tide, accelerating relentlessly like a sharp sword. Killsubing took the lead, followed by all the Guan Ning cavalry who raised their spears and plunged them straight into the bodies of one demon after another.</p>
<p>Behind them, the iron guards with Modo Dao, a type of long-handled sword, and the White Pole spearman followed up, quickly finishing off the attackers and regaining their footing. The archers and phantom archers also rushed out of Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory, firing at one enemy after another. With the cavalry charging, the atmosphere instantly became heated. The Guan Ning cavalry plunged into the middle of the demonic tide with a whoosh, their momentum unddeinished. Then it pierced through the demon tide.</p>
<p>Then following Hoitzubing, they turned around again and continued their charge. Countless corpses of demons and soldiers flew into the sky. No one could stand against this cavalry army that had formed a charging formation. Chapter 104. A great defeat to the demon tide, shocking all sides.</p>
<p>Amidst the demonic tide, the Guan Ning iron cavalry is leading the charge. With the addition of cavalry, Lynhao&#x27;s army&#x27;s combat power has greatly increased. Lynho&#x27;s troops had completely taken their positions and were pushing back against the demonic tide. The Guan Ning iron cavalry are currently enjoying multiple skill bonuses from Hitsubing, including cavalry command, SS level, sealing the wolf mountain, drinking from the vast sea, and using war to sustain war, resulting in explosive attack power. They had never experienced such an exhilarating battle.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao had already seen the skills cavaler commander SS level and sealing the wolf and dwelling in the mount. Taking advantage of his free time, he clicked to check out the other skills. Drinking from the vast sea, Hoitzubing&#x27;s army was not afraid of the deserts of the north or the desolate Gobi Desert. They could unleash even greater combat power in specific terrains. Hitsubing and his troops have a 50% increase in movement speed, 50% increase in endurance, 50% increase in morale, and a 50% decrease in logistical supply requirements when operating on grasslands, Gobi deserts, wastelands, deserts, plateaus, plains, and ice fields.</p>
<p>Hatsubing was not afraid of getting lost. He could accurately find his target and was unaffected by the fog of war or various stealth skills. Lin Shao was very satisfied with this skill which included acceleration, increased battery life, reduced supply requirements, and satellite positioning. Moreover, its adaptability to terrain, including almost all flat terrain, is practically a stimulant for cavalry. Lynho&#x27;s territory is surrounded by mountain ridges, but the valley inside is quite large, practically a small plane.</p>
<p>Using war to sustain war, Hoitzubing was able to lead a small number of soldiers on a long-d distanceance raid of thousands of miles, which was inseparable from his outstanding ability to sustain war through war. Hoitubing and his troops kill enemies. They can gain more experience and gold coins. They can also plunder the enemy&#x27;s food, stamina, and energy, and under special circumstances, a health recovery mechanism will be triggered. Lyn Sha nodded secretly.</p>
<p>powerful too powerful. This is a skill that allows you to heal while fighting and it&#x27;s a group skill at that. As expected of Hortzubing, this wave of demonic energy is in the bag. Lin Shia was resisting the demonic tide. Countless people in the Lan region, various newbie zones, and Lord Mansions heard the announcement from the god system.</p>
<p>Ding. Lyn Shao, a player from the LN Nan region of Blue Star Realm, has successfully upgraded to tier three, becoming the top tier three player in Lan region this year. System reward plus one hero slot. System reward, one epic chest. In the 9527 newbie zone, Dugu Jalon&#x27;s delicate body trembled slightly as she broke free from her meditation, her gaze deep as she looked into the distance.</p>
<p>The female soldier next to her had her mouth agape wide enough to fit an egg. Marlene slowly attached the golden prosthetic arm, a slight smile curving her lips beneath the Valkyrie mask. In the 89757 newbie zone, Ding lays body trembled, his anus tightened, and he was so frightened that he dropped the long sword in his hand to the ground. He then looked around to make sure no one was watching him, shook his head, and slowly picked up the long knife, his face contorted with struggle. Finally, he gritted his teeth, his eyes growing even more determined.</p>
<p>In the same newbie zone, Chufingo was first stunned, then burst into laughter. He instinctively wanted to call Lin Sha, but worried that Lin Sha was currently fighting against the demonic tide, so he dialed Chu Yusi&#x27;s contact number instead. Julie Wong Bo and Pans Sha Yu were sitting together reviewing the gains and losses of today&#x27;s battle. Hearing the announcement, both Wong Bo and Pans Shan Yu wore expressions of shock. Only Julie sighed softly, revealing the way things should be.</p>
<p>In the same newbie zone, Tu Shawn by Chien, who was diligently gnawing on a chicken leg, heard the announcement and her eyes sparkled with excitement. She immediately entered the chat channel and while munching on a chicken leg, she happened to run into heay who had come online. The two exchanged a knowing smile and immediately began their battle of bragging about their boss. In the formal area, the man in the floral shirt lying between two voluuptuous bodies also heard the district-wide announcement. He was stunned for two seconds, then laughed dismissively.</p>
<p>He is indeed a genius, but unfortunately he is not my genius. I&#x27;ll give you hope for now. Two days from now, all that will be left for you is despair. In another large lord&#x27;s mansion in the formal district, Wong Su with his hooked nose was not wearing a mask and was drinking tea and chatting with Hi Yin. Upon hearing the announcement from the main god system, the two were initially incredulous.</p>
<p>They then looked at each other and burst into wild laughter. At the same time, an unprecedented massive amount of chat messages erupted in all the newbie chat channels. Someone has already successfully upgraded to a third tier university so quickly. Lyn Sha, as expected of Lyn Sha, that genius is back. Lyn Sha is awesome.</p>
<p>An endless sea of lava, black islands, and white palaces. The stunning succubus heard the system announcement through special channels. She suddenly stood up and kicked away the onehorned abyss demon who was kneeling at her feet drawing circles. What are you standing there for? Get to work. Huh? You&#x27;re going again.</p>
<p>Nonsense. If someone with your experience can&#x27;t handle it, how can he grow quickly? Your highness, I have an 800year-old mother to support and children to raise. Roll. Upon seeing the one-horned abyss demon, it scrambled to escape while the succubuses s lips curled into a breathtaking smile. She seemed to be in a good mood, and with a swaying cat-like gate, she turned and walked back to her throne.</p>
<p>The surging waves in front of her swaying with each step. Considering you&#x27;ve shown some integrity, this princess will let bygones be bygones for your mistake of seeking pleasure with other women. He he grow up quickly. Further a field, amidst a vast complex of westernstyle manners, lies a low-key palace that still retains its Chinese architectural style. A stunningly beautiful woman, aloof and elegant, bearing a striking resemblance to lonely Garan, but with a more mature appearance, received a call from Chui while dealing with piles of documents.</p>
<p>After hanging up the call, she let out a slight breath. I hope you can pull through this time. You&#x27;re just a new lord who wants to rely on yourself. My first prophet is never wrong. You are indeed a promising talent.</p>
<p>If I survive, I will see you in person. The current dragon kingdom desperately needs a top tier ranger lord, just as the prophet foretold. My hunch is always right. Brans is here again. Resisting the demonic tide, Lyn Sha inexplicably felt his left eyelid twitch several times in a row.</p>
<p>Then a gigantic one-horned abyss demon shattered the ground outside its territory and slowly rose from the flames. Prepare to die. Uh-uh. The abyss demon slowly emerged from the flames. But once he stepped out, he realized he had come to the wrong place.</p>
<p>There wasn&#x27;t a single demon around him. They were all iron guards with long swords, archers with divine arms, and spearmen with white pole. The abyss demon looked up and around. The demonic tide, which should have been locked in a stalemate before, had now been pushed back so much by the battle lines. I was only a few minutes late, and the demonic army was already down to 1/3 of its original size.</p>
<p>Beside him, tall soldiers clad in full armor, wielding long swords and spears, coldly stared at Brans. Brans had fought these soldiers a few times. They were a formidable force he had never seen in the real world. Brans estimated that their strength was at least epic. Bran&#x27;s cold sweat slowly trickled down his back.</p>
<p>Hey everyone, anyone interested in singing, dancing, and rapping together? The iron guards with Mo Dao and the White Spear soldiers immediately made way for them. Brans exhaled. Huh, what gullible humans. Then a sharp pain shot through his body and his entire enormous demonic form flew up. A troop of cavalry, swift as lightning and charging like arrows, slashed him from behind and sent him flying.</p>
<p>The leader, clad in golden helmet and armor, and a silver white woolen cloak was truly imposing and exuded an aura of dominance. Just as the abyss demon was about to land, another troop of cavalry blasted him away. and then another team. Five cavalry units accelerated to their maximum speed and directly inflicted severe injuries on the abyss demon. Poor Brans didn&#x27;t even get to say a harsh word before suffering a crushing defeat.</p>
<p>Bran&#x27;s body is about to disintegrate, returning to the demon realm. With his last breath, Bran shouted, &quot;Lynshia, her highness, the princess, asked me to deliver a message to you.&quot; She said, &quot;She&#x27;s the only one who can control you. There&#x27;s no chance you&#x27;ll sleep with her. The bloodthirsty witch Sherry hiding in her territory immediately perked up her ears. Lyn Shia, what nonsense are you spouting now? Chapter 105.</p>
<p>An unexpected visitor encounter. Bran&#x27;s roar carried far and wide. Immediately, his body shattered into fragments and then crumbled into ashes which were carried away by the wind. Lyn Sha shook his head. He knew that this guy might come back.</p>
<p>Neither Lynn Shiao nor the succubus princess knew the profound impact that this unreliable abyss demon shout would have on them shortly to come. After Brans was defeated, the already crumbling demon tide was quickly wiped out by Hortubing and the Guan Ning cavalry. In the beginner area, the monster level cap is 30. However, as Lyn Xiao&#x27;s golden legendary troops reach higher and higher levels, and his heroes become more numerous and powerful, even the Sclass demonic tide is becoming less and less of a threat. The announcement from the main god system came through.</p>
<p>You have successfully resisted the S-class demonic tide. Rewards are being calculated. Battle results. Annihilate the following enemies. Abyss demon special epic one.</p>
<p>Nest demon epic 5 violent demon excellent 235 fierce demon rare 856 bone demon rare 2687 horn demon fine battle duration 1 hour 15 minutes and 8 seconds our casualties zero special stacking s level demonic tide lord personally participating in the battle and the difference between the lords and troops levels exceeding 10 levels and special epic level boss in the beginner area. Rewards 754,682 exp,487 gold, 6,871 energy, two epic chests, two superior chests, three rare chests. Although the level three magic tide is almost twice as large as the level two magic tide, this time without Chow Chow&#x27;s spirit possession, the 100% bonus is missing. So, the gains can only be considered normal. However, there was at least one epic treasure chest left, and Lin Shia nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>This is basically a buy one get two free deal. Upgrading to level three gives you a golden legendary chest. And fighting the demonic tide gives you two epic chests. My goal of reaching level three and gaining one more hero has also been achieved. Theoretically speaking, we can recruit another Chinese hero right now.</p>
<p>However, on the system panel, Lin Shia discovered that he was currently unable to use the hero token. This suggests that the ancient demons may have already arranged for another hero to be on his way to their territory. I wonder who it will be this time. At that moment, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s communicator rang. It was Chufinga.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao immediately hung up and sent a message to Chufinga telling her to call back a little later because right now, Lyn Shia is about to open a treasure chest. First up, the epic treasure chest. Ding! You have obtained the epic weapon, divine might water gun one. Ding! You have obtained one epic quality recruitment token. View properties: Divine might water gun epic weapon quality orange epic.</p>
<p>Attributes: base attack power 620, strength + 10, constitution plus 30. Special attributes, sharpness, armor penetration increased by 30%, enemy penetration, damage to Japanese heroes, troops, and lords increased by 30%. Introduction. The divine might fierce water gun was forged by the Chinese hero Chiuan from a few rare and precious materials selected from countless spoils of war captured from Japanese pirates. The shaft is 9 ft long with the spear head being 1 ft and 3 in long and the tip being 3 in long.</p>
<p>It is made of fine steel mixed with gold and is extremely sharp. What a sharp epic weapon. Come to think of it, I now have two epic spears. After Bao&#x27;s luck value reached zero, my luck recovered somewhat. Next, let&#x27;s continue opening the golden legendary chests.</p>
<p>Ding! You have obtained the legendary golden weapon, demon sword. A pause. Signal interference is in progress. You have obtained the legendary golden weapon, Crimson Sky Sword. Lyn Sha was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Could this legendary treasure chest also interfere with signals? Was it the work of an ancient demon again? Cha. Lyn Sha suddenly realized. Isn&#x27;t this one of the 10 most famous swords in China? Check the attributes of the Crimson Sky sword. Crimson sky golden legendary poem weapon quality legendary lord exclusive attributes base attack power 880 strength plus 50 spirit plus 50 soul plus 50 special attribute concealed edge the crimson sky sword is always presented as an iron rod holding this sword can conceal one&#x27;s strength and weapon capabilities from the enemy&#x27;s detection when not drawing the sword physical and magical defense is increased by 50% and one is not afraid of mind control magic. Serpent slayer.</p>
<p>The crimson sky sword is also known as the serpent slayer sword and it increases damage against any reptile by 100%. Imperial way increases the holder&#x27;s battlefield luck by 100% and slowly increases the holder&#x27;s national luck. Introduction wielding a three-foot sword, he achieved unparalleled feats. Indeed, a fine sword. The 10 most famous swords of China live up to their reputation.</p>
<p>This is also the first gold legendary weapon I&#x27;ve obtained, and its attributes are really strong. With a great battle imminent, this sword will be like adding wings to a tiger. Since it was exclusive to Lords, Lyn Sha quickly glanced at Xihaos attributes and skills and then put it away. Having obtained a legendary weapon, Lyn Sha thought for a moment and then summoned Hortubing and Chin Leonu. One was a handsome man, the other a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>One wore a silver cloak, the other a red cape. One wore gold armor, the other silver armor. Both were dashing and heroic. One person is as kind and trustworthy as one&#x27;s own nephew. The other person is like your newlywed sister-in-law or like a high school beauty who just got divorced and doesn&#x27;t have a child on Earth.</p>
<p>In short, it&#x27;s that kind of alluring married woman vibe. Strange. Why would I make such an association? It must be a lingering effect of Munga&#x27;s spirit. This humble general pays his respects to the Lord. The two knelt on one knee at the same time, interrupting Lin Xiaos revery.</p>
<p>Suubing, Lyang Yu, I have seen your contributions, and you are both extremely loyal to me. Lyn Shiao said slowly. Suubing used his original weapon while Lyang Yu only used a rare long spear. That kid Pay Min already has two epic swords. I happen to have two epic spears on hand, so I&#x27;ll give them to you, too.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha took out his magic gun, Brianac, and handed it to Chin Leong Yu. He then picked up the newly activated divine might water gun and handed it to Hitsubing. Briona has a negative effect of minus 10 stamina, while the divine might water gun adds 30 stamina. How to allocate it is obvious. This humble general thanks you, Lord.</p>
<p>Lin Sha waved his hand and continued without any formalities. Zubing, Liang Yu, and Payman follow me to the war hall. Soldier Len, Tangg Yi, and Song Ruer are in charge of battlefield cleanup. The three heroes followed Lin Shiao to the war hall. Upon entering, everyone was aruck by the grandeur of the place.</p>
<p>But what surprised them most was a simulated sand table in the center of the hall. the maps and terrain of the real world at a one colon 1 1000 scale based on the maps explored by the lords. Fortunately, Lin Shiao had the opportunity to use the gods perspective when creating the sandbox in the warh hall. Therefore, the sand table at this moment centered on Lin Xiao&#x27;s Lord&#x27;s mansion covers an area of tens of thousands of square kilm. Not only is there the Calabash mountain range and Calabash Valley behind the Lord&#x27;s Mansion, which covers nearly 10,000 square kilm, but there are also various terrains, special buildings, monster layers, rivers, roads, and other Lord&#x27;s mansions all around.</p>
<p>It is accurate to the smallest detail without the slightest error. However, the sandbox is not updated in real time. It will only update automatically when it is updated within the Lord&#x27;s field of vision. Even so, having this sand table is equivalent to having complete control over all the terrain. My lord, with this sand table, we will be able to carry out our battles, ambushes, and surprise attacks with ease.</p>
<p>Deploying strong troops to guard certain strategic locations can make a single man able to hold off 10,000. Chinyu was an expert in mountain warfare. She couldn&#x27;t take her eyes off the sand table once she saw it. He leang Yu. This is also why I gathered everyone here to familiarize ourselves with the terrain.</p>
<p>In less than 2 days, the black flame will descend. We need to fully discuss his tactics and prepare for the worst. For the next 2 days, we&#x27;ll grind monsters and gain experience during the day and come here at night to discuss and analyze military situations. By the way, I&#x27;ll involve Ba as well. Her abilities shouldn&#x27;t limit her to just being a concubine.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao silently called out in his heart, and a moment later, a woman wearing a scarlet cloak arrived at the war hall. She lowered her hood, revealing a face that was breathtakingly beautiful, both ethereal and alluring. Her long black hair cascaded down her back. Her face was fair and flawless, as if sculpted from ice crystal. Her nose was soft yet straight.</p>
<p>Her lips were full and red, and when she blinked, her thick, interlaced eyelashes were like a brush. The other three heroes, regardless of gender, were also deeply moved when they saw this stunningly beautiful woman. My lord, my generals. Ba knelt down and bowed to the crowd. Ba, you&#x27;ve come at the right time.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s discuss military matters together. Lyn Shiao led everyone to the sand table, placed his hands on the edge of the sand table, and stared intently at the complex terrain in front of him. At that moment, Lyn Xiaos communication channel rang. Without looking up, he answered it directly. &quot;Fongu, what do you want with me?&quot; After a few seconds of silence, Lyn Shao looked up in surprise and saw a face as cold and aloof as a painting.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha, is this your reward? The beautiful heroine. Chapter 106. Special hero. O Y Ye Yzi. The expedition arrives.</p>
<p>Lynsha. Is this your reward? The beautiful heroine. A cool and elegant voice came from behind him. And Lyn Sha smiled. Dug Jalon.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so nice to hear your voice. My old squad leader finally had time to visit me. That was Dug Jon. In the video, she wears a light purple robe with a sword at her waist, looking ethereal and otherworldly, standing proudly like a fairy descended to earth, making it impossible to look directly at her. A purple robe fluttered in the wind, long hair cascaded down.</p>
<p>The purple dress was like a flower, and the long sword was whiter than snow. She possessed indescribable beauty, elegance, and noble refinement. Her fair face was charming yet aloof. Her beautiful eyes clear as water. Her thin lips were lightly pursed, pink and glistening.</p>
<p>And her every move exuded a cool elegance. Perhaps I came at the wrong time. It seems I&#x27;ve uncovered quite a few of your secrets. Dugu Jaolons gaze swept over Lin Xiao&#x27;s four heroes, lingering particularly on Bao Sea for several seconds before turning to the sand table in front of Lin Shao. Dugu Jaolon always spoke in a calm and indifferent manner which Lyn Sha greatly envied because subtle is the best tool for a lord to enhance his prestige.</p>
<p>No, you are always welcome. Dugu Lyn Sha shrugged and said, I trust Dugu. There are no secrets between Dugu and me. No secrets? Yes, just like Fong Goo and I. We understand each other without saying a word.</p>
<p>Those who understand understand. The two stared at each other silently for a few seconds across the screen. The atmosphere tense. Then the two of them burst into laughter at the same time. Huh? He after a few seconds of synchronized laughter, Lyn Sha spoke.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, what brings you here, Dugu? I have found more information about the celestial beings organization, and I am providing it to you. Dugu Jaolons smile faded, and he said. Chufunga refused to answer my calls, but only sent me your number. So I came to find you. Lynn Sha was deeply moved.</p>
<p>It turned out that Dugu Xaolan had taken the initiative to seek him out because of this matter. Thank you, squad leader. Lyn Shia deliberately included the word old to show respect. Um Dugu Jaolan spoke with a nasal tone. Thank you, Dugu.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia made a joke that wasn&#x27;t too big or too small and took the file that Doo Jaon was sending him. Although you have won against me again, this time you will soon face the black flames attack. Dugu Jaolon said solemnly. Don&#x27;t be careless. This enemy might be stronger than before for some special reason.</p>
<p>In short, be fully prepared. According to my intelligence, Chufunga, Joli, Wong Bo, and Pans Shan Yu are all from the city lord&#x27;s mansion. They will do their best to protect you this time and are your allies. In addition, I also learned something about Ding Lays relationship with the Celestial Beings organization. The remaining information is all about the military units of the Celestial Beings organization.</p>
<p>I believe you can understand it. Mm. Lin Sha nodded. Thanks. After a pause, Dugu Jaolon slowly continued.</p>
<p>Take good care of yourself. I really want to see you in the official area. Take care of yourself. I still really want to see me. Lyn Shao suddenly opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p>Um, let&#x27;s have another showdown. Dugu Jaolan finished writing all the words expressionlessly, then hung up the call. Really, to be mischievous? Even the usually aloof Dugu can be cheeky. Lyn Sha shook his head, but then he saw Baoi secretly watching him with a half smile. Hey, it&#x27;s not what you think, Ba.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not Daniel Wu, loved by everyone. All right, let&#x27;s take a look at the latest intelligence and then discuss and simulate the military situation. All the heroes understood the urgency of the situation. So they put away their jokes and started discussing it with Lin Shiao Pay Min who were present were all generals with a profound understanding of warfare. As they discussed the latest intelligence sent by Dugu Jaolon, they came up with many good ideas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no matter how you discuss it, Lyn Shao still has one major weakness. Insufficient manpower. On the day of the decisive battle, Lyn Shao only had 50 emo dao soldiers, 50 divine arm archers, 50 white pole soldiers, 50 Guan Ning iron cavalry, 49 phantom archers, and 130 flower fairies. But considering the flower fair&#x27;s combat strength, it was best not to have too high expectations. Besides that, Lin Sha only has seven recruitment tokens, which can recruit 70 soldiers, two epic recruitment tokens, and five other quality tokens.</p>
<p>But the enemy is likely to be 1,000 fully equipped level 30 units. Based on the information provided by Duga Jaolon, the quality is estimated to be quite high. Moreover, according to the latest intelligence, it seems that the celestial beings also developed an unknown number of bloodthirsty lords. There&#x27;s no way to get more recruitment tokens now. Lynn Sha shook his head.</p>
<p>Although he was certain he would receive a recruitment token if he sought help from Chu Yusi, Lyn Sha was unwilling. Then the only option is to improve the capabilities of different troop types while maintaining the same troop strength. But apart from the phantom archers, all of Lord&#x27;s troops are of legendary gold quality. How can they be upgraded? Quitsubing asked. There is still a way.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha looked at the task list in the war hall and his own blacksmith shop. There there are upgrade quests for the Mod Dao soldiers to improve their armor and upgrade quests for all troop types to improve their equipment. As long as the equipment of the legendary gold tier units is upgraded to the next level. Just then, Soldering&#x27;s voice came from outside the warh hall. My lord, a man outside the territory claiming to be O Y Ye Yzi requests an audience saying he is your personal hero.</p>
<p>O Yi Lin Sha was taken aback. Then his eyes lit up. My fifth hero is O Y Ye Yzi. It&#x27;s like a pillow appearing just when you&#x27;re sleepy. Come, let&#x27;s go and welcome O Y Yezi together.</p>
<p>Outside the territory, an elderly man with white hair but vigorous spirit stood quietly at the door. Lynn Sha led several heroes out and his hearty laughter echoed from afar. So it&#x27;s Master O Y Ye Yzi. Please forgive Lyn Sha for being late and welcoming you. When O Yi saw that the Lord did not send someone to lead him inside, but instead came out personally to greet him.</p>
<p>He was quite surprised. He quickly took a few steps forward and knelt down on the ground. This humble subject, oh Yzi, pays his respects to your lordship. Master, please rise. Lyn Sha has been waiting for you for a long time.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha has always been generous in showing respect to talented people and his sincere attitude caused O Y&#x27;s loyalty to soar to 90. Check O Y Ye Yzi&#x27;s attributes. O Y Ye Yzi race human Chinese. Quality golden legend special hero level one. Description: Blacksmith Master Type Special Hero.</p>
<p>No combat ability. Can train blacksmiths while running the blacksmith shop. Unlocks the forging of any standard weapon type of gold legendary. Requires resources. Unlocks any upgrade item below gold legendary level with reduced upgrade resource requirements by 50% and increases upgrade speed by 100%.</p>
<p>Obtaining a special golden legendary hero solved Lin Xiao&#x27;s predicament of not having a blacksmith. Moreover, you can now use O Y Yezi to upgrade the equipment of your troops. Lyn Sha was overjoyed and pulled O Y Ye Yzi into the territory where he treated him well. After making the arrangements, Lyn Sha led the five heroes into the war hall to discuss future strategies. Two days passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>That day, the system issued a regionwide announcement. Ding. Black flame, a player from the LN region, has broken through the region and descended upon the 89757 newbie zone. Target Lynsha. Due to restrictions imposed during the conquest event, the 89,757 beginner zone is locked and no player can enter the official zone.</p>
<p>The lock will be lifted once the 3-day conquest period ends or either black flame or Lin Sha is defeated. Above the beginner area, the light barrier shattered and a large number of people suddenly appeared at the sight of the former Lord Gene Dashangs mansion. A man of medium build with small eyes, thin lips, and a scar on his face stood in front of the lord&#x27;s mansion giving a cold smile. Black flames message in the chat channel. Lyn Shia, I&#x27;m here.</p>
<p>Just wait to die. Now you&#x27;ll all see the consequences of angering the celestial beings. Chapter 107. Ants in the newbie zone. Black flame is coming.</p>
<p>Announce your arrival directly to all the newbies in the chat channel. Ever since Lynn Shia turned the tide and regained first place in the three-year college entrance exam, the chat channel, which had been quiet for a long time, immediately exploded. It&#x27;s over. Lyn Sha is finished. Black Flame is really here.</p>
<p>How could a lord from the newbie zone possibly defeat a lord from the official zone? No wonder Lin Shia didn&#x27;t immediately go to the main area to hide after completing the third book. It turns out he was locked out of the area. Idiot. The god system has already patched such a simple loophole that allows you to enter the official zone by upgrading to level three. Otherwise, what&#x27;s the use of the descent talisman? Now we can only wait quietly for a few days until one side is killed and the game ends before it unlocks.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re still waiting for one of them. Isn&#x27;t that Lynn Shia? It&#x27;s a pity that it delayed my entry into the official zone. you. There are only three or four people in the entire Lon newbie zone who have successfully completed level 3. When will it be your turn? Speaking of Lyn Sha, why isn&#x27;t he coming out to answer? Is he scared by the black flames? Yeah, since we&#x27;re going to die anyway, we might as well say something tough.</p>
<p>Will this work? That way you can die with some dignity. Everyone, sigh, if you ask me, Lyn Sha shouldn&#x27;t have provoked Gene Dang in the first place. Even after Gene Dang brought in reinforcements, we should have given him face and let him go. If that were the case, this situation wouldn&#x27;t have happened. Seriously, he got himself into trouble by showing off too much.</p>
<p>Can&#x27;t you fight back if someone hits you on the head? Look at the power of Gene Duchang isn&#x27;t resisting just certain death. What a pity. The power ceiling of our 89,757 newbie zone has fallen. In the chat channel, everyone expressed their regret to varying degrees, but no one dared to say that Lyn Sha was a good for nothing anymore. Lyn Shia is usually low-key, but what he does is anything but.</p>
<p>In the beginner zone, players can only upgrade to level three. In the three upgrade competitions, Lin Sha won first place twice. On the second day after the server opened, two bloodthirsty lords were killed without a word. Dinglay, whom even the three top players in the other beginner area couldn&#x27;t defeat together, was taken down by Lin Shia with just one hero. Smash the abyss demon with one hand, turning the tide when the second tier universities were at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Every time someone thinks Lynn Shia is no good, he jumps out and proves them wrong. Now, no one dares to doubt his strength in the newbie zone. However, no one believed that someone with F-level talent could turn the tide again and defeat a player who had just arrived from the official zone, even if he has many secrets. After all, the success rate of defeating novice lords in the official server over the years has been 99.99%. And no one believed that Lynn Shiao was one in 10,000.</p>
<p>The win rate in the official server is almost 100% when playing against the newbie server. So why is it that most lords in the newbie server can still smoothly enter the official server as long as they survive? Because the cost of breaking through a new server is too high. Generally, only a few people each year would risk the enormous price of a formal server lord to hunt down a new lord. When everyone else was playing dumb, you were the only one who stood out. And now you&#x27;re reaping what you sowed.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve disliked that kid, Lyn Sha, for a long time. A moment of patience brings calm and tranquility. This old saying, whose origin is unknown, still holds some truth. Sigh. This time, Black Flame is only targeting Lyn Sha.</p>
<p>We as mere bystanders should just watch quietly from the sidelines without making a sound and naturally we won&#x27;t be accidentally hurt when people sighed ridiculed or mocked. Black flame spoke again. Lyn Sha, enough with the nonsense. You have offended the dignity of the celestial beings. You deserve to die.</p>
<p>Not only will you die, but those vassal lords who have come to you will also die. Your best friend is going to die. Your lover is going to die, too. Everyone connected to you must die. Your heroes and troops will all be wiped out by us.</p>
<p>The slaughter begins now. Everyone was stunned. Someone jumped out and asked timidly. Black flame boss, isn&#x27;t this a bit too harsh? Just punish the ring leaders. Isn&#x27;t that enough? Having connections with Lyn Shia? There are far too many.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve even bought items that Lyn Sha listed for auction. Yeah, Black Flame boss. Shut up. Black Flame interrupted. It&#x27;s none of your business to tell the heavenly beings what to do.</p>
<p>You ants and scum from the newbie zone don&#x27;t even have the right to speak to me. You are only fit to be fertilizer for the blood lord and human ships in the killing contest. The sudden insult stunned everyone in the newbie zone. This is blatant contempt and humiliation, but the newbies were helpless and didn&#x27;t even dare to talk back because Lynn Shia, who dared to ignore the threat, was a cautionary tale. Also, what is this killing contest all about? What is the blood lord all about? Just then, a discordant voice appeared.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a black flame. I think you&#x27;re the real fertilizer and scum of the official zone. Tan by Chen. Oh, what a show of power. Coming to our newbie zone to show off.</p>
<p>Did you get bullied by other experts in the regular zone? Maybe in the official area, we&#x27;ll have to lick other people&#x27;s stinky feet. I heard that the one who threatened boss Lin Sha was a masked man, but it was you who came down. Aren&#x27;t you just someone else&#x27;s little brother? What are you so smug about? My little sister is only slightly pretty, and I can&#x27;t even stand looking at her. At this moment, although the other novice lords still dared not speak, they were secretly pleased. Finally, someone dared to stand up and vent their anger.</p>
<p>Take another look, and it&#x27;s Heay and the pretty girl. Aren&#x27;t these two vassal lords of Lyn Shao? Everyone remained silent. Although they dared not be like Lin Shiao, they did indeed feel a little envious of him. Black Flame sneered. Good.</p>
<p>He and Tu Shan by Chian, right? I know you too. Your Liaos lackey. No matter how eloquent you are, today is your death day. He was not afraid at all. You won&#x27;t let me off the hook even if I say nice things.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;ll deliberately say things you don&#x27;t like. Come and hit me if you dare. Tu Shan by Chin also said, &quot;Our territory is near boss Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory, so you can take it all at once. Come on over if you dare.&quot; A poor attempt at provocation. Black Flame continued to sneer.</p>
<p>&quot;So, you just want to lure me into your ambush and launch a surprise attack. Ridiculous. A lion would fear a hair&#x27;s trap.&quot; Black Flame said, &quot;Today, I will show you what it means to be utterly ineffective in the face of absolute power. Dinglay go.&quot; The words fell. Ding.</p>
<p>Player Ding Lelay has created a live stream room. Ding. Contestant Xiao Lelay has created a live stream room. Fight. Several people created live streaming rooms at the same time.</p>
<p>In the live broadcast room, banners fluttered and soldiers were everywhere. Behind Ding lay alone, there were dozens of lords leading more than a thousand troops. Orc veterans, human crossbowmen, lizard riders, all rare unit types, plus many exceptional units. Looking at other live streams, there&#x27;s a minimum of 1,000 people in each one. Four live stream rooms, and more than 5,000 soldiers suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>They were all fully armed and arrogant. &quot;These ants in the newbie zone are all peripheral members under the observation of my celestial being organization,&quot; Black Flame said coldly. Let me tell you a secret. They are all bloodthirsty lords and each of them has the lives of other lords on their hands. These bloodthirsty lords and their troops alone are enough to wipe out the rest of your lords.</p>
<p>So I can kill whoever I want without needing to reason with anyone. If you don&#x27;t want to die, stay away. Huh? But hiding doesn&#x27;t guarantee survival. After all, the area is locked for 3 days. After killing Lynn Shiao, I might not be able to control my restless lords.</p>
<p>Be careful. Many people will die. Blame Lynn Shiao. This live stream will be visible not only to the 89757 newbie zone, but to the entire Lon region. Let&#x27;s use the blood of Lin Sha and everyone connected to him.</p>
<p>The blood of your 89757 newbie zone to make everyone remember. From now on, the reputation of the celestial beings organization will resound throughout the entire dragon&#x27;s summer domain. He I&#x27;ll gladly accept your flower fairy. It&#x27;ll be a good opportunity to taste the different flavors of creatures. Should it be deep fried or steamed? Tan, I&#x27;ve heard you&#x27;re quite beautiful.</p>
<p>I hope you won&#x27;t disappoint me when you&#x27;re beneath me later. Chapter 108. The war begins. Ambush probing. The chat channel was completely silent.</p>
<p>Black Flame had just appeared and hadn&#x27;t even shown its forces yet. Just by pulling out the backup troops for development, there are several thousand soldiers. Dozens of lords have already surrounded Lin Xiao&#x27;s Calabash Mountain Range. They started several live streams at the same time to demonstrate their power. The threat from the Black Flames was still ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>No one dared to speak up and advise Black Flame in the chat channel anymore. Instead, they silently entered the live stream room, watching the powerful army and talking in hush tones. Holy crap, Black Flame and the others are serious. How come there are so many bloodthirsty lords in our district? How many classmates have been silently murdered? At that time, I thought the difficulty had increased this year and the death rate for newbie lords had risen again. These bloodthirsty lords have rare troops as their base and many of them are also excellent troops.</p>
<p>I really don&#x27;t know how Lin Sha will resist these thousands of troops. And there&#x27;s also Boss Dinglay. Boss Ding Lay is actually in Black Flames gang. Boss Dingle is with more than a dozen bloodthirsty lords. With Ding Lay joining the team, Lin Sha has even less of a chance.</p>
<p>Who doesn&#x27;t know that Ding Lay as fighting ability is second only to Lin Sha? Wait. Oh no. We&#x27;ve been scammed. Dinglay supposed to be a killer of bloodthirsty lords. How come he&#x27;s hanging out with them now? Some people in the live stream started to get emotional.</p>
<p>Dingle, I thought you were on the side of us, the weak and vulnerable lords. I never expected you to turn around and side with the blood lord. You owe us an explanation. Dingle, what&#x27;s wrong with you? I used to be a fan of yours, cheering you on. The tall figure standing silently on the hillside also saw the doubts in the live broadcast room.</p>
<p>He simply pursed his lips, stared straight ahead, and remained silent. Behind Dinglay, a fat man with a face full of scars couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. Who the hell is making that noise? In the live stream, the lords, who were indignant, immediately confronted the fat man. The fat man glanced at the live stream and happened to see a lord whose ID was not hidden. He sneered and summoned a hero.</p>
<p>Go kill this guy. Dinglay was shocked to hear this. He immediately turned around and tried to grab the fat man, but saw that the fat man shadow fiend hero had vanished in an instant. Make him stop. Ding.</p>
<p>Player Shia Jun from the 89757 newbie zone has been eliminated. The shadow fiend hero returned shortly afterward, his hands covered in blood. The fat man shoved Ding Lay hard, ignoring Ding Lay&#x27;s fierce glare, and gave a cold laugh at the live stream camera before falling silent. The live stream room seemed to fall into a deathly silence. Dinglay took a deep breath and drew his long sword.</p>
<p>Attack! Under the watchful eyes of hundreds of thousands of spectators, dozens of lords led thousands of soldiers in a siege against Lin Shiao. Oh my god, that was terrifying. Yao Yao run. Eay also entered the live stream room. He switched between several live stream rooms, confirming that none of them were places he could afford to offend.</p>
<p>He quickly determined the direction of the enemy&#x27;s attack from the screen, immediately signaled to Tu Shawn by Chen, and ran away. If you hadn&#x27;t been so arrogant and started broadcasting live, I wouldn&#x27;t have known that more than a thousand soldiers were already near me. He led 200 flower fairies and fled, arriving at the designated location in no time. Large breasted Lolita wearing animal ears, a white Lolita dress, and white stockings is riding on a centaur warrior waiting for him. He&#x27;s a How come Black Flame has so many soldiers? There&#x27;s no way we can fight them.</p>
<p>The attractive girl complained. We originally wanted to lure a small group of soldiers into an ambush to relieve some pressure on boss Lin Sha. Now that&#x27;s bad. Any random squad has over a thousand soldiers. The 300 soldiers we painstakingly gathered aren&#x27;t even enough to fill a tooth gap.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to fight? He hurriedly said, &quot;Boss Lin Shia didn&#x27;t involve us in this campaign. It was all part of our own plan.&quot; Boss Lin Sha sent a message. He suddenly realized, &quot;What did you say? The boss told us to run.&quot; &quot;No, we have to help our boss.&quot; Tu Shan by Chin protested. Boss Lin Sha has saved us several times. How can we cower in such a critical moment? That saved you several times, didn&#x27;t it? He whispered.</p>
<p>In short, we still have 300 troops, all of them elite and rare. Combined with our special talents, we can hold our own against them. Tu Shan by Chin said righteously, &quot;Being able to deplete the enemy&#x27;s forces and kill a few bloodthirsty lords is also a contribution to our leader. My goodness, aren&#x27;t you supposed to be a master of strategy? Hay shouted. With such a disadvantage in troop strength, do you still want to be a micromanagement master? No, we absolutely have to help boss Lyn Sha.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not going. Run away. As the two struggled, a chilling, agonizing laugh drifted from afar. Stop arguing and stop running away. A hideous deformed monster emerged from the shadows.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can&#x27;t escape. Immediately, more shadowy monsters emerged. There are nearly 200. Tuchan by Chin and Heay&#x27;s expressions changed drastically. It&#x27;s a vengeful spirit, a superior level creature, a natural-born lurker and assassin.</p>
<p>RT. Meanwhile, Dingle led dozens of lords and over a thousand soldiers directly to the flank of the Calabash Mountains. Everyone remember this. Our mission is to block the entrance to the Calabash Mountain Range and trap Lin Shiao like a turtle in a jar. Someone will naturally deal with Lin Xiao&#x27;s vassel lords.</p>
<p>Some people also went to deal with Julie and his group, Shufunga and his group, and Lin Shiao himself. The Black Flame Lord will personally oversee the operation, making it virtually foolproof. Do as little as possible in other matters. Avoid creating unnecessary complications. As soon as Ding Lay finished speaking, the burly man behind him let out a disdainful sneer.</p>
<p>Hey, our Ding Lay, even after his epic weapon was stolen, he&#x27;s still so impressive. Do you know why you were sent to block the entrance? It&#x27;s because you&#x27;re a loser. Dinglay suddenly turned around, his desire to kill someone no longer concealed. The burly fat man was fearless and responded to Ding Lay with a look of disdain. Sitting in the Lord&#x27;s manor, eating the valley specialties handed to him by Baoi, Lyn Sha saw this scene in the live broadcast room, and couldn&#x27;t help but narrow his eyes with amusement.</p>
<p>Run. Uh, as the last vengeful spirit was cut down by the centur chieftain, these spirits, who had thought themselves hunters, all died as prey with nowhere to be buried. Phew. I have to say the elite troops are really strong. Tan by Chin said, hands on her hips.</p>
<p>My little sister almost got herself into trouble. Fortunately, we&#x27;ve dealt with 200 exceptional unit vengeful spirits, which is a good start, he said happily. Pretending to have only 300 troops, we actually have 600 plus a near epic level centur chieftain in the newbie zone. Defeating 200 wraiths is a piece of cake. Knowing that our strength wouldn&#x27;t attract the main force of Black Flame, we targeted the outskirts and corners of Black Flame from the start.</p>
<p>Pretend we&#x27;re arguing and deliberately lure out the scouts sent out by the Black Flame faction to attack us. Girl, you really are a big- breasted and smart girl. Too Shawn by Chin smiled sheepishly. He I don&#x27;t know how Brother Chufinga suddenly found me and gave us so many recruitment tokens to support us and told us to keep it a secret. I have to help the boss, but I also have to keep it from him.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the only way. We&#x27;ll use the same trick again later to lure Black Flame&#x27;s reconnaissance units into our trap. Kill as many as you can, even blinding Black Flame is good. Good. Chapter 109.</p>
<p>The consequences of angering a powerful force. In another live stream, a massive bloodthirsty Lord army with 3,000 troops marched ahead of Ding Lays forces, pushing forward in a mighty imposing manner. They had passed through the deserted territory of Tu Shan by Chin and Heay and effortlessly destroyed everything in the territory. The Lord&#x27;s manor, the spirit fields, the houses, the warehouses, the tavern, everything was destroyed in an instant. He and Tu Shan by Chian had already led all the troops and farmers to evacuate, but the losses to their territory were real.</p>
<p>After this battle, they would probably find it difficult to recover. This is what happens when you become Lin Xiao&#x27;s lackey. The Bloodlords party announced loudly, then continued on its way. Following their marching route, their next destinations would be the territories of the Jolie, Wong Bo, and Panch Shan Yu. Then we can advance directly to Hulu Pass.</p>
<p>Their team is the main force of this blood lord battle. Dingle is merely a reserve player and a scapegoat. Xiaoi Lei, who was in charge, had a faint, cold smile on his lips the whole time. He was not at all surprised by the sudden appearance of the three julie people in front of him. These are the three so-called geniuses who were defeated by Ding Lay alone.</p>
<p>Xiao IL sneered. No matter how strong your individual abilities are, you think your 600 soldiers combined can fight against our 3,000. A genius is about to fall. The three members of Julie exchanged glances, said nothing, and with a wave of their hands led their heroes and troops forward. Xiao snorted coldly, and charged forward with the Lord behind him, engaging in a fierce battle with the three members of Julie.</p>
<p>The largest direct battle in the newbie zone to date has now broken out. Countless viewers held their breath, staying in the live stream room without daring to blink. Meanwhile, another group of bloodthirsty lords arrived in a grand procession from the flank at the foot of the outer edge of the Calabash Mountains. As seen in the live stream, most of these more than a thousand units are lightly armed. And there are also some flying units.</p>
<p>Harpies, gargoyless can fly. Executioner is a mountain savage skilled in mountain warfare. The viewers of the live stream roughly understood the team&#x27;s plan. And while they were speculating, several sinister and bloodthirsty lords led these fastmoving troops to the foot of the mountain. At their command, all the infantry began to climb the ridge.</p>
<p>Flying units then took the lead to scout ahead and reconoider. Finally, someone in the live stream couldn&#x27;t help but speak up. This is it. Their team is planning to infiltrate through the Calabash vein and disrupt Lin Xiao&#x27;s rear. This is not just about disrupting the rear.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about launching a surprise attack on Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory from the rear, leaving him unable to defend himself on both ends. Another person added, &quot;This is a blatant sneak attack. Koko is live streaming herself swaggering over mountains and valleys to launch a sneak attack. That&#x27;s just too unbelievable. How unbelievable.&quot; Lyn Shiao is just one person with at most a few vassel lords.</p>
<p>How many soldiers could he possibly have? Several thousand troops launch a frontal attack. Over a thousand reserveists block the way. And over a thousand flank and launch a surprise attack. Even if he understands this, so what? Can he spare troops to deal with it? If he were watching the live stream, he might have already panicked by now. This is psychological warfare, this person analyzed.</p>
<p>Moreover, most importantly, the main force of this expedition, Black Flame, has not yet revealed its unit type, and it hasn&#x27;t personally taken action yet. H! Everyone gasped in astonishment. How could such a lowly henchman possess such power? Is the celestial beings organization truly invincible? Lyn Sha hasn&#x27;t shown his face since Black Flame appeared. Has he given up resisting? It seems Lyn Shao is really finished this time. He hold the east flank.</p>
<p>Tan by Chian s delicate shout came from behind. All centaur warriors charge with me one more time. After saying that, Tu Shan by Chin mounted the centaur chieftain and charged forward again without hesitation. Just a few minutes later, Tan by Chin returned looking disheveled. Girl, all right, let&#x27;s retreat.</p>
<p>You did a great job. He also led the remaining half of the flower fairy legion back. With these 600 troops, we have already eliminated more than 500 enemy reconnaissance troops. If we continue fighting, we will be completely wiped out. The troops that come are getting stronger with each attack.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t keep up with them. Tu Shan by Chian pondered for a few seconds, then nodded emphatically. All right, retreat immediately. The two men leading the remaining soldiers quickly retreated through the pre-arranged secret passage. However, after running only a few hundred meters, a dense swarm of enemies appeared in front of the secret passage.</p>
<p>What? Tu Shan by Chian was about to escape with Heay through another path when they encountered the enemy again. The pursuers behind them caught up at a leisurely pace. They&#x27;re surrounded layer upon layer totaling several hundred soldiers. They cornered Heay and Tu Shawn by Chin in a dead end with no way to escape. Now the two have less than 300 soldiers.</p>
<p>He he pretty girl, weak-willed guy, didn&#x27;t you two have a good time just now? A cold laugh came from a blonde man with tattoos on his neck. Keep fighting. You think it&#x27;s so great that you killed over 500 of our scouts. The blond-haired man first slowly instructed his subordinates to start a live stream. He walked out with a butterfly knife dangling from his hand, wearing ripped jeans and a nonchalant air.</p>
<p>Several bloodthirsty lords followed behind him. We deliberately waited until now to start our live stream just to capture you two alive. Did you really think those scouts died in vain? You are killing them and we are also pinpointing your location. Now surrender obediently. You, the weak kidney man, will be strangled to death by boss black flame.</p>
<p>But you, the pretty girl, can have some fun before you die. Tu Shan by Chian angrily replied. Don&#x27;t even think about it. Heay murmured. When did I become a man with kidney deficiency? Everyone glanced at Heay&#x27;s deep dark circles, but no one spoke.</p>
<p>Hey, that&#x27;s Smokey eye makeup. Superior. With a wave of his hand, the blond-haired man ordered all the soldiers to swarm forward. He and Tu Shan by Chin could only grit their teeth and fight the remaining troops against Huang Mao. However, their troops were inferior in both quality and number to these bloodthirsty lords.</p>
<p>So, their defeat and capture were only a matter of time. In the live stream, someone sighed softly. This is the price of angering a powerful force. Over there, it&#x27;s 3,000 against 600. The main force is almost annihilating the Julie forces here.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s 600 against 300, and the fate of the pretty girl will soon be revealed. More than a thousand people have already reached the top of the mountain and will soon enter the interior of the Holian Mountains. Dinglay still has more than a thousand reserve players. Black Flame, he hasn&#x27;t made a move yet. This person&#x27;s words resonated with everyone.</p>
<p>Regret, ridicule, disdain, and pity filled the live stream and chat channels. After this battle alone, I doubt anyone will dare to offend a major power again. Someone summarized it as follows. Joining major organizations to save your life is the only way for a novice lord to survive. The ruthless and merciless lord like Lynn Shiao has ultimately become a legend.</p>
<p>At that moment, a sudden change occurred. Chapter 1. Epic units debut. Lyn Shia makes his move. On the chaotic battlefield, Xiao Ela stood quietly on the outside as if the soldiers fighting bloody battles had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>As one of the strongest lords in the outer organization of the celestial beings besides Ding Lelay, he is only level 12 so far. The opposing Jolie, Wong Bo, and Panch Shan Yu. Xiao Lelay estimated that they had reached level 15. Similarly, the level of their own troops is also lagging behind the troops led by these three top players, but victory had inevitably tilted in their favor because of an overwhelming numerical advantage. Pans Shanus hero, Spider Prince Nicholas, used a shadow explosion to kill a Blood Lord hero, but he was immediately attacked by several other heroes and died in less than half a minute.</p>
<p>Wong Bo, a member of the Julie tribe, personally went to the battlefield and killed several soldiers, demonstrating his powerful personal combat ability and living up to his reputation as a genius. However, he was also covered in wounds. Of the main force they brought, less than 300 remained. If it weren&#x27;t for the fact that the nine Lee still had 10 powerful, epic quality units, head hunters, holding the fort, they would have been defeated long ago. Xiaoi Lay sneered disdainfully at the live stream audience.</p>
<p>Everyone, the game is over. After saying that, he commanded the reserve troops around him to prepare to enter the battlefield, wanting to make a decisive move. So-called geniuses are nothing more than this. The forces behind you haven&#x27;t even given you the support you deserve. If that&#x27;s the case, why not just die? With your heads on my hands, I&#x27;m guaranteed a place in the celestial beings organization.</p>
<p>No sooner had the words left his mouth than a loud shout came from afar. Who says there&#x27;s no support? A red-haired lord led several hundred soldiers in a charge. Xiaois eyes turned cold. Who are you? Tell me my name and I&#x27;ll give you a fright. I am Chufinga.</p>
<p>You are Chufinga. Xiaoi Lelay was taken aback, then burst into laughter. I was looking for you, but you&#x27;ve really delivered yourself to my doorstep. Julie, Wongbo, Little Cutie, Project 2. Chu Funga shouted, and hundreds of soldiers charged straight into the blood lord&#x27;s army.</p>
<p>A few hundred soldiers, and they&#x27;re already this arrogant. Do they think they&#x27;re God? Xiaoi Lelay was muttering to himself when suddenly his eyes narrowed. Chufinga&#x27;s hundreds of soldiers charged into the enemy ranks, unstoppable and unstoppable. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that this group of soldiers were all elite berserkers, and it seems they&#x27;ve already reached around level 20. Berserkers are the elite of the elite units.</p>
<p>The 500 strong Berserker Legion, facing the Bloodlord&#x27;s army, composed primarily of rare units and supplemented by superior ones, unleashed formidable combat power. They were fearless. Their movements were synchronized and none could stop them. Xiao didn&#x27;t have time to think much and immediately led his reserve team to join the battle. Just then, the ground collapsed and a hole appeared on the other side of the battlefield from which hundreds more berserkers crawled out.</p>
<p>The group of dozens of men leading the group were tall and burly with tattoos on their faces, wearing black cloaks and bare-chested with huge beast teeth around their necks. They were actually epic quality berserkers. Panther berserkers. They were the ones who dug the tunnel and led the soldiers to hide here. The panther berserker leading several hundred elite berserkers plunged into the blood lord&#x27;s army from the flank.</p>
<p>Xiao was shocked. Calling for help. Dinglay quickly bring your troops to support us. The Julie group who had been focused on preserving their strength immediately launched a full-scale counterattack. In an instant, the forces were still 1,000 against 2,000, and the blood lord held the advantage.</p>
<p>But with the addition of a large number of excellent and even epic units by Chufinga, the situation was instantly reversed. Everyone in the live stream was shocked. Has this turned the tables? The blood lord was caught completely offguard and is about to lose. Julie and Chufunga actually have dozens of epic spotted leopard berserkers and hundreds of excellent berserkers. Speaking of which, why are these bloodthirsty lords targeting Julie and his group? And why did Julie and his group cross over to our region? I heard someone say that it&#x27;s because Jolie is Chuong Ji&#x27;s good friend and Chuongu is Lin Xiao&#x27;s good friend.</p>
<p>Later, I found out that the person who told me the news was a bloodthirsty lord. I&#x27;m grateful he spared my life. The blood lord is their enemy, so the intelligence should be reliable. I see what true friendship. How enviable.</p>
<p>I also hope to have friends like that. The new lords were all young people who had just come of age and graduated. They were at the age of being a bit immature and rebellious. When they saw such a passionate event, they couldn&#x27;t help but cheer for Chufinga and the others. Go for it, red-haired kid.</p>
<p>Go for it, long-haired Julie. On the other side, he who was surrounded had only a few dozen soldiers left under Tu Shawn by Chian&#x27;s command are now reduced to less than 200 due to the flower demons self-destruction and Tu Shawn by Chian&#x27;s occasional attacks by transformed demonic beasts. The butterfly knife gritted his teeth. You actually have such strength. Then I won&#x27;t capture you alive.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll just kill you all. After saying that, he tossed the butterfly knife aside, put it in his pocket, and called to the two heroes beside him, &quot;Let&#x27;s go.&quot; The man drew a long sword and charged forward in one stride. But at that moment, the rare hero beside him suddenly grabbed his neck from behind and stabbed him in the back, the knife protruding through his chest. The butterfly knife coughed up blood and turned around in disbelief. Your loyalty level was 70 points.</p>
<p>How could you betray me? He did not betray you. I let him die a quick death. Rare hero said in a low voice as if it came from his belly. The butterfly knife stared in astonishment as his rare hero slowly transformed before his eyes. It transformed into a creature with only a pale face.</p>
<p>There were no organs on that face. &quot;You You are the faceless one. You got it right. Here&#x27;s your reward.&quot; The faceless one said in a low voice, grabbed the man with the butterfly knife, and suddenly pulled out the sharp blade that had pierced through him. The man collapsed, spitting blood.</p>
<p>Another hero next to the man was still in shock and didn&#x27;t know what had happened when another soldier suddenly attacked and pierced through the stunned hero with a single shot. This seemed to trigger a signal and dozens of soldiers mixed in with the besieging Hay Tan and Bai Chians team suddenly turned around and attacked killing their comrades. Everyone in the live stream was stunned. The faceless one. It&#x27;s the faceless one.</p>
<p>Among the heroes and troops of these bloodthirsty lords, there are quite a few faceless ones lurking. Someone exclaimed, &quot;This is an epic level unit, elite spies of the demon race. They can transform into any human form. Faceless ones, demons, who&#x27;s coming to the rescue of the pretty girl and the guy with kidney deficiency. The live stream chattered excitedly.</p>
<p>And Heay and Tu Shan by Chian were also astonished. They had originally planned to end their lives in a dramatic way. Who knew that someone in the enemy ranks would suddenly betray them? And someone was even shouting about the Faceless Ones or something. This rekindled their hope of survival. He tu Shan by Chian over here.</p>
<p>A hurried voice called out. The two looked over and saw that it was Chun Ningming. He wielded a black wind axe and hacked his way through the enemy lines. Chin Ningming, what brings you here? Tu Shan by Chin asked, both surprised and delighted. The boss sent me to rescue you.</p>
<p>Hurry up. Kill all these people and we&#x27;re leaving. The boss? The faceless one is the boss. He&#x27;s eye sparkled. I knew boss Lin Sha wouldn&#x27;t abandon us.</p>
<p>Chun Ningming chopped down a panicked, bloodthirsty lord in front of him with a single axe blow, and the live stream was immediately shut down. But everyone heard what was said. The Faceless One is actually Lin Xiao. Lin Shiao has made his move. Chapter 11.</p>
<p>The Templar Knights make their debut. An invincible force. Lin Shiao made a move. The Faceless One is Lin Xiao&#x27;s. The 20 Faceless Ones, an epic unit skilled in assassination and mixed among the blood lords troops, caused astonishing destruction with Chun Ningming suddenly leading troops to their rescue.</p>
<p>The blood lords were immediately routed. To everyone&#x27;s astonishment, Chun Ningming along with Hiz and Tu Shan by Chien charged left and right, quickly killing all the bloodthirsty lords and soldiers who came to besiege them. Only a few lords escaped with their lives. Boss Black Flame, help. Lyn Sha has a backup plan.</p>
<p>He has infiltrated a faceless one among us. The monkey was ambushed and is dead. The pretty girl and the weakwilled guy have already broken through and escaped. Useless thing. Black Flame spoke coldly in the chat channel.</p>
<p>Useless. All of them are useless. Looks like I&#x27;ll have to take action myself. Ding. Contestant XX has started their live stream.</p>
<p>Ding. Contestant XX has started their live stream. Several live streams opened in succession and Black Flame coldly spoke. Let you country bumpkins in the newbie zone see how the truly powerful units in the official zone crushed the enemy. Countless viewers flocked to the live stream.</p>
<p>My god, this is cavalry. Black flame brought cavalry. What a formidable cavalry force. From the perspective of the live stream, a cavalry regiment slowly accelerated. The cavalry regiment was small, numbering around a 100 men.</p>
<p>Their ranks were neat, and their flags were shining. Each of them rode a magnificent and imposing steed, its head clad in a mask, its breastplate hanging in front, its body covered in chain mail, and its body covered in a heavy horse coat. On the horse&#x27;s coat, the white background with a bright red cross is eye-catching. The knight was covered in shiny plate armor, wore a helmet with a face shield, held a shield in his left hand, and held a lance more than 3 m long in his right hand. The knight&#x27;s tunic and shield also bear the same white background and red cross symbol.</p>
<p>They marched in neat formation, slowly accelerating as they crossed a gentle hill. The knight in charge was clad in magnificent full body plate armor with intricate designs and exquisite patterns along with his horse. Preparation. At the command of the commander at the forefront, all the knights simultaneously lowered their face armor. The armor was thick and the knights could only see through a small gap in their visors.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there were no gaps. Charge. The war horses accelerated once more, their thunderous hoves shattering the wilderness and shaking the earth. The steel torrent had taken shape. Even at such a high speed, the knights remained perfectly organized as if they were one unit without the slightest disorder.</p>
<p>All the knights simultaneously lowered their lances, the massive lances pointing straight ahead. The entire nightly order was like a sharp sword flying forward at breakneck speed. And the knight commander at the very front of the procession is the very edge of this sword. They&#x27;re heading to Chufinger&#x27;s place. Someone suddenly realized what was happening.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the live stream, the knights had already climbed over the earthn slope beneath their feet. Below the slope, Chuunga, Julie, and the remaining bloodlords were engaged in a chaotic battle. So, Black Flame had prepared its troops all along, just waiting for this moment. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, the entire nightly order had already crossed the hill. The heavily armored knights, who were already sprinting at full speed, became even faster on the gentle downhill road.</p>
<p>The knights marched straight toward the battlefield like thunder. Chufinga, leading his 800 berserkers, was suppressing Xiao Elas rare troops, reducing Ziao Ela and other bloodlords troops to only a few hundred. Hearing the thunderous sound of hoofs, he turned around and saw a heavily armored cavalry charging towards him. Damn it. Retreat.</p>
<p>Zia Lelay turned his head and saw the approaching cavalry regiment. He couldn&#x27;t help but smile. Harah Lord Black Flames reinforcements have arrived. Chufinga Julie, you&#x27;d better leave your lives behind. Xiao immediately ordered his troops to focus all their efforts on keeping Chufinga&#x27;s berserkers at bay and preventing them from escaping.</p>
<p>Over here, I&#x27;ve held them off quick. Hurry up. It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re here. They&#x27;re over there. Before Xiao could finish speaking, he was slammed into the sky by the knights who showed no signs of slowing down and his body shattered into several pieces.</p>
<p>Ding! Player Xiao has been eliminated. Before the soldiers behind him could react, they too were knocked down and crushed by the knights. Then the sharp knights cut into the battlefield from one end and charged out from the other without hesitation, directly clearing a vacuum zone in the battlefield. The knights charged out of the battlefield, slowly turned around and prepared to charge again at the command of their captain. The viewers in the live stream were stunned.</p>
<p>Hey, Xiao Lelay is still leading his troops in a fierce battle with Chufunga, Julie, and others there. The Knights of Black Flame, ignoring them completely, charged straight in. Black Flame is truly cold-blooded. Huh, useless trash should be eliminated. At least it held off the enemy before it died, so it had some value.</p>
<p>Black Flame&#x27;s arrogant words suddenly rang out. Our celestial beings organization does not accept trash charge. As Black Flame finished speaking, the knights turned around and their perfectly aligned formation didn&#x27;t even need to be rearranged before they launched their second charge. RT Chufinga pulled Jolie, Wong Bo, and Pans Shan Yu back quickly while his dozens of leopard berserkers and the remaining elite berserkers quickly lined up to prepare to meet the enemy. Where are our troops? Without us, there are no troop bonuses.</p>
<p>How can we win? Pans Shan Yu was about to return when Chufunga and Jolie, without saying a word, quickly helped him up and ran away. As Chufunga and his companions led the heroes in a frantic escape, the knights behind them once again formed an iron torrent, charging straight down. Roar! The Berserkers roared in unison and swung their giant axis. The next second, the Berserker Legion was mercilessly torn apart. Blood and flesh flying everywhere.</p>
<p>The Berserker didn&#x27;t even manage to strike the heavily armored knights before being pierced by an oncoming lance. Roar! The Panther Berserker, being an epic unit, continued its fearless attack even in its final moments. Some berserkers swung their giant axes and hurled them at the knights. Some berserkers broke off the spears embedded in their bodies and used the broken spears to block the knights and their war horses. Someers, bleeding profusely, still leaped forward, intending to fight with their fists and teeth.</p>
<p>However, in the next instant, the unstoppable cavalry continued to advance straight ahead. The knights in the front row drew their long swords, and the knights in the back row raised their lances, riding their heavily armored warh horses and mercilessly crushing the Berserker Legion that was fighting to the death. We can&#x27;t win, Chufinga said in a low voice. From the moment this nightly order emerged, we had already lost. We must escape immediately.</p>
<p>Soldiers can be recruited again if they die. But if the Lord dies, he is truly dead. Several hundred berserkers blocked the fearless charge of the knights while Chufinga and his companions fled with the heroes and a small number of remaining soldiers. Those who cannot win will undoubtedly lose. Suddenly, someone side in the live stream.</p>
<p>From the moment the Knights Templar appeared, the battle band of these few people was destined to be destroyed. Everyone fell silent. The Knights Templar. Suddenly, someone noticed the key point in that sentence. How did you know it was the Knights Templar? He he I have been fighting in other worlds for many years.</p>
<p>How could I not know the famous golden legendary unit, the Templar Knight? Everyone was stunned. Upon closer inspection, it became clear that the speaker hadn&#x27;t hidden their ID. The displayed name was Gene Wuang. Gene Wooang. You were the ancestor of the Gene family, one of the chief lords representing the Huasha domain in the ninth heaven.</p>
<p>The ancestor of Gene Dang. He he is indeed this old man. But who is Gene Dang? Chapter 112. The explanation of the Gene family ancestor. Who is Gene Dang? It&#x27;s Gene Dang, the one Lin Sha killed.</p>
<p>So it was that good for nothing collateral descendant. Gene Wuang sighed, muttering to himself. I gave away too many amulets. The patriarch of the Jean family. It&#x27;s actually the patriarch of the Jean family.</p>
<p>The audience in the live stream gasped in surprise. The Gan family patriarch has returned to the dragon summer domain. He&#x27;s back in the dragon south region. Can we watch the live stream directly? Is the Gan family patriarch going to deal with Lynn Shiao personally? No. I merely returned to L non with an avatar simply to see what this kid Lin Sha is capable of.</p>
<p>Gene Wuang said Lin Sha is a junior not worth me personally dealing with. Someone recalled the conversation when Lin Sha killed Gene Dang in front of Gene Wuang and suddenly asked, &quot;Ances of the Gene family, does this clone of yours have any fighting ability? Of course not. What&#x27;s it to you? The Gan family patriarch struck where it hurt angrily said.&quot; Youngsters, just enjoy the fight. My ancestors health is none of your concern. After a few seconds of silence, everyone tacitly changed the subject.</p>
<p>Ancestor, why do you say that once the Knights Templar are deployed, Chufinger&#x27;s troops will undoubtedly lose? When Gene Wuang saw someone asking for advice, he said, &quot;The Knights Templar are one of the three most powerful nightly orders in Europe. In our Dragon Sia, only a few people have the authority to recruit them. The Knights Templar are marked by a white background with a red cross. You can see that on the horses, the knight&#x27;s shields, and their cloaks of this 100man war band, there is only a conspicuous white background with a red cross. They were all fully armored, and every knight was a master of defense, melee combat, and spearmanship.</p>
<p>Their horses were also hybrids of monsters, strong and fearless. Gene Wuwang side. Although the Templar Knights do not have the same super high bonuses in the hands of the Orthodox European powers as they do in the hands of the Dragon Sea people, their status as a gold legendary unit alone is enough to crush all units below the legendary level. In the ninth heaven, I sometimes fight alongside the European nations and sometimes I clash with them. But as long as any one of the three great nightly orders sends out their troops, unstoppable.</p>
<p>When the Knights Templar appear, no one can stop them. With just a few simple words, the audience in the live stream was captivated and deeply impressed. Amidst the shock, someone sighed. I never expected that the celestial beings would send out their most powerful legendary gold unit to deal with a mere newbie zone lord. This is quite a large undertaking.</p>
<p>Gene Wuang also agreed. The Celestials, a small and shabby organization that was just on the run a few decades ago, has now developed to such a state. This time, it&#x27;s not just about killing Lin Sha, but also about declaring our strength to the world. Someone in the live stream asked curiously, &quot;Ances, aren&#x27;t you with them? Me?&quot; He he even their leader, Hu, Dawei, is not qualified to ask me to do it. Do you have any temper knights under your command, Ancestor? you.</p>
<p>Gene Wuang shouted, &quot;Don&#x27;t pry into the affairs of your elders here.&quot; After four rounds of attacks, the Templar Knights have wiped out all the Berserkers. They didn&#x27;t even spare the heroes and troops of their own bloodthirsty lords. All 100 Templar knights survived and scathed, suffering only minor injuries and some weapon damage during the Panther Berserker&#x27;s desperate counterattack. The entire battlefield was littered with corpses and rivers of blood. Did the secondary target escape? The knight at the very front of the order lifted his visor, revealing a handsome western face with blonde hair, blue eyes, and a high nose.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all right. That&#x27;s Ding Lays reserve position. He can&#x27;t run away. Mr. Rom was exceptionally brave, annihilating thousands of enemies in a single battle.</p>
<p>With Mr. Rom here, we can easily take Lin Xiao&#x27;s head. A loud voice rang out and a man of medium build with small eyes, thin lips, and a scar on his face, slowly walked out. He wasn&#x27;t wearing a helmet, but rather a full suit of black armor, which was constantly emitting elucory flames. Clearly no ordinary item.</p>
<p>Needless to say, everyone knows that this is Black Flame. Black Flame was accompanied by two heroes. One of whom had black skin, dreadlocks, and a bare upper body with muscles so strong they looked like they were about to explode. The other hero was tall and slender, dressed in a green cloak and robe with a long sword at his waist. He wore a seveneyed green glowing gaze piece on his head, making him look both strange and menacing.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the Wuji Sword Saint E. The knowledgeable patriarch of the Gene family explained directly in the live broadcast room. This is an extremely powerful epic quality hero in the official zone whose one-on-one combat ability is even stronger than many golden legendary heroes. I don&#x27;t recognize the other My Little Pony. Just as everyone was about to question what Gene Wuang meant by Rainbow Pony, they saw that following behind Black Flame were squads of elite soldiers.</p>
<p>There were spearmen, swordsmen, archers, dwarven warriors, and a unit that seemed so elucory as if it didn&#x27;t exist. These soldiers were all exuding a murderous aura and arrogance, clearly extraordinary. With the Templar Knights, who just appeared, the entire legion of a thousand men is now present. It&#x27;s over,&quot; the Gene family patriarch muttered to himself. &quot;We&#x27;ve really lost out by sneaking out this time.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s hardly any interesting back and forth fighting before it&#x27;s about to end.&quot; Leaving aside the 100 legendary gold quality Templar knights, the remaining 900 troops are all epic quality units. How is Lynn Shiao supposed to fight them? Epic units, 900. The audience in the live stream was shocked. Black Flame also spoke at this moment. Lyn Shia, you did a good job.</p>
<p>With just your lackey and a few cronies, you defeated half of my bloodthirsty team. I must admit, I underestimated you a little. But now, I&#x27;m going to take it seriously. Now, everyone, listen up. I, Black Flame, will show you the power of the Celestials.</p>
<p>Here, I have 100 holy knights of legendary gold quality. There are still 900 epic level units. All of them are level 30. Lyn Sha, what do you have to fight me with? Courage. Black Flame immediately gave the order.</p>
<p>200 dwarf warriors stepped out of the ranks and headed towards the flank of the Calabash Mountains. Some viewers with better geographical knowledge immediately realized that these dwarves intended to cross the mountains directly and attack Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory. The other 100 archers, each wielding a giant bow nearly 2 m long, quickly turned and pursued Chufinga. All troops attack. Raise Lynho&#x27;s lord&#x27;s manner to the ground.</p>
<p>The remaining 700 soldiers formed a large battle group and slowly advanced towards Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory with Black Flame leading the heroes to join them. Dinglay, I&#x27;m giving you a chance to get revenge. Quickly hand over the heads of Chu Funga, Julie, and the others. Meanwhile, Dinglay led over a thousand soldiers on a march, walking at the very front with a blank expression. Hurry up, Dinglay.</p>
<p>Otherwise, they&#x27;ll escape. A fat man with a face full of scars shouted behind Ding Lay, accompanied by Shadow Fiend. He was already a little excited by the current situation. After Black Flame appeared, the situation was in a sure win, and the fat man was eager to take credit. Remember this, on the battlefield, there&#x27;s only one leader.</p>
<p>Dinglay suddenly turned around and roared at the fat man. As a former bigwig, Ding Lay exuded doineering aura, leaving even the chubby guy who had always been at odds with him speechless. &quot;Form ranks before you advance,&quot; Dinglay said angrily. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be caught off guard again.&quot; No one noticed the fleeting determination in Ding Lays eyes. Chapter 113.</p>
<p>The Epic Legion shocks everyone. On the battlefield, Black Flame led his brightly colored legion forward slowly. The heavy footsteps echoed through the live stream, reaching every viewer. Such a powerful pressure. No wonder it&#x27;s a legion with all legendary and epic units.</p>
<p>Black Flame merged several different live stream perspectives into one large live stream. All viewers can simultaneously see the movements of the various legions of the Black Flame Legion. At this moment, everyone realized that Black Flame had actually arranged for people to be stationed a few hundred meters away from the entrance of Linhaos territory at the entrance of Calabash Pass and opened a live broadcast view, pointing at his gate from afar. At this moment, the walls of Lin Xiaos territory stood high, the gates were tightly closed, and there was no movement. Everyone looked from other perspectives.</p>
<p>Dinglay led over a thousand soldiers in neat formations towards Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory. At this pace, they would soon encounter the fleeing Chufunga and his companions. More than a thousand bloodthirsty Lord troops who had started climbing the Calabash Mountains earlier were like mountain savages. They had now successfully climbed to the top of the mountain and were about to descend and rush into Liao&#x27;s rear. 200 dwarf warriors also arrived at the foot of the Calabash Mountains and quickly climbed the mountain.</p>
<p>If they succeeded, they would follow the climbing route opened up by the blood lord to enter Lin Xiao&#x27;s rear, adding fuel to the fire for Lin Shiao, who was already in a difficult situation. The 100 archers were incredibly fast. They were about to encircle Ding Lays army. The remaining 600 warriors under Black Flames command, including 100 Templar Knights marched slowly toward the main gate of Linia&#x27;s territory with an imposing gate. The atmosphere grew increasingly tense.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Lin Shiao had no way to avoid the final battle with Black Flame. The number of viewers in the live stream surged again, reaching hundreds of thousands. ancestor of the Gene family. You just said that apart from the Templar Knights, the rest are epic units. Do you recognize all of these units? He You guys didn&#x27;t study your academic subjects well, you&#x27;ll suffer when you go to war later.</p>
<p>Gene Wuang said, &quot;Of course, I know them all. The Black Flame Legion&#x27;s Vanguard consists of 200 Sunfire Spearmen, an epic level unit known as the strongest spearman on land. If I remember correctly, one of their skills is scorching sun. Under the scorching sun, these spearmen can focus a sliver of the sun&#x27;s power onto the tip of their spears, unleashing a devastating attack when they strike the enemy. One is sun protection, which gives sun spearmen a 20% bonus to all attributes when fighting under the sun.</p>
<p>One is the cavalry buster, which will not waver or fear when facing cavalry charges and increases the damage to cavalry by 20%. This type of troop was originally trained to counter the three major nightly orders. Although it was ultimately proven that it was still no match for the heavy knights, no cavalry under the three major nightly orders could match it. Black flame is preventing Lin Sha from upgrading to level three and recruiting cavalry. Looking at the blazing sun, the scorching spears of the spearmen, their orderly ranks, and then at the sun high above the battlefield of all races.</p>
<p>Everyone understood that on the battlefield today, the blazing sunspearman could utilize all his skills and fight at his peak. As for the second formation, there are 300 iron wall crusaders, a very famous unit that once led several major crusades that clashed with the Abbassad caliphate for hundreds of years. They were chain mail and wield broadswords possessing both defensive and offensive capabilities. Apart from their slow movement speed, they have virtually no weaknesses. Gene Wuang slowly said, &quot;What impressed me most was their skill, dual sword style.</p>
<p>When attacking the enemy, they can unleash two swift consecutive slashes dealing tons of damage. The crowd erupted in uproar. As expected of an epic unit, none of them are weak. Hulu Pass, Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory. Inside the war hall, Lin Shiao projected the live stream onto the screen, holding the materials given to him by Dugu Jaolon while introducing them to everyone in the hall.</p>
<p>Following behind are 100 shadow lurkers, which are almost formless units. A natural assassin and killer, his abilities at night are no less than those of my faceless men. Even during the day, he can unleash 80% of his power. They have a few skills to watch out for. One of which is shadow jump, which allows them to jump from one shadow to another within a certain range to launch a surprise attack.</p>
<p>The other is block. If a ranged unit attacked by the shadow lurker at close range continues to use ranged weapons, the shadow lurker will have a 100% critical hit rate against it. Song Rui turned his head, exchanged a glance with Tang Yi, and said, &quot;It looks like they&#x27;re targeting weak- ranged units like us.&quot; Tang Yi laughed heartily. &quot;Everyone knows that Guster the Archer is just as fragile as the Phantom Archer when the fight starts. Be careful not to twist your fist or crack your hand,&quot; Song Rui said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>&quot;I almost couldn&#x27;t put away the 40 m long broadsword.&quot; Lynn Sha continued, &quot;The troops that went after Chufinga were the famous British long bowman. I remember memorizing the world&#x27;s number one, the number one range when I was in school. This epic unit was the one with the longest range.&quot; Lyn Shaide, every long bowman on the sun never sets begins training at the age of 13, and only the most outstanding ones can go to the battlefield at the age of 20. They can draw a 2meter long bow with a maximum range of 300 m and can penetrate most armor on the battlefield of all races. These long bowmen are famous throughout the world.</p>
<p>While most archers can only shoot about 100 m, the long bow is like a sniper rifle, both long range and accurate. Even flying a kite can kill most of the enemies. The downside is the common weakness of ranged units. Weak in melee combat and moderate movement speed. Everyone fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Song Rui and Tang Yi exchanged a glance, but Saul Lin was nowhere to be seen. Pay Min stubbornly asked, &quot;My lord, what is a sniper rifle? A shooting device capable of hitting targets at a range of at least 1,000 m.&quot; Song Ruer, whose only visible feature was his eyes beneath the iron helmet, gasped for breath, while O Yzi, who had been dozing nearby, snapped his eyes open instantly. My lord may provide a more detailed explanation. Oh, Yzis eyes lit up. Well talk about this after the war is over.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao said, &quot;My lord, what does flying a kite mean?&quot; Payman asked again. It means keeping your distance from the enemy while shooting and running. Quitsubing replied, &quot;When I fought against the Shiong new, their mounted archers also used this technique. Your analogy is very apt, my lord.&quot; Lin Sha nodded in satisfaction, glanced at Pay Min as if to say, &quot;We&#x27;re both generals. Why do you only possess brute force and are not as good at fighting as Houbing?&quot; Payman shrugged and Lynn Sha continued.</p>
<p>The troops heading north of the Holian Mountains consist of 200 mountain dwarf warriors. This is an epic dwarf specializing in mountain warfare whose status among the dwarves is only slightly lower than that of the mountain king and rune master. Their skills include mountain warrior, resistant skin, burrowing, treasure hunting, mining, and heavy drinking. Wait, the last few don&#x27;t seem like combat skills. Lynn Shiao couldn&#x27;t continue speaking while Chin Leong Yu across from him smiled beautifully, but she forced herself to remain serious as the battle was about to begin.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, I see you&#x27;re smiling.&quot; Lyn Shao glared at Chin Leong Yu and said, &quot;Long Yu, take your white pole, spearman, and proceed according to the original plan. Let these mountain dwarfs see who the true king of the mountains is.&quot; Lean Yu obeys. Chin Leong Yu clasped her hands in a fist salute, her fiery red cloak billowing as she hurried away. All right, everyone. Lyn Shia clapped his hands.</p>
<p>Soul Darren and Chin Leon, you have already taken the lead. Now it&#x27;s your turn to step forward and join me in eliminating the foreign enemy and upholding the glory of China. I am willing to serve my lord. The soldiers responded loudly and marched out of the war hall in unison. only Baoi, clad in a cloak, looked at Lin Sha with teary eyes, &quot;My lord, I couldn&#x27;t be of much help.&quot; &quot;No, you are the most important link.&quot; Lyn Sha reached out and grasped Ba&#x27;s soft hand, saying gently, &quot;Lend me the fortune within your body.&quot; Having said that, he pulled Baoi into his arms.</p>
<p>Chapter 114. Desperate situation. Lynn Shiao summons the spirit of an emperor. &quot;Careful!&quot; Chufunga shouted and shoved Wong Bo aside, then rolled on the spot. Ju Lee and Pan Sha Yu, who were standing nearby, also heard the sound of something cutting through the air and immediately dodged.</p>
<p>Swish, swish, swish. Arrows rain down. Oh. The fleeing Berserkers were caught off guard and riddled with arrows falling from the sky. It&#x27;s archers.</p>
<p>The archers are catching up. Chufunga continued to pull the people off the ground and said, &quot;Speed up. Keep running. Chufinga&#x27;s remaining dozen or so leopard berserkers and the head-hunting master from Julie turned around forming a fragile defensive line to try and stop the pursuing archers. Why can&#x27;t I see anyone? Just then, another volley of arrows flew in long parabolas, falling swiftly straight down.</p>
<p>Ah! Another scream of soldiers falling to the ground. &quot;Let&#x27;s give it our all.&quot; The heroes of Chufunga and his companions were inspired. And in order to protect their lord, they stopped fleeing. My lord, the enemy must have used a speed boosting spell to catch up. We must stop them, but please leave immediately.</p>
<p>Good. Chufinga didn&#x27;t say much and continued his escape. Behind them, another volley of arrows rained down. With this range, could they be long bowman from the British Empire? The fate of the heroes and the remnants behind him was already sealed. Chufinga gritted his teeth and sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>In the end, they still couldn&#x27;t lure out the main force of the black flames. The mere presence of Long Bowman did little to alleviate the pressure on Lin Sha. As he pondered, a large group of people appeared ahead, and Chufingas expression grew even more serious. Dingle, not far ahead, there was Ding Lay and the blood lord&#x27;s army. Did you see that? This is the power of an epic unit, the undying long bowman.</p>
<p>In the live stream, Gene Wuang excitedly said, &quot;A shooting range of 300 m is roughly equivalent to a lap around the soccer field in your school. It would take you students with poor physical condition more than a minute to run that distance. Even if the cavalry chases after them, they&#x27;ll take several arrows. Armor-piercing arrows can completely penetrate the vast majority of armor.&quot; Chufinga and the others have no chance of escape. The audience in the live stream fell silent.</p>
<p>Head hunter master and panther berserker were also epic units, but they were wiped out by a volley of arrows before they even saw the enemy. Before they could charge forward, the hundred long bowman had already slaughtered all of Chufinga&#x27;s heroes and the remaining soldiers. The unparalleled long bowman&#x27;s incredible range deeply impressed them. A sense of powerlessness pierced everyone&#x27;s hearts. Dinglays troops also blocked Chufunga and his group at this moment.</p>
<p>Careful. A snow white fox spirit called out. Chun Ningming flipped over to avoid the harpy s attack, then turned around and killed the harpy who had ambushed him with an axe. They&#x27;ve caught up. They&#x27;re here to intercept us.</p>
<p>He shouted, &quot;Harpies, gargoyles. Those mountain climbing troops have spun off their flying units specifically to deal with us.&quot; &quot;I know,&quot; the fox spirit said crisply. Run this way. The bloodthirsty Lord Legion that crossed the mountain dispatched 300 flying units specifically to pursue Tu Shawn by Chien and her companions. By T Shawn by Chien, who had transformed into a demon, the small team of only a few dozen people charged left and right, dodging and moving forward along the mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although the epic faceless ones are very powerful, they are basically ineffective against overwhelming numbers and aerial attacks from flying units. The pretty girls won&#x27;t be able to escape either. Someone in the live stream side, it was said that although these people were weak, they still had some guts. What a pity. He&#x27;s going to die here, too.</p>
<p>They can&#x27;t escape, Gene Wuang commented. The Faceless Ones are unable to deal with flying units, and none of them have archers. Rare quality harpies and excellent quality gargoyles alone could wear them down. Besides, the dwarf mountain warriors have caught up with us. Well, someone in the live stream side.</p>
<p>Chufunga and the others have been surrounded, and Zay May and the others have also been intercepted. All of Lyn Xiao&#x27;s helpers are in dire need of their own safety. Lyn Shiao himself is left with only a lone force about to be wiped out by the black flame. He&#x27;s in a desperate situation. For some reason, faced with the overwhelming power of the Black Flames, everyone began to feel a sense of sympathy for Lin Shiao and his group.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s because Lin Shiao dared to defy powerful figures. Perhaps it was Lyn Xiao&#x27;s freespirited nature that they envied. Perhaps it was because Lin Shiao had attractive younger brothers like Heay who were willing to take risks for him. Perhaps it&#x27;s the friendship between Lin Shia and Chufinga. and between Chufinga and the Julie group forged through life and death together.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the arrogant attitude of the black flame and its disdain for the lords of the newbie zone that led to this. Perhaps it was just the collective feeling of shared misfortune that made everyone at this moment all the fellow novice lords sympathize with Lin Sha. As an orphan, he struggled to survive alone in the dragon kingdom. Bearing the name of a genius in Jangdong, he shone brightly during his school years. But a talent test revealed that he was a good for nothing.</p>
<p>Entering the battlefield of all races, they successfully turned the tide and won first place twice. But then they provoked a behemoth they shouldn&#x27;t have messed with. His life was filled with such effort yet also such despair. After releasing Baoi, whose face was flushed red, Lynsha took a deep breath. After Ba&#x27;s loyalty reaches 100, you can take her down and unlock the ability fate transfer.</p>
<p>Last night, an ancient demon secretly told me this in my dream. It can temporarily seize the luck of everyone on the battlefield and transfer it to a close person. Lyn Shia drew his Crimson Sky Sword, his eyes flashing. All my troops and heroes are already at level 20 and the Guan Ning Iron Cavalry has been replenished to 100 men using recruitment tokens. The energy of the 10,000 races battlefield has been almost completely exhausted.</p>
<p>The remaining two epic quality recruitment tokens were used to recruit epic quality troops, which resulted in two teams of elite demon scouts, the faceless ones. The recruitment tokens have been used up. Now, as planned, I have 50 MO Dao iron guards, 50 divine arm archers, 50 white pole spearmen, 49 phantom archers, 20 faceless warriors, and 100 Guan Ning iron cavalry. With my current hero&#x27;s super high bonus, powerful units, and pre- battle strategy, defeating Black Flame in a fight to the death should not be a problem. But how could mere Black Flames be worth the loss of my troops? Now is the time for me to make my move.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao raised the Crimson Sky Sword high, its skills flashing through his mind. Imperial Way increases the holder&#x27;s battlefield luck by 100% and slowly increases the holder&#x27;s national luck. With the temporary transfer of Bao&#x27;s fortune, plus the fortune of the Crimson Sky Sword, my chances of summoning the Chinese emperor to possess me have increased even more. Exchange 1,000 points of the final battlefield of myriad races energy to recharge and use the Hasha token, Emperor&#x27;s heroic soul, to summon. Look, Lyn Sha is out and he&#x27;s bringing heroes and troops with him.</p>
<p>In the live stream, someone saw from one of the perspectives that the gate to the territory of Hulu Pass suddenly opened and a slowly emerged. The man at the front was tall and imposing, dressed in dark armor with a handsome and extraordinary appearance and a dazzling demeanor. It was none other than Lyn Sha. Chapter 115. A head-on showdown with Black Flame.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha is out leading a group of heroes and troops. He opened the gates of his territory and slowly walked out just as everyone&#x27;s attention was focused on him. &quot;Look, what&#x27;s that?&quot; someone in the live stream exclaimed. From another perspective, a sky full of arrows flew up. The arrow pierced through the gargoyles and harpies, catching these flying units completely offguard.</p>
<p>Tan by Chian, Hiz and Chin Ningming were overjoyed. Our boss is here to save us. Arrows rained down and Tu Shawn by Chian and the others took the opportunity to escape. The live stream camera flickered and the lord who started the live stream hurriedly turned around finally catching a glimpse of the fleeting figure on the ridge. Green leather armor, golden hair, pointed ears, and white overalls.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s overalls. No, it&#x27;s Phantom Shooter. Lyn Shia sent Phantom Shooter to rescue the beautiful girls. Lyn Sha really wouldn&#x27;t abandon his little brother. The crowd was in an uproar.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao had actually sent his powerful phantom archers to support his vassal lord at the crucial moment when troops were most needed. What would happen to the main battlefield? The camera kept shaking as one flying unit after another was shot down by the phantom archers. Just as air units have an advantage over ground units, archers also have an overwhelming advantage over ordinary air units. It seems that Tu Shawn by Chin has been rescued. Don&#x27;t be too happy yet.</p>
<p>Look at the perspective of the dwarf mountain warriors. They&#x27;ve arrived. Sure enough, the dwarves, who were extremely skilled in mountain warfare, moved swiftly and overtook the enemy, climbing up the ridge and catching up with the troops who were blocking Tu Shawn by Chin and the others. The Phantom Archers retreated. The pretty girl and the others ran away with them.</p>
<p>The dwarf mountain warriors are an epic unit. The Phantom Archers dare not fight them head-on. My goodness, the dwarves are so fast on the mountain. They&#x27;re only a few hundred meters away from the pretty girl and the others. And they&#x27;re keeping a close eye on them.</p>
<p>Just as the chase on the mountain ridge at the top of the Holian Mountains was in full swing. Look over here. Dinglay is about to start a fight, too. On the other side, Dinglay waved his hand with a complicated expression, and the blood lords led more than a thousand soldiers to rush forward, about to overwhelm Chufunga and her three companions. Leading the charge were the fat man with a face full of scars and his shadow fiend hero.</p>
<p>Dingle, is it fun being black flames, lackey? Facing the siege, the red-haired Chufunga smiled contemptuously and stared at Ding Lay, saying, &quot;You even claimed to be a genius on par with Lin Sha, and I even considered you a worthy opponent in the newbie zone. Yet, you were so pathetic. You are actually an accomplice of the blood lord. They were acting from the very beginning, deceiving everyone. You are not worthy to be Lin Xiaos opponent, nor are you worthy to be my opponent.&quot; After saying that, Shufinga and the others from Julie each opened a teleportation portal.</p>
<p>Dinglay, I&#x27;m sorry, but without our heads, you probably won&#x27;t be able to get promoted. Just stay put among the bloodthirsty lords. The blood lords arrived too late and could only watch helplessly as Chu Funga and the other three entered the portal, which then closed abruptly. Didn&#x27;t they already use a ceiling spell? How did they manage to use a portal and a one-way portal at that? The fat man was so angry at missing his target that he jumped up and down. Dinglay, it&#x27;s all your fault.</p>
<p>You insisted on making us march in formation, which delayed our chance to strike. It can only be the talent of a certain lord. Gene Wuang commented. It&#x27;s estimated that they can only maintain a few single-use portals, so they&#x27;ll only use them at the last minute. That&#x27;s probably why that red-haired kid and his gang joined forces and were so fearless.</p>
<p>Now that the crisis involving the big- breasted girl and the red-haired boy is temporarily over, I can focus on watching the duel between Lin Shia and Black Flame. Gene Wuang exclaimed in surprise, &quot;The undying Longbow Bowman are back.&quot; &quot;It turns out that after the troops that shot and killed the red-haired man, the British Longbowman left their lord with Ding Lelay and the others and then used the swift marching talisman again to rush back. With the long bowman of the sun never setting and the expensive speed rune, they are now virtually without weaknesses. I knew it. The large legion would definitely not leave out the archers in the decisive battle against Black Flame.</p>
<p>On the main battlefield, the Long Bowman of the British Empire had actually caught up with the slowly advancing Black Flame Army and were now at the very front of the column. The Black Flame Army has advanced to within a kilometer of Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory. Lyn Shiao led his troops out to meet them at that moment. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s side has infantry, archers, and cavalry. Although I don&#x27;t recognize any of them except for Gust, I have to admit he&#x27;s quite fast.</p>
<p>Gene Wuang became addicted to commentary and everyone in the live stream became addicted to listening. Ancestor of the Gene family, you are a veteran of war and one of the chief lords of Langia. Could you analyze the comparison of the strengths of both sides? Gene Wuang stroked his goatee clearly pleased with the praise in the live stream and immediately said, &quot;Lin Xiao only has 200 troops on his side. Black Flame has 800 members.&quot; Lyn Xiao&#x27;s forces are at a significant disadvantage. Lyn Shiao ordered the cavalry to lead the way, the archers to the flanks, and the infantry to follow behind.</p>
<p>The Black Flame Longbow Bowman lead the way. The Shadow Lurkers are on the flanks. The Sunspearmen are in the second row. The Iron Wall Crusaders are in the middle and the Templar Knights bring up the rear. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s troop deployment has major problems.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the problem? Someone asked in the live stream. Jin Wuang paused for a few seconds before slowly revealing the reason. A barrage of arrows from long range archers before they can directly confront the Black Flame. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s archers are on the flanks and they will be instantly killed by the shadow lurkers of the Black Flame. Then Lyn Xiao&#x27;s remaining cavalry charged while the longbow bowman, having already exhausted their arrows, retreated.</p>
<p>Therefore, Lynn Zhao&#x27;s cavalry would be mercilessly intercepted and annihilated by the Blazing Sun Spearman. In the end, Lynho&#x27;s infantry was completely wiped out by the encirclement and suppression of the Sunless Long Bowman, the Blazing Sun Spearman, and the Iron Wall Crusaders. The Knights Templar don&#x27;t even need to lift a finger. This is under the assumption that Linhao&#x27;s troops are capable of fighting against Black Flames troops. The fact is Black Flames troops are all gold, legendary, and epic troops, and all of them are level 30.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t recognize Linia&#x27;s unit type, but even if I overestimate it, its level definitely won&#x27;t exceed level 20. Lyn Shiao is doomed. As they spoke, the Black Flame Legion was getting closer and closer to Lin Shiao. In the live stream, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s figure became clearer and clearer. Lyn Shiao, you are doomed.</p>
<p>Black Flame roared, leaving its announcement in the live stream and chat channel, and then commanded all its units to accelerate forward. Here it comes. Everyone held their breath, almost afraid to breathe as they watched this scene, lest they miss any exciting moments. Both sides rushed off to their respective destinations. Distance 1,000 m, 800 m, 600 m, 500 m, 400 m away.</p>
<p>Whoosh! The sound of something cutting through the air suddenly rang out. &quot;Huh!&quot; Everyone was stunned, only to see the longbow bowman of the British Empire standing at the front row fall to the ground with a thud. Many Longbow Bowman died with an expression of disbelief and shock still lingering on their faces. He I knew I was talking nonsense. Jin Wuwang was greatly alarmed.</p>
<p>Lynn Zhaos archers have started shooting already. Those who fell were actually the long bowman of the British Empire. Chapter 116. Divine arm bow vs long bow. Guan Ning iron cavalry vss blazing sunspearman.</p>
<p>Before the long bowman of the British Empire could react, a large number of them were instantly knocked down. Swish, swish, swish. The sound of arrows piercing the air continued. The range of the British long bowman has increased again. Now they&#x27;re firing from 400 m away.</p>
<p>Black flame standing in the center of the army, said lazily, but screams of agony continued to echo from the front. Black Flame suddenly realized, &quot;Was it my long bowman who was shot down?&quot; Black Flame quickly looked up and saw that the arrows were coming from the iron canner&#x27;s archers on the two flanks of Linhaos formation. Those giant iron canisters wielding enormous crossbows would pull back the massive bolts with one hand, knock arrows, and unleash a volley every second. Fast and accurate. At the forefront of the army&#x27;s formation had their breastplates easily pierced by the long crossbow bolts.</p>
<p>At this point, the long bowman had not yet reached their maximum range. What&#x27;s going on? It&#x27;s the Gust Archers. How come the Gust archers have a longer range than the Long Bowman? Black flames are enraged. Longbow bowman retreat immediately. A precious troop that his elder brother Wong Su had obtained from Pu Dawei, the leader of the heavenly people.</p>
<p>He had suffered heavy losses because of his carelessness. Shadow lurker, use your shadow to leap over and kill those wretched archers. All troops attack. Just as Black Flame was hastily ordering a change in formation, Lin Sha s archers had already fired three rounds. Two archers each shot at the same long bowman.</p>
<p>One arrow aimed at the head and the other at the heart. The divine archer armor penetration agrade comes with a 50% armor penetration attribute combined with the wind arrow of the five elements arrow. It is incredibly swift and the feathered arrow instantly pierces the already not so thick armor of the long bowman. Instant kill. Three volleys of arrows rained down and more than 70 long bowman perished.</p>
<p>The long bowman used the swift march token again and frantically retreated to the rear of the black flame army. However, the long bowman who had run nearly 100 m in an instant still endured the fourth wave of arrows. Neatly arranged, the last 25 long bowman died on the spot. The live stream room was completely silent. The Gene family patriarch praising the sunless longbowman were still echoing in their ears when this scene unfolded before them, leaving everyone momentarily speechless.</p>
<p>A damn it. Black flames rage. Charge. Charge. Kill them all.</p>
<p>Leave no survivors. The entire army accelerated, jogging towards Lyn Xiao&#x27;s army formation. After a 3-second casting time, the hundred shadow lurkers also activated shadow leap, instantly appearing beside Lin Xiao&#x27;s 50 divine arm archers, drawing their short swords and thrusting straight down. Seeing that the shadow lurker was now close, Black Flame grinned maliciously, no longer threatened by ranged attacks. Lyn Shao, your death is near.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao remained calm and composed. In the midst of the army formation, Hoitsubing led a 100 cavalry men at full speed, heading straight towards the blazing spearmen whose spear tips shone with intense heat. You don&#x27;t actually think you can fight against an epic cavalry killer with this mediocre cavalry, do you? Black Flame laughed wildly. Fierce Sunspearman, show no mercy. In the cavalry formation, Hitsubing took the lead with Hoitzubing&#x27;s drinking horse in the vast sea skill granting a 50% movement speed bonus and the Guan Ning iron cavalry&#x27;s charge skill.</p>
<p>The cavalry regiment quickly increased its speed over a distance of several hundred meters. Guaning Iron Cavalry charge. Guaning Iron Cavalry can accelerate and charge over a shorter distance. Charge distance minus 50%. Speed boost plus 50%, movement speed plus 50%, and damage to enemies directly in front plus 50% while charging.</p>
<p>Before anyone could react, the cavalry regiment, which had been moving slowly forward, accelerated to a speed that was like thunder. Form ranks, hold the line, pierce them to death. The 200 blazing lancers, who would never waver in the face of cavalry, immediately stopped. All of them stood shoulderto-shoulder with one end of their 3meter long lances stuck into the ground and the tips pointing diagonally forward. A blazing light condensed at the tip of the spear like the sharpest divine weapon capable of piercing through any invading enemy just waiting for Lin Xiao&#x27;s cavalry to charge in.</p>
<p>With the buffs from cavalry buster, sun protection, and the lord&#x27;s talent of black flame, the sun spearman reaches his peak and is confident in holding off the enemy. Lin Shiao is still too young. Gene Wuang said quietly. At this point, we should use cavalry to rescue his Gustau archers and then use the Gustau archers to wear down the spearman. There&#x27;s still a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Faced with the steadfast and resolute lancers of the blazing sun apart from the three major nightly orders, no cavalry can break through their formation. Lynhia&#x27;s cavalry regiment is approaching. 200 m, 100 m, 50 m, 30 m. Everyone held their breath again, eager to see what the next collision would be like. The knight general at the head of the cavalry regiment shouted, &quot;Kill!&quot; Then he threw the spear in his hand.</p>
<p>100 cavalrymen split into two groups and simultaneously raised their strangely shaped long-handled iron rods, pointing the iron end at the blazing sunsp spearman. Boom! Boom! Boom! Gunpowder exploded and rose from the ground. Amidst the massive plume of smoke, a large number of the fiery sun gunners fell to the ground. The mouths of everyone in the live stream formed an O shape, as if they could swallow an egg hole. After firing their powerful musketss at close range, the frontline cavalry immediately turned their horses around, splitting into two groups and retreating to the flanks.</p>
<p>Their movements were fluid and without the slightest hesitation. The cavalry in the rear continued to follow, their strange weapons still unleashing deadly flames at the blazing spearman. What? Startled by the roar of the musketss, Black Flame reacted. How come these cavalrymen know how to use firearms? Isn&#x27;t this the unique skill of the mounted musketeers of the kingdom of France? Only the conquerors possess it. Could it be that Lynn Shiao has a squad of Frankie conquerors? Hitsubing led a 100 Guan Ning cavalrymen charging in and attacking head-on.</p>
<p>Their three-eyed musketss fired three shots simultaneously from a distance of 30 m, easily breaking through the armor. With just one charge and a tail sweep, he took down nearly a hundred snipers who were lying in weight. And the Blazing Sunlancers didn&#x27;t even manage to touch a hair on their heads. He the Sunfire Spearman is a level 30 epic unit. Based on the average level of melee strength focused units, its four stats should be around 110 strength, 80 spirit, 80 constitution, and 50 soul.</p>
<p>and the Guan Ning iron cavalry with Hoit Sububing&#x27;s Cavaliers command SS level granting a 100% bonus to all attributes and sealing the wolf&#x27;s lair adding 50% damage to foreign enemies and Guan Ning iron cavalry&#x27;s charge adding 50% damage to enemies in front and breaking formation adding 50% critical hit bonus to enemies in formation. The level 20 Guan Ning iron cavalry has the following attributes. Strength 135 plus 135 spirit 92 + 92 constitution 110 + 110 soul 53 + 53 damage plus 100% critical hit plus 50%. In addition, with the Emperor&#x27;s Luck skill bonus that I&#x27;m currently possessing, my critical hit rate can almost reach 100%. against the blazing sunsp spearman.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s an instant kill. I really don&#x27;t know what black flame has that gives it the confidence to stop the Guan Ning iron cavalry. Lynn Shiao, the top student, nodded secretly. His expertise and calculation had already led him to deduce everything. After the Guan Ning cavalry finished firing their musketss at point blank range, they split into two groups and circled around to the flanks.</p>
<p>Without reloading, they drew their long swords and charged at the archers. This is Lin Xiao&#x27;s cavalry trying to relieve his archers. Everyone in the live stream understood. Lin Shiao isn&#x27;t too bad. At least he knows how to use cavalry to relieve the archers.</p>
<p>Jin Wuang said, &quot;It&#x27;s a bit slow, but at least we can preserve some bows.&quot; Wait, why are none of Lyn Xiao&#x27;s archers dead? Have the shadow lurkers already fallen? Chapter 117. Iron Guards of the Mo Dao versus Templar Knights. The audience in the live stream turned to look at the source of the sound. The archers, whom Lin Shao called the Gust Archers, were surrounded by the shadow lurkers. He immediately abandoned the use of the giant crossbow and instead drew a thick, long, sharp blade from his waist.</p>
<p>Faced with the assassins who came close by, these tall archers remained calm and instead showed friendly smiles. The shadow lurker was taken aback. This doesn&#x27;t seem like the reaction of a weak ranged attacker seeing itself get close. With a snap, the archer gust lowered the heavy circular iron flaps on his helmet covering his face and neck. From then on, these archers were completely covered from head to toe with only a slit between their eyes.</p>
<p>The rest of their bodies were completely sealed off, leaving no openings. Gustee the archer grabbed his ring pommel sword and swung it down with a swift powerful strike. Composure unaffected by ambushes or mental fear effects. When the enemy is less than 10 m away from the archer, the archer&#x27;s strength and constitution attributes increase by 30% and melee ability increases by 30%. Some shadowy figures who didn&#x27;t react in time were unable to dodge and died on the spot.</p>
<p>The divine arm archer is a powerful man whose strength rivals that of the iron guards of the Mod Dao. As a legendary gold tier unit, he wears 60 lb infantry armor and wields a ring pommel sword. With the composure buff, his close combat prowess against squishy assassins is comparable to that of a tanky warrior, making it a piece of cake. The Guan Ning cavalry, who had just shattered the Blazing Sun Spearmen, had not yet arrived. This group of fierce men fought two against one with 50 archers taking on a 100 shadow lurkers and instead killing the assassins who got close making them cry for their mothers.</p>
<p>The live stream audience was shocked. Lyn Sha has brought far too many shocks. This this Jean Wuwang stammered. Is this the skill of the overalls archer? No. Is this the skill of the gust archer? Its range is even greater than that of the epic archer, the sunless long bowman, and it can easily defeat epic quality assassins in melee combat.</p>
<p>Oh my god. Oh my god. I should have made my phantom archers always wear overalls. Everyone exclaimed in surprise. Ancestor of the Gene family.</p>
<p>You made the phantom archer wear overalls. Gene Wuang, of course. But unfortunately, I was ridiculed by those old geysers, so I gave up and waited. Why are you asking about this? Everyone fell silent. Gene Wuang changed the subject.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha has really brought me too many surprises. The Gust Archer is so powerful. Could it be an epic unit? Epic units? Someone in the live stream exclaimed in shock. Lyn Sha actually created an epic unit. They still remember that after the Gust Archer made his first appearance and killed the enemy, someone went to look up the dictionary of battlefield of all races.</p>
<p>But there was no entry for this type of unit. It can only be classified as a type of troop created by Lin Sha. Creating one&#x27;s own unit type is considered one of the characteristics of a genius. And his cavalry can actually operate musketss. That&#x27;s a legendary gold tier unit.</p>
<p>The special skill of the Frankie conqueror, ancestor of the Gene family. Are Lyn Xiao&#x27;s cavalry the Frankish conquerors? No. I have seen the conquerors of Frangic. They did not carry long swords or spears, nor did they move with such speed. Could it be? Could it be something? Could this be another unit created by Lynn Shiao like the Gust Archers? This another self-created unit.</p>
<p>The live stream chat exploded. How long has it been since you created the Gust Archers? 10 days. And now you&#x27;ve created a new cavalry and it looks so powerful. Genius. Absolutely a genius.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha is awesome. Sh. Keep your voice down. The battle isn&#x27;t over yet. If you cheer for Lyn Sha, Black Flame might come after you.</p>
<p>Damn it. Damn it, Lyn Sha. You really deserve to die. As the smoke from the three-eyed musket dissipated, black flame saw nearly half of his fallen sun spearman, as well as the shadow lurkers being besieged by the divine arm archers and the Guan Ning iron cavalry. You force me to this, I&#x27;ll grind you to dust.</p>
<p>Black Flame shouted, &quot;Rom, go!&quot; The blonde blue-eyed knight commander rode slowly past Black Flame, coldly, saying, &quot;Chinese, watch your words.&quot; Black Flame was immediately discouraged and whispered, &quot;Commander Rohm, please strike and kill this scoundrel.&quot; &quot;Snort!&quot; Rahm snorted coldly and led a 100 Templar knights, accelerating from the rear of the army formation. The Iron Wall Crusaders and the remaining Sunfire Spearmen in the central camp immediately parted to make way for the Templars. On the opposite side, archers and Guan Ning cavalry are killing the shadow lurkers. At this moment, Lyn Shao only had the Mod Dao iron guard in his hands. The heavy footsteps of the Knights Templar sounded and the order began to speed up.</p>
<p>Look, Black Flame has dispatched the Knights Templar directly, intending to deliver the final blow. The viewers in the live stream exclaimed in surprise. He kept the Sunfire Spearman and Iron Wall Crusaders close behind, trying to catch up with the Templar formation and expand his gains. With the Templar Knights arrival, the outcome is already decided. Some people also raised objections.</p>
<p>But the Templar Knights only have two or 300 m to charge. Can they even make it that far? You idiot. That&#x27;s a legendary gold tier unit, one of the three great nightly orders of Europe. Even if they can&#x27;t reach top speed, the beast steeds and plate armored knights can easily slaughter all of Linia&#x27;s men. Where is Lin Shiao? How is Lin Shiao responding? From within Lyn Xiao&#x27;s army formation, 50 soldiers nearly 2 meters tall, wearing two layers of heavy armor, and with their faces covered by ferocious iron masks, stepped out.</p>
<p>They were tall and imposing, exuding a fierce aura. Each wielded a 3 m long giant sword with a blade alone measuring 1.5 m. They stood in neat formation facing the Templar knights. It looks pretty good, but is it just for shell? Ancestor of the Gene family? Are you familiar with this type of soldier? Cough. Cough.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t recognize him. Gene Wuang seemed slightly embarrassed. Lynhos troops are too peculiar. Ancestor, do you think Lyn Shao can win? Liaos troops look very imposing. Gene Wuang, he he even a 4 m tall cyclops can be easily killed by Templar knights without them charging.</p>
<p>Lynhos troops are like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. The power of the legendary golden units is beyond your imagination. The words had barely left his mouth when the Templar knights, who had already begun to accelerate, rushed in front of Lin Xiaos troops. The entire Nightly Order seemed to merge into one. Each person radiating a faint golden light.</p>
<p>The Nightly Order like a sharp sword slashing at the enemy. The Templar Knights leader was none other than the legendary golden hero, Commander Rom. Rohm, lance in hand, roared, and a thousand rays of light gathered on him and then on his lance. The entire nightly order charged toward the enemy with boundless power. Everyone stared wideeyed and held their breath.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a white figure flashed past among Lin Xiao&#x27;s 50 soldiers. Then a dazzling white light flashed, trailing brilliant light, overshadowing the radiance of the entire Knight Commander Rome, and disappeared in a flash. Rum was instantly defeated. Clashed with the towering troop formation that was advancing instead of retreating. Cut.</p>
<p>A loud shout rang out. Chapter 118. Melee stalemate. Cullinans Iron Cavalry. Cut.</p>
<p>A loud shout rang out. The Templars simultaneously thrust out their lances. All the tall, sword wielding soldiers formed a dense formation and simultaneously brandished their giant blades. When their lances clashed with the towering soldiers, their massive blades also struck the Templar knights. The weapons of both sides clashed with each other&#x27;s armor, producing a loud bang.</p>
<p>The Templar Knights, who were already not at their full potential, slowed down even further after their commander fall. Their iron tipped wooden lances did not penetrate the armor of the tall soldiers. They merely knock them back a few steps. Click. Most of the lances fired in the first wave of the attack broke.</p>
<p>At the same time, the entire Templar Order&#x27;s charge was also abruptly halted. The towering soldiers wielded their massive blades simultaneously slicing sparks from the Templar knight&#x27;s armor and their warhor&#x27;s armor. What? This type of soldier doesn&#x27;t even try to avoid the enemy. They just go for a head-on confrontation. They actually held on.</p>
<p>The audience in the live stream was stunned. Just then, the tall soldier stepped forward again and swung his great sword at the Templar knights who had stopped. The Templar Knights truly live up to their legendary gold rank. Their reactions are swift. They immediately dropped their broken lances, raised their shields, or drew their long swords to parry.</p>
<p>When the giant blade struck the Templar knights once more, another burst of sparks appeared, accompanied by shields or long swords being cleaved in two. Everyone in the live stream was completely mesmerized. But before they could even marvel, the tall soldier who had just delivered the first slash swiftly delivered another slash in the blink of an eye. Snap! Blood splattered everywhere. More than half of the Templar knights in the first row fell straight down.</p>
<p>Even worse, the man and his horse were split in two. There seemed to be a moment of silence in the air. What? What the hell? What did I see? Lyn Xiao&#x27;s infantry killed the Templar knight. The live stream chat was in an uproar. That&#x27;s a Templar knight in full plate armor, a master of melee combat, a master of defense, known as invincible.</p>
<p>I think I even saw a Warcraft hybrid horse get killed. The horse was also wearing a breastplate and chain mail, and it too was cut in two. My god, what&#x27;s going on? Am I hallucinating? Ancestor of the Gene family, come out and explain yourself. On the battlefield, black flame stood motionless, trembling all over. The Templar knights were killed.</p>
<p>Are there still infantrymen in this world capable of defeating the Templars? Years of combat experience and understanding were shattered. Black Flame even forgot what he was doing and gave no further instructions. He just stood there watching the iron guards of the Mod Dao swing their Mod Dao again and continued to advance, slashing at the Templar Knights. Asel. A loud shout rang out and the fallen knight commander Rom scrambled to his feet.</p>
<p>His left shoulder armor was shattered and blood seeped from his shoulder. How dare you harm a noble Templar knight? How dare you harm a nobleman? Who attacked me? Step forward. I challenge you to a duel. Black Flame was instantly awakened by Rahm&#x27;s shout. He hasn&#x27;t lost yet.</p>
<p>He looked around and then glanced at the live stream. The Templar Knights were only intercepted. More than a dozen of the first rank of charging knights were killed, but they have now begun an effective counterattack. At such close range, the taller soldiers are no longer able to quickly kill the Templar knights. The Templars, relying on their war horses, lances, long swords, and shields were already locked in battle with the towering infantry, still holding an overwhelming numerical advantage.</p>
<p>Night Commander Ram is only injured. He is a legendary gold tier hero and he still has the strength to fight. He also has 100 fiery sun spearmen and 300 fully equipped iron wall crusaders which are one of the strongest offensive and defensive units capable of overcoming fortifications. Executioners and mountain savages that I first sent out to raid Lyn Xiao&#x27;s rear have successfully descended the mountain and entered the Calabash Valley. Their hero Nano along with 200 dwarven mountain warriors had caught up with the beautiful girl and the phantom archer cornering them on the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p>Dingle is leading over a thousand soldiers and is heading this way. They should arrive in 2 minutes at most. As for Chufunga and the others, they never reappeared after escaping, having already disengaged from the battle. No matter how you look at it, you still have an absolute advantage. He was only temporarily panicked because of the sudden loss of the Knights Templar.</p>
<p>Having calmed down, Black Flame immediately made arrangements. His years of combat experience allowed him to make arrangements that best suited the current situation. Dingle, what are you doawling about? Charge forward and surround Lin Shiao. Neagano, lead your dwarf mountain warriors. Surround and annihilate the beautiful girl and immediately infiltrate Lyn Xiao&#x27;s rear and flatten his lord&#x27;s mansion.</p>
<p>Sword Saint Wuji, make your move immediately. Lyn Shiao must have sent that whiteclad hero to ambush and wound, breaking the Templar knight&#x27;s charge. Find him immediately and kill him. Yes, sir. The tall, slender swordsman, wearing a seveneyed visor received the order.</p>
<p>He looked up and the visor traced the battle&#x27;s trajectory. Not far from where the dazzling streak of light had just passed, a man in white was quietly waiting for him. The sword saint of Limitless immediately used his movement technique to rush over. Blazing spearman, ironclad crusaders, follow me forward and slay all enemies. Black Flame dawned his helmet and led the remaining 100 Sunfire Spearmen and 300 Iron Wall Crusaders forward to join the Templar Knights battle line and besieged the mere 50 Ironclad guards.</p>
<p>The battle immediately became intense. The viewers in the live stream were once again amazed. The great battle. Black Flame has committed all its forces. Can Lynn Shia hold out? The Lord of the official district is quite capable.</p>
<p>He made arrangements immediately. He he wasn&#x27;t for nothing that I sneaked out here. Brilliant. Brilliant. Gene Wuang exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>Despite the Templar knight&#x27;s setback, Black Flame still holds an absolute advantage. He&#x27;s operating on three fronts. On the main battlefield, his forces are almost five times that of Lin Xiao, and they&#x27;re all level 30 epic legendary units. Behind Dinglay are more than a thousand rare and outstanding reserve troops. Even if you just pile them up, you can still kill Lin Shiao.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiao&#x27;s most powerful whiteclad hero was also killed by the Wuji Sword Saint. On the flank, the big- breasted girl has been driven to a dead end and is destined to be killed. On the rear battlefield, the mountain savages have already entered Lin Xiao&#x27;s rear and can burn, kill, and plunder all the way, disturbing Lin Shiao. Finally, the flanking and rear battlefields were combined into one, and Lin Xiaos stronghold was wiped out. What a pity.</p>
<p>Gene Wuang side. Lyn Shiao is really good, far exceeding my expectations. If he doesn&#x27;t die, he&#x27;ll inevitably grow into a powerful ruler in the future. All right. Although Lin Sha will eventually die, I cannot leave empty-handed from this great battle.</p>
<p>to everyone&#x27;s surprise in the live stream. Gene Wuang suddenly spoke in the chat channel at Lin Shiao. I think your self-created cavalry unit is quite good. What is it called? How do you train it? Everyone, at this point, they still have the mood to reply to you. So, when you say you can&#x27;t leave empty-handed, you mean you want to get their troops for free? Unexpectedly, Lin Sha actually replied, &quot;Is this the ancestor of Gene Dang? My cavalry is called the Cullinan Iron Cavalry.</p>
<p>As for how to train, I&#x27;ll tell you after I&#x27;ve killed the black flame, the Mod Dao iron guard who was fighting against the tide of enemies alone. He was going to the battlefield to fight alongside the iron guards of the Mod Dao. Lyn Shao swung his long sword. A meteorite fell from the sky. Chapter 119.</p>
<p>What is the king of the mountains? Just as Lin Sha brandished his long sword and slowly walked towards the battlefield. as the meteorite fell from the sky and landed within the black flame army&#x27;s formation. In the live stream, some viewers saw from Tu Shawn by Chin&#x27;s perspective that the dwarf mountain warriors had completely surrounded the remaining soldiers of the beautiful girls on a cliff, leaving them with no way to escape. Among the dwarf mountain warriors, a muscular black hero wielding two single-edged axes grinned as he cleaved down at two Shawn by Chien. The pretty girl and the others are in danger when a loud bang was heard and Chun Ningming rushed out from the side, blocking the attack with his black wind ax.</p>
<p>But how could Chin Ningming possibly match power, the black wind axe immediately flew out of his hand, and Chin Ningming was also knocked dozens of meters away. Shooting at Soldering&#x27;s command, the phantom archer activated the rapid fire skill. Nearly 50 phantom archers fired arrows in rapid succession. Some aimed at the black hero and some at the dwarf mountain warriors surrounding them. rolled away to avoid it, followed by a clanging sound.</p>
<p>200 dwarf mountain warriors, each less than 1.5 meters tall but 1.5 meters wide, short, stocky, and fully armored. Each wielding a shield in one hand and a spear in the other, raised their shields to defend themselves, blocking all the arrows. The phantom archer couldn&#x27;t break through the defenses of the dwarven mountain warrior. Hey, don&#x27;t eat the pickled radish. Seeing this, Soldering could only curse angrily.</p>
<p>The dwarf mountain warriors, shields in hand, slowly advanced while Tu Shan by Chin&#x27;s remaining troops could only retreat continuously. Die. Nanu leaped up again and swung his ax at Chening. Tu Shan by Chin transformed into a fox demon, snatched the unconscious Chun Ningming, and led all the troops in a retreat once more. Behind them was a sheer cliff.</p>
<p>This is really the end. The less than 100 of the beautiful girls remaining troops are no match for epic level units. There&#x27;s nowhere to run. It&#x27;s a dead end. The audience in the live stream side.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia made a mistake. He shouldn&#x27;t have come to save Zay May and the others. They&#x27;re just vassel lords and their strength isn&#x27;t that great. And all those phantom archers and faceless men were wasted. Could it really be that he&#x27;s just after the girl&#x27;s beauty? What a pity.</p>
<p>Zay was quite a beauty in the making. She was sweetl looking, had a great figure, was intelligent, and could even transform into a demon beast. She had so many tricks up her sleeve. My friend, your taste is a bit too extreme. Hey, I can see you talking about me like that.</p>
<p>Tan by Chin shouted in the live stream. It&#x27;s not gentlemanly to comment on a lady&#x27;s behavior to her face. He a dear young lady, what time is it? You still have the mood to argue. At this moment, someone exclaimed, &quot;Look, what&#x27;s that?&quot; Suddenly, a white spear appeared from the cliff behind Tu Shawn by Chen, where there was nowhere left to retreat. The white spear had a strange shape with a long and sharp tip, and below the tip was a barb that looked like a sickle.</p>
<p>The spear extends out and then hangs down. The barb was firmly hooked onto the cliff face. One, two, or several white spears stretched out simultaneously, hanging on the cliff. Then a soldier with dark skin and prominent features suddenly climbed up the white spear and jumped up. One, two, dozens of soldiers jumped up one after another.</p>
<p>These soldiers wore half-body armor to protect their upper bodies, gators to protect their shins, and gauntlets to protect their forearms, revealing two muscular arms. Heavy swords hung at their waists, and their eyes were fierce and filled with murderous intent. This is This is the reinforcements sent by Lin Sha. Lyn Sha actually had a backup plan. Someone in the live stream realized what was happening.</p>
<p>How did they get up here? How can infantrymen climb up cliffs? Are they even human? This cliff in the Calabash Mountains is so steep, it&#x27;s as if it were cut by a knife and axe, reaching a height of 4 or 500 m. Aside from flying units, no one can climb it. Yet today, a unit actually managed to climb it up. This has truly broadened the horizons of everyone in the live stream. In their astonishment, even Gano forgot to attack.</p>
<p>50 Fierce soldiers climbed to the top of the cliff in just over 10 seconds. The last soldier to come up picked up the long spears hanging on the edge of the cliff, and the troops were assembled. A female hero clad in silver scale armor with a flowing crimson cape and long hair tied in a high ponytail reaching her waist leaped forward and landed in front of the white spearman. Lynhia&#x27;s mountain troops have been assembled. The female hero is heroic and awe inspiring.</p>
<p>Her features were delicate with small rosy lips and a high nose that accentuated the three-dimensionality of her features. Her face, eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth. Every single one of them was extremely beautiful. But the combination of these qualities on her exudes a vigorous and heroic spirit, making people overlook her beauty and only feel that she is unstoppable. Wow, what a beautiful heroine.</p>
<p>I have never seen such a beautiful woman in my life. My conqueror&#x27;s spirit is burning. A group of people in the live stream exclaimed in amazement that Lynn Shiao is really lucky with women. He actually has such a beautiful heroine by his side. I don&#x27;t think those dozens of flower fairies of that weak man are appealing anymore.</p>
<p>He a I&#x27;m also in the live stream so watch your words. The crowd ignored him and continued their frantic discussion. And this beautiful heroine looks to be quite powerful in combat as well. Sister, please attack me head on. Hey, control yourself.</p>
<p>Do you guys think this might be the beautiful heroin that Lynn Sha rewarded? That makes sense. So, this is the beautiful heroine the system called out. Ahem, you&#x27;ve got the point wrong. Seeing that the topic had shifted, Gene Wuang said helplessly. The battle is still going on.</p>
<p>This reinforcement only consists of 50 men and one hero, while the enemy has 200 epic level units. In my opinion, this beautiful heroine is also here to die. It was only then that everyone realized how beautiful Chin Leong Yu was. Look, they started fighting on the cliff. Chin Leong Yu with 50 white spear soldiers shielded the wounded Tu Sha by Chin and the others behind her without saying a word.</p>
<p>Leave the rest to me. Chin Leang Yu smiled, leaving Tu Sha by Chin stunned. What a beautiful woman. When did boss Lynn Shia acquire another beautiful lady? He&#x27;s really lucky. While two Shan by Chian was lost in thought, Chin Leangu shouted.</p>
<p>Fighting, the white shafted spearmen immediately lined up and advanced, their spears pointing straight ahead. Seeing that the newcomers were hostile, Gano immediately led his dwarf mountain warriors into formation, their spears standing tall and pointing forward. You think you can fight the mountain king dwarf on the mountains? You&#x27;re so naive. Kill. Without any preamble, 50 against 200.</p>
<p>Chin Leong Yu versus Nagant. A head-on confrontation. The two sides clashed. Boom. Snap.</p>
<p>Was pierced through by a group of spearmen who appeared out of nowhere. The White Pole spearmen have longer spears and can wield them with both hands, making them more agile. Combined with the high attributes of the golden legendary unit and the bonus from Chin Leong Yu, they can decide the outcome of a battle in one strike. Chin Leong Yu, Spearman Command, Srank, Archer Command, Srank. All spearmen and archers have their four attributes increased by 50%.</p>
<p>King of the Mountains. When leading troops in mountain marches and battles, Chin Leong Yu and all troop types gain 50% increased attack speed and movement speed. Stamina consumption for traversing mountains is reduced by 50% and endurance is increased by 100%. Critical hit rate is increased by 50% and damage is increased by 30%. Unaffected by any ambushes or traps below SS level in the mountains.</p>
<p>Whoosh. The Phantom Archer seized the opportunity to fire again. This time with a faster and more powerful arrow. This time, the arrows broke through the defenses of the dwarven mountain warriors, causing considerable chaos in the dwarven army. Seeing the dwarves being slaughtered one-sidedly by the white-barreled spearmen and phantom archers, Neagano, as strong as a gorilla, roared and swung his single-edged ax at Chin Leang Yu.</p>
<p>A barbaric small country full of tales of gods and ghosts. A bunch of dwarfs dared to call themselves the kings of the mountains. Chin Leang Yu snorted coldly, activated master of spear technique, and went to meet the attack. In less than 10 seconds, Nanu was stabbed to death by Chin Leong Yu on mountainous terrain. Chin Leong Yus attack capabilities are comparable to Pay Mins.</p>
<p>The White Spear soldiers and phantom archers pressed their advantage, quickly eliminating the remaining troops. Before anyone in the live stream could react, the camera was turned off. The battle on the mountaintop is over. Chapter 12. Valiant Iron Guard Grand Magister.</p>
<p>Here, Lynn Shao drew his Crimson Sky sword and joined the bloody battle between the iron guards of the Mod Dao and the Black Flame soldiers. The sudden appearance of the meteorite startled Black Flame. Having fought in the official zone for many years, he subconsciously assumed that a highle mage had joined Lin Shia and released a meteor spell. Fortunately, it was just a meteorite, which only killed a dozen or so crusaders. Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t a meteor summoned by the Arch Mitch.</p>
<p>This kind of highle magic is over level 30, so it&#x27;s impossible for it to appear in the beginner area. Black Flame quickly calmed down, determined to surround and kill Lin Sha. The Iron Guards wielding their legendary swords were incredibly brave and formed a formidable human wall of defense. Beneath the flashing blades, Templar knights fell to the ground with screams of agony. However, the Templar&#x27;s attacks also inflicted damage on the iron guards of the Emo Dao Modal.</p>
<p>Their lances and long swords cleaving through their scale armor. Fortunately, the second layer of chain mail blocked most of the damage. And so far, none of the Mod Dao iron guards have been killed or seriously injured. They are still persevering despite bleeding. Quickly charge.</p>
<p>Kill these damned soldiers. Black Flame roared from within the Iron Wall Crusade. Lyn Shiao, you&#x27;re dead. My sheer numbers can overwhelm you. Then you&#x27;ll see how you&#x27;ve utterly failed.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaos eyes were cold as he charged into the Templar Knights and joined the bloody battle. At this moment, due to Liaos arrival, the Mod Dao Iron Guards activated their skills one after another. Blood frenzy. When a unit bleeds, it triggers a berserk state. immediately increase strength, spirit, and constitution by 30% lasting until the end of the battle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as injuries worsen, the berserk state bonus will continue to increase up to a maximum of 100% increase for all three attributes. Heroic, the iron guards of the mo down never retreat. The more enemies they face, the stronger their will becomes. when the number of enemies exceeds five times the number of MO DAO iron guards increasing maximum health by 5% and so on up to a maximum increase of 100% of maximum health. The life value of the MO DAO Ironclad increases by nearly 80%.</p>
<p>Pillar of strength when facing a superior enemy with a combat strength rating close to or exceeding that of your own increases morale and strength, spirit and constitution. The greater the number of enemies, the more morale, strength, and constitution are increased. This effect is doubled when protecting your lord and heroes. Facing an enemy force more than 10 times the size of the Modo Dao Iron Guards, the Mod Dao iron guard&#x27;s attributes increased by 100%. Because of protecting Lin Sha, the Mod Dao iron guards additional attributes increased by 200%.</p>
<p>First, the divine valor skill greatly increases the HP of the Mod Dao ironclad, allowing it to withstand more damage. Furthermore, the injured Emo Dao iron guards blood frenzy greatly increases their attack power. Furthermore, under the pillar of strength state, the four main attributes are greatly increased when fighting against a larger force. The iron guards of the Mod Dao, who had been on the verge of collapse from the Templar Knights onslaught, suddenly straightened up and launched a fearless counterattack. Swish, swish.</p>
<p>Of the long sword flashed continuously, and another row of Templar knights fell. What? Seeing the iron guards of the Mode Dao charging at his Templar knights as if they were on steroids, Black Flame was extremely anxious. Sunfire Spearman, Crusaders, quick charge. Pierce them. Slash them.</p>
<p>The blazing spearmen had already circled around to the rear of the Emo Dao Iron Guards formation, thrusting their scorching spears into the armor of the Mod Dao iron guards. A wisp of white smoke rose out. It truly lived up to its reputation as a skill that gathered the power of the sun. The iron wall crusaders have also arrived and dual sword style is activated. Crack.</p>
<p>Crack. Two consecutive slashes came down. One of the Mod Dao Iron Guards shattered instantly and the Crusader s broadsword became stuck in the Mod Dao iron guard&#x27;s body. Roar. The Iron Guardian in pain turned and swept his sword, cleaving the iron wall crusader in two.</p>
<p>Smooth slash activated. Another sweeping strike followed. He then hacked to death the other two Iron Wall Crusaders and one Sunfire Spearman who had arrived. He was stabbed twice and killed four people. But more ironclad crusaders and sunfire spearmen continued forward once again surrounding and attacking the outnumbered ironclad guards.</p>
<p>Seeing the fierce fighting spirit of the Mod Dao iron guards and their heroic figures as they relentlessly killed enemies despite being outnumbered, some viewers in the live stream began to murmur, &quot;Lynhiao&#x27;s weapons are too powerful. How can they also use dual swords? And even if you kill the enemy instantly, you can still get in two hits. Someone corrected. It&#x27;s not just that. I just saw the Templar Knight block one of the swordsman&#x27;s blows, and he&#x27;ll be hit by a second one right away.</p>
<p>If the second strike kills the Templar Knight, the swordsman will immediately strike again. This isn&#x27;t dual wielding. I&#x27;d call it three wielding. Three strikes. My god, that&#x27;s too powerful.</p>
<p>No wonder even the Templar knights couldn&#x27;t withstand it. What kind of monster soldiers did Lynn Sha recruit? Alas, even the most powerful troops eventually run out of strength. Gene Wuang said, &quot;I observe that although the soldiers morale was boosted again by Lyn Xiaos arrival, the Black Flame troops are not weak either. If this stalemate continues, Black Flame will eventually prevail. Ancestor of the Gene family, you&#x27;ve made several predictions today.</p>
<p>When have you ever succeeded?&quot; Someone said sarcastically. The battlefield is everchanging. Although I made some mistakes in the past, and I admit that Lynn Sha surprised me one after another, but in the current situation, do you yourselves think Lynn Sha can win? Everyone fell silent. Faced with overwhelming numerical superiority, Lyn Sha had no chance of winning. Just then, the sky changed dramatically, and another meteorite fell from the sky.</p>
<p>Boom! The meteorite crashed straight into the center of the black flames army. More than a dozen Iron Wall crusaders were blown into the air. What&#x27;s going on? Why are meteorites falling suddenly during a battle? The viewers in the live stream were puzzled. Boom. Another meteorite fell.</p>
<p>Before the meteorite even hit the ground, the clouds parted and another meteorite poured down. Boom. Several meteorites crashed into the black flame legion. Black flames suffered heavy losses immediately. What the hell? Black flames screamed in agony.</p>
<p>Scatter everyone. Scatter. Don&#x27;t be so crowded. Damn. Why is it raining meteors at this time? Damn it.</p>
<p>Why are they only hitting me and not Lyn Sha? The meteorites struck with great precision, landing precisely in the area where the black flame troops were most concentrated. The power released during the fall did not affect Lin Xiao&#x27;s troops in the slightest. Lynn Shiao used the Crimson Sky Sword to kill another Templar knight. Seeing this, he couldn&#x27;t help but laugh out loud. Today, I&#x27;ll show you the power of a Grand Magister.</p>
<p>Grand Magister? There are no Grand Magisters here. Stop trying to confuse me. Lyn Sha didn&#x27;t waste any words and continued to fight alongside the iron guards of the Mod Dao. In the sky, another meteorite trailing a long fiery tail hurdled straight down. Dinglay, you bastard.</p>
<p>Why aren&#x27;t you up here yet? Blackflame shouted. I&#x27;ll go after I&#x27;ve taken down all the blood lords. Suddenly, Dinglay replied, &quot;What?&quot; Blackflame quickly glanced at the live stream. From Ding Lays perspective, the ground was littered with corpses and rivers of blood. Ding Lay and his troops are engaged in a bloody battle with all the other blood lords.</p>
<p>Chapter 121. Lynn, Grand Magister, child of the plains, Sha. Dinglay, how dare you betray me? Black Flame was instantly enraged. Our celestial being organization valued you so highly. We gave you money and military tokens, and you actually betrayed us.</p>
<p>Huh? You still have the nerve to talk about betrayal? As Ding Lay drew his sword and fought fiercely against the bloodthirsty Lord before him, he shouted, &quot;I&#x27;ve been in a cooperative relationship with you from the very beginning. I never agreed to be one of your peripheral members. Besides, your cooperation wasn&#x27;t based on the intention of using me as a tool, was it? I don&#x27;t get along with Lyn Shia, but I&#x27;m going to defeat him fair and square. I want to kill the bloodthirsty lord, and I want to create a peaceful and harmonious environment for the newbie zone. It&#x27;s all true.</p>
<p>And what about you? You actually provided me with information on those worthless bloodthirsty lords, using me to eliminate them while secretly cultivating even more bloodthirsty lords. I am the one who has been manipulated by you. With a whoosh, Ding lay cleaved the bloodthirsty lord before him to death, roaring. I&#x27;ve lived my whole life on thin ice. Tell me, how could I possibly associate with you bloodthirsty lords? Okay.</p>
<p>Okay. Black Flame enraged laughed. Someone like you who was defeated by Lin Shiao in a single move dares to challenge the authority of the Celestials. You underestimate us. Black Flame remained calm and indifferent, saying, &quot;Everyone, whoever beheads Ding Lelay will be promoted to a full member of my celestial being organization, regardless of past achievements.&quot; The bloodthirsty lords were stunned for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Then howling wildly, he led his troops to charge towards Ding Lay. Seven or 800 troops besieged Ding Lays 300 troops. Dings eyes narrowed. Ding Lay, an insignificant newbie lord, can be crushed with a flick of the wrist. Boom! Another meteorite has fallen.</p>
<p>Black Flame hurriedly dodged, narrowly avoiding being hit by the meteorite. &quot;Holy crap!&quot; Black Flame, covered in soot and grime, was furious. What exactly happened? Lyn Sha sneered as he hacked at the enemy soldiers in front of him. Black Flame, you still have the leisure to worry about others. Go check on your own hero first.</p>
<p>What? Which hero is it? Black Flame turned his head in surprise. Not far away, the Templar Knights Commander Rum was engaged in a one-on-one duel with the golden armored general who had just led the Lynch knights in their charge. It seems that the two sides are evenly matched. Turning around again, Wuji Sword Saint Master E was dueling with Lin Xiaos white-clad hero. Master E was already covered in sweat, his hands holding the sword trembling uncontrollably, while the hero in white remained calm and composed, his hands even clasped behind his back.</p>
<p>Who exactly are you? I, the sword saint of Limitless, do not slay nameless ghosts. Master Yis voice trembled slightly. I&#x27;m just a wandering swordsman. the hero in white said calmly. &quot;All right, now I&#x27;m going to use my ultimate move.</p>
<p>Using this move, I have already slain 132 heroes. If you can&#x27;t catch it, you die. If you can catch it, I lose.&quot; Alpha Strike. Master E, wielding a long sword that gleamed with green light, moved with the speed of the wind, unleashing a series of slashes at the white-clad hero that made it impossible to see his figure. The hero in white simply shook his head.</p>
<p>I thought the hero who was called the Wuji sword saint was so powerful with a sword. You wasted all my time trying to see your swordsmanship and this is it. You dare to show off your meager skills before an expert. The ultimate path. Lord of 10,000 swords.</p>
<p>Faced with the streak of light, the whiteclad hero slowly extended his palm. His index and middle fingers joined together to form a sword-like gesture. And then he pinched forward. Bite. The offensive came to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>The Wuji sword saints slash was directly broken. His sword was actually caught between the fingers of the whiteclad hero. I lost. The sword saint of Wuji could only dejectedly let go. His tone filled with undisguised sorrow.</p>
<p>I am not worthy to be a sword saint. But you can see my sword. The white-clad hero spoke proudly. The sword saint of Wuji suddenly looked up. A streak of light, faster and brighter than his own attack, came hurtling towards him.</p>
<p>Alpha launched another surprise attack. But this one move was hundreds or thousands of times stronger than his own. The seven eyes of the sword saint were filled with sword shadows. All of them the sword trajectories that captivated him. This is the true method of alpha strike.</p>
<p>The next instant, a streak of blood splattered from his throat. With a satisfied smile, the sword saint of Wuji collapsed. &quot;Mastery!&quot; Black Flame shouted in disbelief. In the live stream, everyone was stunned. They still remember Gene Wuwangs previous explanation.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the Wuji Sword Saint E. This is an extremely powerful, epic quality hero in the official zone whose one-on-one combat ability is even stronger than many golden legendary heroes. Now, the Wuji Sword Saint, who had killed 132 enemy heroes, was actually killed by Lin Xiao&#x27;s whiteclad hero, Fongqing Yun, with his ultimate move. Just how strong is Lin Xiao&#x27;s whiteclad hero? It wouldn&#x27;t be an exaggeration to say that he&#x27;s the number one hero in one-on-one combat in the newbie zone of the LN region, would it? Pay Min, who had killed the sword saint of Wuji, gently placed the sword saints sword back on his corpse. Although we are rivals, I still retain the respect due to his swordsman.</p>
<p>Payman said softly. Then he walked step by step with his hands behind his back toward the Templar knights commander who was fighting Hua Sububing one-on-one. As Rahm rode his waror, he caught a glimpse of the murderer who had calmly killed Master walking toward him out of the corner of his eye. &quot;Stop!&quot; Rahm shouted. &quot;Stop! Chinese! I am engaged in a glorious duel with the leader of the Cullinan Iron Cavalry, God above.</p>
<p>No one is to interfere in our battle. The Western God has no say over me, the wandering knight of the east. Payman smiled and continued walking. Shameless. Do you think you can outnumber us? You have no sense of honor whatsoever.</p>
<p>He You&#x27;re wrong. I want to fight you oneon-one, not outnumber you. I refuse, Rom replied without hesitation. He had witnessed Pay Min effortlessly kill the sword saint of Limitless. The sword saint of Wuji is no weaker than him in one-on-one combat.</p>
<p>Fighting this young man in white is suicidal. But I was the one who ambushed you and knocked you off your horse while we were mixed in with the army. Didn&#x27;t you clamor to duel me? Aren&#x27;t you a nobleman who values honor the most? How can you not seek revenge? Payman smiled and walked closer. Now I&#x27;m here. Rom stood there stunned.</p>
<p>Stop! Black Flame shouted anxiously, quickly pushing aside the crusaders in front of him and rushing towards Rahm. Whoosh! A sword suddenly attacked from the side and Black Flame quickly dodged to the side. He turned around and found that it was Lin Sha who had bypassed the military unit and blocked his way. The two lords of this great battle finally clashed in close combat. &quot;Lyn Sha, you&#x27;re dead.&quot; Black Flame angrily raised his sword and slashed at Lin Sha.</p>
<p>Bite. Lyn Shao swung his hand upwards with a backhand flick, and the immense force sent the Black Flame staggering back several steps. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s combat strength is so much stronger than he imagined. Whoosh! At the same time, a huge meteorite trailing a long flame crashed into the Black Flame. Black Flame leaped and dodged in one fluid motion.</p>
<p>Then raised the sword in the stone again, channeling power into his arms and delivered a leaping slash towards Lyn Sha. Bite. Lyn Sha parried again, and the black flames were sent flying once more. His sword in the stone had lost most of its power, but his own hands were still shaken to their core. How can you be so strong? Whoosh! Another huge meteorite fell from the sky.</p>
<p>Black Flame dodged awkwardly once again. Then it suddenly dawned on me. Why does every time Lin Sha draws his sword, it&#x27;s accompanied by falling meteorites? Lyn Sha, did you sabotage this meteorite? You got it right. But there&#x27;s no reward. Lyn Sha lunged forward and slashed at the black flames with his sword.</p>
<p>A flash of black flame appeared dozens of meters away in an instant, questioning Lin Sha. Why? How do you have this ability? Aren&#x27;t you an F-rank piece of trash? Lynn Sha said calmly. Yes, my lordly talent is frank. But I am now also Lynn, the Grand Magister, the chosen one of the plains. Shiao.</p>
<p>Chapter 122. A hasty escape. The time for black flames has come. What nonsense are you spouting? Stop playing tricks on me. I am a level 63 lord in the official district.</p>
<p>I have more experience than you have. How could you possibly be my match? You must have used some skill or item that instantly boosts your combat power. It won&#x27;t last long. Black Flame cursed angrily and refusing to believe it, charged forward again, unleashing exquisite sword techniques and engaging Lyn Sha in a fierce battle. Lyn Sha calmly responded, and the two fought back and forth, locked in a fierce and evenly matched battle.</p>
<p>Although Black Flame was limited to level 30, at least he still had combat experience. lord talents and skills and was still powerful. After Lin Shao was possessed by the spirit of a certain emperor, his attributes increased dramatically. Furthermore, with Payman nearby and the added bonus of the sword Dao aura, dealing with the black flame was not a problem at all. The two sides exchanged blows in a short period of time, having already exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha couldn&#x27;t break through the black flames for a while, but he was able to suppress them, thinking that it was a good way to hone his skills in actual combat. Black flame grew increasingly alarmed as the fight progressed. He possessed a formidable set of exceptional armor, and the stone sword lent to him along with hundreds of battles under his belt. Yet, he was no match for Lyn Sha. He felt that Lyn Sha seemed to be better at fighting than him.</p>
<p>One wound after another was added to the black flames body. Boom, boom, boom. Several more meteorites crashed down, landing in the Black Flame army&#x27;s formation, causing another significant loss of Black Flame troops. Even the Templar commander Rahm was attacked by the meteor and had to spur his horse to dodge. As Black Flame grew increasingly disadvantaged, Payman strolled towards him at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>Rahm shouted, &quot;China, I was ambushed and injured by you. This duel is unfair. I&#x27;m waiting for you to challenge me in the official zone. After saying that, Ram took out a gem, crushed it, and then turned into a streak of light and disappeared. This payman shook his head.</p>
<p>This was the first time he had ever seen a hero abandon his lord and run away. The audience in the live stream had almost become numb. Since Lyn Sha appeared, strange things have been happening one after another. The Templar Knights commander, who kept talking about glory, was actually scared away by Lin Xiao&#x27;s white-clad hero. Remembering how he kept referring to China, everyone felt incredibly relieved.</p>
<p>The Templar Knights commander is a gold legendary hero. Such a highquality hero is definitely not something Black Flame can possess. The Gene family patriarch faithfully fulfilled his duty of explanation. This must be a hero lent to him by the Celestial Beings organization. And he even has life-saving items on him.</p>
<p>He I never expected that the Templar Knights Division Commander, a renowned legendary hero, would be so frightened by an unknown hero from the newbie zone that he fled in panic. When I meet those lords in Western Europe, I must give them a good slap on the shoulder. He Gene Wooang burst into laughter, seemingly releasing a long suppressed pentup frustration. Stop laughing, ancestor of the Gene family. Look at the situation on the battlefield.</p>
<p>From the live streams perspective after Rom escaped, the archer withdrew his sword and fell, killing the last shadow lurker. It&#x27;s so refreshing to stretch your muscles occasionally. Song Rui nodded to Lieng Long, the squad leader of the Guan Ning iron cavalry, who came to provide support, put away his bloodstained ring pommel sword, and slowly unloaded the giant crossbow from his back. A collapse. All the archers simultaneously lowered their giant crossbows and stomped on them.</p>
<p>Whating also raised the brianac he had borrowed from Chin Leongu and shouted, &quot;Gather!&quot; The sound of hooves thundered as the Guan Ning iron cavalry quickly formed ranks. Preparation. The Guan Ning cavalry formed a formation and began to slowly accelerate. With the divine crossbow raised his massive crossbow and aimed it at the legion of black flames. Put charge.</p>
<p>Two commands rang out simultaneously. 100 Guan Ning cavalrymen formed a swift and powerful torrent, swooping down once again. The archer with the sharpshooter pulled the trigger and arrows rained down, instantly piercing into the enemy ranks. Oh. Dozens of blazing spearmen and ironclad crusaders fell to the ground simultaneously.</p>
<p>Their prized armor offered almost no resistance against the armor-piercing attacks of the divine archers. The Guan Ning cavalry instantly accelerated, their thunderous hooves booming like thunder, cutting straight into the Templar knights ranks, who were blocked and unable to move by the Emo Dao iron guards. Kill. The Guan Ning cavalry had no time to reload their three-eyed musketss, nor did they attempt to use their lances against the heavily armored knights. They simply swung their three-eyed musketss and smashed them down.</p>
<p>Thump! A loud explosion rang out. The war horses of the Guan Ning cavalry crashed heavily into the Templar Knights Warh horses, which had come to a standstill. Head-on clash, the dynamic waror rammed and won against the stationary warhorse. The blunt weapon, comparable to a spiked club, struck the Templar knight, piercing his armor and knocking him off his horse roar. Seeing that there were more strong reinforcements, the iron guards with their Mod Dao swords erupted once again, slashing and hacking with their Mod Dao swords, blood spurting out.</p>
<p>Pay Min, now without an opponent, has arrived at the main battlefield and joined the battle. His sword energy is unstoppable, and with a single move, a white light flashes, knocking down several soldiers. Lyn Sha also swung his sword, forcing the Black Flames to retreat repeatedly. &quot;Black Flame, your death is near.&quot; The meteorite pierced the sky and crashed down, causing the Black Flame Legion to scream in agony. I don&#x27;t know when it happened, but the balance of power on the battlefield has shifted.</p>
<p>The Black Flame Legion&#x27;s long bowman, Dwarven Mountain Warriors, and Shadow Lurkers have all been wiped out. The sword saint of Wuji has been killed and Ganu was stabbed to death by Chin Yu. The Templar commander fled, leaving fewer than 30 Templar knights remaining. The Blazing Sun Spearman and the Iron Wall Crusaders were reduced to less than 40% after being struck by Lyn Xiao&#x27;s meteorite. Lyn Ziao&#x27;s troops, however, suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Now the archers and the Guan Ning cavalry are free to join forces to besiege the remnants of the Black Flame army. It&#x27;s clear to everyone that Black Flame is now completely at a disadvantage and defeat is imminent. Lynn Shiao, you force me to this. Black Flame understood his predicament. He raised the sword in the stone, its blade pointing towards the sky.</p>
<p>Summon the sword spirit. The sword and the stone lit up and a beam of light shot into the sky. pointing towards the heavens. Black flame grinned maliciously. Lynn Shia, the sword spirit is sealed within the sword in the stone.</p>
<p>Once the sword spirit is unleashed, it will slaughter within a 100 miles. He won&#x27;t return until he&#x27;s killed enough. I&#x27;ll make you and everyone in this newbie zone perish with you. What? We&#x27;re still watching the live stream while munching on sunflower seeds. We&#x27;re shocked.</p>
<p>Black flame, you shameless bastard. You can&#x27;t accept defeat. You can&#x27;t handle this, so you flip the table. That&#x27;s shameless. Calm down.</p>
<p>You still have several hundred troops and over a thousand Blood Lord troops in Lyn Xiao&#x27;s rear. And Ding Lay is about to be defeated. You still have hope. Don&#x27;t give up. Instead, some people in the live stream tried to persuade Black Flame.</p>
<p>He he holy crap. What are you laughing at, you old geyser? You&#x27;re only laughing when you&#x27;re not in this newbie zone. Gene Wuang said, &quot;This does have the style of the Heavenly People organization. It&#x27;s shameless, and I like it, ancestor. What do you mean you like that? I&#x27;m about to explode with anxiety.</p>
<p>Everyone, think of something quick. What should we do?&quot; The crowd chattered on and on like ants on a hot plate for quite some time. Suddenly, it dawned on me that the black flame summoning sword spirit had an excessively long wind up. Everyone looked towards the live stream. On the battlefield, time seemed to stand still.</p>
<p>Black flame held his sword, pointing it at the sky. The light of the sword in the stone slowly dimmed, but the sword&#x27;s spirit did not seem to have emerged yet. A silence seemed to fall over the room. Lyn Sha narrowed his eyes and stared at him coldly. Are your hands tired? Black flame, should we wait a little longer? Black flame.</p>
<p>A Lsha, what trick have you used now? Why can&#x27;t I summon the sword spirit? I&#x27;ve already said it. It&#x27;s because I am now the chosen one of this plane. Lynn Shiao said expressionlessly. The blade spirit wouldn&#x27;t dare come out and give me experience points. You? What nonsense are you spouting now? Boom.</p>
<p>A bolt of lightning streaked across the sky. The sky, which was already covered with dark clouds, turned as black as ink at some point, and a torrential downpour began. The strange movements in the sky startled everyone. While black flame was filled with doubt and uncertainty. The time has come.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha raised the crimson sky sword and a streak of light flashed past. A sword comes from the east. The black flames collapsed instantly. Chapter 123. The counterattack in the valley.</p>
<p>Something extraordinary. Black flame fell utterly dead. The audience in the live stream fell silent. But the battle is not over yet. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s troops had surrounded the remnants of Black Flame&#x27;s army.</p>
<p>The two sides were evenly matched in number, but it was a one-sided crushing defeat. Without the Lord&#x27;s bonus and the hero&#x27;s bonus, they managed to turn a winning game into a losing one. The remaining troops suffered a significant drop in attributes and were completely routed. The outcome is decided. Lyn Sha slowly put away the Crimson Sky Sword.</p>
<p>He no longer needed to participate in the battle. Pay Minodded to Lin Sha, took out a twisted little monster from his pocket, and threw it into the remaining crusaders. The little monster suddenly grew and transformed into a giant demon with many tentacles. Nest demon. The nest demon twisted and thrashed about, slapping with its tentacles, opening its enormous mouth to spew out acidic liquid, and frantically attacking the enemy forces.</p>
<p>The level 30 epic unit, the nest demon, was originally only on par with the black flames epic units. But with this shift in power, how could the remnants of the army, who had no will to fight, possibly be a match for the ferocious demons? The nest demons rampaged through the enemy ranks, replenishing their energy with flesh and blood and rapidly eroding the remaining sparse resistance. Here, dozens of bloodthirsty lords along with their troops had already entered Calabash Valley. He was speechless, stunned. They had just painstakingly entered the valley when they saw Lynn Shiao kill Black Flame in the live stream.</p>
<p>Black Flame is dead. Should we still fight this war? Someone hesitated. Fight. Why aren&#x27;t we fighting? Do you want to climb the mountain again? Don&#x27;t tell me there&#x27;s a beautiful heroine waiting for you on the mountaintop. Dozens of fierce barbarian spearmen could easily kill even dwarves.</p>
<p>Do you want to go up the mountain to your death? It&#x27;s too late to surrender. Lyn Sha never seems to accept surrender. This the blood lord hesitated. Lyn Sha went out of the lord&#x27;s mansion to fight. And it will take him some time to kill the black flame soldiers and get back.</p>
<p>The only way now is to charge through, destroy the mines occupied by Lin Shiao, take down Lin Xiaos base, kidnap the farmers and other remaining units, and negotiate with Lin Shiao. The man said, &quot;If we&#x27;re lucky, we might be able to choke Lin Shiao and force him to submit.&quot; &quot;Good. The blood lords are a group of people who live on the edge of a knife. Almost every one of them has blood on their hands and bears the punishment given by the god system. Some of them even have red names which they can&#x27;t escape rather than running away and hiding.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s better to just kill them. The group immediately took action. They entered the valley which was surrounded by numerous mineral veins. These mineral veins all indicate that Lynn Shiao is the occupant, but they are completely deserted. This guy has taken over quite a few mines.</p>
<p>And to guard against our sneak attacks, the farmers have all evacuated. The group continued onward but saw no living beings. Be careful. Keep an eye on things. Someone reminded me.</p>
<p>Oh my. Is there a witch waving at us ahead? A lord with the special ability of far-sightedness immediately noticed the anomaly using his talent. Wow. Dozens of bloodthirsty witches. They&#x27;re really pretty.</p>
<p>Are they dissatisfied with Lin Shia and want to join us? I once read a line in a novel. The taste of a witch is really good. We&#x27;re going that way anyway. Why don&#x27;t we guys give it a try? Shut up. Do you still have time for that? Let&#x27;s fight our way through and sweep all the way to Lord Lin Xiaos manner.</p>
<p>The blood lords, numbering over a thousand, were utterly unafraid of the witch and marched off in a mighty force. Sherry, it seems your beauty isn&#x27;t working. A cyclops hiding behind the witch Sherry whispered, &quot;They don&#x27;t seem to be here to do anything to you. They seem to be here to do anything to you. Shut up.</p>
<p>Vulgar and disgusting. Shirley was furious. They&#x27;re all going to die anyway. They dare to break into their master&#x27;s backyard, burn, kill, and loot. Ask any of the native monsters here if they&#x27;d agree to it.</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, the marching army of the blood lords was suddenly attacked. Behind the once deserted mine, in the woods, and under the boulders, waves of all sorts of monsters emerged. cavemen, orcs, cobalts, red goblins, centaurs, porcupines, and even horned demons and monsters. All these demonic forces suddenly appeared and besieged the blood lord&#x27;s army. Ambush! Watch out! What&#x27;s going on? Lyn Shia has so many different types of troops lying in ambush here.</p>
<p>Some people resisted while shouting in surprise, &quot;Shut up! We are not part of anyone&#x27;s military. We are free natives.&quot; A porcupine man shot out sharp spikes while howling. Then why did you attack us? Our Lord is wise and mighty. He is our savior. Under his rule, we live in peace and prosperity with plenty of food and clothing, enjoying a wonderful and tranquil life.</p>
<p>If you dare to ambush him, you are going against millions of our kind-hearted indigenous people. You dare to ambush him, you&#x27;re asking for our deaths. We will absolutely not allow anyone to harm our lord in the slightest. The bloodthirsty lords. Damn it.</p>
<p>Did I hear that right? The monster said they were living a wonderful and peaceful life. They even say Lynn Shiao is the savior of them. These free natives you experience packs and loot drops actually recognize the person who wants to kill you as your savior. The crowd couldn&#x27;t believe it. They had never seen a wild monster and its lord coexist peacefully.</p>
<p>A fierce demon suddenly charged out, killing several types of soldiers. Even unruly monsters like demons listened to him. He You heard me right. The witch Sherry, accompanied by the cyclops, also gathered around. Your master&#x27;s abilities are beyond your imagination.</p>
<p>You cannot even imagine the mercy of your master. Now prepare to die. The witch drew her dagger and closed in on one soldier after another, her graceful figure coiling around them like a python. her slender fingers caressing them like a lovers before slicing them to the throat with a single blow. The cyclops lifted a giant rock and hurled it into the enemy ranks.</p>
<p>Under the combined attack of the monsters, the blood lord suffered heavy casualties in a short time. Run, split up and run. The blood lord fled in panic. Someone ran deep into the forest and only a few screams were heard before silence fell. Some people in a panic ran hap-hazardly to the gates of Linhao&#x27;s territory and before they could even catch their breath, boom.</p>
<p>The exploding arrow tower fired arrows, instantly turning these lucky individuals into dust. The last bloodthirsty lord collapsed to the ground, looking at the slowly approaching witch and asked in a trembling voice, &quot;Why? Why do you all listen to Lyn Sha? Even the demons listen to Lyn Sha.&quot; Eh, I might as well tell you a secret I overheard by accident. Sherry approached with cat-like steps, the dagger spinning and leaping in her hand. A high-ranking abyssal demon with a broken horn once said. Sherry&#x27;s red lips drew near the lord&#x27;s ear, her voice magnetic and melodious.</p>
<p>He said that the succubus princess wants to marry our lord. So, isn&#x27;t it reasonable for a mid-level demon like me and those irritable low-level demons to obey their master? What this? Sherry&#x27;s dagger flashed. The Lord fell and the live stream ended. The viewers in the live stream were all bewildered. I think I just heard something incredible.</p>
<p>Chapter 124. Lucio&#x27;s power. Dinglays choice. The fighting on the main battlefield has ended. With the addition of the Grand Magus, the son of the plane, Lin Sha is confident that even if Black Flames forces increase several times over, he can annihilate the invading enemy.</p>
<p>However, some of their own troops will inevitably suffer losses. Lucio&#x27;s joining was a pleasant surprise. Lyn Sha strolled slowly across the final battlefield, surrounded by powerful soldiers such as the Emo Dao Iron Guards who were engaged in their final hunt. Meteorites still fall from the sky from time to time. Lynn Shiao discovered that as long as he appeared on the battlefield, meteorites would randomly fall, one after another, seemingly endless.</p>
<p>Each one possesses the power of a highle magic meteor spell several dozen levels high. Lyn Sha walked forward with his hands behind his back and his head held high. Behind him, meteors and fire rained down continuously, and the entire battlefield had turned into a sea of fire. He paid no attention to the fighting around him, strolling leisurely, as awe inspiring and unapproachable as a true emperor. After I transferred Ba&#x27;s fortune, and with the Chi-Cha sword&#x27;s 100% battlefield fortune bonus, it&#x27;s only natural that Lucio would be willing to lend me his power temporarily.</p>
<p>No matter what, the Chi-Cha sword was the sword of Lu&#x27;s ancestor when he founded the country, which should also be an important reason for attracting Lucio.

<p>My skills in mixed martial arts and full weapon control have both been upgraded. Battle is indeed the best teacher. Although Black Flame is level 30 and has an excellent armor set and a good sword, his attributes are no match for mine after Lucio possesses me. With the added bonus of my set and the terrifying 50 to all three attributes from the Crimson Sky Sword, he has no chance at all. As expected of the chosen one of the planes, this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen someone with 500 more soul points.</p>
<p>The soul, the most mysterious attribute on the battlefield of all races, is categorized by some as fate and by others as magic. I think luck also plays a part. Lynn Sha let his thoughts wander as he walked in the opposite direction from his own lord&#x27;s manner. &quot;Oh, right, Pay Min, why don&#x27;t you lead the troops to clean up the battlefield? We can&#x27;tt leave behind Black Flames good equipment.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; Pay Min replied. &quot;I should go see my old rival.&quot; Lyn Sha gradually walked away.</p>
<p>After Black Flame&#x27;s death, the blood lord&#x27;s ranks were thrown into chaos. His numerous live streaming rooms were no longer being attended to by his subordinates. They even forgot they were still streaming, focusing only on escaping and fighting. As one lord after another fell, only one perspective remained in the live stream. The last perspective of the area where Ding Lay was fighting.</p>
<p>Everyone who was paying attention to this great battle flocked in. On the battlefield, chaos reigned. Ding Lay was covered in blood, wounded in multiple places. His armor was torn, and his long sword was almost blunt. All his heroes had perished, and the troops he led had been reduced to only a few dozen men.</p>
<p>The besieging blood lords still have several members remaining along with over 300 soldiers. He Ding Lelay parried an attack from a bloodthirsty lord and laughed. Didn&#x27;t you guys watch the live stream? Black Flame is dead. He died like a clown. His promises to you have expired.</p>
<p>So what&#x27;s the point of continuing the fight? It&#x27;s all your fault, you shameless traitor. The most vicious attacker of Ding Lay was the fat guy who had always been at odds with Dinglay. He and his shadow fiend hero worked together to kill Ding Lays hero and severely injured Dinglay. The fat man whose face was already covered in scars now looked even more ferocious like a demon from hell and snarled. If it weren&#x27;t for you, you traitor Chufinga and the others wouldn&#x27;t have escaped.</p>
<p>We rushed up to support Lord Black Flame a long time ago. With more than a thousand of us, Lord Black Flame can kill Lin Shia. Uggh. It&#x27;s all your fault. The fat man frantically slashed at Ding Lay, seemingly possessed.</p>
<p>Black Flame is dead, and we blood lords will definitely be punished. I&#x27;m doomed, but I&#x27;ll take you down with me. Dingle&#x27;s fighting skills were among the top tier in the beginner zone. Even though he was seriously injured, he managed to block all of the fat man&#x27;s attacks. He seized the opportunity, raised his foot, and kicked the fat man away.</p>
<p>But at that moment, a shadow demon appeared behind him and suddenly attacked from the shadows, piercing Ding Lays left leg. Ding Lay collapsed to the ground in pain and in the process stabbed Shadow Demon with his knife. The Shadow Fiend howled and used Shadow Escape to escape. Several soldiers came to Ding lays rescue but were brutally killed by the fat man who arrived at the scene. He rushed towards Ding lay step by step constantly killing the soldiers who came to his rescue.</p>
<p>Finally, all the troops were wiped out and the bloodthirsty lords surrounded them. Only Ding Lay remained, slumped on the ground. Dinglay, do you have any last words before you die? The fat man stared fiercely at Dinglay. Dinglay opened his mouth, a mouthful of blood spilling from the corner of his lips. He laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m so damn unlucky. H scared now. I&#x27;m so unlucky that I have to die on the same day as you bunch of trash. You bunch of goodfor-no trash who only know how to ambush your own kind. You&#x27;re not even as good as a cesspool.</p>
<p>At least your can be used as fertilizer, but your rotting flesh is something even your own mother would despise. You bunch of trash should go back to the original chaotic abyss and see if anyone wants you. You. You. The fat man was so angry he was practically fuming.</p>
<p>His finger trembled as he pointed at Ding Lay, unable to utter a single complete sentence. The audience in the live stream was so shocked that they fell silent. I never expected Ding Lay, who always presents a virtuous and positive image, to be so scathing in his insults. Is this is this his lord&#x27;s talent? I don&#x27;t think so. It&#x27;s more like he&#x27;s given up and doesn&#x27;t care anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe his lordly talent doesn&#x27;t allow him to swear. In the discussion room, &quot;You, you, you.&quot; The fat man finally uttered a complete sentence. &quot;You bastard. What&#x27;s the use of cursing me? You&#x27;re going to die anyway.&quot; Lynn shall never accept surrender. Whether I kill you or not, you&#x27;re doomed.</p>
<p>Who said I was going to surrender? Dingle caught up in his rant. went straight to the point. I&#x27;d rather die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die outside jump off this cliff we will absolutely not surrender to Lyn Sha good you&#x27;ve got guts thanks Dinglay replied casually then paused taken a back came from behind Dinglay turned around and the fat man also froze looking at the distance walked over with his hands behind his back his face expressionless the battlefield fell silent instantly everyone stopped and stared blankly at Lyn Sha Lynn In Shiao, you dare come alone? Are you here to die? The fat man roared and charged forward. All the bloodthirsty lords and troops charged forward. Lyn Shia gave a cold snort and slowly drew his crimson sky sword.</p>
<p>He unleashed another sword strike from the east, transforming himself and his sword into a streak of light. This time, however, its power is greater than ever before. Lucio&#x27;s skill, bravery, recorded in the Chinese classic book of the later Han. Sun and he also sent several thousand soldiers to fight. Emperor Guang Wu fled and beheaded dozens of them.</p>
<p>Lucio was able to single-handedly killed dozens of enemy soldiers amidst thousands of troops, making his personal marshall prowess among the top of all emperors throughout history. When Lucio fights against the enemy alone, his four attributes can all break through the limits of ordinary people. The host who possesses him will enjoy an additional 100% bonus to all attributes on the basis of the original additional attributes. As the light faded, blood splattered. The final image that everyone in the live stream saw was Lin Sha standing proudly with his back to the live stream, looking calm and collected.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, no one else stood. Chapter 125. There&#x27;s such a superpower. Can you become stronger just by showing off? Ding lay sat half on the ground. Blood continuously oozing from the corners of his mouth and the wounds on his body.</p>
<p>Normally, with such severe injuries, he should not have been able to hold on. He smiled bitterly as he watched Lynn Sha slowly approach him, then sit down cross-legged and quietly watch him like an old friend. They neither took action nor left. Are you here to laugh at me? Why haven&#x27;t you made a move yet? Dinglay said calmly. Like those bloodthirsty lords, I also used a slaying talisman on you.</p>
<p>You could have easily killed me. Lynn shouted not respond to Ding Lay, but instead asked, &quot;With such severe injuries, you should have given up long ago. Why are you still able to talk to me?&quot; Ding Lay turned his head away. This is none of your business. The live stream is now closed.</p>
<p>If I leave you here, I won&#x27;t do anything. Lynsha said, &quot;You&#x27;ll die just like everyone else once your talent effect wears off.&quot; Dinglay suddenly turned around and looked at Lynsha. His eyes flickered as if he had something to say, but he held back. &quot;Are you betting that I don&#x27;t know about your lordly talent?&quot; Lyn Sha said calmly, &quot;You&#x27;re betting I just said it off hand.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re about to die? Why do you still care about these things?&quot; &quot;I do care. Since I&#x27;m going to die anyway, I want to retain some dignity,&quot; Ding Lay said.</p>
<p>They said, &quot;Lynn Sha never accepts surrender. If you want to kill me, then kill me, but don&#x27;t try to humiliate me. I&#x27;m a prominent figure at Jangdong number one high school, and I won&#x27;t do anything like begging for mercy.&quot; Lyn Sha scoffed. I&#x27;ve only killed a few people, and you&#x27;re already labeling me like this. Everyone used to think you were a virtuous and upright gentleman.</p>
<p>Dinglay opened his mouth, wanting to speak, but then held back. He couldn&#x27;t figure out what Lin Sha was up to. So, he kept quiet, hoping to retain some dignity. I see you&#x27;re eager to die, partly because you don&#x27;t want to be humiliated, and partly because of the harsh words you just said in the live stream, right? Lynn Sha chuckled and said, &quot;Even if you die outside, you&#x27;d rather jump down than surrender. The effect of those harsh words has kept you going until now.</p>
<p>But if you actually surrender, the buff will disappear and you will die immediately. Am I right? Lynn Sha spoke slowly and deliberately, but Dinglays expression gradually darkened. How do you know so much? Dinglay asked. It&#x27;s very simple. Observe, summarize, and analyze.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha sat comfortably cross-legged opposite Ding Lay, his Crimson Sky sword sheathed and tucked into his waistband. His well-fitting dark armor combined with his handsome appearance and calm expression made Ding Lay feel envious. I have reviewed all your public statements and performances. From the moment you entered the newbie zone, you started to show off in a high-profile manner, created an alliance, and even tried to mediate between me and Xiao Daton. Although you took sides, you did want to become a respected person in the newbie zone.</p>
<p>Then there&#x27;s your encounter with Tu Sha by Chien, and you even started a live stream to fight the death knight. I&#x27;m wondering why you had to do it. Liv, your actions against the blood lord are all aimed at accumulating reputation. In addition, someone gave me some detailed information about Black Flame, which even included your performance during your school days. Who gave it to you? Dinglay asked the question, looking slightly nervous.</p>
<p>In short, she is a very powerful person. Her influence far surpasses that of you and me. Lyn Sha continued the topic directly, explaining in detail. You are considered one of the top students in school, but your identity and status are relatively confidential. You are definitely not a high-profile person, plus your terrible skills.</p>
<p>Based on all this information, I can conclude that you only became high-profile after you awakened your lord talent. And your lord talent is related to being high-profile. In other words, it&#x27;s related to showing off. After speaking, Dinglay fell into a long silence. After a long while, he raised his head and Lyn Sha was still looking at him calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, you guessed right. But what does that have to do with you?&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s very simple,&quot; Lyn Sha said. &quot;You don&#x27;t know how to show off. But I do, and I&#x27;m very good at it. So, I&#x27;ll save your life.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll join me. Become my vassel lord. Then I&#x27;ll teach you how to be cool, and you&#x27;ll become very powerful. This is also very beneficial to me. After all, I have gained a powerful henchman like you.</p>
<p>Of course, for the sake of the final result, our relationship can be kept secret. Ding Lays eyes suddenly sharpened. Is this really true? I, Lynn Sha, never break my word. Ding Lays pupils trembled, and his breathing became slightly rapid. It was clear that he was tempted.</p>
<p>Just then, Dinglay suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood. Heihei, Dinglay said with a bitter laugh. Lin Shia, you have already proven your strength in the battle just now. If you can make me stronger, I have no objection to becoming your vassel lord. You were right just now.</p>
<p>My lord talent is a level soul of glory. This talent requires me to constantly maintain a high profile in order to preserve and improve my combat power. Dinglay showed Lynn Shia his talent introduction interface and at the same time his aura visibly weakened. My current talent effect is about to disappear and my death is imminent. If you really have a way to make me stronger, then watch now.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao didn&#x27;t look up, but quietly looked at Ding Lays talent introduction. Although the description given by the god system was very literary, Lyn Sha still summarized it in the simplest plain language. You can become stronger just by showing off. Successfully showing off increases four main attributes: health, attack power, critical hit rate, and defense. The more impressive the display, the higher the bonus and the longer the duration.</p>
<p>If you successfully show off all the time, some attributes can even get a permanent boost. Moreover, for certain types of showing off, it seems that as long as people are still spreading the story and being shocked by it, the effect of showing off will last forever. No wonder Ding Lelay had to boast about his A-level talent as soon as he entered the battlefield of 10,000 races. It turns out that boasting really does make him stronger. No wonder he always kept a straight face.</p>
<p>He wanted to maintain his image. No wonder he streamed himself when he challenged the death knight. Some people said he was so good that he could cut the death knight in one blow, while others doubted him and he would get cut in return. Defeat Julie and others single-handedly after establishing his reputation in the newbie zone. But after his reputation collapsed, he couldn&#x27;t even defeat a dozen bloodthirsty lords.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was still too inexperienced and couldn&#x27;t quite grasp the essence of it. That&#x27;s why he failed. When he finally failed, he abandoned all pretenses and image and started cursing. All the guesses were confirmed. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s inner monologue.</p>
<p>Damn, isn&#x27;t this the template for a web novel protagonist? With this talent, if given to a modern time traveler, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be much worse than his own eternal peace. Seeing Ding Lays breath growing weaker and weaker, Lynn Shiao smiled slightly. Just follow me. As long as you learn from me, you&#x27;ll have endless opportunities to show off. Don&#x27;t put it so harshly.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the spirit of glory. Isn&#x27;t this just showing off? Save your last breath and don&#x27;t die. I&#x27;ll teach you right now. crude and vulgar. Lyn Shaol leaned closer to Ding Lay and slowly read aloud a passage.</p>
<p>Chapter 126. Only today do I realize who I am. The great battle between Lin Sha and Black Flame has come to a complete end. The last live broadcast also came to a stunning close as Lin Sha swept away all his enemies with a single sword strike from the east. But the people, still eager for more, didn&#x27;t leave.</p>
<p>They went to the chat channel and discussed what they had just seen and heard. Incredible. Absolutely incredible. I actually stumbled upon an event where a novice lord supposedly had a success rate of only 0.01% to defeat a lord from the official district. And I even witnessed it all myself.</p>
<p>I saw it, too. Lyn Shiao is really awesome. That&#x27;s right. In terms of troop types, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s troop types completely crush Black Flames epic troop types. In terms of strategy, Lin Shiao countered every move from the front lines to the rear, blocking all of Black Flame&#x27;s attacks.</p>
<p>Compared to other heroes, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s whiteclad hero could easily kill Wuji Sword Si. In terms of individual strength, Lin Shiao is capable of one-on-one combat, even single-handedly taking down one or 200 lords and troops who were besieging Ding Lay with a single sword strike. I declare Lin Sha to be the undisputed big boss. After the battle, even in the chat channel, everyone started referring to Lin Shia as big boss. Do you need to announce this? Someone mocked.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia is more than just a big shot. I think he&#x27;s a truly unparalleled genius. He only has an F-rank talent, yet he was able to defeat the level 63 Black Flame and so many golden legendary and epic units in the official zone. Someone sighed. I really don&#x27;t know how boss Lyn Shao did it.</p>
<p>Why is he so strong? Why are his heroes and troops so strong? And even that useless old devil Jean can&#x27;t recognize boss Lin Xiaos troops. Gene Wuang, I haven&#x27;t left yet. Can&#x27;t you all show some respect to me, the Chief Lord? Why aren&#x27;t you going home yet? Gene Wuang, I am waiting for Lin Sha to tell me the secret of the Cullinan Iron Cavalry. The crowd said,&quot;Old man, you really are a thief who never leaves empty-handed, and you&#x27;re shameless enough to ask Lyn Shiao for military secrets after he killed your descendants.&quot; Gene Wuang, shut up. I&#x27;m doing this for the greater good of Lang Shia.</p>
<p>Everyone, yes, yes, yes. Gene Wuang kept making wrong predictions, and since his clones weren&#x27;t very effective, people in the live stream who knew him actually dared to joke about him. Lyn Xiaos Cullinan cavalry is indeed powerful. This self-created unit is too strong, a genius&#x27;s exclusive, someone said in front of the great Lin Sha, all so-called geniuses pale in comparison. What about Pan Shan Yu, the king of Julie, who ranked second, fourth, and fifth in the second tier universities? He&#x27;s considered a genius in the Jong Dong newbie zone, right? He was instantly defeated by Ding Lay.</p>
<p>So, Ding Lay is considered a genius, right? I saw some people comparing him to Lyn Sha, even saying that Ding Lay is more powerful than Lyn Sha, but Ding Lay can&#x27;t defeat those dozen or so bloodthirsty lords and their troops. Boss Lyn Sha could kill them with a single sword strike. That&#x27;s right. Who&#x27;s as good as Lyn Sha? Lyn Shia is a peerless genius. Human nature is indeed complex.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao was looked down upon and despised before the war, but now he is praised by many people. These people seem to have forgotten that they were the ones who were most vocal when they were praising Ding Lelay and criticizing Lyn Shao. Two Shawn Bachen who were receiving treatment under the care of the flower fairy and the healing effects of the territory couldn&#x27;t help but twist their lips into a grotesque smile when they saw the crazy flattery in the chat channel. If Lin Shiao hadn&#x27;t already privately messaged them, telling them not to speak carelessly in the chat channel and that he would explain later at the meeting, the two of them would have already joined the chat channel to mock everyone&#x27;s opportunistic behavior while enjoying their praise. By the way, where&#x27;s Dinglay? When talking about geniuses, some people think of Ding Lay, a genius from the same district.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia used his final sword strike to kill the last person broadcasting live and then shut down the live stream. But no death warning for Ding Lay has ever appeared. &quot;Ding Llay isn&#x27;t dead yet,&quot; someone exclaimed. &quot;That despicable man. We trusted him so much before.</p>
<p>I thought he was the most just and prestigious lord in our newbie zone. Someone who stood up for all newbies and was dedicated to eliminating evil and wickedness. I never expected to be fooled by him. He&#x27;s actually on the blood lord&#x27;s side. He&#x27;s probably killed quite a few newbie lords.</p>
<p>Yes, he was actually putting on an act with the blood lords. No wonder he knew so many hidden blood lords. Well, you can&#x27;t say that. I guess Ding Lay had his own reasons. Didn&#x27;t he break with Black Flame in the end? He fought against nearly a thousand blood lords and troops all by himself.</p>
<p>I also think Ding Lay was forced onto this pirate ship. If Dinglay doesn&#x27;t turn against us, things might get a bit complicated for boss Lin Sha. What&#x27;s the trouble? Is it possible that boss Lynn Sha can&#x27;t defeat these little Kurami bloodthirsty lords? That&#x27;s true, but Dinglay has already used his own death. Huh? Dinglay isn&#x27;t dead yet. I remember he said he wanted to surrender.</p>
<p>His last words were that even if he died, even if he died outside, even if he jumped off this building, he would never surrender to boss Lyn Sha. He was quite ambitious. The crowd was somewhat puzzled. The current situation is that there is no live broadcast, no explanation from the parties involved and no system notification. So the public has not yet gotten any updates on the outcome of this feud between the two.</p>
<p>So what exactly is the connection between Ding Lelay and boss Lyn Shia? Well, just then a faint sigh rang out. The ID is actually Dinglay. The chat channel was immediately filled with surprise. Before anyone could ask a question, Ding Lay said quietly, &quot;My lords, Ding Llay has been enlightened by Brother Lin Shiao and has become sworn brothers with him.&quot; &quot;The past mistakes are in the past. I have never killed a good person apart from Brother Lin Shiao.</p>
<p>I, Ding Lay, have never harmed any good person. From now on, I am reborn. I am not merely Lin Xiaos sword and blade. I am still Ding Lay, fighting for justice. I will forever be on the path of eradicating evil.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned for a moment. Then someone said, &quot;Lynn Shia actually let Dinglay go.&quot; Looks like Lynn Shia and Ding Lay have become sworn brothers. Wow, I&#x27;m so envious of Ding Lay. What Dinglay said makes some sense. He really hasn&#x27;t killed any good people.</p>
<p>If Boss Lynn shall forgive him, then let&#x27;s forgive him, too. No, Dinglay said slowly. I don&#x27;t need your forgiveness. The chat channel suddenly went silent. Ding Lay slowly recited.</p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have cultivated good deeds and have never loved killing or arson. Suddenly, the golden rope is broken and the jade lock is shattered. Ah, the tide of the Chintang River is coming and only today do I realize who I am. Ladies and gentlemen, I have found myself. From now on, I will become stronger.</p>
<p>Everyone, please look forward to my performance. No one spoke for a long time. Ding Lays casually uttered words, neatly arranged and easy to recite, simply described his actions, and expressed his transformation. The way he condensed numerous events into short sentences, even sounded somewhat philosophical. This strange way of expressing himself evoked a strange sense of familiarity in everyone along with a vague feeling of excitement and joy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like regaining lost wealth. The tide comes in on the Chantang River, and only today do I realize who I am. The crowd pondered the words, savoring them as they came to mind, while a multitude of thoughts raced through their minds. Dingle is truly a dragon among men. To be able to create such a sentence, Dinglay is not bad either.</p>
<p>Although he can&#x27;t compare to Lin Sha, his words are so philosophical. He deserves to be called a genius who can take on three people at once. Perhaps Dinglay is also a genius of his generation. His magnanimity when he said that he did not need to be forgiven proves his inner strength. Over here, Dinglay felt his injuries healing steadily and his physical condition improving rapidly.</p>
<p>He recovered quickly. Soon, his body reached its peak, the level it had when he single-handedly fought three geniuses. Soon, my body had reached an unprecedented level of strength, and I felt full of power. The current Mi can easily defeat the Mi at my peak. Ding Lay raised his head, his eyes blazing with fury, and looked at Lin Sha with a stern expression.</p>
<p>Just by reciting the so-called poems you gave me, you can exert such power. Chapter 127. Subduing Ding Lay and colluding with the Demon Clan. Just by reciting the so-called poems you gave me, you can exert such power. As Dinglay spoke, he looked at Lyn Sha in front of him with a cold expression.</p>
<p>As his condition improved, he gradually regained his superior demeanor. Lyn Sha was over 1.8 m tall, but Ding Lay, who was standing up, was even taller than him. He looked down at Lyn Sha, exuding a sense of oppression. Lynn Shao remained unmoved, merely tilting his head slightly to look at Ding Lay and said calmly, &quot;Of course, this kind of poetry has a fatal attraction for the people of Lshia, and you&#x27;ve seen the result. Moreover, what I&#x27;m telling you isn&#x27;t even a poem.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s at most a verse, just from a popular novel, not worth a second glance. Before true poetry, the power of your glorious spirit will exceed your wildest imagination. Do you know that my current strength has become so great that even I am shocked? Dinglay took a step forward indifferently, heading towards Lin Shiao. I think I can now put up a fight against Black Flame. Lyn Xiaos lips curled into a slight smile.</p>
<p>So So Dinglay stared intently at Lin Sha for a few seconds. Then he prostrated himself, knelt on one knee, and lowered his head toward Lin Shao. I, Ding Lay, am willing to become Lin Xiaos vassel Lord. unconditionally and sign a vassal lord contract. All conditions are to be decided by Lynn Sha.</p>
<p>Very good. Lyn Sha nodded. You will learn a saying. Those who understand the times are the heroes. Lyn Sha immediately found a three-year vassal lord contract in the main god system space and made the strictest restrictions in the contract.</p>
<p>All acts of betrayal by vassal lords are subject to the highest level of punishment. Furthermore, it is stipulated that upon the expiration of the contract, the lord has the right to choose to renew it and the vassel lord cannot refuse. Dinglay is not like tu shan by chien heay or chining. Although I also saved Dinglays life, his superpowers dictate that he will only keep showing off and keep on the path of showing off even more. If Ding Lay can ever surpass himself, that will be the greatest success in his life.</p>
<p>By then, will Ding Lace still listen to me? Or will he simply use me as a stepping stone on his path to showing off? Lynn Shia never tests human nature. He only goes along with it. This most stringent vassal lord contract was then presented to Ding Lay, who was kneeling on one knee. Dingle looked at it carefully without any emotional fluctuation and signed the contract directly. Lyn Shao breathed a slight sigh of relief.</p>
<p>If Ding Lay doesn&#x27;t even look at it, then he must have ulterior motives and he absolutely cannot be kept. Ding Lay carefully read the contract, which shows that he took the matter seriously. On the surface, he seemed to be sincere. I like using sharp knives, even though there&#x27;s a risk of cutting my hand. Lin Shiao said calmly.</p>
<p>One day, you will realize how right your choice was. Let&#x27;s go. Come with me to my territory. It&#x27;s necessary to discuss what to do next with Lin Xiaos team. After signing the vassal lord contract, the price of Ding Lays betrayal would be extremely high.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha could confidently bring him into the territory and allow him to reconcile with his members. Yes. Seeing Ding Lays sincere expression, Lyn Sha silently nodded in his heart. Did he really go to such lengths to win over Ding Lay just to have another powerful underling? No. There&#x27;s also his powerful lordly talent.</p>
<p>Soul of glory becomes stronger by showing off. Because of his eternal peace and prosperity, continuing the lost learning of the sages, he can learn any skill, including lord talents. In this world of Langia, where the original Chinese history has been lost, the ancient Chinese civilization holds a fatal attraction for the Lia people. Of classical Chinese poetry, pros or even pretentious internet slang slip out. Lyn Shao is confident he can pull off this X act and become even more powerful by binding Ding Lay with the strictest vassel Lord contract.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia will help him become stronger. But even if he were to become stronger than himself, the power of the contract granted by the god would still leave Ding Lay completely powerless against Lin Sha. Once I learn Ding Lays Soul of Glory, Ding Lay will never be able to catch up with me again. I will be far ahead. far ahead.</p>
<p>However, I still haven&#x27;t figured out the trigger conditions for this, inheriting the lost skills of the sages. I&#x27;ve been in the battlefield of 10,000 races for so long, and I only learned a set of panlong staff from Emperor Taizu of Song when I leveled up to 10, and I learned a sword coming from the east when I went to fight Brands with Pay Min. However, I can take my time, and there&#x27;s no rush since Dinglay is already my vassel lord. Lyn Sha then led Ding lays slowly back the way they came. Waste You yellow-kinned monkeys are utterly useless.</p>
<p>A bunch of pigs. Inside the magnificent gothic mansion, the man in the floral shirt violently swept the tabletop to the floor with a loud bang, then picked up a vase from the coffee table and smashed it on the floor. Not satisfied with that, he searched the room for anything else he could break and vented his anger. Wongu knelt on the ground, his head buried deep in his legs like an ostrich, not daring to move. That&#x27;s a legendary gold unit.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s an epic unit. A whole thousand people. Only Ram managed to escape using a life-saving item. The man in the floral shirt pointed a trembling finger at Wong Su. As soon as Rahm returned, he ran back to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s going to complain about me to the Grandmaster of the Knights Templar. They&#x27;re saying that we Lia set a trap to frame the noble knights Templar. 100 Templar knights have fallen and now the most powerful region in the entire blue star realm, Western Europe, is enraged. The Middle East is also enraged. Japan is also taking advantage of this situation to try and extort benefits from us.</p>
<p>The man in the floral shirt was so angry his eyes almost popped out. His usual calm and collected demeanor was completely gone. Wong Su, Wong Su, can you bear the consequences? Didn&#x27;t you say Black Flame was your most capable subordinate? How come he can&#x27;t even handle a newbie lord who&#x27;s not even level 30? And he squandered so much of my precious resources, my sword in the stone, my legendary golden unit, my epic unit. What is your crime? Oh. The man in the floral shirt roared to the sky filled with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>My lord, please forgive me. My lord, please forgive me. Wong Su with his hooked nose could only bury his head on the ground and keep begging for mercy. That Lyn Sha, there&#x27;s something fishy about him. Then tell me, what&#x27;s so strange about Lin Sha? Pu Dawei s voice carried a hint of coldness.</p>
<p>That Lin Sha, he only has franklord talent. How could he possibly completely overwhelm Black Flame in terms of troop type, hero, and personal strength? Wong Su, sweating profusely, voiced his judgment. His units, apart from the phantom archers and faceless ones, are all unfamiliar to us. Yet, they are exceptionally powerful. So, what? I don&#x27;t need you to emphasize how amazing he is.</p>
<p>Pu Dawei rubbed a flame in his hand, his expression growing increasingly impatient. It&#x27;s the demons. Lynn Shiao is colluding with the demons. Wong Su blurted it out. Chapter 128.</p>
<p>The past of the demon clan. The past of the succubus princess. Demons. The man in the floral shirt paused, his expression turning serious. How do you know? My lord, my lord, it is like this.</p>
<p>Wongu quickly raised his head, knelt, and took a few steps forward and said ingratiatingly, &quot;My lord didn&#x27;t watch the whole live broadcast, but I watched it through gritted teeth the whole time.&quot; Combined with the rumors surrounding Lin Shiao, I can basically conclude that Lynn Shiao has a significant collusion with the demon clan. Speak. Stop talking nonsense. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>Heard the accusations of the abyss demon in a live broadcast room that he accidentally opened. They said Lin Shia had tainted their princess&#x27;s reputation. A demon princess? Pu Dawei, the man in the floral shirt, frowned slightly and glanced at the stunningly beautiful angel standing quietly behind him. Upon hearing this, the goldenhaired angel also raised her head. Her face, which had remained calm and still for millennia, turned towards Wong Su.</p>
<p>Yes, the demon princess. It should be that infamous succubus princess, Andrea. What a joke. What innocence does Andrea have? Pu Dawei muttered to himself. grown-ups, it&#x27;s nothing.</p>
<p>Please continue. Yes, many people have heard the accusations of the abyss demon. That&#x27;s one point. Secondly, the team that Black Flame sent to raid Lin Xiao&#x27;s rear was actually besieged by the native monsters in the valley, which is a very rare occurrence in the past. Wong Su said, &quot;In other realms outside of Blue Star, there are elven players who can subdue elven monsters at a very low cost.</p>
<p>dwarf players who can coexist peacefully with dwarf monsters and highle demons who are born with the ability to dominate low-level demons. No human player has ever been able to easily subdue so many different kinds of wild monsters. Moreover, among these wild monsters are demonic monsters such as the fierce demon and the bone demon. The fierce demon is known for its violent and fearless nature, and there is almost no record of it being subdued. Isn&#x27;t that suspicious? Pu Dawei nodded, signaling Wong Su to continue.</p>
<p>Third, one of the lords who was besieged heard a witch speak to him personally before he died. The reason the demons obeyed Lin Shiao is because the succubus princess wanted to marry him. What? Pu Dawis eyes narrowed instantly, a dangerous glint flashing within them. What merits does that brat possess to win the favor of the succubus princess? He&#x27;s from a race I&#x27;ve never even touched. What right does he have to lay a finger on her? Upon seeing the leader&#x27;s outburst, Wong Su immediately fell silent in fear.</p>
<p>After a moment, the strong winds that had been swirling around them gradually subsided, and Wong Su continued. If these three points are not enough, there is actually a fourth point. After Black Flame was killed, the live broadcast perspective of the main battlefield was maintained for a period of time. The white-clad hero pulled a nest demon from his robes and tossed it directly into the iron wall crusader&#x27;s formation, shattering their last line of defense. My lord, the nest demon is an epic quality demon.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s incredible that Lyn Xiao&#x27;s hero can raise a nest demon. It is indeed very suspicious. It&#x27;s highly suspicious, sir. How could Lin Shiao, a useless person with F-level talent, manage to win first place in so many level ups? How could he acquire one powerful unknown troop type after another? Even Gene Wuang, one of the chief lords of Lang Shia, didn&#x27;t recognize those troop types. The only ones we recognized were those 20 epic quality demon spies, the faceless ones.</p>
<p>His sword was evenly matched with the sword in the stone, so it must be a weapon of epic quality or higher. During his battle, meteors kept falling from the sky. That&#x27;s highle fire magic. How could someone possibly unleash that in a beginner&#x27;s area? Unless Unless what? Pawi also noticed something a miss. Unless it&#x27;s an abyss demon.</p>
<p>Abyss demons can unleash a weakened version of meteor shower, which is essentially a group meteor spell. If a demon from the abyss was secretly helping, then everything becomes clear. Wongu resolutely blocked the railway. Pu Dawei fell silent. He squinted slightly and paced back and forth unconsciously.</p>
<p>Since that glorious battle thousands of years ago, the demon race, which had helped the ancient evil, has suffered a great loss of strength. Originally able to rival the gods, gradually declined and was defeated in the battle for the second heaven and was forced to hide in the abyss, the lair of the sixth heaven. Their elite troops scattered and fled, forced to constantly wander and hide across various realms. Many more demons, leaderless, gradually became wild monsters on the battlefield of all races. But after Andrea&#x27;s sudden emergence, the demon race has become rampant again in recent years.</p>
<p>This cruel and cunning succubus, regardless of her chaotic love life, is not only unparalleled in martial arts, but also possesses countless highle spells, making her arguably the number one among the younger generation in the sixth heaven. She also had a wide range of interests, enjoying research and experimentation in her spare time and had cultivated many new demonic unit types. It is said that the faceless ones were created by Andrea. With this alternative demonic soldier that has no demonic characteristics at all and can transform into various humanoid forms. Andrea successfully planted spies in all realms.</p>
<p>At this point, Pu Dawei paused, stunned. You just said that Lynn Shiao has faceless warriors. Yes, sir. Interesting. Pu Dawi rubbed his chin using a recruitment token to directly recruit an epic demon unit.</p>
<p>This makes him even more suspicious. That&#x27;s right, sir. That&#x27;s why I said Lynn Shiao is colluding with the demons. That way, his strength can be explained. Seeing that the leader had already agreed with his statement, Wong Su quickly pressed his advantage.</p>
<p>My lord, the highle demons are the common enemy of the blue star human race covenant and even the ninth heaven covenant. Since Lynn Shiao is colluding with the demons, we can report him to the authorities and make him a public enemy hated by everyone. When the time comes, someone will naturally deal with Lin Sha. Report my ass. Pu Dawei suddenly kicked Wong Su, sending him tumbling to the ground.</p>
<p>Have you forgotten what kind of organization we celestials are? You, a bloodthirsty lord organization, reported to that in the dragon summer domain that you were bullied by the demons. She&#x27;s probably secretly laughing. You may be able to afford to lose face, but I can&#x27;t. Pu Dawei said angrily, then took a few steps and then remembered something. However, ruining Lin Xiaos reputation is not a bad idea.</p>
<p>We just need to find some people to spread the news that Lyn Shiao is colluding with the demons. Once the lords all know that Lin Shiao is colluding with the demons, he will indeed be suspected and isolated. At that time, we will have plenty of opportunities to deal with him. Your excellency is wise. Huh? Stop flattering me.</p>
<p>Huawei said, &quot;Lin Sha will soon be promoted to a full district.&quot; At that time, the task of locating him and hunting him down is now yours. Conquests in the official zones don&#x27;t have as many restrictions as those in the broken zones. You, a topranked Lord ranked 100, can&#x27;t possibly be unable to handle Lin Sha this time. I&#x27;m ranked at the top. Wong Su was about to speak again, but seeing Pu Dawis fierce expression, he changed the words he was about to blurt out and said, &quot;I guarantee I&#x27;ll blast Lin Sha to smitherines.&quot; Chapter 129.</p>
<p>Not a demon, but an ancient evil spirit. Is Lin Sha colluding with the demon clan? Inside a palace with an understated Chinese architectural style, a stunningly beautiful, mature, and aloof woman posed a question in a cool voice. That&#x27;s right, Lord Domain Lord. Besides what I just mentioned about Lyn Xiao&#x27;s relationship being exposed in his live stream, Lyn Shao possessing the faceless demon and the hero&#x27;s nest demon pet, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s own strength is so formidable that it is the biggest point of suspicion. Lyn Sha has several military branches that no one recognizes.</p>
<p>An official said, &quot;It&#x27;s normal for a genius to create one or two types of troops, but Lynn Shiao created the Gust Archers, the Cullinan Iron Cavalry, the most powerful swordsmen who can defeat the Templar knights, and savage soldiers who can climb cliffs. Each of them is incredibly powerful. That&#x27;s not normal.&quot; Furthermore, we estimate that the strength of these units should be around epic quality. Another official added, &quot;The ability to create several epic quality units inevitably brings to mind Andrea of the demon race. Shill, quiet.</p>
<p>We&#x27;d better not say her name, lest people from other domains misunderstand.&quot; The officials present nodded in agreement. &quot;Yes, we must not leave any more leverage for other regions. Dragon Sa and the demon clan must be irreconcilable enemies.&quot; Humph. Only Chu Yusi gave a cold snort. timid and cowardly, lacking any spirit.</p>
<p>She can&#x27;t even mention the demon princess&#x27;s name. Afraid of being misunderstood. Afraid of being misunderstood by whom? By the Americas, by Western Europe, by Japan? Haven&#x27;t already imposed enough filth on us, Chu. You see, an official retorted. You may be able to show off your power for a moment, but do you know how much pressure the domain lord is under? If this causes diplomatic unpleasantness between the two countries and the national destiny competition begins, Liao might be demoted and have its destiny reduced again.</p>
<p>Are you going to take responsibility for that? If I&#x27;m kicked off the National Fortune Arena for such a trivial matter, I Shui will personally take to the stage. And if I lose, I&#x27;ll commit suicide to atone for my sins. You wish. Whether you step into the ring or not is not up to you. All right, everyone, quiet down.</p>
<p>A cold female voice rang out. The Lord of Lang Sha domain had spoken. Chu Yusi and the noisy officials all quieted down. I already know about what you just mentioned about Lin Sha colluding with the demons. There are many doubts about this matter, and there is no substantial evidence, so it is not appropriate to draw any conclusions rashly.</p>
<p>Rumors about Lynn Shiao and the demon race have already begun to circulate throughout the entire Lnon region. A cold indifferent voice waved its hand dismissively saying a saying that came from who knows where goes. Rumors stop with the wise. These people who were swayed by rumors were saying Lynn Sha was doomed. Does anyone still mention it now? Lord territory Lord.</p>
<p>All right, that&#x27;s all for today. Meeting adjourned. One by one, the remotely connected 3D light screens disappeared until only Chu Yui remained. &quot;Chui, if it weren&#x27;t for Lin Shiao, your three most capable and trusted lieutenants would likely have perished in the newbie zone,&quot; a cold voice said. &quot;Haven&#x27;t you learned your lesson after suffering a loss once.&quot; Chu Yusi scratched his head awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn&#x27;t expect the Celestials to deploy their most elite troops for a big surprise attack. In previous years, when the breaking zones descended, didn&#x27;t they just use some superior troops to crush them? However, I did secretly give Fong Guu a heads up. In critical moments, saving lives is the most important thing, and they did just that. Huh? The cold voice remained non-committal. As it continued, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you offer your opinion on the matter between Lin Shia and the Demon Clan earlier?&quot; Chu Yusi was even more embarrassed.</p>
<p>To be honest, I also think there&#x27;s something wrong with that kid, Lyn Sha. He&#x27;s so handsome. Maybe Andrea really has her eye on him. Andrea&#x27;s private life is so rich that it can&#x27;t be contained in a single book. Lyn Sha even had a little scandal with her.</p>
<p>Um, aim. What I mean is, Lyn Sha is a very promising newcomer. It would be one thing if there were one or two suspicious things related to the demon race, but now there are so many. Considering everything, Lyn Sha is indeed somewhat suspicious. So, you also agree with investigating Lyn Sha or nipping him in the bud? No, no, no, Lord.</p>
<p>I suspect Lyn Sha might have connections with the demon clan, Chu Yusi said. But so, what if we have a connection? Lia is poor and weak and suffers from oppression. As long as Lia can become strong, even if it colludes with the demons, I Chu Yusi can turn a blind eye. Chu Yusi, you don&#x27;t seem to care about the Blue Star Convention&#x27;s description of the demons as vicious and ruthless. The cold voice said, &quot;You&#x27;ve got some nerve, Lord of the Domain.</p>
<p>Please forgive my rudeness.&quot; Chu Yusi spoke eloquently, showing no fear whatsoever. The Blue Star Convention only restricts developing countries like us. when has it ever restricted developed countries? This kind of law is only for the weak. The strong don&#x27;t care at all. Furthermore, the fact that the higher demons are extremely vicious and that everyone on blue star has the right to kill them is a big deal.</p>
<p>Every year, how many deaths and injuries are caused by the higher demons attacking the western European region and the American region? Yet, we have almost never heard of the higher demons attacking my dragon. Although I don&#x27;t know the reason, I believe in the saying, &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend.&quot; Chu Yusi&#x27;s eyes shone brightly. &quot;Even if Lynn shout doesn&#x27;t have concrete evidence right now, I can accept it even if he really has something going on with the demons.&quot; &quot;Chui, you&#x27;re playing with fire.&quot; A cold voice sideighed. &quot;Go downstairs. I want to be alone for a while.&quot; Chu Yusi shut down 3D communication and the meeting came to a complete end.</p>
<p>Lord Long Lia stood up, stared into the distance, and was in a daysaze. My lady, the first prophet has come to visit. A servant announced in a low voice from outside the door. Khalil Jabbron has arrived. Please invite him in.</p>
<p>A moment later, a tall elderly man with a high nose, blue eyes, and a full head of white hair walked in with a smile. Lord Dugu, it seems you have something on your mind. The old man had many wrinkles on his face, but his eyes were still exceptionally bright and full of cunning. Hei, this is all thanks to you, prophet. Lord Long Lia said with a smile.</p>
<p>You said that Lin Sha would be the most powerful ranger lord in Lang Shia and could even reverse Lias decline. He hasn&#x27;t even entered the newbie zone yet, and rumors are already circulating that he&#x27;s colluding with the demons. This whole thing has been driving me crazy. Khalil Jibron laughed heartily. May I ask, Lord Dugu, do you still remember the secret story I told you before? Yes.</p>
<p>The demon race has fallen into such a state because they helped the ancient evil demons, and the ancient evil demons seem to have nothing to do with our long. Khalil Jibron nodded, his smile fading. Whether Lin Shiao is connected with the demon race is still unknown, but I can confirm that Lin Sha has some connection with the ancient demons. What? A hint of surprise appeared in the otherwise cold voice. Ancient demons.</p>
<p>These are the common enemies of the nine heavens and even all realms more infamous than the demon race. Mr. Jabbrron, please don&#x27;t jump to conclusions. Khalil Jabbron nodded and said, &quot;Does the domain lord not know me well enough? I have already recognized that the sword Lynn Sha held during his battle with black flame is one of the divine swords created by the ancient demons Crimson Sky. The cold voice was filled with shock.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. It shares the same origin as the Tha sword inherited by the domain lord s family. The crimson sky sword s status is no lower than that of the Tha sword. domain lord. In my opinion, Lyn Shao is truly connected to the ancient demons.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, the stunningly beautiful woman, lord of dragon summer domain, slowly spoke, &quot;Does Mr. Jabbrron mean that my Duga family is also related to ancient evil spirits?&quot; Chapter 130. Mythical cards angels, your subordinate dares not. The Thai sword is a family heirloom sword obtained by the ancestor of the domain lord from slaying an ancient demon. The domain lord is the pillar of Lshia.</p>
<p>How could he collude with an ancient demon? Khalil Jibron lowered his head slightly, his gaze calm as he looked at the stunningly beautiful woman before him. I am merely informing Lord Domain about Lin Xiao&#x27;s suspicious aspects. After a long silence, the woman withdrew her doineering aura, stared intently at the prophet before her, and said, &quot;Word by word, if Lyn Shiao is truly connected to ancient demons, what suggestions do you have?&quot; Before Jabbrron could answer, the woman continued, &quot;Originally, he was only associated with the demon race, so I could still protect him. Now, it&#x27;s related to an ancient demon, an enemy of all realms. No one can protect him.</p>
<p>It seems the only way is to act swiftly and eliminate him beforehand to avoid getting burned. The stunningly beautiful woman spoke, her eyes never leaving the old man in front of her. Khalil Jabbrron&#x27;s expression remained calm as he slowly spoke. I don&#x27;t think so. I have great confidence in my prophecy.</p>
<p>It says that Lin Sha will be the top wandering night lord in the future of Lang Shia, fighting for Lia and seizing a glimmer of hope for Lia&#x27;s future. As for the ancient demons, they are nothing but rats hiding in the shadows. Apart from their fallen ancient civilizations and the wealth they left behind, they pose no threat whatsoever. Now, Lynn Shiao is connected to the ancient demons, but he only obtained an ancient divine sword made by the ancient demons. I am confident that I am the only one in the world who can recognize the crimson sky sword.</p>
<p>The stunningly beautiful woman narrowed her eyes. So you mean this matter is known only to heaven, earth, you and me. As long as we don&#x27;t tell anyone, no one will know. Jabbron lowered his voice slightly. Lord of the domain, when I was young, I was also a wandering knight errant.</p>
<p>I like to use sharp knives, even though there is a risk of cutting my hands. Lynn Shiao has gained the support of the ancient demons, which shows that he has unlimited potential. However, he is still very weak at the moment. We can continue to monitor him, win him over, and absorb him. You&#x27;re even more radical than Shu Yusi.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t you afraid of asking a tiger for its skin by doing this? We have no choice, Lord. If we continue to lose, the Dragon Sa Kingdom will become a second rate nation within 50 years, and the Dragon Sea domain will be annexed by the Eastern Inmain. Faced with the fate of my nation, I am willing to take the risk. Besides, the prophecy has supported my judgment. Is that so? Upon hearing the news that the dragon kingdom was deteriorating, the beautiful woman&#x27;s side again.</p>
<p>Tell me your thoughts on how to get through this Lynn Sha matter. After all, he is related to ancient demons. If he is not careful and his identity is exposed, not only will he be doomed, but our Lang Shia kingdom will also suffer a catastrophic disaster. Lord Dugu, there is an opportunity right now. Khalil Jibron calmly replied, using a few smaller problems to cover up the real big problems.</p>
<p>You mean the demons? Exactly. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s problem right now is that he is too powerful for a novice lord. And this power is suspicious. If Lin Sha really has an unclear relationship with the demon race, then his power can be explained. We just need to give some official responses that are neither here nor there.</p>
<p>give Lynn Shiao some overt support and declare that Lin Shiao has no connection with the demon race. That way, other countries won&#x27;t be able to cause trouble in the shadows. The rumors of Lin Xiao&#x27;s collusion with the demons will not disappear, and the rumors will continue to spread, but at least his relationship with the ancient demons has been covered up. The stunningly beautiful woman pondered for a moment, then nodded emphatically. Okay, well do as you say.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll also contact Lin Sha myself and meet with him. Then I shall take my leave. Long after Jabbrron left, a cold, quiet voice sounded softly. The crisis in the Dragon Sa Kingdom is getting more and more serious. Chu Yusi doesn&#x27;t care about the demons and Jibron doesn&#x27;t even care about the ancient demons.</p>
<p>They are willing to fight for any chance of survival. Khalil Jabbron, my first prophet, truly values Lynn Shiao. His views on the ancient demons also surprised me. Although he tried his best to hide it, I could still sense that he did not harbor any hostility towards the ancient demons. Does he know something, too? Meanwhile, Khalil Jabbron, back at his residence, also sighed.</p>
<p>He smiled and shook his head, then poured himself a glass of wine. It&#x27;s really tiring to play riddles with the domain lord. She also knows the truth about the ancient demons. And I also know the truth about the ancient demons. But she doesn&#x27;t know that I know.</p>
<p>And I know that she knows. We can&#x27;t talk about this taboo topic, and we have to find a respectable reason to resolve Linhao&#x27;s matter perfectly. Khalil Jabbron slowly poured the wine into his mouth, looking out the window into the distance. I don&#x27;t like playing riddles. Lynn Shiao shook his head with a smile and asked Pay Min.</p>
<p>Pay Min, just tell me straight. How were your gains from this battle? At this moment, only Lynn Shiao and his few heroes were in the war hall. His vassal lords had all been left outside. Whether to divide the spoils or how much to give to one&#x27;s vassal lords is entirely up to one&#x27;s own decision. If one doesn&#x27;t let them in, then one won&#x27;t feel resentful after seeing it.</p>
<p>Yes, my lord, pay replied. The spoils of this great war, including various resources, mines, gold coins, experience points, and energy from the battlefield of 10,000 races, have all been collected directly by the system and have entered the system warehouse. Lord, you can check them at any time. A sword, a set of heavy armor, several talismans, a bottle of potion, and a card were dropped from Black Flame&#x27;s body. Please take a look, Lord.</p>
<p>After saying that, Pay Min pointed to the chopping board in front of him, on which were neatly arranged the items he had mentioned. Lyn Sha picked up the sword and glanced at it briefly. Sword in the stone, epic weapon. Attributes: Base attack power 530, strength plus 25, constitution plus 25. Description: Only the king can pull the sword from the solid stone.</p>
<p>The sword in the stone was King Arthur s sword and it provided a bonus to cavalry when worn. The sword in the stone has average stats typical of epic swords. It is worth noting that the sword in the stone also has a trump card skill summon sword spirit. Just as black flame said once the sword spirit appears it will slaughter for miles around and only return after drinking enough blood. However, the skill bar for summoning the sword spirit is currently black and cannot be activated, and there is also a line of small text on the system introduction screen.</p>
<p>The blade spirit is frightened and cannot be summoned temporarily. What a weak sword spirit. Lyn Shiao casually made a comment, then checked the entire set of the excellent quality dragon roar heavy armor set. Again, it was slightly damaged, but O Yzi said it could be repaired. The talismans included consumables such as the heavenly eye talisman, camp talisman, and rapid marching talisman, while the potion was a bottle of life restoring potion.</p>
<p>It seems that black flame was killed before he could even take it. Only one card remains. This card has intricate patterns and details along its edges, making it more exquisite than even the finest tarot cards. The entire card is like a work of art, depicting a stunningly beautiful angel. Lynn Sha picked up the card and the information given by the main god naturally entered his mind.</p>
<p>Mythical card angel. The holder of this card will gain the authority to recruit the mythical unit angel. Chapter 131. Ba is indeed suspicious. A mythical level card.</p>
<p>Does the holder of this card gain the authority to recruit angels? Does that mean recruiting angels requires this prerequisite? Also, are angels a mythical quality unit? How come black flame has this on him? A series of questions popped into Lin Xiao&#x27;s mind. In the school curriculum, the highest quality is golden legend. There has never been any mythical quality. But the mysterious and powerful angels can occasionally be heard in rumors on the streets and alleys, and sometimes they also appear in classic western battles, playing a decisive role. Lynn Sha once asked his course teacher what quality an angel was, but the result was a sigh from the gray-haired teacher and the meaningful words.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s not on the exam, so don&#x27;t know too much. Now, a brand new and beautiful card is placed in front of him, and in an instant, Liao&#x27;s question of many years was answered. So, angels are mythical qualities. Mythology was never mentioned in Lia&#x27;s courses. Could it be yet another instance of foreign powers suppressing and monopolizing advanced knowledge in Liao? As he talked to himself, Lyn Xiaos hand kept caressing the gorgeous angel card.</p>
<p>My lord, this card is generated after the corpses of black flame and all fallen legendary and epic units reached their expiration time. Pay Min explained from the side. It should be one of the campaign rewards. I see. No wonder Black Flame, a penniless guy, would have a mythic card hidden away and never use it, yet still carry it with him.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia understood and immediately checked the battle results panel of the main god system. You and your vassel lord have successfully withstood the challenge from Black Flame, a player from the official zone, and his subordinate lords. The rewards are as follows. Battle results. 65 bosses killed, including Black Flame, level 63.</p>
<p>Enemy heroes eliminated 131. Among them, one epic quality hero, Master E. One superior quality hero, Neagano the Predator, and several rare quality heroes. Annihilate the following enemies. 100 Templar knights, legendary, 300 ironclad crusaders, epic.</p>
<p>200 Sunfire Spearmen, epic. 100 Sunless Long Bowman, epic. 100 Shadow Lurkers, epic. 200 dwarven mountain warriors, epic, and 58 exalted slayers. Excellent.</p>
<p>Battle duration, 7 hours, 21 minutes, and 18 seconds. Our casualties, player Lin Shiao, Zero, Subordinate Lords, Tu, Shan by Chin, 239. He 419, Chin Ningming 93. Special stacking events include breaking through the zone to challenge the lord personally participating in the battle, the difference in level between the lords and troops of the two sides exceeding 10 levels. A battle involving more than a thousand people and the challenger being perfectly killed.</p>
<p>rewards. Epic weapon, sword in the stone, excellent quality set, dragon sroar, heavy armor set, damaged, two rapid march charms, one heavenly eye charm, one camp charm, 10 million experience capped for a single battle in the beginner zone. 1 million gold capped, 50,000 energy. Lyn Sha quickly skimmed through the settlement reward page. Unlike fighting wild monsters, when fighting a lord, the victor will likely obtain the equipment and weapons the enemy is carrying after defeating them, but treasure chests and the like will generally not be obtained in this major operation.</p>
<p>Apart from Black Flame dropping some good equipment, most of the other blood lords dropped rare or even lower quality items which Lynn Shia didn&#x27;t even bother with and simply threw into the god space warehouse to deal with later. Defeating lords of the same kind yields the most experience and gold. After winning a single battle, Lyn Sha directly receive the maximum reward of 10 million experience points and 1 million gold coins in the newbie zone. This experience is enough for him to directly upgrade all heroes and units to level 30 so that he can enter the official server in the best possible condition. The Hasha Order also provided 50,000 units of energy, which excited Lyn Shao greatly, giving him many more options when recruiting heroes or having imperial spirits possess him next time.</p>
<p>After looking around, Lyn Sha frowned slightly. The battle results never mentioned the reward of the mythical card angel. Lyn Sha has an amazing memory, but he has no choice but to look at it again. Still none. Why wasn&#x27;t the angel card reward shown? Is it because other countries are blocking advanced knowledge from the dragon sia domain? Do they not want such advanced knowledge like the mythical level to flow into dragon sia? Is it because the mythic quality is blocked in the newbie zone? That shouldn&#x27;t be the case.</p>
<p>The god system already showed the contents of the mythic card when I held it. Lyn Sha paced back and forth holding the cards in his hand. As he held the card in his hand, the god system naturally issued a notification. A mythic quality card has been detected. Activating it will grant you recruitment privileges.</p>
<p>Activate now. As a time traveler who has experienced great ups and downs in another world and knows a part of ancient history, including how the ancient Chinese people of Earth were betrayed by other countries in this world. Lyn Shia has to be wary of this card that he suddenly acquired. Angels in every game and mythology are incomparably powerful beings. Once the card is activated, I will gain the ability to recruit angels.</p>
<p>Won&#x27;t that give me a powerful ally in the battle for supremacy among all races? Faced with such temptation, Lyn Sha was finding it hard to resist. Suddenly, Lyn Sha remembered something. He looked up and gazed at a stunningly beautiful woman standing quietly in the hall. Ba, come here. Since consummating her relationship with Lynn Shiao, Baoi has become even more radiant and beautiful.</p>
<p>However, her gentle and unassuming nature means that she always stands quietly behind Lin Sha and never takes the initiative to show off. Baoi, still wearing the forest which cloak that Lin Sha had given her, obediently came to Lin Sha. Check Ba&#x27;s attributes. Ba race human ancient China quality myth level Level two attributes strength 68 spirit 65 constitution 71 soul 105 skills charm Srank a smile worth a thousand pieces of gold Srank beauty that could cause disaster a rank peerless beauty Srank two elements reversal Srank peerless demoness click to Combat power rating 85 stars not yet unlocked. Exclusive unit songstress.</p>
<p>Lynsha thought to himself. Just as I expected. Unbeknownst to them, all the content replaced by question mark has been displayed. Baoi, who is only level two, has incredibly high stats, even surpassing Pay Min, the king of one-on-one combat. Ba&#x27;s qualities are actually mythical.</p>
<p>What is this? Starting out an ancient demon forces a peerless demoness of mythical quality to be his concubine. Lyn Sha glanced at Ba again, his eyes filled with shock and surprise, which puzzled Baoi. My lord, what&#x27;s wrong with me? No, it&#x27;s nothing. You&#x27;re great. You&#x27;re getting more and more beautiful.</p>
<p>Liaos lips curled up slightly. If it weren&#x27;t for the presence of so many subordinates, he would have loved to pick up Baoi and spin her around a few times. There&#x27;s no rush to go around in circles. We can go around in other places tonight. However, by checking Bao&#x27;s attributes, Lynn Shiao confirmed one thing.</p>
<p>The mythical quality had already been unlocked for him. Therefore, if there are items of mythical quality, he can certainly examine them. However, the reward list provided by the god system does not include any angel cards, which means there&#x27;s definitely something wrong with this angel card. I happen to have some time now, Lynsha said. All heroes and squad leaders, go and keep watch in the territory.</p>
<p>There may be an attack on the territory later. Protect the territory. Protect my vassal lords. Lynn Sha paused. Also, no one is allowed to enter the war hall to disturb me without my permission.</p>
<p>Ba, you stay. Chapter 132. Pay men, the gossip king, and the traps of the traitor. Ba stayed behind and the others left. Pay Min&#x27;s ears perked up.</p>
<p>He tilted his head slightly, looked at Tangg Yi, and then at S Rui, who was putting on his helmet. Huing and Shin Leong Yu acted swiftly and decisively, immediately going out to arrange military affairs. O Yi had already taken the damaged armor to repair it. He was a workaholic. Tang Yi pursed his lips, ignored Pay Min&#x27;s gaze, and walked out as well.</p>
<p>Hey, it&#x27;s only evening. Lord, what are you planning to do? Pay Minudged Son Ruer. Song Rui slammed down his face plate and neck flap, then walked away without looking to the side. Boring. Pay secretly turned his head and saw that Lin Sha had already grasped Bao&#x27;s soft hand.</p>
<p>Ba blushed with embarrassment and almost lowered her head to the ground. Mr. Pay Min, why aren&#x27;t you leaving yet? Soldering with his long ears came over. The Lord must have important matters to attend to with Ba, so let&#x27;s not waste our time. After saying that, Soldering pulled Pay Min out of the war hall.</p>
<p>Pay Min suppressed a laugh as he walked out of the hall and suddenly asked, &quot;Soldin, what urgent matter does the Lord need to attend to? I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s inside the war hall.&quot; The war hall is quite empty with only a sand table, a task board, and some chairs, but we usually hold meetings standing up. Does Mr. Pay Min have any deeper meaning in asking this? There&#x27;s no deeper meaning behind it. Seeing Solderland&#x27;s confusion, Pay Min leaned closer, seemingly about to speak mysteriously. Pay Min, get lost.</p>
<p>If I ever hear you gossiping about me again, I&#x27;ll confiscate all your frosts and fire joy. Lyn Xiaos voice echoed from the hall. Payman shuddered and slunk away. This kid is great in every way, except he loves to gossip. It&#x27;s time to find him a companion.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha shook his head and said to Baoi, who was blushing shily in his arms. This kind of wandering night errant won&#x27;t settle down until he meets the right person. I wonder what kind of woman he actually likes. Lyn Shiao actually started worrying about Pay Min&#x27;s important matter. How fortunate I am to have met you, my lord.</p>
<p>Ba nestled her face against Lin Xiaos chest, blushing as she spoke these sweet words. I will fulfill any request of your lord. Lynsha clicked his tongue. This vixen&#x27;s mind wasn&#x27;t pure. She always used the most innocent expression and demeanor yet uttered seductive words.</p>
<p>In the fashionable terms of before his transmigration, she was a pure desire type. Ba, we&#x27;re going to take care of important business. Lyn Sha took Ba&#x27;s hand and said earnestly, would you like to meet your old acquaintance? Oh. While Baoi was still in surprise, Lin Shiao recited the secret code. Lin Bing Doha Ja Jean Li Shen Shing.</p>
<p>In an instant, the world spun around. Lyn Sha and Ba appeared in an unknown place. There were buildings and houses that were both real and elucory. A chaotic sky, a broken earth, and cold winds blowing through the fragmented air. chaos, decay, secrecy, and stranges.</p>
<p>Between the overlapping real and elucory buildings, some figures like black mist drifted about. This is the hiding place of ancient demons. Bowsi exclaimed in surprise. Yes, let&#x27;s come and see our old friend. Lyn Sha gently patted Ba&#x27;s hand, comforting her to calm down.</p>
<p>Both of them were consciousness entities, only able to drift with the wind. But strangely, there was still a shining spot on Lin Xiaos chest. A moment later, three dark figures drifted over. Lyn Shiao opened his mouth to speak. He, the second shadowy figure, spoke first, catching Lin Xiao&#x27;s greeting in his throat.</p>
<p>Ouch. The leader of the shadowy figures, smacked the second in command hard on the head. All you do is laugh like that all day long. Do you think young friend Lyn Sha would try to steal your laugh? Lyn Sha could only chuckle awkwardly. This second brother really held a grudge.</p>
<p>He hadn&#x27;t forgotten the time he stole his lines. Three dark figures approached Lin Shia and Baoi. Uh Baoi, young friend, Lyn Sha brought you along, too. The leader of the shadowy figures nodded to Baoi. Baoi greets the three seniors and thanks them for their kindness in giving her a second chance at life.</p>
<p>Ba&#x27;s consciousness bowed to the three dark figures filled with gratitude. No need to be polite. The leader of the shadowy figures was the most composed. As fellow Chinese, it is only right that we help each other. Young friend Lyn Shia, what brings you here? We heard that your troubles should be resolved.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha smiled slightly and said, &quot;Mere Black Flame and Templar Knights are easy prey for my Chinese troops.&quot; &quot;Excellent. That&#x27;s the might of our ancient demons back in the day.&quot; The leader of the shadowy figures exclaimed in admiration. But this time, I have two questions that I need to ask some senior colleagues. The second shadowy figure sneered. I think you mean the old devil.</p>
<p>Speak. The third shadowy figure kept staring at the light on Lin Xiao&#x27;s chest, waiting for Lin Xiao&#x27;s next question. Actually, these two questions can also be the same. One is, what is mythical quality? Secondly, what about this card and can I use it? Lyn Xiao&#x27;s consciousness took out the angel card from his pocket. The moment the angel card was taken out, it shone brightly without the obstruction of Linhao&#x27;s consciousness, illuminating even the entire chaotic dark space.</p>
<p>The three figures in black were taken aback at first, then jumped back as if facing a formidable enemy. &quot;This is a trap set by traitors.&quot; The shadowy leader shouted. &quot;Have you activated the card?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; Lin Shiao said in a deep voice. &quot;If there&#x27;s a problem, I&#x27;ll go back immediately.&quot; Hearing Lyn Xiaos reply that it wasn&#x27;t activated, the leader of the shadowy figures breathed a sigh of relief. Three dark figures slowly moved forward and came to Lyn Sha.</p>
<p>If you activate it now, it&#x27;s too late to go back. The traitors may have already located our position. We will have to abandon this place where we have been hiding for many years and find a new space-time rift. Lynhos expression was serious. What exactly is going on with these cards? What&#x27;s honey to others is poison to you, the leader of the shadowy figure&#x27;s side.</p>
<p>I never expected that you would obtain such an advanced item while still in the newbie zone and also encounter such a huge risk. Let me start from the beginning. In the battlefield where all races v for supremacy, all equipment and all troop types have six well-known quality levels: common, fine, rare, excellent, epic, and legendary. You may have wondered the lord talent has six levels F, F, C, D, A, B, and C. F level corresponds to ordinary.</p>
<p>The powerful A level can correspond to legendary, but there are a very few geniuses with S-level lord talent. Does S level also correspond to golden legend? That&#x27;s what the textbook says, Lynn Sha said calmly. However, some S-level talents are above legendary. Alas, these toxic textbooks are harming future generations. The leader of the shadowy figures cried out in anguish.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all the work of those traitors who manipulated the culture. A powerful A- rank talent can indeed correspond to a golden legendary talent, but an S-rank talent corresponds to something above golden legendary, mythical quality. Mythical quality is an ultimate quality across all realms, a level higher than golden legendary. The third shadowy figure interjected. However, mythical quality is extremely rare, whether in the ninth heaven or the third heaven.</p>
<p>Mythical quality is the best in all realms. It can be said that the golden legend is the emperor of the mortal world who can already dominate the world, while the mythical quality is the ethereal god in the heavens who can only be encountered by chance. So, I&#x27;ve struck gold, Lyn Sha asked doubtfully. Rome, you&#x27;ve stepped into a trap meticulously designed by the traitors. A trap specifically designed to target geniuses.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you can gather all the materials needed to recruit angels. The moment you activate this card, you will be located, watched, and marked, and you will never be able to escape the gaze of the traitors. Chapter 133. Modifying a semi- divine artifact. Being located, marked, and watched with no escape.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha frowned and said, &quot;Does it have to be this Cthulhuesque? What did you say?&quot; &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s nothing. Please continue.&quot; My brother said that these angel cards are a carefully designed trap by the traitors, but also a honey for others, and there&#x27;s a reason for that. The third shadowy figure continued to explain, &quot;The angel cards were jointly produced by the traitorous nations of Western Europe. They monopolized the recruitment authority for angel units. Without their consent, no one can obtain the qualification to recruit angel units or even have the chance to see an angel.</p>
<p>In order to make the best use of the angel&#x27;s mystery, powerful attraction, and deterrent effect, the behind-the-scenes controllers of Western Europe have come up with a vicious method. They will implant some kind of magical mark that will soon dissipate on their most powerful legendary and epic units, with only a tiny bit attached to each unit. When a legendary or epic unit is defeated, a magical mark will be triggered. However, the small amount of magical mark will dissipate quickly and nothing will happen. Only when the rate of death is fast enough, the number of deaths is large enough and the deaths are rapid, numerous, and dense can these magical marks be gathered together.</p>
<p>When more and more magical symbols converge and reach a critical value, they can trigger the magic they have set up in advance, which will directly send a mythical card from their base. &quot;Do you know why they did this?&quot; Mark the genius, Lyn Sha said in a deep voice. &quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; the leader of the shadowy figures nodded. &quot;Being able to kill a large number of specific gold legendary units or even more specific epic units in a short period of time can only mean one thing. The killer has very strong strength and can be considered a peerless genius.</p>
<p>In fact, the last time cards were given out in the entire Dragon summer domain was 20 years ago, which is enough to show how difficult it is to meet the conditions. Once the conditions are met, the Western European domain will give out a mythic quality card as loot for the killer. When a normal person encounters such a good thing as a windfall, of course, they would activate the card immediately. Then they will be marked by the magical effects on the cards and watched by the person behind the scenes. Lyn Shao continued in a deep voice.</p>
<p>If this genius is someone the people behind the scenes are willing to cultivate and who is also willing to join them, he will be given special attention. But from then on he will be nothing more than a dog of Western Europe. If this genius is considered an enemy of Western Europe, or if the person behind the scenes is unwilling to cultivate him, then he will face extermination. What a vicious and meticulously planned trap. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s face was as cold as a stone.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. So now you know why we reacted so strongly just now, right? The leader of the shadows said, still shaken. We&#x27;ve been hiding for thousands of years, and we can&#x27;t afford to wander again. If your card is active, it&#x27;s very likely that you&#x27;re being watched by something behind the scenes. Lynn Shia said apologetically.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m really sorry. I&#x27;ll be more careful in the future. I&#x27;ll contact you before entering this space. I will not bring items here rashly again. Although Lin Shia and Baoi are consciousness entities, they can carry items when they enter the demons hideout using the incantations given by the ancient demons.</p>
<p>As long as it&#x27;s not activated, it doesn&#x27;t matter much. The top members of the betrayers faction are very busy. They won&#x27;t be checking cards every day that they might only use once every few decades, said the second shadowy figure. The leader of the shadowy figures nodded as well. This angel card.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can give it to us. The third shadowy figure said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen a mythical quality item in years. We can silently remove the magic on it.&quot; Then he the third shadowy figure laughed. I can use the sliver of divinity on this one card to attach to legendary quality equipment and create a semi- divine artifact. A semi- divine artifact? Linhao&#x27;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Yes, the semi- divine artifact you create will still be yours. If you have more items imbued with divinity, you can ask us again and then take them over. Speaking of divinity, Lynn Shaol laughed. What&#x27;s the deal with my bow? The stunningly beautiful woman standing to the side was both shy and delighted when Lin Shiao called her my families and she was at a loss for words. Why are you asking us what&#x27;s going on with your Bousy? We didn&#x27;t put any surveillance magic on her.</p>
<p>Shut up. The leader of the shadowy figures interrupted the second brother&#x27;s chatter with another sharp wrap on the head. He approached Lin Shia and Baoi, the hazy shadowy figure getting close to the two of them, looking left and right. Lin Shiao seemed to faintly smell a faint scent of alcohol. The situation is more optimistic than I imagined.</p>
<p>The shadowy elder said Baoi is a mythical hero, but she is affected by negative luck and cannot unleash her full potential. Now that the negative luck has been diluted to a critical point, her attributes have become apparent. Of course, this is also because you obtained a mythic level card and unlocked the mythic quality. I don&#x27;t know what method you used to change this poor girl. so much, but you&#x27;ve done a good job.</p>
<p>Keep it up. We&#x27;re not sure how much potential Baoi has.&quot; Upon hearing the leader&#x27;s words, Baoi looked at Lin Shia with eyes full of love and subconsciously reached out to hold Lin Xiaos arm tightly, refusing to let go. Lyn Sha also affectionately patted Baosi&#x27;s hand. &quot;By the way, how can I recruit mythical quality units in the future? The West has angels, but does China have mythical quality units?&quot; Liao asked. The second shadowy figure scoffed.</p>
<p>You underestimate our ancient demon race. We were once the demons of countless realms who fought our way up to the third heaven. How could we not have mythical quality troops? Just focus on fighting and grinding monsters to grow stronger. As long as you trigger the god&#x27;s mythical quality reward, the China token can change that reward to China&#x27;s. He remember this.</p>
<p>My Chinese golden legend can crush the western golden legend and my Chinese mythology can crush their mythology. Then I&#x27;m relieved. Lyn Sha nodded. Thank you. Three seniors Ba and I will head back now.</p>
<p>Wait. The leader of the shadowy figures called out to Lyn Sha. You did a good job in this battle. I didn&#x27;t expect you to be so shrewd. Not only did you use the nest demon pets to attract attention, but you also made contact with Andrea and laid out your plan long ago.</p>
<p>staging a double act. I understand your plan. Use the demons and Andrea to create confusion and cover up the truth. Stop. Stop.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha felt increasingly uneasy as he listened. What are you talking about? What? Andrea? Who? Chapter 134. Three denials dividing the spoils. Both sides stood there stunned. You haven&#x27;t contacted Andrea? Who exactly is Andrea? The two said in unison.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s that demon princess you had a rumored affair with the leader of the shadowy figures touched his nose. Embarrassed, you started to trick Andrea without even contacting her. You truly are a descendant of our ancient demons. Me? Haven&#x27;t I been constantly being tricked by this succubus princess? Lyn Sha was both amused and exasperated. She has a subordinate who always claims that I forcibly took someone&#x27;s virginity.</p>
<p>I only saw her once from afar, and she even set a trap for me. interrupting my good time with Ba. I was just playing along, using the demons as scapegoats. A collaboration between me and her. That&#x27;s impossible.</p>
<p>You must have been misled by the rumors spread by that abyss demon. Lyn Sha denied it three times. But I remember it was a bloodthirsty witch from your valley who said it to the live stream. Lyn Shia, all right, the leader of the shadowy figures ended the dispute. Whether you cooperated with her or sabotaged her, the results this time were quite good.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re about to enter the official zone. Remember, you need to be extra careful. You must hide yourself until you&#x27;re strong enough. Using the demon race as a cover is dangerous, but it&#x27;s much safer than directly revealing that you are a member of the ancient demons. Lynn Shia, wait, when did I become one of the ancient demons? The shadowy leader said, &quot;You are Chinese and your wife Ba is also Chinese.</p>
<p>Chinese people are ancient demons, so you are an ancient demon. Take care, my fellow ancient demons. I&#x27;d rather sacrifice my looks for that succubus princess than give up my life.&quot; Lyn Sha, go for it, young friend. We look forward to seeing your performance in the official server. The leader of the shadowy figures waved his hand, and Lin Shia and Baoi felt dizzy again.</p>
<p>But after a few seconds, their consciousness returned to their bodies. In the distance outside the hall, a commotion had already broken out. It seemed that the meeting with the ancient demons had once again triggered an attack, and the heroes of the territory had begun to organize a defense. Lynn Shiao touched his chest. The beautifully designed angel card had disappeared.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s an incredible ability. Lynn Sha pondered the strength of the three ancient demonic figures and secretly assessed just how powerful the traitors were who could make the three figures flee in such a sorry state. Lyn Sha rubbed his chin. If his identity were really exposed, his fate would not be much better than that of the ancient demon. He is indeed Chinese, albeit in another world.</p>
<p>But in this world that views Chinese people as a monstrous threat, the traitors will likely not listen to his explanation. Therefore, Lyn Sha had no choice. From the moment he entered the official zone, he was destined to begin a cautious battle royale. Is that demon princess named Andrea? I&#x27;ll find a chance to ask our well-informed class monitor about it. Having gotten rid of the hot potato that is the angel card, it&#x27;s time to meet with my subordinate lords, settle everyone in, and head to the official server in a couple of days, Lynn Sha led Bao Sea out of the warh hall.</p>
<p>Outside the territory, wave after wave of beast tides fiercely attacked. However, under the defense organized by Hoing and Chin Leong Yu, Lin Sha felt no threat. Within the territory, two Shawn Bachin and Heay each had a bag of melon seeds and watched with great interest as their lord&#x27;s heroic troops fought against the overwhelming demonic tide. Heay would occasionally jokingly ask when the flower fairy beside him would become as strong as the mo Dao iron guard. Chun Ningming placed his hand on his weapon, his expression calm, as he continued to patrol the territory.</p>
<p>Ding Lay stood the furthest away, but he only crossed his arms and watched everything that was happening in his territory from afar. Upon seeing Lyn Sha emerge, the group turned around and greeted him. Boss, boss Lyn Shao, big brother. Lyn Sha waved his hand, signaling everyone to come closer. Everyone, Dinglay is now my vassel lord.</p>
<p>So from now on, we&#x27;re all on the same side. Although Dinglay was being pretentious, he didn&#x27;t actually cause any real harm to Tan by Chin and the others. So they quickly accepted the reality and shook hands with Dinglay to make peace. Seeing Tu Shan by Chin and the others looking at him with puzzled expressions, Lynn Sha chuckled. I know what you want to ask, but I&#x27;ll just tell you all.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t ask anything about my heroes and units. The more you know, the more dangerous it is for you. When the time is right, I will tell you. Let the rumors go. I don&#x27;t care.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaos face turned cold. And he slowly said, &quot;This time, I killed Black Flame and killed a thousand expensive soldiers. The Celestial Organization will not let me go.&quot; According to Dingle, Hi Yin can only be considered an ordinary elite in the Celestial People Organization. His superior is Wong Su, a masked man who once stood up for Gene Dang. Wong Sus superior is Pu Dawei, the leader of the Celestial People.</p>
<p>Once I enter the official zone, the celestial organization, the lords who covet my troops, the lords who want to become famous, and countless bloodthirsty lords will relentlessly track and hunt me down. Lyn Sha turned to look at the group and said, &quot;These things originally had nothing to do with you, and you shouldn&#x27;t have gotten involved, so I&#x27;m giving you a chance. If you&#x27;re scared, you can leave now, and I&#x27;ll terminate the contract.&quot; Dinglay, you&#x27;re the same. The group exchanged glances. Tu Shan Bachin was the first to speak, saying, &quot;Brother Lin Sha, without you, we would have died on the battlefield long ago.</p>
<p>Few of those who come to the battlefield of the myriad races are afraid of death. I will follow you. Although it sounds very dangerous to you, danger always comes with opportunity. I really want to improve.&quot; He and Chin Ningming nodded, expressing their determination. Lyn Sha looked at Ding Lay, who slowly said, &quot;Brother Shiao, you understand me.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t survive if I don&#x27;t pretend. I can only pretend if I&#x27;m with you. Imagine me following you to defeat a powerful enemy and then delivering that exhilarating line in front of everyone. That scene, that&#x27;s the life I want. Lynn Shia raised his hand and touched his forehead.</p>
<p>You learn very quickly. All right, since you&#x27;re all willing to follow me, then get ready to face the brutal challenges of the official zone together. Lynn Shao opened his God system warehouse and pulled out a long list of equipment of excellent quality and below. Each of you may choose five pieces of equipment from all of these. Wow, brother Lyn Sha is incredibly rich.</p>
<p>Tu Shan by Chian exclaimed dramatically. Lyn Sha casually flicked Tu Sha by Chians forehead with his hand. These were all dropped by the blood lords we just killed in this battle. As my underlings, I can&#x27;t treat you unfairly. After you&#x27;ve made your selections, go back to your own territories and develop rapidly.</p>
<p>See what resources your territories lack to upgrade your lord&#x27;s manner and just tell me. Yay! Brother Lyn Shiao is so good to us. Tu Shan by Chen, the little girl in white stockings jumped up and grabbed Lyn Xiaos arm. Then let&#x27;s start choosing. Lyn Sha withdrew his arm without making a sound, although he had to admit that the little girl was indeed very well-developed.</p>
<p>Get out of here after you&#x27;ve made your selection. Chapter 135 Kman protection fee 89757 newb zone. The great battle between Lin Shiao and Black Flame which shocked the entire Lnon region and even more or less affected the entire Lia domain ended after the war. The remaining new lords continued with their daily tasks, occasionally mentioning the excitement of the great battle and its unbelievable ending while diligently accumulating resources, grinding monsters, recruiting troops, upgrading their lord&#x27;s manor, and methodically preparing for the third level and entry into the official server. When the black flames descended, the god system gave a 3-day lockdown period during which no one could enter the official area.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha and Black Flame are fighting fiercely. It&#x27;s like gods are fighting. I don&#x27;t understand it at all, but for me, it&#x27;s more practical to just grind monsters and level up my lord&#x27;s manner. Someone was chatting in the L non- newbie chat channel during their free time. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Such wars are just something to look at. They&#x27;re too far removed from our lives. If Blackflame releases an epic unit, I&#x27;ll have no choice but to kneel down and admit defeat. I only have one elite unit to put on a show, but it can&#x27;t beat epic units. You also have exceptional units.</p>
<p>You can be considered a hidden master. Remember how arrogant Xiao Datang and Gene Dang were when they only had a few rare units. Haha. Everyone&#x27;s standards in the newbie zone have been raised by Lin Shiao. They don&#x27;t even care about the excellent troops anymore.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, someone cautiously brought up the topic, what kind of unit does boss Lin Sha actually use? I looked through the Encyclopedia of all races units yesterday, but I couldn&#x27;t find a unit with a similar description. Hey, why flip through that book? It&#x27;s only revised once every 10 years. Every year, countless new and extinct troop types are created on the battlefield of 10,000 races. By the time it&#x27;s included in the dictionary, some lords will have been killed by these new troop types, and their graves will be over a meter high with grass growing on them. That&#x27;s true, but I guess Lyn Xiao&#x27;s troops are also self-created.</p>
<p>Do you even need to tell me? Boss Lin Shiao himself said that the Gust archers were trained and upgraded from phantom archers. The Cullinan Iron Cavalry were trained and upgraded from step knights, and the most powerful swordsmen called the Flash Spirit Iron Guards were trained and upgraded from Berserkers. I&#x27;ve heard about it, too. Lyn Sha is really generous. He answered the Gene family patriarchs question immediately.</p>
<p>He truly keeps his promise. What&#x27;s strange is that Lynn Shiao claims he trained all his self-created troop types while wearing overalls are sold out on the home planet. Many lords are using their connections to have friends and relatives by overalls on the home planet and teleport them over to put them on their phantom archers and other units. I heard that when all these soldiers wear overalls for training, they look quite impressive and have a unique kind of spectacular feel. Yes, boss Lin Sha also mentioned that training in overalls is a tradition passed down from the Kuan sect.</p>
<p>This Kuwin sect is an ancient sect, but I don&#x27;t understand what the Kuin and Kuwan sect means. You guys have a lot of free time, huh? A loud shout interrupted the novice lord&#x27;s idol chatter. Did you pay your protection money this week? You still have time to chat here? The chat channel paused for a moment. The conversation abruptly ended. Seeing that no one responded, the man continued arrogantly.</p>
<p>You ordinary lords shouldn&#x27;t spend your days discussing and yearning for the world of the big shots. What does that have to do with you? He&#x27;s a genius, a big shot, and most importantly, he has powerful backers. Otherwise, how could an F-rank talent obtain so many powerful units and heroes, defeat top players in the official zone, and even epic units? Do you understand? The most important thing is to have someone behind you. The arrogant voice seemed pleased that no one dared to contradict it and continued. Look at Xiao Dahong and his group.</p>
<p>They have the heavenly people organization behind them. They can run rampant as soon as they enter the newbie zone. The three masters of Julie, King Bo, Pen Shanu, and others are also members of a certain powerful force. Lynn Shiao has an unclear relationship with the Demon Clan and even has a Demon Clan princess as his girlfriend. These people are so strong because they have powerful connections.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with your talent, hard work, passion, or fearlessness. And you? A bunch of mediocre lords with no money and no power. You can only be cannon fodder on the battlefield of all races. So, you&#x27;d better obediently hand over your protection money. Our organization is a medium-sized organization in the official district, and we have experts at level 70 or 80 in the official district.</p>
<p>By paying us protection money, you&#x27;ll become one of our peripheral members, which will reduce a lot of trouble for you. At least we won&#x27;t extort you anymore. Understand? All right, stop doawling. Instead of chatting here, why don&#x27;t you farm a few more ways of monsters and collect the protection fee as soon as possible? Understand? Sigh. someone side.</p>
<p>But boss, your protection fee is too expensive. It&#x27;s almost as much as all the materials I need to upgrade to level two. Just tell me if you&#x27;re going to pay or not,&quot; the arrogant voice said. Everyone shook their heads silently, and the chat channel became even more bleak and oppressive. Although Black Flame is dead, the shock he brought made more people realize the power of the official district organization.</p>
<p>And there are many people like the arrogant kid. I&#x27;ve told you so many times, those with talent join all the big organizations. Those who lack talent should obediently become dogs of large organizations. This is the correct way for most novice lords to survive. The arrogant voice continued.</p>
<p>Stop talking nonsense and pay the fee now. The chat channel fell silent again. Our bloodlord in the newbie zone was killed and the celestials organization was severely damaged. But there are still this organization. that organization and countless other organizations.</p>
<p>A novice lord side, what can I do? I&#x27;m desperate, too. We lords without power or money are truly at the mercy of others. I really don&#x27;t want to pay. Stop talking nonsense. The arrogant voice roared.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll teach you to talk nonsense. A moment later. Ding. Newbie zone 89757. Player Le has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Anyone else want to talk nonsense? The arrogant voice said, &quot;It&#x27;s just killing one or two people. You only become a red name if you kill three. I have plenty of underlings, more than enough. No, boss. We&#x27;ll pay.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll pay.&quot; Okay. Everyone was in despair. Lyn Xiaos epic battle is ultimately irrelevant to us commoner lords. Perhaps some were too desperate to care about the threats of the arrogant voices. One person side as he paid the fee.</p>
<p>We really can only be canon fodder. This battlefield of the myriad races is too dark. There isn&#x27;t a single ray of light. He Let&#x27;s not talk about us. Someone added, &quot;Isn&#x27;t even Lynn Xiaos vassal lord just cannon fodder? Look at Heay and the beautiful girl.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia used them to wear down the enemy. Their own base was raided and hundreds of soldiers were killed. It will be difficult for them to enter the official area in the future. Even when Lin Xiao&#x27;s good friend Chufinga brought Ju Lee and the others to support Lin Shiao, didn&#x27;t they only end up with their entire army wiped out and fleeing in disarray? That&#x27;s right. So don&#x27;t be superstitious about any big shots.</p>
<p>Following any big shot will only lead to being a slave and cannon fodder. We ordinary people can only keep a low profile, swallow our anger, avoid provoking powerful forces, and behave ourselves. Dark. This world is dark. At that moment, a discordant voice suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>He who said following boss Lynn Shia means becoming canon fodder. Chapter 136 shocking everyone. I am the only light. He&#x27;s remarks immediately drew ridicule. He your troops are almost all wiped out and you&#x27;re still smug about it.</p>
<p>Yes, you&#x27;re the kind of person who gets sold out and then counts the money for the seller. Big shots and such are completely unreliable. He curled his lip. H unreliable big shots are other people. Our boss Lin Shia is not that kind of person.</p>
<p>What else could he be but this kind of person? Although I admit he&#x27;s very capable. He didn&#x27;t lose a single soldier while you guys almost all died. Is it because Lyn Sha saved your life that you&#x27;re willing to be his dog? He&#x27;s a Damn. Lyn Sha really treats me like a friend. Friends? Haha.</p>
<p>What about his friend Chufinga and Chufinga&#x27;s friend Julie? With all the soldiers and heroes dead, will Lynn shall receive any compensation? Heay shook his head helplessly and continued. I finally understand what the boss meant by, &quot;I pity their misfortune, but I&#x27;m angry at their lack of ambition. He was talking about you guys.&quot; He immediately pulled out his equipment and sent it to the chat channel. He&#x27;s a dragon&#x27;s pine breastplate, mighty bracers, berserker&#x27;s blade. Click to view.</p>
<p>See that? They&#x27;re all top tier equipment, and I have several pieces myself. Boss Lin Sha shared quite a bit of the loot with us. After a few seconds of silence, the arrogant voice of the person collecting the insurance premiums rang out. H, the equipment is pretty good, but that&#x27;s only because boss Lin Sha killed over a 100 blood lords and accumulated a lot of equipment. He&#x27;s just giving you a few pieces.</p>
<p>But your territory has been raised to the ground. That&#x27;s a fact. You lack troops. Your territory has been destroyed. Even if you start over, you&#x27;ll be far behind others.</p>
<p>It will be difficult to recover your accumulated resources and enter the official zone. Tsk tsk Lyn Sha. What a clever trick. He takes a few pieces of equipment that he doesn&#x27;t need to show off, but he doesn&#x27;t provide you with any real help. What nonsense are you spouting? Even I can&#x27;t stand it anymore.</p>
<p>Tan by Chian also logged on. Who said brother Lin Shia is only good at putting on a show and winning people over? Who says our territory level can&#x27;t catch up? Tan by Chiian. Check it yourself. Lord&#x27;s Mansion LV2 upgrading. Click to view.</p>
<p>Once this 3-day lockdown is over, I&#x27;ll be almost at level three and I can go to the official server soon. He say me too. Lord&#x27;s Mansion LV2 upgrading. Click to view. Holy crap.</p>
<p>This girl got into a second tier university so quickly. Everyone exclaimed. Even faster than me, a lord who had a smooth start. Where did you get so many resources? It was given to me by brother Lynn Shia. Watch out, beautiful lady.</p>
<p>Almost all of your troops have been killed and are unable to protect you. Sooner or later, other lords will target you. Be careful that you end up losing everything. Your money will be stolen and you&#x27;ll be captured and used as a play thing. Someone warned Shan by Chin.</p>
<p>Thank you, little sister. I&#x27;ll take that as a compliment to my beauty. Centaur Chieft Centaur elite archer bear warrior. Click to view. Do you think my unit types are lacking? Where did you get so many different types of soldiers? It was given to me by brother Lynn Shia.</p>
<p>Damn, you guys haven&#x27;t been doing anything shady, have you? What are you saying? My relationship with brother Lynn Shiao is completely innocent. Although brother Lynn Shia can also choose to pursue me, he and Tu Shan by Chin&#x27;s experiences made everyone envious. See that? That&#x27;s the advantage of having a powerful backer. The protection money collector jumped out again. You commoner lords, go to sleep.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll either be dogs or corpses. Tu Shan by Chin said unhappily. Although most of what I got today was thanks to brother Lynn Shia. He also said that he was only rewarding me because I risked my life to help him. It&#x27;s not something you can get by just slacking off.</p>
<p>Brother Lynn Sha said, &quot;Heaven doesn&#x27;t help everyone, but everyone should help themselves. Even without brother Lynn Sha, I would only die a glorious death and I would never be treated like a dog and ordered around like a coward. Heaven does not help everyone. People must help themselves.&quot; The beautiful woman&#x27;s words stirred ripples in the hearts of the lords. Huh? It&#x27;s easy for you to talk when you&#x27;re not the one suffering.</p>
<p>You only get to say that because of your looks, the arrogant voice said. Do you see anyone else getting this kind of treatment? Besides, do they even have the right to help themselves? Silence fell over everyone. The flame that had just been ignited in their hearts was extinguished once more. Then another sigh was heard. That&#x27;s why we have the Holy Alliance.</p>
<p>Starting today, the Holy Alliance will break its rule of only accepting lords of rank B and above and will accept any lord who is unwilling to be a puppet or a dog. From this day forward, members of the Holy Alliance will no longer pay protection money to any force. One word, unyielding. Do you dare to fight for your own destiny? It was Dinglay. Huh, Dinglay? What right do you have to talk big? The arrogant young man said, &quot;Didn&#x27;t you also get your entire unit wiped out?&quot; Dinglay ignored it completely.</p>
<p>These people are just bullying you because they think they can exploit you by claiming to be from an official district organization. In reality, the official district organization wouldn&#x27;t bother going through all that trouble for such a small amount. If you unite, are you really going to be afraid of these people who are just using your connections to bully others? A thought instantly ignited in everyone&#x27;s minds for breaking through a region and annihilating someone just because of their meager resources. Most of these random organizations are just using a name to extort money. As long as we unite, we have nothing to fear.</p>
<p>The arrogant young man was furious. Aren&#x27;t you afraid of being retaliated against after entering the official area by doing this? Tu Shan by Chien. Entering the battlefield of 10,000 races is for fighting and growth. How can you achieve anything if you are timid and hesitant? Everyone, the pretty girl is right. Dinglay is right.</p>
<p>The momentum was about to become uncontrollable. The arrogant young man said, &quot;Anyone who dares to disrespect our organization will be dealt with immediately.&quot; The chat channel went silent again. Ding Lay said, &quot;Gentlemen, I have also completed three books and will soon follow Brother Lynn Shiao to the official server. To all those who look down on me, here&#x27;s a piece of advice. 30 years east of the river, 30 years west of the river, never underestimate a young man&#x27;s potential.&quot; Everyone&#x27;s hearts suddenly lit up again.</p>
<p>His blood surged immediately, and even his breathing became rapid. Dingle, well said. That sounds really exciting. Aren&#x27;t we commoner lords lords too? Let&#x27;s fight. Anyone who dares to rob me, I&#x27;ll fight them to the death.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. Things change every 30 years. Many lords in the official districts are also from commoner backgrounds. Who says we can&#x27;t achieve something great? Isn&#x27;t Lin Shia a typical example? He&#x27;s also a commoner lord. Dinglay felt the powerful force rapidly transmitted from his talent and nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>The arrogant young man planned to suppress him. Lynn Shiao doesn&#x27;t have many days left to live. After the 3-day lockdown, he&#x27;ll be going to the official district. The people in the heavens won&#x27;t let him off then. Besides, what&#x27;s the point of all this shouting? What does Lyn Xiao&#x27;s awesomeness have to do with you? Do you think Lyn Shia would help you? Don&#x27;t forget, this world is just like this dark.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s not a single ray of light. At this moment, Lyn Sha, who had not appeared for a long time, finally spoke up. Everyone, the battlefield of all races is also going against the heavens. How can we lose our fighting spirit? The chat channel fell silent instantly, everyone perking up their ears. I won&#x27;t help you.</p>
<p>I know the battlefield of the myriad races is dark, but I have something to say to you. May all new lords shake off their apathy and simply strive upwards, paying no heed to the words of those who give up on themselves. Even a firefly can shine a little light in the darkness without waiting for a torch. If there is no torch after this, I will be the only light. If there is no torch thereafter, I will be the only light.</p>
<p>As everyone pondered those words, they felt as if they had been struck by lightning. A shiver rose from the soles of my feet and rushed all the way to the top of my head. Silence. The chat channel for newbies in the Lung Nan region was silent for a full minute with no one speaking. Since that day, in the 10 newbie zones of the LN region, the number of lords extorting money under the guise of official zones has decreased by 90%.</p>
<p>Either die or fall silent. The death rate of new lords in the LN region has increased by 50% this year, but the chance of being promoted to the official region has also increased by 50%. After a 3-day lockdown, Lynn Shiao was officially promoted to the next district. Chapter 137 ascension, once again shocking everyone. Finally, the third day of the lockdown has arrived.</p>
<p>On this day, countless people were still waiting in front of the chat channel, discussing enthusiastically. Who else do you think besides Lin Sha could be the first to be promoted to a higher level? I&#x27;ll just say one thing. Dingle is definitely a good candidate. TCH, you don&#x27;t need to tell me. Dingle was already one of the top 10 players in the entire newbie zone, and now he&#x27;s become sworn brothers with Lin Sha.</p>
<p>His strength will only increase. During the 3-day lockdown, aside from the first day when there was fighting, many lords who were already quite good will probably be able to reach tier three by the next few days. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with people like Chufinga and Joli. It&#x27;s a pity that the first player to advance in the newbie zone this year wasn&#x27;t our Lin Sha. It&#x27;s all because of the Black Flames lockdown.</p>
<p>Yes, Black Flame deserves to die. Amidst the discussions, Lynn Shiao had made thorough preparations and was just waiting for the moment the lockdown ended so he could immediately upgrade his district. Although the old squad leader, Dugu Jaalon, had already taken the lead and entered the official zone due to the 3-day lockdown, Lin Shia didn&#x27;t care, as there were no extra rewards for being the first to advance to the zone. Moreover, due to the 3-day lockdown period, multiple people from the newbie zone where Lin Shiao is currently located will enter the official zone together, which also provides him with cover. Time was approaching 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute.</p>
<p>We finally arrived. The blockade is lifted and the curtain of light in the sky slowly dissipates. Ding! Player Julie from the 89757 newbie zone has entered the official zone. Ding! Player Chuunga has entered the official zone 89757. The announcement from the main god system immediately rang out and the geniuses who had been suppressing their emotions for a long time quickly entered the official server at the very first moment of its opening.</p>
<p>In a certain area of the beginner zone, a flash of light appeared and the hazy phantom of a lord&#x27;s mansion rose into the air. Along with the lord&#x27;s mansion, the phantoms of other buildings within the territory also rose into the air. And at the very back were various kinds of mineral resources. After upgrading to a new district, all the buildings and resources of the new lord will be transferred to the official district where they will be placed on their own in a location on the vast map of the official district. Rising into the air is the special effect of the upgrade zone.</p>
<p>Although the god system has implemented some privacy protections, making the lord&#x27;s resources and buildings blurry, everyone can still roughly understand the lord&#x27;s personal strength from the blurry phantom. The first district to be upgraded is Julie. They have a lot of buildings and resources. One person remarked, &quot;No wonder he was once the second place finisher. He still has the ability.&quot; However, it seems that Chufinga has more resources and buildings than Julie.</p>
<p>Nonsense. Chufinga&#x27;s foundation has always been here. Unlike Julie, he doesn&#x27;t need to retake the mines. So, it&#x27;s normal that he has developed the best. Look, isn&#x27;t this Pansyu? He has the most resources.</p>
<p>He just has fewer buildings. Uh, they might be a resource type lord. Sh, keep it quiet. We lords of the 89757 newbie zone have been friends ever since Lynn Shiao said those words 3 days ago. Please keep it a secret for our friends.</p>
<p>There aren&#x27;t many lords like the young boy Pen Shan Yu, but he has a lot of resources, so he is likely a resource type lord. He is not strong in combat, but he is good at production. Such lords are highly sought after in the official districts, not only by major organizations, but also by many desperate criminals who are tempted to rob them. Wong Bo has been promoted to a higher district. Dingle has been promoted to a higher district.</p>
<p>These geniuses are indeed not to be underestimated. The other lords in the newbie zone, whenever they had free time, would look up to watch the spectacular scene of all the geniuses advancing to the newbie zone, hoping that they too would soon be able to reach level three and enter the official zone. They are all geniuses, but overall, Chufinga and Dingle are still the strongest. From the phantom image rising into the sky, one can roughly judge the lord&#x27;s strength. The more buildings and mineral resources a lord possesses, the stronger he she is.</p>
<p>Someone noticed something was wrong. Where&#x27;s Lin Sha? We haven&#x27;t heard his promotion announcement yet. Everyone realized, &quot;Oh, right. Where&#x27;s Lyn Sha? Could it be that something happened to boss Lyn Sha?&quot; Silence. Unease.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha, whom everyone had been eagerly anticipating, had still not ascended to immortality. Could it be that the remaining blood lords have come to retaliate? Or is it that the experts from the official zone are exerting other pressure? Or is it that boss Lynn Shiao is afraid to enter the official zone for fear of retaliation? As everyone was lost in thought, a sudden earthquake shook the ground. What happened? There was an earthquake. I felt the tremor here too. Amidst the astonishment and uncertainty, someone exclaimed, &quot;Look at the sky.&quot; Everyone looked up and saw a huge phantom slowly rising in the sky.</p>
<p>The Phantom was vast and boundless, stretching for countless kilometers. And when it rose, it covered almost half the sky. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a mountain range. &quot;Mountain range,&quot; its boss, Lyn shout. Some people realized that Lyno&#x27;s territory was located in a gourd mountain range, and the phantom rising in the air was that huge gourd mountain range.</p>
<p>Not only the mountains, but also the valleys, the buildings on the mountains, and the resources all took off at the same time. My god, Lyn Sha has emptied an entire mountain range. A hazy but enormous phantom slowly rose up. As people gazed at this phantom, they could vaguely see the entire mountain range, the mineral veins and buildings between the ridges, and the hazy territory located at the mouth of the mountain range. On the mountain range, there were even some shadowy figures of wild monsters moving around and cheering.</p>
<p>I think I just saw a witch dancing wildly on the mountaintop, someone said in disbelief. Master Lynsha, how exactly did you manage to do that? When a lord enters a formal district, they can only take away their own mineral resources and buildings. I&#x27;ve never heard of someone taking away an entire mountain range along with them. Lynn Shia is truly amazing. At this moment, watching the giant mountain range slowly recede into the distance.</p>
<p>The lords still remaining in the newbie zone were filled with envy and longing. Lynhias abilities were infinitely elevated in their minds. Within his territory nestled in the mountains, Lyn Shiao gazed into the distance at the rapidly receding beginner area and nodded in satisfaction. Within the nearly 100 square kilm of the entire mountain range, all the mineral veins belong to him. All the monster layers belong to him and even all the monsters in the valleys obey him.</p>
<p>The Calabash mountain range formed a closed loop and the main god system was directly lifted up along with the entire mountain. Entering the formal area now we don&#x27;t even need to move our nest. We just need to find a good place to put this mountain. The mountain range stopped suspended tens of thousands of meters above a vast dark expanse of land. Next, simply choose a landing point to officially enter the main area.</p>
<p>The official zone also has a fog of war, so choosing a place to land is very important. Choosing a location in the crowd makes trading and communication easier, but it also makes you more likely to be exposed. The chosen location was too far from the other lords, seemingly safer, but it yielded. Use the celestial perspective ability of the Hasha decree. Chapter 138.</p>
<p>Finding the location, the aftermath of shock. With the gods perspective activated, Lyn Sha once again gained an unimaginably vast field of vision. The incredibly vast map of Long Nan district was finally partially revealed to Lynn Shiao. He was currently in Lan City, the central city of the Lan district. Each official district will have a small number of city states and a largest city which is the central city.</p>
<p>The lords in the formal districts are scattered in various places which makes it easier to acquire resources and develop their power. However, they also have the need for social interaction and communication. For some important resources, face-to-face negotiations are also easier to complete. So, the central city came into being. Lon central city has stood in Lan district for thousands of years.</p>
<p>This ancient citystate, a battlefield of countless races, covers an area comparable to the mega cities Lin Shiao had seen in his previous life, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangho, Shenzhen, New York, and Tokyo. It is incredibly prosperous and has everything one could need. There are no Lord&#x27;s territories in Lan City, only residential and commercial buildings. Therefore, many lords chose to place their territories near Long Nan City for easy access to the city. However, due to historical reasons, the land surrounding Lan City has long been divided up, and only powerful families and leaders of large organizations have the opportunity to place their territories around Lan City.</p>
<p>Within Lon City, except in designated areas, any act that harms others is prohibited. This is an authority granted to each central city by the main god system. Only in this way can a basic peace be maintained in the world of the battlefield of 10,000 races where the strong become stronger. The knowledge he had learned in class echoed in his mind and Lin Xiaos divine perspective had already briefly swept over the entire Lan city. Lan city after entering the official district, you need to go there to report.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao continued to shift his perspective, searching across the vast land. Lynn Shiao didn&#x27;t consider locations that were too close to Lan City. However, he also didn&#x27;t want to settle in any of the remote corners of the LN region. Many uninhabited areas while possessing abundant resources and treasures are also hiding places for lawless elements and outlaws like the Celestial People Organization. After a short while, Lin Sha found a secluded place with abundant mineral resources, also located in the mountains and hills.</p>
<p>After entering the official area, apart from major battles, I mainly rely on teleportation portals to get in and out. This is fine in the mountainous and hilly areas, and it can also hide my calabash mountain range. After confirming repeatedly that there was no other person&#x27;s territory in any area within his field of vision around this location, Lin Sha no longer hesitated and directly granted his own territory. Ding. You have successfully entered the Lia domain, Lan region.</p>
<p>Please report to Lan Central City within 24 hours. As a perk of officially becoming a lord, you have received a permanent portal which has been added to your inventory. The notification from the main god system sounded and Lynhiao&#x27;s entire territory rapidly plummeted in the newbie zone. After witnessing the complete disappearance of the massive mountain range, heated discussions once again arose. Lynho&#x27;s strength also left an indelible impression on the new lords of this year&#x27;s region.</p>
<p>His fearless resistance against power, his counterattack, and his words made countless commoner lords idolize Lin Sha, a fast-moving scout type lord who flies at low altitudes. Soon, he arrived at the former Hulu Pass. Looking around, the entire Hulu mountain range had disappeared, leaving only a desolate land covering nearly 100 km. He picked up a talisman crystal, began to record the scene before him, and then dialed someone&#x27;s number. Not far away, different lords from different factions also came to this area and reported what they had seen and heard.</p>
<p>Did he really say that ic? So majestic, Shu Yusi exclaimed in admiration in a magnificent city lord&#x27;s mansion. Fongu, you&#x27;ve really made a good friend. Shu Yusi squinted slightly, his hands behind his back as he slowly paced back and forth. As an ordinary citizen, he has such lofty aspirations and a broad mind. He is not only exceptionally capable, but his willpower also seems to be far beyond that of ordinary people.</p>
<p>If he does not die in the future, he will surely achieve great things. Old man, you keep saying what would happen if someone didn&#x27;t die, why don&#x27;t you just protect him? Chufinga with red hair picked at his ear and said impatiently, I&#x27;m tired of hearing how talented Lyn Shiao is, but I&#x27;ve never seen anyone go to protect him. He You&#x27;re just a child. Hardship is an essential part of a genius&#x27;s growth. Didn&#x27;t you grow up quickly after almost being wiped out this time? Chu Yusi said dismissively.</p>
<p>Fongu, why hasn&#x27;t Lin Sha arrived yet? What is this real? Did he really say that? The shocked voice, devoid of its usual elegance and composure, startled the kneeling brands. Yes, of course it&#x27;s true. Everyone in the newbie zone of Lan heard what Lin Shao said. I wouldn&#x27;t dare lie. If there are no torches from now on, I will be the only light.&quot; Andrea kept repeating those words to herself, and her body swayed uncontrollably as she sat on the throne.</p>
<p>At this moment, she had lost her usual charm and allure, and instead became somewhat dejected, as if she had suddenly become like a helpless little girl, lost in thought. Who knows the hardships I endured leading the demons out of the sewers and out into the world again? Does anyone know that we demons also long to see the sunlight? Andrea muttered to herself, her eyes glazed over. That&#x27;s not a very good statement either. What Dinglay said about 30 years east of the river, 30 years west of the river, I think is even better. Kneeling Brands interjected upon seeing his master&#x27;s loss of composure.</p>
<p>If one day I were to brutally beat that brat Lynn Shia and then in front of everyone, say 30 years east of the river, I can&#x27;t even imagine what that would feel like, Bran said, lost in his beautiful fantasy, his body stiffening with pleasure. Get lost, the succubus princess kicked Bran, sending him flying. You&#x27;re over 700 years old. 30 years east of the river, 30 years west of the river. Don&#x27;t underestimate the poor in old age.</p>
<p>Bran&#x27;s voice could be heard from afar. The succubus princess couldn&#x27;t help but laugh, but her laughter seemed to contain tears. Inside the lord&#x27;s mansion, which resembled a grand gothic cathedral, Pu Dawei, a man in a floral shirt, crumpled up the note containing the message and casually tossed it aside. He has some skills, but also the naivity and ridiculousness typical of a novice. Still want to be the only light? You&#x27;re just like me 20 years ago, stealing the spotlight, Lynn Sha.</p>
<p>However, I have found the one I truly deserve to serve, and that is the all- knowing and all powerful Lord. I have also received a reward from the Lord, a mythical angel. One day, I will correct Long Sa&#x27;s deviations and lead him back to the right path.&quot; The man in the floral shirt raised his hand, and the blonde angel behind him quietly stepped forward and handed him a cup of warm coffee. Inside the old-fashioned palace, the maid relayed the information she had gathered to the aloof and elegant beauty. The woman&#x27;s eyes narrowed slightly at first, then suddenly widened.</p>
<p>&quot;Did he really say that?&quot; And after that, there were no torches, and I became the only light. &quot;Yes.&quot; Upon hearing this, the lords of the 89757 newbie zone immediately killed the lord who had been collecting protection money, the maid replied. Then many major battles broke out in the newbie zone, and many lords who were previously strangers gathered together to resist the extortionists in the official zone. Good. Good.</p>
<p>Well done. The stunningly beautiful woman&#x27;s perpetually aloof face showed a rare expression of joy, surprising even the maid standing beside her. Lyn Sha is stronger than I imagined. We must protect him. We must do everything in our power to protect him.</p>
<p>Even if the whole world is against us, judging by the time, he should have been officially promoted to the district level today. I need to go find Chu Yusi right away and explain things to him. Chapter 139. Reporting in. Farewell to Dugu.</p>
<p>Jaolon. Lyn Sha completed the landing in the official zone. He briefly inspected the territory, finding all the buildings intact, and then strolled leisurely with Baoi, patrolling a small part of the Calabash Valley. All the monsters were safe and sound. The flying experience was still a bit too exciting for them.</p>
<p>A ruthless demon fainted with joy when he heard that Sherry, that witch, was finally able to escape the newbie zone. Why is she so happy to escape the beginner area? because she said there was a very powerful lord in the newbie zone who was her master and that master controlled her so she couldn&#x27;t absorb the essence of male creatures. Now that she&#x27;s in the official zone, there are wild monsters and wild men everywhere. Lyn Sha was a little embarrassed. Then ask her next time who her owner is in the official area.</p>
<p>Oh. The demon answered blankly and went back to work diligently in his sulfur mind. After confirming that his territory was intact, Lynn Shiao calmly arrived at the gate of his territory and opened a teleportation portal right below the four exploding arrow towers. Location next to the Lord&#x27;s reception area in Lan City. Specific coordinates xxx.</p>
<p>The permanent portal will open soon. From now on, Lyno&#x27;s territory and the central city can be reached simply by crossing the portal. When he wants to go back, he only needs to silently think of opening a portal to return to the gate of his territory. Ba, use the concealment skill to conceal the portal in my territory. I don&#x27;t want my location to be discovered when I come back.</p>
<p>Ba&#x27;s mythical hero quality is unlocked. She gains an additional skill, peerless demoness. Peerless enchantress. Ba, one of the four enchantresses, possesses boundless charm. This skill is unlocked if she has become another man&#x27;s wife.</p>
<p>Ba can temporarily seize the luck of others and transfer it to a certain person or place and it will be returned after the time is up. Ba can influence fortune so she can amplify, shrink and transfer the effects of specific skills. Skills that are too powerful cannot be manipulated. Lynn Shiao had Bao Se directly transfer and amplified the concealment effect of the forest which cloak making the portals within his territory concealed blocking any exploration by a rank or lower skills making them undetectable unlocatable and uncarchable by specific skills. This greatly enhances the security of one&#x27;s own territory.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time to report for duty. Lyn Sha had already contacted Dinglay. He stepped through the teleportation portal and arrived directly in a corner of the LN city reception area where he met Ding Lay standing not far away. Lin Sha nodded to Ding Lay and together they walked towards the towering main building in the city center where the city lord&#x27;s mansion was located. Brother Shia, although we&#x27;ve been locked down for 3 days, there are still very few new lords coming here.</p>
<p>Ding Lay said while observing the surrounding situation. Even if we&#x27;re not the earliest, we&#x27;re still in the top 50. That&#x27;s fine, too. I&#x27;m actually a very low-key person, Lyn Shao said with a faint smile. Ding Li pursed his lips speechlessly.</p>
<p>When you said that when there was no torch, I was the only light. The amplification effect of my 30 years of prosperity statement was directly reduced by 30%. So, you still have 70% of your growth left. This time your strength must have surpassed any of your previous boasting, right? It&#x27;s a glorious performance. Don&#x27;t put it so harshly.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. That&#x27;s what we call a glorious performance. The reception area was not far from the city lord&#x27;s mansion. And soon Lin Shia and Dinglay walked downstairs to the city lord&#x27;s mansion.</p>
<p>Before the magnificent hall, more than a dozen lords who had arrived that day were already waiting. Once it was clear that almost everyone had arrived, the gatekeeper let the new lords in to register. I remember that in previous years this matter was handled in the side hall of the city lord&#x27;s mansion. A lord said, &quot;What&#x27;s going on this year? They actually let us into the hall. Are we going to see the city lord?&quot; That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>A new city lord was appointed just a few days ago. The new rule he established is that all lords must report to the city lord&#x27;s mansion so that he can meet with each of them. Oh, they&#x27;re really letting us see the city lord. That&#x27;s a very important person. As the group chatted in hush tones, they suddenly noticed Lin Sha approaching.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha had made a name for himself in the battle a few days ago, and coupled with his extremely handsome appearance, he was quickly recognized. Your Lin Sha? Lyn Sha nodded in acknowledgement. Those present were the most outstanding and top-notch geniuses from each of the newbie zones. They also had their own pride. When they discovered that Lin Shiao was with them, they simply greeted him or nodded in acknowledgement.</p>
<p>However, most people couldn&#x27;t hide their envy and jealousy of Lin Xiao&#x27;s outstanding performance. Lyn Shao saw everything but continued walking forward without caring. In the grand hall, a majestic figure stood in the center, surrounded by dozens of officials of various ranks. On the side of the hall, behind the officials were several other newly promoted novice lords resting. Chu Yusi Lin Shao recognized the figure standing in the center.</p>
<p>The lord of Lan city, the central city of Long Nan district is actually the lord of Jangdong city in the real world of blue star. Harah, welcome. Welcome to all you talented young people. Chu Yusi laughed heartily, opened his arms in a welcoming gesture, and had everyone invited to the center of the hall to stand in front of him. Greetings, Lord City Lord.</p>
<p>No need for formalities. This is a city state on the battlefield of all races. There aren&#x27;t as many formalities as in the real world of Blue Star. Chu Yui said, &quot;I have only been the city lord of Lan City for a few days, and I am a newcomer just like you. We&#x27;re all newcomers.</p>
<p>Let me introduce myself. I am Chu Yusi. I was once one of the chief lords of the Lan district. After retiring, I became the city lord of Dangdong city in the blue star world. The domain lord of Langia transferred me to Lan city to assume the position of city lord.</p>
<p>Fellow young talents, the future prosperity of the Lan region depends on you all. After saying this, Chu Yusi bowed slightly to the crowd. No, no, you flatter me, city lord. Everyone hurriedly returned the greeting and then in the order they entered, each briefly introduced themselves. Lyn Sha was at the back of the line and at that moment he casually looked around.</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt a familiar gaze gently fall upon him through the crowd of officials. Lyn Sha turned his head and saw a woman in purple standing not far away, nodding to him from afar. She wore a pale purple robe, a sword at her waist, and stood tall and proud, ethereal and otherworldly like a fairy descended to earth. Her long hair cascaded down. Her purple robe was as beautiful as a flower, and her long sword was as white as snow.</p>
<p>She possessed indescribable beauty, elegance, and noble refinement. Her fair face was charming yet aloof. Her beautiful eyes clear as water. Her thin lips were lightly pursed, pink and glistening, and her every move exuded a cool elegance. It was Dugu Jaon.</p>
<p>Linhaos lips curled up slightly, and he nodded to Dugu Xiaolan from afar. By this time, Dinglay had finished his introduction. The powerful strength he unconsciously exuded drew exclamations of admiration from the lords, while the officials standing nearby whispered among themselves and nodded in agreement. Dinglay turned around and gave his seat to Lyn Shao. The atmosphere suddenly became quiet.</p>
<p>All eyes turned to Lyn Sha. Everyone recognized Lin Sha. Lyn Shiao, you shameless lord, how dare you even report to the official district. Chapter 140 surrounded and attacked head-on. A furious curse broke the silence that had followed Lin Xiaos arrival.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao, you scum who colludes with foreign tribes. How dare you come to report to the official district? Lyn Shao was slightly takenback. He looked up and saw that Chu Yusi&#x27;s face was also filled with shock and confusion, which quickly turned into undisguised anger. The speaker was an official underchui. He spoke with spittlefing, pointing at Lin Shiao and condescendingly criticizing him.</p>
<p>H an orphan from Jangdong Tomato orphanage. Being able to enter the battlefield of the myriad races is already a blessing from God. Yet he&#x27;s unwilling to give up his once dominant position at school and colludes with foreign races. Another official came out and sneered. It&#x27;s understandable for young people to show off.</p>
<p>Which of us here wasn&#x27;t a prodigy in our youth? The important thing is to uphold the bottom line. Otherwise, we are traitors who betray Lia and humanity. Young man, don&#x27;t be too bloodthirsty. You kill the descendants of the chief lord at the slightest disagreement, even in front of others. With your temperament, it&#x27;s hard to go far.</p>
<p>One official after another came out, mocking and ridiculing Lyn Shao. Lynos expression quickly turned cold. All the novice lords around him, except for Ding Lay, took a step away to keep their distance from Lyn Shao. Across from him, Shu Yusi&#x27;s face was also terribly gloomy. Suddenly, as if by prior agreement, all the officials simultaneously attacked Lin Shiao without consulting him.</p>
<p>This was not only a warning to Lyn Shia, but also a reprimand to him, the city lord, who had only been in office for a few days. Shut up. Chu Yusi interrupted the officials accusations with a sharp shout. I, the city lord, am here to welcome all the new lords who have come to report to the official district, not to have you criticize them. Lyn Shia has neither killed any innocent people nor done anything to betray Lia.</p>
<p>So what are you all babbling about here for? What kind of behavior is this making such a racket? Lyn Sha raised his eyelids and glanced at Chu Yui. This man was Fong Ji&#x27;s father. In his youth, he was a mad man from Jangdong. He didn&#x27;t care about official decorum or his own authority. He directly bered his subordinates, which intimidated some of those who mocked him.</p>
<p>The sudden argument in the hall attracted the attention of those who had already registered and were resting on one side of the hall. They gathered around, puzzled. A cold, beautiful woman in purple also looked over from afar. Your excellency, you are unaware of this. An official relying on his seniority retorted.</p>
<p>We did not intend to make things difficult for Len Shiao. It&#x27;s just that this boy is unruly and has a deep misunderstanding of Lshia. We had no choice but to speak up to remind him in order to prevent him from going astray. What misunderstanding does he have about Lia? Chu Yusi asked in a deep voice. Lord, City Lord, an official stepped forward and added.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure the city lord is aware of this boy&#x27;s spectacular battle a few days ago and his words, &quot;Since there are no more torches, I will be the only light.&quot; The official turned around and looked at Lyn Sha. This brat actually said that my dragon kingdom has no torches. He said, &quot;The battlefield of the war of 10,000 races is dark and that the dragon kingdom is dark. Isn&#x27;t this cursing long sya, belittling long sa and maliciously smearing Longa? The officials eyes were bloodshot as he glared at Lin Sha as if he were not a young lord but a heinous villain. That is smearing Lia and spreading malicious rumors.</p>
<p>Where is Lia? Anything dark? Based on that one sentence alone, we could convict you. The scene was chaotic. Some officials nodded coldly and looked down at Lyn Sha while others stood indifferently at the back with their hands behind their backs, seemingly unconcerned. On the outermost edge, the novice lords who were watching suddenly realized what was going on and began to whisper among themselves. Lyn Xiaos expression was calm and indifferent, showing neither joy nor sorrow.</p>
<p>It seemed that these scenes were nothing more than noise to him, not worth a groan. Shu Yusi, who was about to continue reprimanding the disobedient subordinate, saw Lin Xiaos expression and demeanor and secretly nodded in approval, raising his opinion of Lin Shiao even higher. Ding Lay couldn&#x27;t hold back any longer and was about to speak up for Lyn Sha, but Lyn Sha stopped him with a gesture. Lyn Sha slowly took a step forward. With just that one step, the entire hall immediately fell silent.</p>
<p>Even the officials who were spitting as they spoke were startled and subconsciously stopped talking. Lyn Shiao, what other words do you have to defend yourself? The official was somewhat embarrassed and annoyed to find himself intimidated by a novice lord. Everyone, I Lyn Sha am just here to report. Once I finished, I could have left. But you officers have a deep misunderstanding of me.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha Lyn Sha said calmly. What I said about the torch and the light was only to encourage everyone in the newbie zone to shake off the coldness and do more to cheer themselves up. This is just to ensure that the lords in the newbie zone don&#x27;t lose their edge and that they don&#x27;t allow those who are just sitting on the laps of power to ride rashad over them. I didn&#x27;t say who is darkness. Darkness is there and we will have to face it eventually.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha sneered. But now some people are taking it personally and getting anxious. Is there a single wrong word in what Lin Sha said? Who are you calling a fox borrowing the tiger&#x27;s power? A mere figurehead holding a position. What are you eating? Although the official had been detached from Chinese civilization for a long time, he still subconsciously understood about 80% of the meaning. When he heard Lin Shia use an idiom, he clearly understood that Lyn Shao was cursing him.</p>
<p>Shu Yusi narrowed his eyes in satisfaction upon hearing Lin Shiao use two four character phrases in succession which were concise, meaningful, and profound, waiting for Lin Xiao&#x27;s next response. I&#x27;m not targeting anyone in particular. I&#x27;m saying that all of you here who are criticizing me are just bullies holding positions without doing any work. You officials, aren&#x27;t you just relying on the power given to you by the Dragon Sea Kingdom to point fingers at the lords who are conquering all sides, and you&#x27;re always trying to punish me? Isn&#x27;t this just a fox borrowing the tiger&#x27;s power? You officials, instead of investigating the facts and understanding the cause and course of events, you slap the accusations of indiscriminate killing and smearing Lia on my head. What is this if not holding a position without doing your job? Lord Shu, I have a suggestion for you.</p>
<p>Most of these officials, big and small, are not capable of being used. Lyn Xiaos voice wasn&#x27;t loud. But after he finished speaking, the entire room fell silent. The official who was being scolded angrily pointed his finger at Lin Shiao, trembling and unable to speak. You, what a sophistry.</p>
<p>Do our officials need you to give them orders? Some officials were so angry they laughed. All right. All right. Even if what torch fire and the dark stream meant was what you said to encourage everyone in the newbie zone. But what about your collusion with the demons? The demon race is the common enemy of the entire blue star.</p>
<p>The blue star convention clearly states, &quot;Anyone who colludes with the demon race is guilty of a serious crime.&quot; Lyn Sha, how do you explain this? Lyn Sha casually picked at his ear and said indifferently, &quot;I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m colluding with the demons. Do you have any evidence?&quot; Chapter 141. The Dragon Sia domain Lord appears. Still trying to deny it, the official shouted. I&#x27;ll shut you up right now.</p>
<p>He pulled out a list and announced loudly. Your vassel lord inadvertently started a live stream and stumbled upon an abyssal demon discussing your relationship with the demon princess. I suspect you and the demon princess have some shady deal going on. Lyn Sha said expressionlessly. You believe what the demons say? You believe what the enemy says? If that abyss demon said you were his son, you would have gained a father for no reason.</p>
<p>The official was so angry he choked. You suppressed laugh came from behind me. How will you explain when the witches in your territory reiterate your intention to marry the demon princess during the final battle? The witch said those words to put some pressure on the bloodthirsty lords who might still be invading. This is just a tactical deception and doesn&#x27;t count. Remembering how Sherry thought she could become a lord after ascending to the official zone and danced wildly with joy, Lyn Sha suddenly felt a headache coming on.</p>
<p>He thought he might have to go back and teach this woman. No, this witch, whose mind was filled with unhealthy thoughts a lesson. Several lords among the onlookers nodded slightly, agreeing with Lin Xiaos explanation. All fair in war. There&#x27;s no such thing as honesty on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Then let me ask you, why are there so many demons under your command in your valley? Lynsha said, I need to correct one point. These demons, like all the wild monsters in the valley, are only loyal to me, but they are not troops under my command. The official shouted, &quot;How did you do that? This is the secret of my talent, and I cannot tell you. Nonsense. Humans don&#x27;t have that kind of talent, and humans can&#x27;t be friends with wild monsters.&quot; Lynn Sha sneered.</p>
<p>Yes, peace can reduce the monster&#x27;s hostility, can&#x27;t it? The official asked in confusion. You use this F-rank talent to subdue wild monsters. Lyn Sha said seriously. Of course not. It&#x27;s mainly because I&#x27;m handsome.</p>
<p>A few scattered laughs came from behind him. The official realized that he had been tricked by Lin Sha and his face immediately turned red. What a despicable liar who spouts nonsense. Well, you can&#x27;t deny it now, can you? Another official waved his hand, and a giant projection appeared in midair. This was the scene of the great battle between Lin Shiao and Black Flame.</p>
<p>At that time, Black Flame had already perished, leaving only the last remaining Iron Wall crusaders. In the scene, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s white-clad hero pulled a miniature nest demon from his robes and threw it into the enemy ranks. The battle was intense. The footage was clear and it&#x27;s unclear when the live stream was recorded. Lyn Xiaos whiteclad hero who keeps a nest demon is once again on display in full view of everyone.</p>
<p>Please tell me what&#x27;s going on with this nest demon. After showing the footage, the official looked coldly at Lyn Sha, waiting for his explanation. Lyn Sha shrugged. Even primitive humans could raise lions and tigers and tame wolves as dogs. My hero wants to try taming a little nest demon as a battle pet.</p>
<p>Is there anything wrong with that? How can demons be tamed? Just raise him like a son. Another low chuckle came from behind. The officials face flushed red. But those are demons, the common enemy of the entire blue star. Lynn Shia curled his lip.</p>
<p>Why don&#x27;t you just kill all the demons on the battlefield of all races in the blue star realm? liberate all the mineral resources occupied by the demons and benefit the lords. Wouldn&#x27;t that be better? The official was speechless. Indeed, although the demons were enemies on the battlefield of all races, which wild monster wasn&#x27;t an enemy in every district, countless demons occupy various resource points. But the lords of dragon summer have always treated them as ordinary wild monsters. Seeing the official speechless, Lynn Sha added, &quot;My hero raised the nest demons to understand the habits of the demon race and to become familiar with them so that he could better criticize and fight against the demon race in the future.</p>
<p>He is so noble, much better than you, bunch of people who only know how to talk. you. Seeing that Lynn Shao had calmly diffused all the accusations and that none of the officials who had accused him had any concrete evidence, frustration and anger gradually crept into their hearts. They felt that Lyn Sha was connected to the demon race, but they were powerless to do anything about him. Chu Yusi nodded in satisfaction once again.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao had taught this group of incompetent and tyrannical officials a lesson without him even having to lift a finger. Lord City Lord. The official went directly to Chui. This boy is arrogant and conceited, publicly defying the officials of the city lord&#x27;s mansion. He has absolutely no respect for the law or authority, and he also has an unclear and ambiguous relationship with the demons.</p>
<p>I suggest we thoroughly investigate this person. Until then, I do not recommend letting him act recklessly. Oh, Chu Yusi said, &quot;Without evidence, what crime can he be charged with?&quot; &quot;Sir, the laws of Lshia only require suspicion to investigate him. As long as we investigate, we will definitely find evidence.&quot; &quot;Absurd. How can you shoot the arrow first and then draw the target?&quot; Chu Yusi rebuked, &quot;Lin Xiao is one of the top geniuses in our Lnon region.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#x27;t doing this disappoint the people of the world. My lord, I was only thinking of Long Xia&#x27;s best interests, the official said sincerely. Lyn Sha only has F- level lord talent and is a commoner. No matter how you explain it, it is impossible for him to defeat the black flame army innocently. The ambiguous relationship between Lin Shia and the demon clan is escalating and has become widely known.</p>
<p>If we don&#x27;t make some statements, soon other domains will doubt us, question us, and even find excuses to make things difficult for us. Don&#x27;t forget, Lynn Shiao just killed a squad of legendary gold tier Templar knights. Right now, there are quite a few people who are watching us closely, ready to cause trouble if we don&#x27;t deal with Lin Shiao. Chu Yusi narrowed his eyes. The official was right.</p>
<p>This was also one of the focal points of his argument with the conservative officials in the Lang Sha domain palace that day. Dugu Nanuang transferred him to Lan city as the city lord also so that he could solve this problem himself. Lynn Shiao had ties with the demon clan, but he wanted to protect this young man who he found agreeable. The atmosphere in the hall became deathly silent. Everyone looked at the new city lord and then at Lin Shia who stood tall and composed.</p>
<p>Ding lay clenched his fists, gritted his teeth, and slowly scanned his surroundings. In the distance, a beautiful figure in purple was also silently watching. Lyn Sha sighed inwardly, realizing he had underestimated the influence of the demon clan and the pressure exerted on Lia by other domains. Forget it. If I&#x27;m really going to be investigated, I&#x27;ll just open a portal and escape, then live as a fugitive in the vast region and secretly develop my power.</p>
<p>Chu Yusi finally let out a cold snort and was about to speak when a giant projection suddenly appeared in the center of the hall. A woman of unparalleled beauty, mature and aloof, dressed in a magnificent gown and adorned with solemn headdress, appeared before the crowd, exuding a cool and noble air, yet possessing an air of authority. Lord, territory Lord. The officials were takenback for a moment, then quickly bowed their heads respectfully. Oh my, it&#x27;s her majesty the queen.</p>
<p>The novice lords then realized what was happening and hurriedly followed the officials in bowing. The person who came was none other than Dugan Nanwang, the current domain lord of Langsha domain, the patriarch of one of the four major families of Langsha kingdom and known as the queen of Lshia among the people of Langsha. In the present-day Lang Sha kingdom and Langsha domain, there is no longer a monarch. The title of queen is merely a common name among the people. Dugu Nanuang glanced around with indifferent eyes, then spoke softly.</p>
<p>&quot;Chui, your subordinate is here. Haven&#x27;t you finished the task I assigned you?&quot; Shu Yui lowered his head, his mind a complete blank, his eyes darting around. I&#x27;m already taking care of it. Is it being processed? If it were being processed, this place wouldn&#x27;t be in such a mess. Dug Nanuang said, &quot;Lin Xiao is my disciple, someone I have been cultivating with great effort recently.&quot; However, people have been slandering him, saying that he is colluding with the demon race.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t I tell you to clarify the rumors? Chapter 142. The domain lord&#x27;s closed door disciple. Kenzo Dohara visits. Dugu Nanuang, the domain lord of Langsha domain and someone she has been cultivating. Everyone present stood frozen in place as if they were sitting on wooden chickens.</p>
<p>If that&#x27;s the case, then it explains why Lynn Shiao has such great strength, powerful heroes, powerful troops, and so many resources. She was the most powerful woman in the entire Dragon Summer domain. How could the power cultivated by the domain lord of Dragon domain not be strong? Even if it&#x27;s an F-level talent, we&#x27;ll build it up for you. Although Chu Yusi looked down and seemed confused, his eyes darted around. After hearing Dugu Nanchuan&#x27;s words, he immediately figured out the reason.</p>
<p>The rumors about Lin Shiao and the demon clan are getting worse and worse. The domain lord is going to take action personally to give Lynn Shia a legitimate lineage. The domain lord must protect Lin Sha. The domain lord doesn&#x27;t care about Lin Sha as ties to the demon clan. He must protect Lin Sha.</p>
<p>Chu Yusi was overjoyed and quickly said, &quot;This subordinate dares not forget the Lord&#x27;s instructions. I just wanted to test Lin Xiaos character when faced with malicious difficulties.&quot; &quot;So, have you passed the test?&quot; Dugan Nonwang asked coldly. With unwavering resolve and exceptional willpower, he is destined to become an outstanding chief lord of the Dragon Sia domain in the future. As soon as Chu Yusi finished speaking, the scene erupted in uproar. In front of the domain lord, the city lord praised a lord who had just entered the official area, saying that he would definitely become the chief lord in the future.</p>
<p>There are only 10 chief lords currently in service in the entire dragon sia domain who are the strongest fighting force in the entire dragon sa domain. on the surface. In a moment, your subordinates will issue an internal and external announcement proclaiming to the entire Dragon Sia domain and replying to foreign nations that Lin Sha has no connection with the demon clan, but is the most trustworthy, direct descendant genius of the Dragon Sia domain. Very good. The woman projected on the giant screen nodded calmly.</p>
<p>Chu Yusi, you should properly manage your subordinates. What&#x27;s the use of keeping officials who are incompetent and lack drive? If you&#x27;re going to replace them, then replace them directly regardless of whose faction they belong to. All the officials shrank back in unison. Lyn Shia, you&#x27;re absolutely right. It has to be admitted that there are still many dark sides to Lia and many things that aren&#x27;t exactly honorable.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, regardless of whether Linhao&#x27;s words were meant to encourage novice lords to break free from their aloofness and shine on their own, or to point out the many dark sides of Lia, his words directly address the shortcomings and point out the deficiencies. Any official should take this as a warning and not try to make things difficult for Lin Sha. If this happens again, I will never let you off the hook.&quot; As Dugu Nanuang finished speaking, her cold gaze swept around the hall once more. Finally settling on Lin Sha, Lyn Sha nodded slightly, meeting Dugun Nanuangs gaze with composure. He looked like an arrogant genius, responding to his superior, neither serval nor humble, displaying extraordinary demeanor.</p>
<p>Dugu Nanuangs gaze then swept lightly over the figure in purple before she closed the communication. Few, everyone present breathed a sigh of relief, finally freed from the oppressive aura of Queen Dugu. Looking at themselves, they were already covered in cold sweat. That was Dugu Nanuang, the number one person in Lang Sha domain. I never expected her to be so beautiful and young.</p>
<p>And Lord Lia, why did you suddenly come to help me? On the surface, Lin Sha maintained a calm and composed demeanor, ignoring the surprised and envious gazes cast upon him. But inwardly, his emotions were in turmoil. Such an important figure who had never said a word to me suddenly appeared and took all the blame for the suspicions surrounding me. Could there be a trap here? I have already refused the official offer from Chu Yusi. So why would the domain lord personally come to help me clear my name? With his remarkable observational skills, Lyn Sha couldn&#x27;t help but turn his head slightly to look at the figure in purple in the distance.</p>
<p>Could it be that the class monitor intervened again? But what does she know? We can&#x27;t just guess. Both of them share the surname Dugu. And although Lord Dugga&#x27;s makeup is a bit heavy, the two still look somewhat similar. The two also have very similar temperaments. Both being aloof and reserved.</p>
<p>One is more mature with a dignified and elegant air and an unparalleled beauty. The other is more graceful, lively, and cunning. Payment to death. I wouldn&#x27;t believe that the class monitor and the lord of Lsha domain had no connection. Dugu Jaolon calmly met Lynh Xiaos gaze and simply nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Linhaos heart skipped a beat. There was indeed a connection. For the sake of the class monitor, I&#x27;ll take on the role of Dugan Nanuangs disciple for a while. I&#x27;ll ask the class monitor for the specific reason later. Whispers filled the hall.</p>
<p>Several officials glanced at Lin Shiao with complicated expressions before whispering amongst themselves. Everyone had recovered from their shock and began discussing the words spoken by Lord Lia. Hey, so Lin Shiao is actually a disciple personally trained by the domain lord. I think those people outside who doubt Lyn Xiao strength can shut up now. There&#x27;s no need to doubt the strength of the domain lord&#x27;s lineage.</p>
<p>No wonder he rebuked these officials to their faces without any fear. He has the demeanor of a domain lord. It seems we misunderstood Lin Sha. Ding Lay also relaxed, looking at Lynn Shiao with shock in his eyes. Lynn Sha didn&#x27;t need to ask to know what he was thinking in that mournful look.</p>
<p>It must be because he had acted too well. Could he get one for him too? But there was nothing he could do. Her majesty the queen suddenly attacked him before he could react. I can&#x27;t very well go to her majesty the queen and beg her for another disciple spot. Everyone, please quiet down.</p>
<p>Chu Yusi finally spoke. I originally just wanted to test Lynn Shiao and see how everyone would react to this matter. Now that the domain lord has spoken and cleared Lin Sha of suspicion, there&#x27;s no need for me to say anything more. You are all geniuses from Lan District and even Lia full of vigor. I hope that in the future you can also be like Lynn Shiao.</p>
<p>Break free from your aloofness, shine your own light and become the light in the darkness. the domain Lord and I will always support you. We will heed your teachings Lord City Lord. All the lords who came to report bowed in unison. The registration process is complete and they can now return to their respective territories.</p>
<p>Just then a commotion arose outside the hall. Then with a loud bang, a security guard was shoved to the ground and the group swaggered in. Lord City Lord. A loud yet strange voice rang out, causing everyone to turn their heads and watch as this arrogant group walked straight up to them. The group of people wore loose black clothing, wooden clogs, and their hair was tied in small braids and combed back, revealing large expanses of smooth foreheads.</p>
<p>Below their noses, in the center of their filtrum, was a small tuft of black beard. The leader, a fat man with a sleazy appearance, shouted exaggeratedly, &quot;Lord City Lord, we finally found you. You must stand up for us.&quot; Chu Yusi suppressed his anger and slowly said, &quot;Kinzo Dohara, didn&#x27;t I tell you to stay at the consulate, and I would summon you after I finish my work? Why are you forcibly breaking into my city lord&#x27;s mansion?&quot; Lord Chu, you are wise to see the truth. Kenzo Dohra bowed deeply to Chu Yusi in a seemingly respectable manner, then slowly stood up, his gaze coldly fixed on Lin Sha. We heard that Lyn Sha was here, so we rushed over.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d like to ask Lord Chu to compensate my Eastern Kingdom for its losses. And while I&#x27;m at it, I&#x27;ll also kill that scoundrel Lyn Sha. Chapter 143, Demanding Compensation. Greater East Asia co-rossperity sphere. The atmosphere in the hall erupted in uproar.</p>
<p>Even those who were just about to leave all stayed behind. Everyone looked at Lin Shiao and the visiting group from Japan. Chu Yusi snorted coldly. What arrogance. Kenzo Dohara.</p>
<p>You come to my city lord&#x27;s mansion and expect me to kill my own lord and compensate you for the losses. What grounds do you have for demanding that I kill Lyn Shao? And what grounds do you have for demanding compensation from us for any losses? If you can&#x27;t explain it and you come here to cause trouble, you&#x27;ll regret it. Chu Yusis eyes flashed with a sharp light as he stared intently at two Fuan not long after he took office. First, an official made things difficult for Lin Sha and then an envoy from Japan barged into the hall and made unreasonable demands, making this arrogant man from Jang Dongls face. Kenzo Dohura had not expected Chu Yusi to be so furious and he calmed down slightly saying of course we have ample reason.</p>
<p>We have suffered serious losses because of Lin Xiaos actions and we also know that Lin Shiao is colluding with the demons. Both of these reasons point to Lin Shiao the man standing before you. Therefore, we demand that city lord Chu severely punish Lin Shao. H colluding with the demons. Tell me then.</p>
<p>Kenzo Dohara immediately recounted the entire story of Lin Xiao&#x27;s collusion with the demons, but the content was exactly the same as what the many officials had just said. Lyn Shiao picked at his ears out of boredom. Nothing had changed. Not a single word was different. He was so tired of hearing it.</p>
<p>Huh, ridiculous to slander my lord without any substantial evidence. Lyn Shia is the disciple of the lord of my dragon domain. How dare you slander him? Considering you are ambassadors of Japan, I will not pursue this matter this time. However, if it happens again, you will be expelled. Chu Yusi didn&#x27;t waste any words and suppressing his anger, repeated Dugu Nanuangs words.</p>
<p>Kenzo Dohara&#x27;s expression changed slightly. He rolled his eyes, wiped his sweat, and smiled. Ah, I see. It was a misunderstanding. However, our Japan is only acting in good faith, isn&#x27;t it? After all, the blue star convention states that everyone has a responsibility to resist the demon race.</p>
<p>Kenzo Dohura glanced at Lin Shia indifferently. In that case, we only need Lord Chu to compensate us for our losses. As for how to deal with Lin Sha, we will leave it to you, Chu. You see, oh, what&#x27;s the story behind your losses? And why do you want us to compensate you? Lord of the City, I Kinszo Dohara, representing the Shikoku Island Ambassador of the Japanese Empire, hereby formally negotiate with you. Our Shikoku Island recently cooperated with the Western European region, investing a large amount of resources in the Grandmaster of the Knights Templar.</p>
<p>We are willing to sponsor the growth and expansion of the Knights Templar and represent the Blue Star Realm in battles against other nine Heaven Star realms. A portion of the Knights Templars profits will go to our Eastern Kingdom. But unexpectedly, in just a few months, the Knights Templar still haven&#x27;t set off, said to Fu and Sienan, looking utterly heartbroken. Just a few days ago, Lyn Shao brutally murdered an entire Templar knight squad. The Knights Templar have suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve now directly announced to my Eastern Kingdom that they will not return the principle and resources, nor will they share any profits with us. This is a heavy blow to our Japanese empire. By the grace of Amitarasu, the great process of our Japanese nation in creating the greater East Asia co-rossperity sphere has been delayed once again. This responsibility must be borne by the perpetrator Lin Shao and the mismanaged Lan district. Oh, right.</p>
<p>Since Lin Shiao is the disciple of the dragon Sia domain lord, you all have an even greater responsibility to shoulder. Kenzo Dohra added. Lin Shao felt increasingly uneasy. Was this guy trying to get resources for nothing? He glanced at Chu Yusi noticing his ashen face and immediately asked with a cold laugh. What kind of compensation does Japan want? This is all you&#x27;re doing.</p>
<p>Kenzo Dohur said, &quot;Our Japan has always valued morality. You have caused us losses and delayed the progress of the greater East Asia co-rossperity sphere. We should compensate you 10fold. Now that I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re one of Lord Long Lia&#x27;s people, I&#x27;ll just ask for double the compensation. A total of 20 million stone or 20 million timber, 8 million refined iron, 8 million refined copper, 8 million refined copper, and 2 billion gold coins.</p>
<p>Delivery within one week. The crowd in the hall erupted in uproar once again. The officials who had just quieted down began whispering and discussing among themselves again. So much Lynn Shiao has really given us a lot of trouble. The Eastern Japanese Empire is far more powerful than our Long Shia.</p>
<p>If we delay their plans, we will suffer the consequences. I think the domain lord shouldn&#x27;t have taken in Lin Shiao this jinx. What should we do now? The envoy from Japan is quite reasonable. He only asked us to pay double the amount, which isn&#x27;t too bad. Lord City Lord, please agree quickly, lest Japan go back on its word.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Kenzo Deura nodded slightly in satisfaction and added, &quot;Yes, yes, that&#x27;s all the resources.&quot; Hearing the officials and fat man&#x27;s words, Lynn Sha rolled his eyes so hard they almost reached the sky and Chu Yusi couldn&#x27;t help but shout, &quot;Shut up all of you. Kenzo Dohurra, let me ask you this. On what grounds should Lia compensate you for your losses? Kenzo Dohuri looked puzzled and said, &quot;Your Lynn Shiao caused us to lose everything. Shouldn&#x27;t you compensate us?&quot; &quot;Should what makes you think you should? Your investment is your business, and it&#x27;s inherently risky. You&#x27;re responsible for your own gains and losses.</p>
<p>The battlefield of 10,000 races is a battlefield, and fighting and killing are normal. You&#x27;re asking me to compensate you? That&#x27;s untenable, Lord Shu. What you said is incorrect. Seeing Chu Yusi&#x27;s firm attitude, Kenzo Dohara explained, &quot;Our ultimate goal is the rise of greater East Asia so that all of us East Asians can become a powerful force in the blue star realm. Our investment in Japan this time is also for the future of Langia.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t compensation the only right thing to do? Therefore, our Japanese nation has been preparing for this goal for a long time. We not only poured all the resources we had accumulated over 10 years into it, but even our women sold their jewelry and donated money and goods to accumulate enough resources to invest. Kenzo Dohura changed his expression to one of grief, wiped away his tears and said, &quot;In order to raise enough resources, some housewives and young girls even sold their bodies to exchange for that meager amount of money which they then donated entirely. Our Japanese empire has poured its heart and soul into the common prosperity of greater East Asia. We could have led dragon to the top of the world.</p>
<p>But that dream has been ruthlessly shattered. Tell me, don&#x27;t you owe us compensation? The officials looked at each other, shook their heads, and sighed. Alas, since that is the case, Lia has indeed done wrong. An official said, &quot;Long Shia is to blame for delaying the progress of your countries and even our East Asia&#x27;s prosperity.&quot; Lord City Lord, I believe we should pay compensation. I&#x27;ll pay you back my ass.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha cursed, interrupting the official. You guys are living such a hilarious life. How dare you come here demanding compensation. You even have the nerve to mention money earned from selling a woman&#x27;s body. Aren&#x27;t you ashamed? What do you mean by losing 10 years worth of accumulated resources? Even a dog wouldn&#x27;t believe that.</p>
<p>Kenzo Doer roared. Baka, I am the Japanese ambassador. What right do you have to speak to me? Chapter 144. Resource competition bet. Qualifications, Lyn Sha said calmly.</p>
<p>I am the domain lord&#x27;s disciple. After becoming a formal lord, I am equivalent to a regional reserve official. Besides, what qualifications do we need to speak to you? You are nothing more than a villain from a small island in a tiny country here to extort money from us. Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;The identity you gave me, sister domain lord, is coming in handy now. I&#x27;ll use your name as a shield for now.</p>
<p>You do roared in fury. Lord Chu, he&#x27;s right.&quot; Seeing that two Fiuin was about to explode, Chu Yusi waved his hand and said, &quot;Long Shia does indeed have such a regulation and Lin Sha is already a prospective official.&quot; Kenzo Dohur narrowed his eyes and looked at Lyn Sha saying, &quot;In that case, Lyn Shao, what did you mean by what you just said?&quot; Lyn Shao, I said what you just said was all  a string of lies. Baka, when have I, Kenzo Dohra, ever lied? Lynn Sha smiled slightly and said slowly. You said that you accumulated resources over 10 years, invested them all, and ended up losing everything. That&#x27;s completely unfounded.</p>
<p>How dare you call yourselves the Eastern Empire when you&#x27;ve only accumulated this much resource over 10 years. Doa said, &quot;Our people also suffer losses, especially from fighting abroad. I think you&#x27;ve all been hiding somewhere.&quot; Lyn Ziaos words startled Kinszo Dehiraa, who was looking up at the sky with his hands behind his back. &quot;What you little people like to do most is to import large quantities of resources from Lshia at low prices, seal them up, and then sink them to the bottom of the sea. Then they would claim to be poor while extorting money from others.</p>
<p>When everyone is short of resources, you&#x27;ll play the victim while simultaneously bringing out the resources you&#x27;ve hidden and selling them back to Lia at a high price. What? Kenzo Dohura and all the officials in the castle lord&#x27;s mansion were greatly shocked. Is this really true? Shuyusi asked. Absolutely. Lyn Shao replied decisively.</p>
<p>How could he not know what kind of world Little Life was? It was almost identical to his original world. Kenzo Dohurra broke out in a cold sweat, then said firmly, &quot;We&#x27;re preparing for future dangers. Besides, what does our resource storage have to do with your dragon? Then what does your investment failure have to do with our Lia domain?&quot; Lyn Sha asked bluntly. &quot;You, you cunning, sly, and calculating brat.&quot; The officials behind Lyn Sha were somewhat agitated. Some of them saw the fat man get his comeuppance and the arrogant ambassador was experiencing the same feeling they had just gone through which made them feel inexplicably satisfied.</p>
<p>You mean to say someone is glib tonged? Lyn Sha shook his head. Unfortunately, your Japanese are not as good at stealing culture as you are at extortion. Well said. A small group of the lords who had come to report exclaimed in hush tones. Lyn Shiao had truly given them a sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Humph. Seeing that his plan had failed, Kinszo Dohur said directly, &quot;Lord Shu, just tell me if you&#x27;re going to compensate us or not. Our losses are real. We in Japan have a small land area and few resources, but we can collect resources quickly. So, of course, we need to store some resources.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your Lone Sha region is sitting on a vast treasure trove, but unable to extract any resources. Your extraction efficiency is extremely low. Making you lone sha pay compensation is indirectly forcing you to improve your efficiency. Ultimately, it&#x27;s for your own good. Eh, excuses.</p>
<p>All excuses. Who says Lia&#x27;s resource gathering speed is slow? Lyn Sha said, &quot;First, how fast we collect resources is none of your business, Japan. Second, our efficiency in collecting resources is in no way lower than yours.&quot; Let me give you a piece of advice. Stop trying to bully us in Lia. Yes, the newbie lords behind him said in unison.</p>
<p>Chu Yusi also stated directly. No compensation. No compensation. Isn&#x27;t Lord Chu afraid that my four kingdoms district and my neighbor Lan district will become mortal enemies? Isn&#x27;t Lord Chu afraid that my four kingdoms region and Lan region will open the National Fortune Arena and start a regional war? Kenzo Dehura said in a somber tone, &quot;If you don&#x27;t want to compensate, then hand over Lin Shiao. He has disrespected our Eastern Kingdom, and we are going to take him back and punish him properly.&quot; Silence.</p>
<p>Here they come. Lyn Shao is here. Perhaps this is the real purpose of Japan. Some onlookers have seen through Kinso Dohur&#x27;s intentions. Shu Yusi also suddenly became furious, walked straight up to Tu Feuin, and stared at him coldly.</p>
<p>Are you going to start a war with Long Sa? Kenzo Dohura squinted and stared at Chu Yusi with a blank expression. 10 seconds later, he slowly relaxed. Lord Shu, you flatter me. Japan and Lia have been friendly countries throughout history, and Lia has made many contributions to the development and growth of Japan. Lord Shu, please calm down and do not start a war lightly.</p>
<p>Consideration from multiple perspectives before it can be launched. However, I do have an idea. After saying that, Tufi Yuan changed the subject. Since this arrogant brat just said that your dragon summer lord&#x27;s resource gathering speed is no slower than my eastern Japan lords, how about we make a bet? We will then engage in a resource race. We, the Shikoku region of Japan, will not bully you.</p>
<p>We have more veteran powerhouses than you. How about we use this year&#x27;s rookie lords for the competition? Kenzo Dohara was aggressive, scrutinizing Chu Yusi and Lin Shiao from side to side. He could see that Chu Yusi, the new city lord, had a tough attitude, and Lyn Shao was also taking a head-on approach, showing no fear of him whatsoever. If you lose, immediately compensate my Shikoku region with five times the resources, and hand Lynn Shiao over to us to deal with. The officials were shocked.</p>
<p>Lord, you absolutely must not gamble with the Japanese ambassador. We have no way to defeat Japan. Just hand Lyn Sha over. There&#x27;s no need for compensation. Yes, Lyn Sha has caused such a huge disaster.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure the domain lord won&#x27;t punish him. If the city lord is unwilling to hand over Lyn Shiao, then let&#x27;s accept the previous agreement. Double compensation is better than five times the compensation if we lose. Chu Yusi reached out to stop the officials. What if we win? If Long Xiao wins, I certainly won&#x27;t need Lia to compensate me with any resources.</p>
<p>Chu Yusi was about to speak. What kind of good deal is that? Lyn Sha sneered. You lost and there&#x27;s no punishment at all. Kenzo Dyma said, &quot;Then what do you intend to do? Since you&#x27;re going to compete, you must bear the same stakes.&quot; Lyn Shao said, &quot;You also have to compensate our Lnon region with what you call five times the resources.&quot; Huh? You&#x27;ve got guts, Kenzo Dohara. You dare to raise the price now? How about we bet 10 times the resources? 10 times it is.</p>
<p>Shu Yusi agreed before Lin Shiao even thought about it. As the city lord, his words carried weight. Excellent, Lord Shu. What a spirit you have. Kenzo Dohur said, &quot;In that case, we can begin the competition now.&quot; &quot;Wait,&quot; Lyn Sha interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;What? Scared? Regretful? The current stakes are not fair.&quot; Lin Sha said slowly. Even though we both get 10 times the resources, if you win, you&#x27;ll take me with you. If we win, we&#x27;ll only get 10 times the resources. If you really win, you can choose any of my Japanese singers, court jesters, and actresses you want. As many as you desire.</p>
<p>The fat, round, and fleshy man flew up and said, &quot;But did you win? I don&#x27;t want you to call me an actress, actress, or anything like that. It&#x27;s vulgar. If you lose, give this year&#x27;s luck charm of the Shikoku region to my L nonan region. Do you dare to bet? Chapter 145. 10 people gathered.</p>
<p>Duga joins. They actually want to gamble with the luck charm. Kenzo Dohyro&#x27;s heart tightened. Why is the death rate so high in the battlefield of the war of all races? It is cruel and bloody, yet countless people flock to it. Because the battlefield of the myriad races offers many benefits that others in the real world cannot enjoy.</p>
<p>This luck charm is one of them. Every year, the god system distributes a luck talisman to each region. After using the luck talisman, it can increase the lifespan of everyone, improve the physical condition of everyone, increase the resource production of the entire region, and even expand the territory of the region. This can be considered one of the most important items in a region, and most lords can enjoy the rewards of the luck charm. Over time, many powerful lords, having enjoyed various rewards from the battlefield of all races for an extended period, have become superior to ordinary humans.</p>
<p>The battlefield of myriad races, there are many women whose beauty makes it impossible to guess their age, as well as experts who are already several hundred years old. It is precisely because of these endless rewards that the strong get stronger and it becomes extremely difficult to surpass others. Linia&#x27;s request for a luck talisman from the four countries of the eastern Japan region which surprised Kenzo Dohra slightly. Lin Shiao, do you think you&#x27;re worth a luck talisman? If you think I&#x27;m not worth it, then you can skip the competition and just go back to the Shikoku region. This competition was your request, but that&#x27;s because you caused us to lose the Templars&#x27;s investment.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t you annoying? They went back on their word and tore up the contract. Go find the Knights Templar themselves. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s thinking was clear and his logic was sound. He was able to grasp the key points and quickly counter the loopholes in Kenzo Dohara&#x27;s rhetoric. For a moment, even Shu Yusi did not need to speak or argue.</p>
<p>He only needed to quietly watch Lin Shia argue his point. Yes, every wrong has its perpetrator and every debt its debtor. Isn&#x27;t the Western European region where the Knights Templar are located known for its strong sense of contractual obligation? They breached the contract, so make them pay compensation. What are you doing coming to us? If you want to compete and bet with us, then meet our demands. Otherwise, get out.</p>
<p>The lords behind Lin Shiao also realized what was happening. Having witnessed Lin Xiaos repeated confrontations with the Japanese ambassador, they felt more confident and joined in supporting Lin Shiao. Seeing that the situation in the hall was becoming increasingly out of control, Kinszo Dehura sneered and said, &quot;Good, Lyn Shiao. You said it yourself, Lord Shu. If we agree to wager the luck talisman and 10 times the resources, are you willing to take on the resource accumulation competition between the Four Kingdoms region and the Lnon region? Chu Yusi said in a deep voice, &quot;Of course, if your L nonan region loses, you will have to compensate us with 10 times the resources and hand Lynn Sha over to us to dispose of as we see fit.&quot; Do you agree? Approved.</p>
<p>All right, let&#x27;s sign the competition terms under the witness of the main god system. The Four Kingdoms region and the Dragon South region will each send 10 lords who just entered the official server this year to participate in a resource accumulation competition starting today, lasting for one week. The team that collects the most resources within one week wins. Chu Yusi tilted his head slightly and glanced at Lin Shiao only to see that Lyn Xiaos gaze was firm and he looked full of confidence. For no apparent reason, his confidence in this young man he had always admired, as well as in Lin Shiao, whom even Dugun Nanuang valued, grew even stronger.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a deal. Both parties pressed their fingerprints and signed the contract. Kenzo Dohara suddenly burst into loud laughter. Haha. Without lifting a finger, we are about to obtain 10 billion gold coins and countless mineral resources.</p>
<p>What do you mean? An official questioned. Kinszo Deharez said smuggly, &quot;Your Dragon Islands information is way behind the times. We, the Shikoku region of Japan, are your neighbors, yet you know nothing about us. Our Shikoku region in Japan has produced two unparalleled geniuses this year. Sakura Shichiro and Roland.</p>
<p>Both of them possess S-rank talent. We&#x27;ve also specially trained over a dozen resourcerich lords. You&#x27;re doomed to lose this resource accumulation competition. What? Two S-ranked talents. They even specially cultivated resource type lords.</p>
<p>The people in the hall were shocked. Kenzo Dohiro waved his sleeve triumphantly and the group walked away, their wooden clogs clattering. Lord City Lord, what should we do? An official said anxiously. Lord City Lord Lin Sha was too reckless. He agreed to the competition with the Japanese just like that.</p>
<p>Now he has fallen into their trap. My Lonan district is going to suffer a huge loss. Enough with the nonsense. The contract has been signed and the competition will begin immediately. I Chui take full responsibility for my actions.</p>
<p>If I lose, I will naturally go to the domain lord to ask for punishment and bear the consequences. You cower when you see foreigners, but you&#x27;re very proud to bully your own people. All right. If you don&#x27;t have any good suggestions, then shut up. Chu Yusi said, &quot;Now, those who want to join this competition, please step forward.</p>
<p>We need 10 people.&quot; Lynn Shiao was the first to stand up. They&#x27;re targeting me in this competition. I can go alone. What are S-rank talents and resource type lords compared to this? Isn&#x27;t my own eternal peace strong enough? Isn&#x27;t moving an entire mountain range enough? Initially, Lynhia&#x27;s plan was to challenge the Shikoku Islands region of Japan alone and teach them a lesson. Hei, how could I miss such a great opportunity to teach Japan, which has bullied us for so long, a lesson? Dinglay blinked and said, I&#x27;ll join, too.</p>
<p>I almost forgot about the little brother who needs to show off. There are still a few of us. A familiar voice came from inside. It was Chu Funga with red hair. Lin Shao were late, but we still want to join in.</p>
<p>Chufinga came over with Julie, Wong Bo, and Pans Shan Yu. They had already reported for duty and gone back to rest, but they rushed over after hearing about the conflict between Lin Shiao and the Japanese envoy. Okay, Lynsha nodded. All of these people were geniuses, and Pans Shan Yu was a resource type lord, so he could be considered an asset. We need four more people.</p>
<p>Anyone want to join? Those who aren&#x27;t afraid of death or being scolded, come on over. Resource type lords are preferred. Ding Lay and Chuunga began to shout. The competition starts today and the Lon region can no longer wait for the lords who will report later. We can only choose from the existing new lords.</p>
<p>But the good news is that everyone standing in the hall right now is an elite from each newb zone, and there are no weaklings. Haha. How could the resource competition be complete without me? A young lord who had witnessed the trouble caused by the Japanese kingdom in the hall stepped forward. My name is Lu Xiaoying. I am not very talented, but I am the third lord to enter the official area this time.</p>
<p>I also happen to be a resource type lord. I hope you will take good care of me during the competition. Okay, thank you. Lyn Sha nodded. Resource-based lords usually don&#x27;t reveal their strengths.</p>
<p>So, Lu Xiaoings initiative in mentioning his own characteristics shows his upright character. I, Guangjuan, am willing to join the competition. Another person signed up. Shinuandu, count me in. I&#x27;m a combat type lord, but I&#x27;m confident I won&#x27;t hold you back when it comes to resources.</p>
<p>Nine people were gathered at once, but no one in the hall made a sound. First, the competition came suddenly and everyone had their own plans as soon as they entered the official area. Perhaps not wanting to cause any unforeseen complications. In addition to the passionate young people who just signed up, most people are not optimistic about this competition bet and do not want to be blamed after losing. &quot;Is anyone else here?&quot; Chufinga asked anxiously, searching around.</p>
<p>The remaining novice lords either looked away or remained silent, offering no response. Lynn Sha nodded. Nine it is. We can still fight them. Count me in.</p>
<p>A cold, aloof voice rang out, and a stunningly beautiful woman in a blue dress moved gracefully and slowly approached. Chapter 146. The cold and aloof goddess Dugu Jaolon. Dug Jaon, squad leader. Lyn Shiao and Chufunga exclaimed in surprise, overjoyed.</p>
<p>Dugu Jaolon was radiant. Even surrounded by geniuses in the hall, she still stood out from the crowd. Lin Shiao, don&#x27;t forget that I was the first person to enter the official zone. Dugu Jaolon said slowly, her lips slightly parted. I have already defeated you twice.</p>
<p>Great, that&#x27;s fantastic, Chufinga exclaimed, shaking her head. With the class monitor joining us, our chances of winning have increased even further. The two of you working together as a couple will make the work easier. You&#x27;re like husband and wife. I mean classmates with perfect teamwork.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll definitely be able to defeat those despicable lords of the Eastern Kingdom. Chufinga wiped his sweat. Lin Shiao, his best friend, was fine, but he didn&#x27;t want Dugu. Jaolons hand, which was vaguely raised, to turn his hair green again. Chu Yusi raised his hand.</p>
<p>All right, now that we&#x27;ve gathered 10 people, I won&#x27;t waste any more words. The competition will begin in 1 hour. Lords, go back and prepare. Go for it. If you lose, I&#x27;ll take the blame.</p>
<p>If you win, the entire Lon region will thank you. Thank you, Lord. City Lord. With the city lord&#x27;s assurance, everyone felt more at ease. And after a brief greeting, immediately headed to their respective territories.</p>
<p>Chufinga gave Lin Sha a look and was about to wink and say something when she heard Chu Yusi sha from above. Yuanfil son, come here. Lyn Shao shook his head. Everyone in the hall had left. He looked up and saw Dugu Jaolon standing quietly not far away, seemingly waiting for him.</p>
<p>Dugu Jaon Lin Shiao, we finally meet again. Um, I have some questions for you, Domain Lord. Domain Lord Duggan Nonwang is my aunt, one of the direct descendants of the Dugu family, and the current patriarch of the Dugu family. Dugu Jaolan winked at Lyn Shao and said softly, &quot;Keep it a secret for me.&quot; Lyn Sha stood there stunned. He hadn&#x27;t even asked yet, and Dugu had already told him everything.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, okay, I&#x27;ll keep it a secret for you,&quot; Lyn Shao stammered. &quot;Then why?&quot; &quot;Because I told her she needed a cover identity,&quot; Dugu Jalon said. &quot;But when I went to her, she had already decided to help you. How could my classmate Dugu know my dear class monitor Dugu know that I needed an identity cover? Lyn Sha fell into a days again and could only mutter. Okay, thank you class monitor.</p>
<p>But what about you, Dugu? I watched the live stream. Dugu Jalon said calmly. The demons things are so conspicuous and rumors about you and Andrea are spreading everywhere. She hasn&#x27;t come out to say she&#x27;ll take responsibility for it, so I think you&#x27;re going to be in trouble. You also know Ander? I know, succubus princess, a peerless expert of the sixth heaven, but there&#x27;s nothing between you and her.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia choked on his words, wondering why Dugu Xolon had answered him before he could even finish speaking. Wasn&#x27;t she supposed to be a cool and aloof goddess? Why did she answer first? Is the Lord&#x27;s talent in my good class monitor mind readading? Lyn Sha swallowed hard and looked over again. He saw that although Dugu Jaolan was still aloof and elegant, she seemed to be looking at him with a half smile, as if waiting for his next question. Why are you helping me? Especially since I&#x27;m such a suspect. I know you inside and out, and I don&#x27;t want to let a genius like Long Sia go to waste.</p>
<p>Having finally asked the question completely, Lin Sha felt a sense of accomplishment. Dugu Jaolons answer, however, elicited a small internal grumble from him. What does it mean to know someone inside and out? Do you really know them? All right, squad leader Dugu. It&#x27;s been so long since you&#x27;ve seen me. Is there anything you want to ask? Lyn Sha shrugged.</p>
<p>Are you really confident that you can take on 10 lords of Japan all by yourself? Have What&#x27;s the name of your hero in white? Uh, pay. Show me the sword you were wielding when you fought the black flame. Give. Lyn Sha subconsciously took out Chi Xiao and was about to hand it to Dugu Jaolon. In a fraction of a second, Lyn Sha realized something was wrong.</p>
<p>Why would Dugu Jaolon suddenly asked me for a weapon? This is too abrupt, especially one of the 10 most famous swords in China that I possessed. Lyn Shia had already drawn the Crimson Sky sword and was holding it scabbard. He didn&#x27;t know whether to put it back or hand it over. His eyes were filled with shock and disbelief as he looked at the stunning beauty before him. 10 million ideas quickly churned in Liaos mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Dugu Jaon merely glanced at Lyn Xiaos sword sheath and nodded indifferently.&quot; &quot;Lin Xiao, you&#x27;re quite vigilant.&quot; &quot;Dugu Ja on you?&quot; Lyn Xiaos face turned cold, and he was on high alert. With his personal safety and the safety of the entire ancient Hasha race at stake, he had no choice but to assume the worst about the intentions of his old classmate who had just helped him so much. Don&#x27;t be nervous. Dugu Jaolon waved his long sleeves and a long sword appeared at his waist without anyone noticing. A slight smile slowly crept onto her lips as if she was pleased to see Lin Xiao&#x27;s discomfort.</p>
<p>Dugu Jaolans slender fingers traced the ancient sword at her waist as she stared into Lin Xiaos eyes and slowly said, &quot;This sword is named Ta.&quot; Having said that, Dugu Xolon turned and gracefully departed. Go and prepare for the competition, Mr. Torch. Oh my god. Lin Shiao realized that it was actually the Thai sword, which was on par with Chi Sha, and even slightly surpassed it.</p>
<p>This sword was actually in Dugu Jaolan&#x27;s hands. Chi Xiao is the sword of an ancient demon and Tha is also the sword of an ancient demon. So how come it is in Dugu Jaolans hands? Why would Dugu Jaolan tell me about something so dangerous? What was she trying to say? Lyn Xiaos mind was in turmoil. Under Dugu Jaolons sudden attack, he inexplicably took out Chi Xiao. It seemed that Dugu also recognized Chi Xiao, indicating that Dugu Jaolon knew about his connection with the ancient demon.</p>
<p>Then Dugu X Jaolon showed himself the Tha sword. What was she trying to do? Was she going to take him down with her? Or did she intend to? Does she also possess a divine sword from China? Is she also connected to ancient demons? One of our own. I found my people. Lyn Sha was surprised, delighted, and apprehensive. Since Dugu Xolan knows something, does her aunt Duga Nonwang, the lord of the dragon summer domain, also know something? If Dugu Nanuang knows something, does that mean her actions are entirely under the surveillance of the Lung Sha authorities? They were watching my every move.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao dared not be certain, nor dare he deny it. But at least those incompetent officials certainly didn&#x27;t know. Otherwise, they would have already jumped up and sold themselves out. Perhaps only members of the Dugu Jaalon and Dugu Nonwang families know this. Perhaps next time I see Dug Jalon, I should ask him for clarification.</p>
<p>Dugu Jalon, the aloof goddess in front of outsiders. Seems quite mischievous to herself. Ah, Dugaju Xi, my old squad leader. Didn&#x27;t I just call you old squad leader when we met last time? Now I feel like you&#x27;ve been playing me for a while. Having figured this out and knowing that Dugu Xolon had no intention of harming him, Lyn Sha felt relieved.</p>
<p>He quickly opened a portal and returned to his own territory. Soldren, call Sherry over. Uh, no. I need to call all the blood witches over here. I&#x27;m going to teach them a lesson.</p>
<p>Chapter 147 is the lorded devil. After being whipped and scolded, the blood witch Sherry slunk back to her mind with her witch sisters. He muttered to himself as he walked. I thought the lesson master was talking about was that kind of lesson, huh? He whipped me pretty hard. Come on, Sherry.</p>
<p>Master didn&#x27;t use much force. He still needs you to mine. He wouldn&#x27;t dare hurt you. A witch teased. But you with that cry, even your master was too embarrassed to do anything.</p>
<p>Even we blushed when we heard it. Shut up, you little brat. Shirley said, figning anger. That&#x27;s what you call romance. Master must really enjoy the feeling of conquering Sherry.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all because sister Sherry gossiped about our master. Neither our master nor Andrea are people we poor, helpless little bloodthirsty witches can talk about. I think it&#x27;s Shirley who likes being hit, right? If it&#x27;s Lord Shirley&#x27;s turn to draw, she&#x27;d certainly be willing. You little I&#x27;m afraid next time the Lord will send General Chinley on you to beat you up. Haha.</p>
<p>Uggh. What nonsense are you talking about? I&#x27;ll pinch you if you don&#x27;t. Ouch. It itches. I&#x27;ll scratch you, too.</p>
<p>He He The bloodthirsty witches chatted and laughed as they returned to their respective mines. Behind him, a phantom archer wearing overalls hidden in the woods, shook his head, and walked toward another mining spot where the lord had tamed other wild monsters. The phantom archer arrived at the demon lord&#x27;s lair and explained his purpose to the leader of the demon lords. What? Over time, the cyclops also received a notification from another phantom shooter. The monsters throughout Calabash Valley were in an uproar, making a great commotion.</p>
<p>Dozens of phantom archers moved among them, notifying the various monster gathering points. Overtime. Great. I love overtime. Long live the Lord.</p>
<p>I love working overtime, too. My lord, I love you. I love my job. I&#x27;m addicted to my job. The clamor and cheers from the valley could be heard even by Lin Sha who was reviewing the mission log in the warh hall remained wary of the monsters in the valley and she asked what method did you use lord why are the monsters in the valley so happy men also looking rather idle crossed his arms and said I have traveled the world for many years and have never seen anyone say that they like working overtime let alone monsters what ability did you use to convince them lord Lyn Sha kept his eyes fixed on the latest sand table and didn&#x27;t even look up.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s simple. It&#x27;s about money. What? It&#x27;s about giving them enough rewards. Lynsha said, &quot;These monsters occupy the minds just to mine them and then use the mind resources to exchange for food from the god system. They work so hard just to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>The god system doesn&#x27;t bargain with wild monsters. No matter what kind of mineral vein it is, it&#x27;s just the most basic guarantee of food to exchange for an equal number of wild monsters. So, these monsters are like the poorest working class in the god system. Get up earlier than the chickens, sleep later than the dogs, work harder than the oxen, and worry every day about being wiped out and turned into experience packs by the nearby lords with their troops. Payman wiped his eyes so pitiful.</p>
<p>I really felt sorry for him. Lynn Shiao raised his foot and kicked Pay Min away. You, a sly old fox who always tries to muddle through, can actually empathize. Even Hoy Subing, the passionate young man who always had a stern expression, laughed in the warh hall. The atmosphere was relaxed when he was with Lyn Sha without the worry of being in a dangerous situation, which made him feel sincere respect and love for Lyn Sha.</p>
<p>So, the Lord gave these monsters food. Chin Lean Yu was still wearing her silver soft armor, her ponytail tied high, and with her bright red cloak, tall figure, and three-dimensional and beautiful features, she was truly heroic and incomparably beautiful. That&#x27;s right. Since the god system is so stingy, I, the new boss, will be more generous. I had the Phantom Archer deliver a message.</p>
<p>For the next week, well have them work overtime 24/7. and on my side. Lynn Shia smiled faintly. We&#x27;ll provide them with extra spirit rice porridge and spirit fish soup. Golden legendary spirit rice.</p>
<p>The golden legendary spirit fish. The crowd gasped in disbelief. All the wild monsters in the valley were so happy as if they had gone mad. Golden legendary quality spirit rice and golden legendary quality spirit fish can randomly increase one of the following attributes by two points. strength, spirit, constitution, or soul.</p>
<p>It can improve the user&#x27;s skill level up to a maximum of B-grade. Most importantly, it has a chance to extend the user&#x27;s lifespan and maintain a youthful appearance. The legendary golden rice and fish that are impossible to obtain outside are now readily available to all heroes and troops under Lyn Xiao&#x27;s command, and there&#x27;s an increasing supply of them. My golden legend farmers now number over 200. Every day, the Golden Legend farmhouse continues to produce golden legend farmers.</p>
<p>And each Golden Legend farmer comes with its own golden legend spirit field of the spirit field is five times the normal amount. We can&#x27;t possibly eat it all. The monsters in the valley crazy. Your lordship has made a truly wise decision, the heroes exclaimed in unison. This is just an appetizer, Lynsha said calmly.</p>
<p>Now that the monsters in the valley are no longer fighting each other, they can save their combat and guard forces for labor, which increases the labor force. At the same time, we can divide the monsters in each vein of the valley into three shifts with the three shifts taking turns to work and rest, which can also improve efficiency. I had the phantom archers take the golden legendary farmers and set up several points in the valley. They provided four meals a day, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a midnight snack, directly distributing spirit rice porridge. This way, the monsters didn&#x27;t have to cook for themselves, saving them time and allowing them to mine more resources.</p>
<p>Finally, these monsters can also allow female monsters and young monsters to join in mining. With these incentives, the monsters should be able to unleash several times their productivity. It&#x27;s barely good enough. Lynn Sha stroked his chin and slowly said, &quot;This lord isn&#x27;t some kind of devil. While there are no labor laws or laws protecting miners yet, those wicked capitalists can flee us as much as possible.&quot; &quot;Huh? Why are you all looking at me like that?&quot; Lyn Sha suddenly noticed that the way his heroes and squad leaders were looking at him had changed.</p>
<p>&quot;My lord, are you really having an affair with Andrea?&quot; Payman asked, stunned. &quot;What nonsense are you talking about? Don&#x27;t you know what kind of person I Lin Shia am? Then why are the Lord&#x27;s methods so ruthless? More ruthless than the devil himself. He doesn&#x27;t treat monsters like monsters at all. He&#x27;s trying to squeeze them dry. Lyn Sha chuckled and shook his head.</p>
<p>In my previous life, even worse than this. Many people want good fortune, but can&#x27;t even get it. You&#x27;re all so scared because I only used some petty tricks from those ruthless bosses in my past life. These monsters are so physically strong. It&#x27;s a real shame they don&#x27;t work overtime and become corporate slaves.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha simply offered a brief explanation which caused the heroes and generals in the war hall to break out in a cold sweat once again. All right, let&#x27;s take a look at the terrain. As for the resource competition, let the wild monsters handle it. I have a backup plan. Our goal is to eliminate the undead forbidden zone heroes in the official zone and obtain the undead orb.</p>
<p>Chapter 148. the forbidden zone of the dead far ahead. While the competition for resources is one thing, the development, expansion, and upgrading of one&#x27;s own territory must continue. For Lin Sha, the resource competition and betting was just a side activity. He always felt a sense of urgency to upgrade and become stronger immediately.</p>
<p>No one knows how long they can keep their Chinese identity hidden. Once exposed, they will be in grave danger. When he was first reborn, his ideal of becoming a powerful lord was now replaced by a sense of urgency about life and death. There are now 56 Phantom archers. Soldering is leading them to patrol the valley and maintain order for the weak.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Soldering replied. Everyone else, follow me. We&#x27;re going here. Lynsha pointed his finger at the Warand table.</p>
<p>It was a place shrouded in black mist, hidden among towering mountains. The land was rotten and the ground emitted a foul stench. Even the trees and vegetation there were withered and decaying. That place is a forbidden zone for the dead. In the beginner zone, apart from the book of the dead and a few necromancy skills, novice lords will basically cannot encounter the undead race.</p>
<p>This is because the undead race has all come to the official zone and they have banded together to form a unique undead forbidden zone. The forbidden lands of the dead are scattered throughout the various regions of the official district, varying in size. Some are almost comparable to a large citystate, while others are no smaller than the territory of a powerful lord in the official district. It can be said that every forbidden zone of the undead is one of the toughest nuts to crack in the official zone. There are all sorts of undead units and monsters there, including skeletons, zombies, vampires, ghosts, liches, horror knights, and stitch butchers.</p>
<p>The larger undead forbidden zones even have legendary golden monsters like the rotten spider mother and the undead reaper, and even frost dragons of unknown quality. Each undead forbidden zone is guarded by an undead hero. So, why would the lords of the official districts attack the undead forbidden zone? First, the experience points are very high. Second, there are generous material rewards. However, many people&#x27;s main goal is still the undead orb.</p>
<p>With this item, you no longer need to manually upgrade your heroes and units all the time. Instead, they will upgrade automatically, making it a true hands-free wonder. This is why Lynn Shia set his sights on the Undead Forbidden Zone the moment he arrived in the official area. The Undead Forbidden Zone has a random element. it won&#x27;t stay in one place.</p>
<p>They will appear from different places from time to time and after a period of time they may suddenly disappear. This results in the existence of some undead forbidden zones regardless of the size of the official zone. Lyn Shao entered the main area and used the celestial perspective where he happened to see a medium-sized undead forbidden zone. Based on the size and the buildings within the restricted area, there shouldn&#x27;t be a frost dragon. At most, there could be a stitching butcher or a dread knight.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao said to his generals, &quot;The stitcher butcher is also of epic quality, and the dread knight is of legendary quality. There are probably quite a few of them. So this time, everyone except soldering will set off together.&quot; &quot;Yay men, if an undead hero appears, you will handle it as usual.&quot; Pay Min made an exaggerated received gesture. &quot;My twin swords are itching for a fight.&quot; Lynn Shia rolled his eyes. That&#x27;s because your impulsive personality makes you unsuitable for leading troops.</p>
<p>All right, enough chitchat. Let&#x27;s get the undead orb and upgrade to Town Hall 4 as soon as possible. Let&#x27;s get started. Inside a wooden lord&#x27;s mansion that resembles an ancient Chinese palace, yet bears numerous traces of imitation. Hiroshi Doy sat on the ground looking at the two young men in front of him.</p>
<p>Sakura Shichiro Roland, I made this bet hastily this time. Do you two young talents have the confidence to beat Lan District? Don&#x27;t worry, senior. Well make sure that Lan region loses convincingly and hands over 10 times the resources and Lin Sha obediently. Ingielong replied immediately. Roland added, &quot;Rest assured, my lord, we are both S-rank talents and each of us has four resource type lords under our command.</p>
<p>With this configuration, we might not lose even if we were to compete with geniuses from Western Europe or the Americas. The contract established by the God system cannot be revoked, even if they want to. The moment the resource competition ends, the resources of the Lan region will be transferred to our four kingdoms region. A single bet can bring me nearly half a year&#x27;s worth of resource benefits across Japan. Even if Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and General Isuroku Yamamoto knew about it, they would only praise me.</p>
<p>Your senior is wise. However, Kenzo Dohurra slowly put down his teacup and pondered that Lynn Shiao confronted me to my face and even rallied other novice lords to oppose the Eastern Empire. I think Lyn Sha is also involved in Lord Chu Yusi&#x27;s tough stance. Therefore, we can&#x27;t let that kid Lyn Sha lose so easily. Sakura Shiro asked in confusion.</p>
<p>Senior, didn&#x27;t the bet stipulate that if we won, we would hand Lin Sha over to us? That was just a delaying tactic. Do you think my great Eastern Empire needs a Lin Sha? It was just that Pu Dawei from the heavenly realm asked me to do this. Pu Dawei only wanted Lin Sha dead, but in front of Chu Yusi, I changed my mind and said that I would take Lin Sha away to deal with him. Kenzo Dohur said, &quot;If Lin Shiao dies during the competition, the bet is unfair and we can demand. We demand that the Lnon district also pay with a luck charm.&quot; Senior, what skillful methods, sir? What skillful methods? Kenzo Dohara stroked his mustache with satisfaction, then said, &quot;Go and prepare.</p>
<p>You two focus on accumulating resources. I will send a ninja lord to deal with Lin Shia.&quot; &quot;Yes, senior.&quot; A dozen minutes later, the resource competition began on time. The main god system made an announcement in the Lnon region and the neighboring four kingdoms region and then displayed the panels of both sides of the competition prominently in the announcement area. Throughout the competition, the participating players from both sides and the amount of resources they have accumulated are all displayed on the resource panel and updated in real time. After the competition ends, the winner will be announced and the prize will be awarded.</p>
<p>Look, the Lon region and the Shikoku region of Japan are fighting. The two official regions have more than tens of millions of people, and some sharpeyed people have already seen the announcement. Only been the district head of Lan district and the city lord of Lan City for a few days, and he&#x27;s already made headlines. Haha, as expected of the madman of Jong Dong. I like him.</p>
<p>Come on. Japan is a developed country and the Shikoku Islands region has many experts. Our Lon region&#x27;s veteran experts are simply outnumbered by them. How can we fight? Wrong. Someone said wrong.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t a competition among veteran masters, but rather a competition among young lords who have just entered the official zone. A competition of young talents. Everyone&#x27;s interest was peaked. Who can represent our Lnon region? The panel shows the names of the contestants from two different zones. Go check it out yourself.</p>
<p>Holy crap, it&#x27;s Lin Sha. Lyn Shia is in first place and he&#x27;s far ahead of everyone else. Chapter 149 senior. We can win. The match between the two sides had only been going on for an hour.</p>
<p>In the announcement area of the main god system, the resource collection information of both sides participating in the competition is displayed at a glance. Resource collection data for the Shikoku region. Sakura Shichiro 120,000, Roland 110,000, Banjong 3,500, Xiaoyu and Isu 0.32 million. Togo Nichi total in the Shikoku region 252,000. from the four kingdoms region accumulated a total of 110,000 and 120,000 resources respectively in just one hour which is quite fast.</p>
<p>Why are only two people from Japan accumulating such terrifying speeds while the rest are so slow? Yes, give me an hour and I could probably get more than 5,000 resources in total. Some people have raised questions. The total resources include all mineral resources, whether it is iron or copper or stone, wood or any buildings that produce resources such as your own farmland and fish pond. As long as new resources appear, they are included in the total resources. Ah, this is all thanks to the vassel lord.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoiing, one of the contestants from the Lan region who spoke. He explained the accumulated resources of vassal lords can be counted under the name of the lord. So someone replied the reason why the top two lords in Japan have such terrifying statistics is because the other lords are all their vassal lords. Lu jaoing slowly said that&#x27;s right. Moreover, the other eight lords from Japan who participated in the competition were all resource-based lords.</p>
<p>What eight resource-based lords become vassel lords? If they were just ordinary lords, Sakura, Shichiro, and Roland couldn&#x27;t have accumulated resources so quickly. You see, the other lords only have a resource gathering speed of around 0.3. That&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve reserved the most basic necessities for their territories farmers. All the other resource gathering data is credited to the top two lords. Everyone was surprised and asked, &quot;So, Lyn Sha has nine resource type lords as Vasselords? What are you saying? Lynn Shiao didn&#x27;t have any vassel lords in this competition, but why are his stats so unbeatable? Everyone quickly looked at the LG Nan ranking list, which they had previously dared not look at.</p>
<p>Resource collection data for Lan District. Lin Shiao 260,000. Dugu Jaolon 49,000. Lu Xiaoing 32,000. Pan Shan Yu 31,000.</p>
<p>Dingle 25,000. Chufinga 23,000, Julie 22,000, Chunuandu 21,000, Guanghuan 15,000, Wongbo 0.9 million. Summary of Lan region, 487,000. Lan region is far ahead of the other four regions. My god, what am I seeing? The Lan region is even stronger than the Shikoku region of Japan.</p>
<p>Are we going to win? Don&#x27;t get too excited. Someone poured cold water on the idea. Resource-based lords are all longasting and have great potential. The longer they are around, the more their strengths will be revealed. Perhaps they can catch up in speed later on.</p>
<p>What are they catching up to? Someone exclaimed. Is Lyn Shia a resource type lord? How come Lyn Sha alone has more people than all of Japan combined? Lyn Sha alone has 260,000 while the 10 lords of the four kingdoms combined only have 252,000. Damn, I didn&#x27;t believe Lyn Sha could easily defeat and completely crush Black Flame in the newbie zone, but now I do. The domain lord is truly amazing to have taken in such a super genius as Lin Sha. Amidst the shock of everyone in the Runan region, Kenzo Dohara of the Shikoku region was also furious.</p>
<p>You too. Why is that kid Lynn Sha so powerful? Why is it that his resource collection data alone is more than all of yours combined? Sakura Shichiro and Roland knelt on the ground and were immediately berated by Kenzo Dehiraa senior. I think Lynn Shiao may have used some kind of secret method that overdraws life force, forcing farmers to collect resources beyond their capacity. Sakura Shiro said cautiously. Maybe we should wait and see.</p>
<p>Maybe the data will reverse later. Let&#x27;s wait and see. 1 hour later. Lin Xiao&#x27;s resource collection data 520,000. The entire Shikoku region 505,000.</p>
<p>Senior, let&#x27;s wait and see. Perhaps Lyn Xiao&#x27;s dosage is too high. We can wait a little longer. His farmers certainly won&#x27;t be able to hold on. Another hour later, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s resource collection data 780,000.</p>
<p>The entire Shikoku region, 748,000. Senior, it&#x27;s almost lunchtime. Lynn Sha will slow down. Senior, it&#x27;s getting dark soon, and those who gather resources need to rest. Senior, please allow Prince Roland, the cow herd, to serve you in bed.</p>
<p>Senior, don&#x27;t worry. We&#x27;ve already had some resourcerich lords work overtime to gather resources at night. Just wait for good news first thing tomorrow morning. Senior, please enjoy your night. Senior, I guarantee that we will crush Lin Shia and Lon district tomorrow.</p>
<p>Good morning, senior. You idiot. Don&#x27;t you dare call me senior. Baka, look at the mess you&#x27;ve made. See if you&#x27;ve kept your promises.</p>
<p>Sakura Shichiro opened the god competition panel with a look of astonishment. Resource collection data for the Shikoku region. Sakura Shichiro 880,000. Roland 850,000 total in the Shikoku region 1.79 million resource collection data for L nan district Lin Shao 3.12 million total for L nan district 3.84 84 million. This senior baka, I told you not to call me senior.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have such disgraceful juniors like you. Kenzo Dehura slapped Sakura Shichiro across the face, knocking him to the ground, and then kicked Roland, who had just gotten out of bed, showing no mercy whatsoever. He was so angry he was about to explode. All the resource lords under his command arranged for half of their farmers to work overtime at night to mine resources. As a result, when they woke up, Lyn Sha had almost doubled their resources.</p>
<p>Baka Lyn Sha, that bastard. Doesn&#x27;t he need to sleep? Don&#x27;t his farmers get tired? Don&#x27;t they need to sleep? Damn it. Lyn Sha must die, otherwise we might really lose. Kenzo Dohara opened the communication panel and called the ninja lord. Mamataro, how&#x27;s the progress? Reporting to our lord.</p>
<p>We have infiltrated Lan District, but still have not found Lin Xiao&#x27;s location. Huh? Even using ninja dogs won&#x27;t work. No, Lin Shiao has no residual aura. Even using secret methods to rewind doesn&#x27;t work. No.</p>
<p>Tao San Lang used a secret technique to rewind and saw Lin Sha step into a portal, but there was nothing on the other side of the portal, so we couldn&#x27;t see anything. Mama Sabiro wanted to activate the secret technique to get a closer look, but suddenly a terrifying face appeared in the teleportation portal. Mamataro reported in a terrified tone. Then Mama Saburro fainted and hasn&#x27;t woken up yet. What kind of face? It was a huge face resembling both a fox and a human, but with shorter cheeks covered in sharp fangs and with eyes that were entirely white, staring straight at people.</p>
<p>Kenzo Dohurra shivered. My lord, your subordinate is incompetent and cannot find Lin Xiao&#x27;s location. Please punish me. All of you who are useless, may you all commit sepuku. Kenzo Dohurra waved his hand and shut down the communication device under Mamaros incredulous gaze.</p>
<p>I must find a powerful Jonan to deal with Lin Sha. Kenzo Dohura muttered to himself. However, among the 10 lords in the Lnon region, Dugu Jaolon, Shufinga, Dinglay, and those two resource type lords are also quite capable. Even if we deal with Lin Shiao, we won&#x27;t leave them too far behind. It seems that we have no other choice but to use that method.</p>
<p>Kenzo Dohara&#x27;s two eyes, like marbles embedded in his fat, looked at the motionless Sakura, Shichiro, and Roland, his gaze sweeping back and forth between them. Chapter 150. Bowing. I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m so sorry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lyn Sha, along with all the heroes and troops, had used precise coordinates to open several portals and arrived at a distance not far from the forbidden zone of the dead. Having a god&#x27;s perspective is great. Murder, robbery, and escape are all essential. Lynn Shia made a self-deprecating remark and looked at the stunningly beautiful enchantress following behind him. Ba, your first battle is going to be a major one.</p>
<p>Are you afraid? Wearing a scarlet cloak that covered her entire body, revealing only her stunningly beautiful face, Baoi smiled gently upon hearing this. Lyn Xiaos first impression of Baoi was that she was gentle and weak, but at this moment, she seemed completely unaffected. Her face was fair, her nose was small and delicate, and her large eyes always seemed to be filled with mist, arousing a strong desire to protect her. Even outside the forbidden zone of the dead, where a chilling aura that would terrify ordinary people, was just a 100 meters away, Ba still exuded an amazing charm at all times. This humble servant thanks your excellency for your concern.</p>
<p>However, my lord, you should not underestimate me. I understand how capable you are. I&#x27;ve never underestimated you. Lyn Sha lowered his voice, causing Bao&#x27;s cheeks to flush red. Paymen&#x27;s ears perked up again.</p>
<p>His gaze swept suspiciously towards Lyn Sha, then glanced at Baoi, whose pretty face was flushed. He was about to speak. Pay attention. Keep quiet. Do not move around.</p>
<p>Do not whisper. Chin Leongu s voice came over. As the commander-in-chief of this operation, I must repeatedly emphasize military discipline, and those who violate it will be punished according to military law.&quot; After saying that, she looked at Lyn Sha meaningfully and said indifferently, &quot;Lord, you are the same.&quot; Lyn Sha shrugged with a rise smile, looking like he had been caught red-handed making a mistake. Chin Leonu turned her head, her red cloak, silver soft armor, high ponytail, and incomparably beautiful features, making her a stunning beauty of a different type. Almost on par with Baoi, heroic and radiant.</p>
<p>As a general specializing in mountain warfare, Chin Leang Yu was mostly straightforward and unpretentious, leading her troops like brothers and even daring to give orders to Lord Lyn Sha. No one noticed that as Chin Leang Yu turned her head, a breathtaking smile appeared on her lips. Only Pay Min quietly gave a thumbs up to Hoitsubing, the young general in golden armor, who was completely unaware of what was happening. &quot;All right, we&#x27;ve arrived at our destination,&quot; Chin Lean Yu ordered. &quot;My lord, please activate the celestial perspective to confirm the enemy once again.&quot; Lyn Sha nodded and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>His perspective flew out from his body, soaring higher and higher. He manipulated his viewpoint, carefully surveying every soldier and every building in the forbidden zone of the undead before him. The memory palace was activated and Lyn Sha began to memorize. A few minutes later, Lyn Sha opened his eyes. 100 paces to the west of the valley ahead, there are 12 cave demons hiding.</p>
<p>200 paces ahead, there are 130 putrid zombies. The third grove of decaying trees is teeming with ghosts. At the center of the restricted area, to the east are 20 stitched butchers, and to the west are 31 dread knights. The strongest undead hero discovered so far as the crypt lord, who is surrounded by many putrid beetles. Lyn Sha spoke rapidly, reciting all the troop distributions he had memorized.</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes, he found all the generals staring at him in shock. A moment of silence. Why are you all looking at me like that? Lyn Shao asked curiously. With our lord here, General Lee Guuang will never get lost. Huing remarked.</p>
<p>With the Lord here, Chin Leang Yu and the White Spear soldiers can move swiftly through the mountains. Chin Leang Yu said longingly. With the Lord present, an assassin sneak attack is virtually impossible, Pay Min said before Lin Shia interrupted him. All right. All right.</p>
<p>You can flatter me later. I&#x27;ll listen to your praises comfortably when we get back to our territory. Lynn Shiao said solemnly. Now, obey Chin Leong Yus orders and finish the battle at hand. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>The heroes replied in unison. Lyn Sha nodded silently, but inwardly he was quite pleased with himself. Look at the kind of people praising themselves. Hitsubing, who sealed the wolf&#x27;s lair, Chin Leang Yu, the loyal marquee of the Ming dynasty, and Pay Min, the sword saint of the Tang Dynasty. These are all prominent figures in Chinese history, and they all greatly admire the skills they have painstakingly honed.</p>
<p>Young Master Pay Min, prepare for battle. Chin Leong Yu has begun issuing orders. General Hua, please take command of the central army and lead the Guan Ning cavalry. Miss Baoi, please use concealment. White pole soldiers lead the way.</p>
<p>Emo Dao soldiers bring up the rear. Guan Ning cavalry dismount. Their horses gagged. Divine arm archers take down their bows and crossbows and prepare to fire. From this moment until the crypt lord is killed, no one shall make a sound.</p>
<p>Everyone nodded emphatically and quickly formed a line. The small team of several hundred people plunged silently into the dark, forbidden land of the undead. What? You want us to kill our own kind and steal their resources? Sakura Shiro was greatly surprised. Damn it. How dare you shout like that? What are you doing here? Kenzo Dohura slapped Sakura Shichiro across the face again.</p>
<p>If you two weren&#x27;t so useless, I wouldn&#x27;t have resorted to this drastic measure. If you lose this bet and lose all these resources and luck charms, neither of you will survive. Koko, how are we going to tell our people? Baka, what else do you want to say? Do you apologize to them before you kill them? They are all young lords under my command. Do you think I don&#x27;t feel sorry for them? Kenzo Dohara&#x27;s eyes widened like glass beads, and the fat on his face twitched. Get it done right away.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Sakura, Shichiro, and Roland dared not disobey and could only bow and nod. A portal appeared out of thin air in a youth territory in the Shikoku region. The teleportation portal was extremely precise, landing precisely in the guest area of the Lord&#x27;s manor without triggering any alerts or backlash. A lord of medium build with a slender and delicate body as graceful as a woman stepped out.</p>
<p>He held a long samurai sword and wore a kimono which made him look like a handsome god. The young lord was surprised to see a guest but when he turned around he was overjoyed. Sakura Shikarukuan, you&#x27;ve come to visit me. The young lord happily went to greet him. The arrival of the renowned number one genius of the four kingdoms is truly a cause for great joy.</p>
<p>Uh what are you doing? Sakura Shichiro coldly pulled the samurai sword from the young lord&#x27;s body, letting the blood splatter, and the young lord slowly fell to the ground in disbelief. I&#x27;m sorry. I need all your resources. There&#x27;s a bug in the resource gathering competition. Even resources obtained by killing other players are counted as gathered resources.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t find Lyn Shia. Killing one or two lords in the Lnon region will likely attract attention and delay our progress. So, Sakura Shichiro coldly waited for his heroes and troops to wipe out all the young lords resistance forces and then break into the warehouse. The moment the main god system notification sounded, Sakura Shichiro happily narrowed his eyes. Then, he took a step back, his expression turning solemn, bowed towards the young lord&#x27;s corpse.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;ve caused you trouble. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s come to this now. Chapter 151. Brother Shiao, I really followed the right person.</p>
<p>Just as Lin Sha led most of his troops and heroes through the forbidden zone of the undead, a lord from the Lan region noticed changes in the data on the competition bulletin board. Look, look, the top two players in the Shikoku region are accumulating resources at an alarming rate. Sakura Shichiro now has 1.08 million followers, 1.29 million, 1.52 million. My god, how did his numbers rise by tens or hundreds of thousands in just a few minutes? And Roland 2. Roland&#x27;s already worth 1.49 million.</p>
<p>No, 1.75 million. Sakura Shichiro has already reached 1.93 million. What did resources fall from the sky? Even if resources fell from the sky, they wouldn&#x27;t arrive this quickly. Amidst the gasps of the crowd, the data of the two prodigies from the fornation region visibly and rapidly increased with each jump amounting to tens or hundreds of thousands. In less than half a day, Sakura Shichiro and Roland had collected a total of 6.01 million resource data.</p>
<p>Total data collected for the entire Lan district is only 5.98 million. Everyone panicked. Young lords of Lonan district, what&#x27;s wrong with you? How did the lords of the four kingdoms district overtake you? Hurry up and catch up. The Shikoku region is moving too fast. Who&#x27;s the boss here? Come out and solve this problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ding Lay, Shuunga, and others who participated in the resource competition also discovered the anomaly in the Four Kingdoms region. Dinglay tried to contact Lin Shiao, but received no response. Brother Shiao said he was going to take care of something important and might shut down communications. How come the people from the four kingdoms region overtook us at this crucial moment? This is simply not scientific. I&#x27;ve checked the books and brother Xiao speed has already broken the historical best record, even far surpassing the old record.</p>
<p>How could someone be faster than Brother Xiao and be able to surpass him? Ding Lays gaze shifted to the competition panel where he saw the following text. Resource collection data for Lnon district. Lin Shiao 3.51 million. Dugu X Jaolon 960,000. Lu Xiaoing 540,000.</p>
<p>Pan Shan Yu 510,000. Dingle 290,000. Chufinga 280,000. Lan District total 6.29 million. Lynn Shiao remains far ahead of all other contestants, single-handedly carrying the banner of the Lung Nan region, but he&#x27;s now out of contact.</p>
<p>Dinglay was a little anxious. Just now, the total number of resources collected in the Lan region has reached 6.29 million, but the data for the Sigua region is even more alarming, now reaching 6.48 million. Resource collection data for the Shikoku region. Sakura Shichiro 3.2 million. Roland 3.18 million.</p>
<p>Banan Jhong Ron 32,000 Xiaoyu and Ishu 28,000. Total for the Shikoku region 6.488 million. Panic spread through the chat channels of the LN region. Many lords have already begun to complain that Chu Yusi should not have accepted this competition bet. Losing it will only make things worse for Lia.</p>
<p>Losing Lynn Shiao is not a big deal, but the T-fold resource compensation will indeed  the entire Lan region for a long time. All four regions in Japan are strong regions, and Dragon Summer has always been a region where you lose more than you win. What should we do? You guys need to think of something quickly. A lord kept shouting in the regional chat. Lin Shia and Dugu Jaolan have such good grades.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoing Pans Shan Yu, you two are resource-based lords. Speed up your resource gathering. Lu Xiaoying, I&#x27;ve pushed my talent to its limit. All my heroes have gone mining. Pan Shan Yu, I&#x27;m farming myself now, tending 10 plots of land by myself.</p>
<p>Damn, how come you guys are so far behind those two from Japan? Who knows how to reply to that? I dug my own foot with my pickaxe. everyone. Just as the atmosphere grew increasingly tense and panicked, Ding Lay remembered what Lin Sha had told him before he left. &quot;If any unexpected situation arises, your role is to keep things under control.&quot; Lyn Shao said, &quot;We cannot allow panic to spread. Having a pillar of stability is more important than anything else, and it will also benefit your lordly talent.&quot; You can say it like this.</p>
<p>Dingle composed himself, looked at the chaotic chat channel, and thought to himself, &quot;It&#x27;s time for me to make my appearance.&quot; &quot;Everyone, when facing important matters, one should remain calm. I do not believe that there are no wise men in this era. Calm down, everyone.&quot; Getting anxious and jumping up and down won&#x27;t solve anything. Ding Lays literary and strangely neat words immediately cooled down the irritating chat channel. Everyone unconsciously slowed down their speech and reduced unnecessary complaints.</p>
<p>Feeling the feedback from his talent, Dinglay nodded in satisfaction and said, &quot;Everyone, don&#x27;t panic. It&#x27;s only the second day. We haven&#x27;t lost yet. We should still have a solution. Let the competitors tell us their difficulties, and we&#x27;ll work together to find a solution.&quot; The words felt, &quot;In the face of great events, one must remain calm.&quot; As the saying goes, there are wise men in this day and age.</p>
<p>We should think of solutions instead of complaining and blaming each other. Guanghuan, one of the 10 members of the team, jumped out and said, &quot;I have extra minds, but not enough farmers. I&#x27;m looking to buy 20 ler talismans with a requirement of rare quality or higher.&quot; Another member, Chinuandu, said, &quot;I have 10 outstanding leader talismans to lend you first. You can pay them back later.&quot; Chufinga also stepped forward. Let&#x27;s exchange ideas and see where there&#x27;s room for improvement.</p>
<p>Julie, I only need a few more resources to upgrade the mine. After upgrading, the mining speed will increase by two times. Chufinga, I&#x27;ll provide the resources. Wongbo, I&#x27;ve always been too embarrassed to say it, but I&#x27;m good at fighting, and there are only about 30 farmers here, and we haven&#x27;t been mining much. Chufinga, I&#x27;ll send troops to help you clear the land.</p>
<p>Go buy some farmers right now. Lu Yaoing, can anyone lend me a hand? I&#x27;ve discovered a resourcerich area with abundant mineral veins, but the monsters guarding it are incredibly strong. Dingle/chufinga. Let&#x27;s go together and take down the monsters. Lu Xiaoing.</p>
<p>Then how will the resources be distributed? Dinglay/chufinga, you are a resource type lord, so we&#x27;ll give you everything first. We&#x27;ll discuss the division and make up for what should belong to us after the competition. Very good, Panu. Why is nobody paying attention to me? I need a 100 plots of farmland. Everyone, we&#x27;ll give it to you.</p>
<p>In this way, through everyone&#x27;s back and forth conversation, the L non regional competition team became as united as a rope, working together to win the competition. Look, the Lon region is making a strong push, someone exclaimed in surprise. The resource gathering data of the eight lords who were originally ranked third to 10th is rapidly increasing. 500,000, 600,000, 700,000. Even Wong Bo, who had the lowest salary, immediately saw his salary increase from over 100,000 to over 300,000.</p>
<p>The combined improvement of all eight lords has a significant impact on the data. As the sun set on the second day, Lan region once again overtook Sigua region. Resource collection data for LN district, total 8.59 million. Resource collection data for the Shikoku region. Total 8.52 million.</p>
<p>Dinglay looked at the competition panel and nodded in satisfaction once again. It feels great to overtake someone. Especially when you&#x27;ve done it through your own hard work. The turnaround began simply because of a sentence Lynn Sha left him when he left. In the face of great events, one must remain calm.</p>
<p>I do not believe that there are no wise men like those of the past in this era. Brother Shiao, I really made the right choice in following you. Chapter 152. Extreme Pulling. Lin Sha, where are you? However, Dinglays happiness did not last long.</p>
<p>Because at night, except for resource-based lords, the peasants of ordinary lords are usually very tired and need to rest. Even if they are forced to work, they may eventually die suddenly or get injured, which could affect their subsequent work. Therefore, at night, only Lu Xiaoing and Pans Shan Yu were able to maintain half speed for resource gathering, while the other lords were considered to be doing well if they could reach 1/5 of the speed. Meanwhile, in the Shikoku region, Sakura, Shikaru, and Roland even accelerated their resource gathering speed. Baka Baka.</p>
<p>In a small wooden mansion in the Shikoku district, the beautiful but melancholic Sakura, Shichiro viciously hacked at the corpse of the lord in front of her. He&#x27;s still alive, and he even got up to ambush me. If I weren&#x27;t an S-class genius, you guys would have almost succeeded. I&#x27;ve already apologized. What more do you want? Sakura Shichiro, still seething with anger and panting, stared at the corpse that was practically rotting flesh and said, still not satisfied, &quot;You incompetent lords of the great eastern Empire should just bow down and let me kill you.</p>
<p>Do you know how hard I worked to win this competition, to leave the Shikoku region, and to become a superstar in the entire great Japanese empire?&quot; Sakura Shichurro touched his bottom, his voice already trembling with tears. You&#x27;ve only lost your lives, but I&#x27;ve lost my real money. After saying that, Sakura Shichiro wiped away his tears and muttered to himself, &quot;No, I absolutely cannot let those stupid and barbaric Chinese win the competition.&quot; He opened another portal and went inside, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, it&#x27;s come to this now.&quot; The sound carried from afar. Early on the third day, the young lords of Lan district, who had rested overnight, immediately rallied and continued to catch up with the progress of the four kingdoms district. Come on, Dingle, Chufunga, and others encouraged each other and provided support and assistance.</p>
<p>The lords who were watching also cheered everyone on. They saw a new generation of young lords, different from those of previous years, full of vigor and vitality. As the sun finally set, Lan region caught up with Sigua region once again, taking the lead by a very small margin. However, the good times didn&#x27;t last long. After nightfall, the Four Kingdoms region once again surpassed and left the Lan region behind.</p>
<p>This can&#x27;t go on like this. Dinglay dialed Lin Xiaos number again, but there was still no answer. Every lord of ours has already given it their all, and all the shortcomings have been addressed. There is almost no room for improvement in the future. But why is the data of the Japanese lord rising so rapidly as if he&#x27;s been injected with adrenaline? Brother Shiao, come back quickly.</p>
<p>How can we fight without you? On the fourth day, the lords of the Lan region tried their best to catch up, but they still couldn&#x27;t catch up with the Donging Shikoku region by sunset. As night fell, the gap widened even further. On the fifth day, the Lan region was already nearly 2 million fewer than the Shikoku region in Japan. Just when everyone was feeling hopeless, Dugu Jaolon, who had been keeping a low profile, suddenly made a move. Look, Dugu Jaan stats are rising.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what method she used, but she worked around the clock and the resource collection data skyrocketed. On the sixth day, Dugu Jaolan&#x27;s resource collection data reached 5.8 8 million, while Lin Shiao maintained a steady growth rate, reaching 5.9 million. The combined data of the two of them is almost the same as that of the Shikoku region. With the other eight lords also performing admirably, the Lnon region has once again surpassed the four kingdoms region. Damn it, Kenzo, Dohara kicked the coffee table in front of him away.</p>
<p>Sakura, Shichiro, and Roland are so useless. Even their murders and robberies can&#x27;t match the speed at which the Lnon region accumulates resources. It&#x27;s infuriating. My lord, please calm down. An elderly ninja across from him took a sip of tea and said, &quot;Fum Kodoro has already set out and will soon find Lin Shia and kill him.</p>
<p>But look at the stats of the other lords in the Lan region. They&#x27;re quite good, too.&quot; Kenzo Dohra said angrily, &quot;What the hell is wrong with those damn Chinese? Aren&#x27;t they supposed to be the most disunited people in the world? The ones who love to fight amongst themselves? The elderly ninja narrowed his eyes and said, &quot;My lord also has other lords. You mean the total number of young lords in the four kingdoms this year is also in the tens of millions. There are always many ants who are sent to their deaths. Let them die as brilliantly as summer flowers, which can be regarded as a ray of light in their boring lives.&quot; After listening to the old ninja&#x27;s words, Kinszo Dohara nodded heavily.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, before the sun had even set, the resource competition leaderboard had changed again. Entire four kingdoms region is skyrocketing. It&#x27;s not just Sakura, Shikaru, and Roland. Even resource-based lords who were previously lagging behind are seeing their data surge. Oh my god, what on earth is going on in the Shikoku region? The numbers following each lord&#x27;s name rose rapidly.</p>
<p>The Lnon region could no longer hold on and was quickly left behind by the four kingdoms region. This is insane. It&#x27;s absolutely insane. A veteran lord murmured. The speed at which Lan District has gathered resources this year is almost among the top 10 in the history of the entire planet.</p>
<p>This group of young lords is incredibly capable and they are very united. But how come the Shikoku region can still surpass us? Everyone was bewildered and puzzled. Even if we lose in the end, we must protect these young lords. Their abilities, resilience, teamwork, and mental fortitude are all topnotch. One lord suggested, &quot;We can&#x27;t ruin the future star of our Lan region.</p>
<p>Help!&quot; A shrill cry rang out. Then silence fell again amidst the astonishment of the people in Lan district. Sorry everyone, I apologize for the mistake. It was the wrong server that the Lord from my four kingdoms region sent the message to. Someone explained in the crosserver channel.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was a cry for help from their adversaries in Japan, the people of Long Nan district didn&#x27;t take it to heart. As the resource accumulation data of the four regions continued to soar, while the data of the Lan region had slowed down its growth rate as night fell, everyone&#x27;s hearts were in their throats. Who else can turn the tide, huh? This guy almost turned the tables. Necro orb successfully obtained. Lynsha took out a pale white orb from the corpse of the cave lord and carefully put it away.</p>
<p>It took two days to infiltrate the forbidden land of the undead and assassinate the crypt lord, and another two days to lure him out and kill him. Without the divine perspective and Chin Leon Yus command and the White Spear soldiers extremely high bonus on the mountain, we simply couldn&#x27;t have taken the undead orb as soon as we entered the official area. I can only consider it after I reached level 60. We did it when we were only level 30some. Leong Yu, thank you.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao solemnly expressed his gratitude to Chin Leong Yu and all the soldiers were filled with awe. At this moment, the notification sound of the main god systems reward settlement rang out. Lynn Shiao calculated the time, wondering how the competition was progressing and then opened the communication interface that had been blocked for several days. In an instant, the flood of information made the entire interface turn white. Brother Shia, brother Sha, urgent.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia, come out quickly. My old man is about to beat me to death. Please help me. Lynn Sha, this is Dugu Jaalon. Are you there? Chapter 153.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha returns. Don&#x27;t be afraid. I&#x27;m here. I didn&#x27;t expect so many people to be looking for me after I was only missing for a few days. Even the frost goddess Dugu Jaolon messaged me privately.</p>
<p>Before Lin Sha could finish speaking, Baoi, who was following behind, secretly pinched his waist. Stop fooling around. Lyn Sha patted Ba&#x27;s head and gestured for her to continue using the concealment while the team rested and remained on guard. During a break, Lyn Sha quickly browsed the messages sent to him and soon he understood the reason. Surprisingly, the Shikoku district did not lose to the Lan district as he had predicted.</p>
<p>Instead, it took the lead over the Lan district in the resource competition. What on earth is going on? Dugu Jaolan has already gathered resources to a level similar to mine. And so have Ding Lelay, Fongu, Panch Shan Yu, Lu Jaoiing, and even a brute like Wong Bo, all of whom have gathered a lot of resources. Are we still lagging behind? Lyn Shiao quickly looked through the chat history and learned the whole story. It turns out that after he left, Dinglay used his backup plan to show off and successfully motivated all the contestants.</p>
<p>Everyone worked together and once caught up with the fornation region. However, just like themselves, the Shikoku region does not slow down its collection speed at night and it has overtaken them again. Finally, the veteran squad leader Dugu Jalon made his move and once again surpassed the Four Kingdoms region. However, at this moment, all the lords of the Four Kingdoms region went berserk as if they had rabies. At this point, the Lan region could no longer catch up with the Sigua region and now there was a gap of more than 3 million.</p>
<p>Resource collection data for Lnon district total 25.05 million. Among them, he and Dugu Jaolan accounted for the majority. He had 13.41 million and Dugu Jaolan had more than 8 million. Resource collection data for the Shikoku region total 28.78 million. Sakura, Shichiro, and Roland accounted for the majority with a combined total of over 23 million, but the resource collection data of the other eight lords is also rapidly increasing.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve already gotten our data into the top 10 in the history of Earth. How can the little guys still surpass us? I have a feeling that the younger generation didn&#x27;t do anything right in this competition, Lyn Sha muttered to himself. If they had such a method for quickly gathering resources, why didn&#x27;t they use it in the first place? Why did they give it to the two lords first and not to the vassal lords? Now that they&#x27;re in a hurry, they&#x27;re giving it to the vassel lords. There must be something wrong. Lyn Sha activated his most powerful brain, quickly browsing and analyzing the chat history.</p>
<p>The cry for help caught his eye, and Lyn Sha instinctively felt something was wrong. After a moment&#x27;s thought, Lynn Sha contacted Saulin. saw the Lynn do this and this. Almost there. Lynn Shao stretched and sent a message to Ding Lay Chu Funga and others who had been anxiously waiting for him.</p>
<p>I have returned. After thinking for a moment, she mischievously sent a message to Dugu Jalon alone. Don&#x27;t be afraid. I&#x27;m here. After saying that, Lynn Sha opened a portal.</p>
<p>Everyone, return. After a brief flash, before the enemies in the entire forbidden land of the dead could react, Lyn Ziao&#x27;s men had all returned to their official territory. The chat channel was filled with gloom and despair. It&#x27;s over. Only one day left.</p>
<p>The resource race is about to end. Our Lon district is still more than 3 million resources short of the four kingdoms total resources. More than 3 million. Even a resource lord couldn&#x27;t accumulate that much in 10 days. Our 10 new lords have performed quite well this year, but we never expected that the Japanese from the four kingdoms region would be even stronger.</p>
<p>The four nation region has two lords with S-rank talents. We also have Lin Shiao and Dugu Jaolan, but Lyn Shao only has F-level talent. Liao&#x27;s performance is evident to all, and he is also the personal disciple of the domain lord. He is no worse than an S-rank lord. But the reality is that our Lnon region is about to lose.</p>
<p>Sigh. Things are unpredictable. I think we lost this time. Let&#x27;s not blame them. If it were us back then, we wouldn&#x27;t have done any better.</p>
<p>But losing is really frustrating. 10 times the resources and compensation will the Lon region again. At this time, isn&#x27;t it just a difference of a little over 3 million? A voice suddenly appeared in the chat channel. Don&#x27;t worry. Let the little ones have their fun for a while.</p>
<p>Let them drink poison to quench their thirst and then our L nonan district will step up its efforts. I&#x27;ll make those bastards lose both their wives and their money. The chat channel was silent for a few seconds. Who&#x27;s talking? Bragging at a time like this isn&#x27;t something to be happy about. It&#x27;s Lin Shiao.</p>
<p>Someone recognized Lin Xiao&#x27;s ID. Lyn Shiao, you&#x27;ve finally shown up. You still have a way to improve resource collection data. Brother Shiao, I&#x27;ve been waiting for you for so long. What does Shiaoi mean? What does losing both wife and army mean? Lynn Sha laughed heartily, forgetting that the dragon people spoke a different language than him.</p>
<p>The Japanese mean small life, but I forgot about that too quickly. As for losing both the wife and the army, it means making them lose both the game and their dignity. Everyone in the chat channel was shocked. What? You can still win? And what about the Japanese? What happened to them? How did they act so disrespectfully? Lynn Sha smiled mysteriously. You&#x27;ll all find out soon enough.</p>
<p>Our 10 lords of the Lan region are the true victors. The Japanese are destined to be nailed to the pillar of historical shame. Lyn Sha logged off and briefly checked the battle rewards after his long-d distanceance raid on the undead forbidden zone and the beheading of the undead hero. I have enough experience to level up directly to level 40. Fortune favors the bold.</p>
<p>upgrade everyone to level 40 immediately. Then activate the undead orb. The god system flashed with light and after a few operations, the necromancer orb was activated. Going forward, all of Linhao&#x27;s heroes, troops, and other units that need upgrading can be upgraded automatically, eliminating the need for Lin Shiao to manually operate them. Moreover, Lynn Sha set up the undead orb to allocate 80% of the experience to all units for self-upgrading while the remaining 20% of the experience returned to him for overall management.</p>
<p>In this way, he can directly upgrade the newly recruited green horns to the corresponding level of the same type of soldier. It&#x27;s impossible for all the current Moda iron guards to be level 40 and for all newly recruited Moda iron guards in the barracks to start leveling up from level one. Moreover, he can use this experience to level up himself so that even if he slacks off, just kidding, he can still maintain the highest level in the territory. What is the majesty of a lord JPG? It&#x27;s safe to say that the undead orb is indeed one of the most sought after items in the official server. Moreover, it reappears after the undead forbidden zone disappears, making it not so easy to farm.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia grabbed one as soon as he entered, which can be considered incredibly lucky. I don&#x27;t have much gold or resources, but I did get a piece of equipment, the scale rock helmet that I&#x27;ve been missing. Now, I finally have the scale rock set, but it&#x27;s a set of excellent quality, so I&#x27;m not too keen on it. I&#x27;ll just use it for now. At least it&#x27;s better than one or two epic armor pieces combined.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve gained over 10,000 more battlefield energy and now I have 70,000. I should be able to use it freely for a while. Enough said, you little bastards. Since you&#x27;ve resorted to underhanded tactics, don&#x27;t blame me for using cheat codes. Use Battlefield of Myriad Races energy to exchange for Hwashia token energy.</p>
<p>Then use the Hasha token, Emperor&#x27;s Heroic Soul, to summon. Require Chapter 154. A prosperous era of emperors and their negative effects. Use the Hashia token, imperial heroic soul summoning. A golden light shone down from the sky, piercing through the endless fog on the battlefield of all races.</p>
<p>A faint majestic chanting sound rose from the heavens and earth, and the atmosphere around became solid and heavy, as if one were in the midst of a battlefield with clashing swords and galloping horses, or as if one were at top a high temple in the heavens, looking down upon all living beings. In an instant, countless imperial souls surged toward Lyn Sha, used the energy of the battlefield of all races to impose restrictions. Lynn Shao remained calm and composed and stated his requirements. Requirement one, an emperor who establishes a golden age. As soon as he finished speaking, 20 or 30 imperial spirits stepped forward, scrutinizing Lyn Sha with proud eyes.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha took a moment to check his energy level, and wow, just this one condition alone cost him over 20,000 energy. Fortunately, they didn&#x27;t directly ask for General Ton Su or Zuong or anything like that because he suspected he couldn&#x27;t afford to play that game. Requirement two, a leader who can revitalize the nation skilled at liberating and developing productive forces. Of the 20 or 30 emperors, more than a dozen remained. Only 2,000 units of energy were removed from the battlefield of 10,000 races.</p>
<p>It seems that the emperor who revived a dynasty and the emperor who ushered in a golden age have a high degree of overlap. Lin Sha glanced at the remaining emperors and suddenly added requirement three. No Eisenjoro or Eisenjoro Hongley. The two Imperial spirits emerged unwillingly glanced at Lin Sha and then disappeared. Unexpectedly, upon seeing Lin Sha proposed the third condition, several of the remaining Imperial spirits nodded in appreciation.</p>
<p>It seems there&#x27;s a hierarchy of contempt, even among emperors. Lyn Sha glanced at the energy level. The battlefield energy had only increased by 4,000. Spending 4,000 battlefield energy to eliminate two pseudo emperors of a prosperous era was worth it. The conditions are set.</p>
<p>Come imperial spirits, lend me your strength. Whoever it is under these constraints will surely be a powerful emperor. As Lyn Sha finished speaking, a tall, handsome emperor with an elegant demeanor and dashing appearance walked over. Possession complete. Lyn Sha opened his eyes.</p>
<p>This was a good deal. Emperor Schwanzong of Tang Leongji. Ability borrowing level two. Degree of integration low. Duration 48 hours.</p>
<p>Abilities: Click to view, prosperous era, skilled in both literature and martial arts, charming and dashing, imperial bearing. All troop types command a level negative. Faint eyesight. He defeated the most powerful emperor in the Tang dynasty besides Leeir. Moreover, it&#x27;s the mature version of the god system.</p>
<p>No, the hasha decree is truly a divine artifact. Otherwise, if Liongji were to experience the Enlucian rebellion, I&#x27;d probably be in a complete mess. Lyn Shiao simply clicked to view Liongji&#x27;s skills. The Caillouan era, Emperor Schwanzong of Tang created one of the most prosperous eras in Chinese history with outstanding achievements in both civil administration and military affairs. Martial arts increases the loyalty of all generals under your command by 20%.</p>
<p>increases all attributes by 20% and reduces the difficulty of recruiting foreign troops by 100%. Civilization increases the mining efficiency of all mineral veins by 300%. Increases the yield of all agricultural resources by 300%. Increases the output of all territory buildings by 300%. Allied nations and vassal states have also benefited greatly from the prosperity of the Tang dynasty.</p>
<p>Therefore, the host designated allies will have their mining efficiency increased by 200% for all mineral resources, agricultural production increased by 200% and territorial building production increased by 200%. Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. No wonder Leongji was able to quickly restore order to the Tang dynasty after the turbulent decades following Wuatian, transforming it from poverty and destitution into the prosperous Caillouan era, which was even stronger than the Jinguan era of his greatgrandfather Lee Shiman, attracting all nations to pay tribute. With just this one skill, Lin Sha could crush and surpass the fornation region.</p>
<p>As for the attributes of well-rounded in both literary and martial arts, charming and dashing, imperialbearing and all type troop commander level, there was nothing interesting about them. So Lin Shiao just glanced at them briefly. Being both scholarly and marshall is simply a matter of adding some points to the four main attributes, health and lifespan, especially stamina and way strength. However, I don&#x27;t seem to need it right now. He is dashing and charming, more attractive to the opposite sex, appealing to all ages, and devoted to all the women he falls in love with.</p>
<p>A regal bearing enhances one&#x27;s charm, making it easier for the opposite sex to fall in love with them. Huh. Lyn Shao suddenly realized that Leongji had so many skills, two of which were related to love and romance. No wonder he was so entangled with Yangu Feay. Negative, fainting eyesight.</p>
<p>After reaching a certain age, Liongji would become arrogant, extravagant, and neglect state affairs. Anyway, the one possessing me now is the young and vigorous Emperor Schwanzong of Tang. So, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Lyn Sha ignored this negative skill. After entering the official zone, or rather after I came into contact with the mythic cards, the level of Emperor&#x27;s Soul Fusion has reached the low level and the duration has also reached 48 hours.</p>
<p>The attributes that Emperor Schwanzong of Tang has given me have now reached an average of 600 points. Lyn Sha closed the character attribute panel and nodded in satisfaction. When I opened the competition interface again, my resource collection quantity indeed skyrocketed like an explosion. Resource collection data for Lnon District. Lin Sha 13.51 million 13.52 million 13.55 million 13.6 6 million.</p>
<p>People in the Lan district also quickly noticed Lin Xiao&#x27;s unusual behavior. Oh my god, look. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s stats are skyrocketing. 14 million 14.1 million. Every time I blink, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s resource collection data increases by tens of thousands.</p>
<p>This is simply unbelievable. The exclamations drew a crowd and soon hundreds of thousands of people following the competition flooded the chat channel. Lynn Shiao truly lives up to his reputation as a genius personally taught by the domain lord. With him around, we still have hope. Brother Shia, awesome.</p>
<p>In just over 10 minutes, Lynn Shia narrowed the gap of more than 3 million in Lan district to more than 2 million. At this rate, the Shikoku region will soon be caught up with and surpassed. At this moment, Lynn Shiao, who was sitting in the Lord&#x27;s mansion, noticed that the data of the four kingdoms region had also begun to surge. Is he truly encouragable? By doing this for a single match, aren&#x27;t you digging your own grave?&quot; Lyn Sha closed his eyes, used his lord level authority to locate the spy he had sent out, and then sensed the spies perspective. Just as I expected, just as I thought.</p>
<p>Through his observations of the undercover agents, Lynn Shia learned the truth. To win the resource race, they actually did such a thing to their own people. How perverted and shameless. But I like it. On the competition interface, Lyn Sha had just narrowed the gap to around 1 million.</p>
<p>But the four kingdoms region started to speed up again. Instead, Lyn Sha asked the monsters in Calabash Valley to rest for half a night. Let them kill for another night. The more the better. He Anyway, they were all lowly lords who died.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s give the Japanese some vague hope. It&#x27;s time to go find my old squad leader, Dugu Jaolon, my little brother, Dinglay, and my good brother Fongo, and let them also enjoy the 200% bonus. Then, well have victory in our grasp. Just then, Ba walked in. My lord, this humble servant.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaos gaze froze for a moment. My beloved concubine, come to me quickly. For some reason, Bai, who is already stunningly beautiful, seemed different to him today. He just felt if I cannot embrace my beloved at this moment, I will feel a deep sense of loss. He only regretted that he could not transform into a pair of love birds in heaven with Ba or become intertwined branches on earth.</p>
<p>At this moment, I don&#x27;t want to care about anything else. All I want is to have a deep emotional exchange with Baoi. Baoi looked up in surprise and found that Lin Shiao was different from before. He was already a handsome man. But at this moment, he was more mysterious and more alluring.</p>
<p>Yes, men can also be described as alluring. It also possesses an alluring imperial aura. They say power is the best aphrodesiac. Ba&#x27;s breathing became rapid. Her pretty face flushed red and she walked cautiously with small labored steps.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha didn&#x27;t care about anything else. He stroed over and picked up Ba in his arms. With a gentle reminder, the two removed their unnecessary items. Chapter 155 must not be allowed to live designated privileges. Nightfalls inside the Lord&#x27;s mansion in the Shikoku district.</p>
<p>Kenzo Dohara&#x27;s angry voice echoed through the air. Baka bastard. The lead we&#x27;ve worked so hard to build is now only a little over a million. Will we be overtaken tomorrow? Sakura, Shikaru, and Roland, and your vassel lords, are you even capable? Of the more than 10 million young lords in my four kingdoms region, several thousand have been slaughtered by you. I mobilized my connections every day to clean up the mess, and this is the result you left me.</p>
<p>Hurry up and step up your game. take advantage of the night and quickly build up a bigger lead. Baka, if we lose this time, even killing you all wouldn&#x27;t be enough to compensate. I&#x27;ve already lost thousands of lords, and if this continues, I won&#x27;t be able to protect you all. Hey, came the distinctive bowing and scraping of the Japanese from the other end, and Kinszo Dohura&#x27;s anger gradually subsided.</p>
<p>After turning off the communication, he sat down on the tatami mat with his knees bent, his expression solemn. We almost got turned around and it was all caused by that guy named Lynn Sha. Thank goodness. Thank goodness his speed suddenly slowed down and he didn&#x27;t start operating at night. I can somewhat empathize with Pu Dawei s concerns about this son.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s unbelievable that one person alone has the ability to influence and change the entire situation. This child must not be allowed to live. Kenzo Dohara&#x27;s small round eyes flashed with a sharp light as he dialed the old ninja&#x27;s communication again. Has Lyn Xiao&#x27;s location still not been found? Fumako has discovered something unusual in a forbidden zone for the undead. Rest assured, my lord, Fumodoro is one of my four great ninjas.</p>
<p>Killing Lin Shia, a level 30 novice lord, is a piece of cake. After an unknown amount of time, Ba, feeling as if she had been pulled out of the water, finally came to her senses and gently leaned against her husband&#x27;s strong body. My lord, okay, just call me husband. Lyn Shao gently embraced the beauty in his arms and said, &quot;There are no outsiders here, so you can relax. We can be like any other couple.&quot; &quot;My husband,&quot; Baoi blushed shily, her eyes welling up with tears of emotion.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaoso willingness to let her call him husband is a sign of his approval of her. My husband is different today. That was Emperor Schwanzong of Tang, that eccentric emperor. His both literary and marshall talents skill had a jumbled mess of things added to it, which really opened Lyn Xiaos eyes. He Lyn Shao stretched and asked, &quot;What brings you here?&quot; &quot;I was originally here to serve the Lord during his bath and dressing,&quot; Baoi said shily.</p>
<p>&quot;But now it&#x27;s like this.&quot; Haha, things are fine as they are now. It&#x27;s not too late to take a bath now. Lyn Sha laughed and carried Ba to the bathtub. The water&#x27;s all cold. Ba said, &quot;Please let me heat up some warm water.&quot; &quot;No way,&quot; Lyn Sha said decisively.</p>
<p>&quot;How can I let you work so hard? Besides, what if someone sees us?&quot; Lyn Sha thought for a moment, then summoned two flower fairies in his mind and asked them to bring in fresh hot water. Two strange and beautiful fairies with translucent wings flew in. As soon as they entered, they saw a handsome man faintly visible behind the screen and a beautiful woman he was embracing. The woman leaned on the man&#x27;s shoulder, her long black hair cascading down to the ground, partially obscuring her shapely figure. The flower fairy was momentarily stunned.</p>
<p>Hearing the sound of flapping wings, the man slowly turned his head and spoke softly in a nasal tone. Um uh Yao Yao deserves to die, the two flower fairies quickly apologized. Their hearts were pounding, and they dared not look around anymore. They could only quickly change the hot water and fly away, closing the door behind them. &quot;Ph, I was so nervous,&quot; a flower fairy exclaimed, patting her chest.</p>
<p>The Lord&#x27;s aura is becoming more and more terrifying, just like a real emperor. I couldn&#x27;t help but want to kneel down and crawl over. Stop. What are you saying? It&#x27;s outrageous. What you&#x27;re saying is perfectly normal.</p>
<p>What are you two doing? The flower fairy squad leader came to the two of them and scolded them. Get to work. After the two left, the flower fairy squad leader shook his head and muttered to himself, &quot;How could you possibly covet the Lord, Miss Ba? General Chin Leong Yu, Princess Andrea the Succubus, Sherry the blood witch, and I even think that Miss Dugu, the Lord&#x27;s classmate, is interested in him. Even I, Yao, Yao, dare not dream that the Lord will one day make Yao Yao. Um, I&#x27;m drooling.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao and Bao entered the bathtub. The warm waters soaked their skin, making him close his eyes in comfort. By the way, Ba, you should recruit some songstresses. Lynn Sha stretched and yawned, then put his arm around the beauty in his arms. The songstresses were Bao&#x27;s exclusive troop type, but Lyn Sha had never recruited them, and Baoi had never mentioned them.</p>
<p>H Does my husband think I haven&#x27;t served you well? No, no, no. What I mean is, you&#x27;re my person. How can you do these trivial things every day? You should also have the demeanor of a princess. Let the servants do these chores. And the flower fairies are too lively and unruly.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#x27;t be good waitresses. You could recruit some songstresses who could give you leg massages, back rubs, and foot washes and sing and dance during holidays. No, rap. I mean sing and dance to make everyone happy. My lord, I will recruit some singing girls.</p>
<p>But your words frightened Ba a little. Fear. Lynsha suddenly woke up. Holy crap. What am I doing? Continuing to play music and dance.</p>
<p>It turns out that the negative effects of Emperor Schwanzong of Tang were taking hold. Lin Shao broke out in a cold sweat. Then realized, &quot;Baoi, you are truly my wise and virtuous wife. From now on, if anyone says you are a fim fatal who brings ruin to the country, I&#x27;ll fight them to the death.&quot; Baosi leaned happily into Linia&#x27;s arms. With my husband&#x27;s words, I can die without regrets.</p>
<p>But husband, why is your breathing so rapid again? Haha, of course. Then a thousand miles of orioles sing amidst the green and red wine flags flutter in the wind of wateride villages and mountain towns. The flower fairy squad leader, who was eavesdropping outside, shed tears of envy from the corner of his mouth. After some time, Lyn Sha arrived at the war hall. It&#x27;s only 900 p.m.</p>
<p>now, and the competition lords of the Lan region should still be awake at this time. Dinglay, you did a great job this time. Lyn Sha first went to his vassel lord and subordinate and assigned the caillouan prosperity special effect to Dinglay. Dinglays current mining efficiency for all mineral veins is increased by 200%. The yield of all agricultural resources is increased by 200%.</p>
<p>The output of all territory buildings is increased by 200%. If I eat meat, you&#x27;ll have soup. Lynn Shiao encouraged him. Be my good little brother and let&#x27;s chase the spirit of glory together. Then they found Fongu.</p>
<p>Good lad, you finally arrived. Chufinga&#x27;s red hair drooped a little. There&#x27;s still a gap of about a million and there&#x27;s only one day left. How can we catch up? And why has your speed slowed down again? Lynn Shia smiled mysteriously. With me here, you can rest assured.</p>
<p>Let me give you a taste of what it&#x27;s like to be the center of attention. You have to keep this a secret. Lynn Shiao designated the prosperous era of Caillouan special effects for Chufinga. Next up should be my good class monitor, right? Lyn Sha felt an urgency as he dialed Dugu Jaolan&#x27;s number. On the other side, Dugu Jaolon, dressed in a light purple robe and holding a sword in her hand, looked like a fairy descended from heaven.</p>
<p>Her long hair cascaded down. Her purple robe was as beautiful as a flower, and her long sword was as white as snow. She was indescribably beautiful, elegant, noble, and otherworldly. With the help of Emperor Schwanzong of Tang, Lin Sha blurted out unconsciously. My beloved concubine, &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m here.&quot; Dugu Jaalon was struck dumb, and the sword in his hand clattered to the ground. Her eyes widened in disbelief, her usual, elegant and aloof demeanor completely gone. How dare you? A voice came from beside Dugu Jaon. Chapter 156. Dialogue with Lord Dugu.</p>
<p>Far ahead. Lyn Sha was taken aback. A woman who looked seven or eight parts similar to Dugu Jaolon, but was more mature and aloof, dressed in a gorgeous gown and wearing a solemn headdress, appeared on the communication interface. Little ant. Lin Sha murmured unconsciously.</p>
<p>Who are you calling auntie? Across from her, Dugu Nanuangs eyebrows furrowed and waves of murderous intent emanated from her through the internet cable. Lin Shiao shivered and quickly straightened his posture, bowing his head and saying, &quot;Lord of the domain.&quot; Dugu Nanuang snorted coldly, glanced at Dugu Jaon, and slowly said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect Ganon to tell you about my relationship with her. It seems you hold a high place in Gowan&#x27;s heart. In front of her aunt, who surpassed her in status, aura, experience, and looks, Dugu Jaolan lost her aloof goddess demeanor and instead looked pitifully at the floor like a girl who had made a mistake. Lyn Sha thought to himself with a smug smile.</p>
<p>Serves you right for being so mischievous and playing tricks on me all day long. Dugu Nanuang continued, Lyn Sha, I came to find Jaolon to learn about your situation. It&#x27;s just that you called. Looks like I don&#x27;t need to come to see you separately anymore. Lynn Shiao said sincerely.</p>
<p>Please give your instructions, Lord Domain Master. Dug Nanuang said coldly. Lyn Sha, confirm that you are not with anyone and are in an absolutely safe and confidential place. Lyn Sha looked around and said, &quot;I have cleared out the warh hall. No one can enter without my permission.&quot; Dugun Nanuang nodded.</p>
<p>Very good. What I am about to say may very well concern your life or death. Lynn Shiao, aren&#x27;t you wondering why I suddenly appear and declare that you are my last disciple when we&#x27;ve never met before and you even refused Chu Yusi&#x27;s offer to recruit you? Lyn Sha looked directly at Dugu Nanuang and said frankly, &quot;Because the domain lord wanted to protect me. He gave me a legitimate identity with strength that was beyond reason. Why should I help you? Because the domain lord wants me to become a powerful ranger lord of dragon sia and fight for dragon sa.</p>
<p>Will you fight for Lia meeting? Then why did you reject Chu Yusi back then? Its wings are not yet fully grown and it has too many secrets. Dugu Nanuang narrowed her eyes, a playful look on her face. Oh, so you&#x27;ve grown powerful now. In the official area, the sea is wide enough for fish to leap and the sky is high enough for birds to fly. So, you don&#x27;t have many secrets left.</p>
<p>There are still many secrets, but I am grateful to the domain lord for his kindness in covering them up for me. Dug Nanuang didn&#x27;t speak. She just kept staring at Lyn Shao. Lyn Sha neither dodged nor avoided Dugu Nanuangs scrutinizing gaze. Dugu Jaon, standing to the side, frowned slightly as if he had gleaned something from their conversation and was deep in thought.</p>
<p>Very good, Lyn Shao. Dugu Nanuang said slowly. Your mind is more firm and mature than I imagined. It seems that my decision was not wrong. However, I also want to remind you that my investment in and protection of you is entirely based on your ability to contribute to Lshia.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you have an ambiguous or unclear relationship with the demon race, Duga Nanchuangs tone turns somber. It&#x27;s still about ancient demons. As long as you can become an invincible blade for my Lung Shia. Lyn Xiaos pupils suddenly contracted. The Dugu family indeed knew something about him and the ancient demons.</p>
<p>Can you really fight for Lia? Dugu Nanuang asked slowly, almost in a dreamlike tone. Lin Shiao remained silent for a full 5 seconds. Although I came into this world, I have never forgotten my identity as a Chinese person. Because of his Chinese identity, he obtained the Chinese token and awakened an SSS level talent. They felt an instant connection with the Chinese heroes and soldiers from this other world.</p>
<p>The world of Lshia is on the verge of collapse. The fate of the ancient demons also tells the tragic story of Chinese civilization. He originally only wanted to live a carefree life in another world, but by a twist of fate, he has become deeply bound to the ancient demons of China. Whether by choice or by force, he was already on the blacklist of all traitors and had no choice but to fight to the death for his own sake and for the fate of the ancient demons. Lord Dugu, there is something I must clarify.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao said slowly. I will not become anyone&#x27;s weapon. Dugu Nanus expression remained unchanged, but her killing intent had already hardened. I really admire these masters. How did their killing intent travel through the internet? Lyn Sha thought to himself, but still calmly replied.</p>
<p>But I can assure you, everything I&#x27;ve done is for Lang Shia, for the people of Lang Shia, and for this country to become strong again. It&#x27;s also for the sake of China. As soon as the words were uttered, Dugu Nanuang narrowed her eyes slightly again, while Dugu Xaolans eyes widened, and she lost her composure once more. Okay, I&#x27;ve got it. After that, there were no torches and I became the only light.</p>
<p>Without wasting words, Dugan Nanuang said directly, &quot;You can still use my name.&quot; Having said that, she glanced indifferently at Dugu Jaon, then looked back at Lin Sha and slowly said, &quot;Besides me and Gan, I hope you will never say those two words in front of anyone else. This is for your own good.&quot; Dugu Nanuang is gone, leaving behind only Dugu Jaolan, who has shed her aloof exterior. Hey, class monitor. Before Lin Sha could finish speaking, Dugu Jaolan abruptly shut down the communication, leaving Lin Shiao scratching his head awkwardly. The morning of the final day of the resource race.</p>
<p>Look, Lan region has caught up, and the gap with the four kingdoms region is less than 100,000. My god, how did they do that? It&#x27;s Dugu, Jaolon, Dinglay, and Shufinga. Their combined resource data has almost doubled. What? That&#x27;s amazing. Amidst the murmurss, Lynn Sha awoke.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time to give the Shikoku region a desperate and undignified death. Surely, notify all the monsters in the valley. Everyone must go into battle. No rest allowed. Gather resources for the entire day.</p>
<p>soldin inform all farmers to put aside their other work and devote themselves entirely to production. With Lin Xiao&#x27;s arrangement, his accumulated resource data skyrocketed. The three shift system was changed to a single shift system and the output increased by three times. Caillouan prosperity 3x bonus. May peace and prosperity last forever plus five times the amount.</p>
<p>Lynhiao&#x27;s resource collection data has reached 15 million 15.5 million 16 million. The data increases every time you blink. The total data for the L nan region immediately surpassed that of the four major regions. We&#x27;re going to win. We&#x27;re going to win.</p>
<p>The crowd began to cheer. Lin Shiao, Dugu, Ding Lay, and all the young lords participating in the competition. Good luck. You must win. If you win, I&#x27;ll treat you to dinner.</p>
<p>After witnessing Lyn Xiao&#x27;s prowess, the data from the four regions briefly struggled but ultimately could not catch up with Lin Xiao&#x27;s terrifying acceleration. Finally, the tense final day of the competition came to an end and everything was settled. Resource collection data for Lnon district. Lin Shao 46.75 million, Dugu Jaolan 13 million, Dinglay 5.31 million, Chufinga 5.25 25 million total for Lnon district 82.31 million resource collection data for the Shikoku region Sakura Shichiro 22.52 million Roland 21.88 88 million total in the Shikoku region 46.7 million Lan District 1 far ahead from the four regions is not even as much as the data from Lin Shao alone. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s collection of over 46 million resource data points was mostly obtained on the last day.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiao&#x27;s boast that he could defeat 10 lords from the four kingdoms all by himself actually came true. Lynn Shiao is terrifyingly powerful. Just as the entire Lan region was celebrating, an exasperated voice rang out in the cross region channel. Cheating. You must be cheating.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia, confess. Did you collude with the demons to kill their lords who were sent to their deaths to obtain resources? Chapter 157. The truth revealed, rewards received. Lyn Sha, confess. Did you collude with the demons to kill their lords who were sent to their deaths to obtain resources? The chat channel was silent for a few seconds, then immediately launched a fierce counterattack.</p>
<p>What nonsense are you spouting? Every one of our lords has achieved real results and even broken historical records. You guys can&#x27;t handle losing, so don&#x27;t play. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too late to back out now. We&#x27;ve already won the bet witnessed by the god system. The voice on the other end continued to haunt them.</p>
<p>Chui, come out here and explain yourself clearly. Why did the data for your lords suddenly increase at the end? If you don&#x27;t explain yourself clearly, my country Japan will lodge a formal protest with your Lan district, and you will bear all the consequences. Since the competition and betting began, calmly said, &quot;All the participating lords in my lung non region have used fair and just methods, and there has been no cheating. This has been recognized by the god system. You Kenzo Dohura persisted.</p>
<p>Even the competition monitored by the god system has bugs.&quot; &quot;Oh, what kind of bug? How come I didn&#x27;t know about it?&quot; Chu yusi on the other end became interested. Does your country know about this bug? Kenzo Dohura didn&#x27;t answer but just kept shouting, &quot;No, you have to explain why your results were able to surpass ours. Especially Lynn Shiao. His results are outrageous. I have reason to believe that he must be colluding with the demons.</p>
<p>I regret that I cannot comply.&quot; &quot;Then you have indeed colluded with the common enemy of Earth, and your intentions are despicable.&quot; Kenzo Dohur said, &quot;Our Japan will certainly not let you get away with this. Your accusations are completely unfounded. Damn it, you fat pig. Always babbling on and on. What&#x27;s your name? A shrill voice rang out, startling everyone in the chat channel.</p>
<p>In front of people from two different countries and two different regions across a cross regional channel. He publicly referred to the high-ranking official, Ambassador Doyuku Kenji, as a dead fat pig. Baka Tufun immediately flew into a rage. Lyn Sha, how dare you be so rude to me? Don&#x27;t you know anything about basic manners? The one who cursed was Lyn Sha. Can&#x27;t accept defeat, huh? You fat, ugly duckling.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t you just trying to smear the demons on me again and then try to reig on your promise? You&#x27;ve already lost all shame, and you won&#x27;t even let me scold you. Unfortunately, even if you want to reig, it&#x27;s useless. With the contract witnessed by the god system, the god system will automatically take the resources from you and give them to us. Kenzo Dohurra was furious. I&#x27;ll give it to you.</p>
<p>Do you dare to take it? You must have cheated and colluded with the demons to achieve your current results. If you do not return all my resources, my Shikoku region will definitely report to Prime Minister Tojo Hideki of Japan and launch a just war against your dragon summers collusion with the demon race. The threat of war is spoken so openly and blatantly. This gives a glimpse into the doineering and shameless nature of the Japanese. What? Scared? If you&#x27;re scared, apologize to us right now and take on 10 times the resources before handing Lin Shiao over to us.</p>
<p>Seeing the chat channel quiet, Kinszo Doyu was smug. Fine, go ahead and report it. Let&#x27;s see if Tojo Hideki Chi will chop you up, you fat pig who slaughtered his own kind before he even starts the war. What did you say? You thought you had the upper hand just now. That&#x27;s because I was uploading a video.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha shouted loudly. Everyone, please look. Lyn Sha posted the videos one by one to the cross regional chat channel. A handsome man in a kimono walked out of the portal holding a samurai sword and coldly and mercilessly stabbed the astonished young lord in front of him. A blonde man who looked like a woman accompanied by fierce Japanese samurai frantically chased and slashed at the fleeing people and then set the lord&#x27;s mansion ablaze.</p>
<p>There were also lords with ferocious faces who not satisfied with killing the lord set their sights on the lord&#x27;s female heroes and female soldiers raping them in public. One, two, 10 faces kept appearing in the videos, killing lords one after another, listening to the howls with expressionless faces. And then there was their standard bowing and apology after they killed someone. Sorry for the trouble. How ironic.</p>
<p>the two who appeared most frequently and also the first ones to appear. Sakura Shichiro, a handsome man in a kimono, and Roland, a blond-haired host. They and indeed all the Japanese lords in this competition were actually slaughtering their own kind. Those unsuspecting novice Japanese lords. You, you, where did you get this video from? This is slander, defamation, and falsehood.</p>
<p>Kenzo Dohura stammered incoherently. Lyn Sha, you&#x27;re framing me. As we all know, videos cannot be photoshopped. So, the video is real. Lyn Sha made a joke in a relaxed manner.</p>
<p>What? What photoshop? Whether it&#x27;s true or false, surely the lords of Japan have relatives and friends among these deceased. Why don&#x27;t they check if the people they know are still alive? Baka, how did you know that? You don&#x27;t need to know how I know. Lyn Shao said, &quot;You keep saying there&#x27;s a bug in the all races competition because you used that bug yourself. You asked us in the Lon region if there&#x27;s a bug where killing demons causes a bug because you&#x27;re guilty and you&#x27;re killing your own kind.&quot; &quot;Sorry, you fatso&quot;,&quot; Lyn Sha said calmly. &quot;Not only have we not colluded with the demons, but every resource we collect has been obtained cleanly.&quot; Lyn Shao raised his voice and said, &quot;But you, Kenzo, Doyu, you used your superior authority to leak a large amount of information about young lords to the lords participating in the competition.&quot; Sakura, Shichiro, Roland, and others can obtain precise coordinates to travel directly to the location of the young lord and carry out the massacre.</p>
<p>The consequences of massacring one&#x27;s own kind and the punishment from the main god system have also been erased by you. as the superior using your authority. Resources obtained by killing fellow clan lords are also counted in the competition which is why Sakura Shichiro and others have seen their scores sore. Kenzo Dohara, you really will stop at nothing to achieve your goals. Thousands upon thousands of your people have been sold out and killed by you.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha deliberately adopted a Japanese tone and said being betrayed by the superior you trusted most and suddenly killed by your idol. If I were Japanese, I would probably feel heartbroken too, right? My lords of Japan, it is a pity that I am a dragon person and cannot help you. I&#x27;m so sorry to have been born a Dragia person. You decide for yourselves how to treat your superior, your ambassador, Kenzo Doyu. No, Baka, let me go.</p>
<p>I am the ambassador. You have no right to treat me like this. Kenzo Dohare&#x27;s shouts abruptly stopped and no one spoke in the Cross region chat channel anymore. Lyn Shia let out a long sigh and left the Cross Region channel. Just then, the competition rewards from the God system arrived in my account.</p>
<p>Ding. The resource gathering competition between Lan region and the four kingdoms region has ended. The winning Lan region has received its winning stake as agreed. The main god system has directly collected the corresponding bets from the four kingdoms and all resources have been deducted equally from all lords in the four kingdoms. The loneon region will receive the following resources.</p>
<p>A total of 100 million stone or 100 million timber, 40 million refined iron, 40 million refined copper, 8 million gold coins, and 10 billion gold coins. All resources will be placed under the unified management of the LN region city, Lord&#x27;s Mansion. Lung Nan region receives an extra bet. The Four Kingdoms region&#x27;s annual luck charm has been activated and is in effect. All players in the LN region, excluding beginners, will receive a 10-year increase in lifespan, a 10% increase in health, and a 10% increase in luck.</p>
<p>The overall resource production of the Lung Nan region will increase by 10%. And the area of the Lan region will expand by 10%. The announcement from the main god system slowly reached everyone&#x27;s ears. But this time, after learning how cruel the Japanese had been in order to win, the people of Lan District didn&#x27;t feel much joy or excitement. Lyn Sha nodded.</p>
<p>Through this incident, the people of Lan District had realized that the Japanese were not good people and had become more aware of their situation. Lynn Shiao casually switched back to the Lan region channel, intending to plan his next move within his territory. Looking up, I saw a screen full of neatly arranged messages. Lyn Sha, thank you. Lyn Sha, thank you.</p>
<p>Chapter 158. New hero. I want Jugalong. Inside the Lord&#x27;s Manor, Lyn Shao silently waited for the upgrade of his four bases to be completed. The rules in the official area are more complicated.</p>
<p>You need to be level 40 to upgrade to Town Hall 4 and level 50 to upgrade to Town Hall 5. So, for Town Hall 10 bases, the lord needs to be level 100 to upgrade. A level 100 official lord can already participate in the competition for the official area&#x27;s marshall prowess ranking. Black Flame&#x27;s elder brother, Wong Su, is level 100 and just ranked 100th on the Lord ranking, but he only has 10 books and 10 heroes. That&#x27;s why being number one in the newbie zone is so important because it means getting an extra hero slot.</p>
<p>And I I actually have two more hero slots. After sighing, Lynn Shiao smiled faintly. I doubt many people would have thought that I would have completed four books in just 10 days after entering the official zone. After entering the official area, Lin Sha went to the undead forbidden zone, killed the heroic crypt lord inside, and gained a huge amount of experience. After returning to his territory and completing the resource competition, Lyn Shao reached level 40 and began leveling up his base.</p>
<p>Today marks the completion of all four books. Then, Lyn Sha can recruit his sixth hero. So far, Lin Sha has five heroes. Pay Min, the great sword saint of the Tang Dynasty, is a powerful one-on-one hero and the master of wandering knights. Baoi, the peerless enchantress, is a mythical heroine, a stunning beauty, and can even influence the fate of lords and nations.</p>
<p>Marquez Chin Leang Yu is the queen of the mountains, a valiant and beautiful female general who is also a married woman. Huubing, also known as Finlang Jaku, was a cavalry general, a military genius, and an unparalleled warrior. Master blacksmith O Yzi, a special hero, and one of the patriarchs of blacksmiths, has forged countless famous swords. Although he has no combat ability with his addition, Lin Shiao has upgraded the equipment and weapons of all the MO Dao iron guards, divine arm archers, white pole spearmen, and Guan Ning iron cavalry, raising the combat power of his own Chinese troops to a new level. Of course, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s troops are now quite complete.</p>
<p>Pay has recruited a team of 10 wandering knights. Each of the knights is more capable than the iron guards of the same level and is a master of one-on-one combat. Ba also recruited several songstresses, all of whom were stunning beauties. However, Lynn Sha used them as servants in the Lord&#x27;s mansion, and they were responsible for household chores. Hitsubing has recruited 100 elite cavalrymen.</p>
<p>These are Hoitubing&#x27;s exclusive Chinese troops, and they are of the gold legendary level. They are powerful and even stronger than the Guan Ning iron cavalry in close combat. On O Y&#x27;s side, he recruited a number of blacksmiths to assist him, which could quickly advance the upgrading of Linhao&#x27;s army&#x27;s equipment. In short, Lyn Shao is currently in a period of rapid growth. All heroes and units obeyed their own commands, and there were no internal troubles.</p>
<p>The area of the official district is large enough that it will not encounter other lords and there will be no external threats. Lyn Shia already has several hundred golden legend farmers and over 200 lively flower fairies in his workforce. The hardworking wild monsters throughout the calabash valley and the spiritual fields and ponds of the golden legend farmers. Lyn Sha could continuously recruit all the units he could. There&#x27;s a huge amount of equipment, including excellent and rare weapons and armor, as well as many epic and legendary items.</p>
<p>However, there haven&#x27;t been any new epic or legendary items available in the official servers yet. Thanks to previous accumulation and Leelong skills, the gold coins were more than enough to last. As for safety, with Bao se&#x27;s amplified skill, concealment, and Lin Xiao&#x27;s occasional use of the celestial perspective to check the surrounding environment, Lin Sha has not yet discovered anything unusual. Last time, from the perspective of the god of heaven, it seems that someone has entered the forbidden zone of the undead again. But this person did not leave any obvious traces.</p>
<p>He must be a master. I hope it&#x27;s not aimed at me. Lyn Shaoed. My territory is now only a small to medium-sized territory, but I&#x27;m already finding it difficult to manage. This time, let&#x27;s recruit a civil official type hero with strong domestic administration skills.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao glanced at Baoi, who was quietly keeping him company while he waited, and silently thought to himself, &quot;Drunk, I lie on the lap of a beauty. Awake, I wield power over the world. My focus should be on conquering and improving myself. It&#x27;s better to have someone manage the affairs of the territory. This person should ideally be able to command respect so that my subordinates will be willing to listen to him.</p>
<p>Of course, loyalty is also necessary. In Chinese history, many powerful civil officials have directly sidelined the emperor and even held the power to depose and install emperors, manipulating the emperor at will. Loyalty is of course the most important thing. He he I can&#x27;t let my subordinates kick me out of office. Thinking about it this way, there is one person who can meet my conditions very well, but I don&#x27;t know if the Hashiao order has enough energy.</p>
<p>Lost in thought, the four books were upgraded. The announcement from the main god system resounded throughout the Lon region. But in a region with a population of hundreds of millions and an area of tens of millions of square kilm, announcements like upgrading a lord&#x27;s mansion are too common. So few people paid attention to Lin Shia. Excellent for books.</p>
<p>Now recruit my new hero. Lyn Shia took out the hero&#x27;s token. Exchange for Huasha token energy. Consume one energy point to use the Hasha token. Hua summoning function to summon a Hasha hero.</p>
<p>Hua immediately deducts 1,000 battlefield energy points. Then Lynn Shiao continued, &quot;Continue to consume the energy of the battlefield of myriad races and set the conditions for this Hasha summoning. Roll call. Zuyong. Ding.</p>
<p>Your Hasha token energy is insufficient. How can you recruit someone like Zhuang who is top-notch in both intelligence and internal affairs and whose loyalty is a model for all ages? I&#x27;ll accept it if I can&#x27;t recruit anyone with over 40,000 energy.&quot; Lynn Sha thought to himself. Lyn Sha decided to change the conditions and try a different approach to see if he could recruit Jubalang. Requirement one for this event is a hero with strong domestic affairs capabilities. Requirement two, absolute loyalty to the monarch/lord.</p>
<p>Requirement three, he is she has served as prime minister. Requirement four, postumous title, Woo/Who. As soon as Lynn Sha finished speaking, a system notification sounded. Ding! Recruitment successful. Your Hua Xiao orders battlefield energy has been completely deducted.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia was overjoyed. It worked. It really can exploit bugs. Yay! My Zhuang has arrived. A flash of seven colored light appeared and a portal appeared in the territory.</p>
<p>A figure slowly emerged from the portal of light. The figure moved with the stride of a dragon and the gate of a tiger. He was tall and strong with long limbs and large joints. He had a thick beard, a broad face, and was in his early 40s. His phoenix eyes held both the decisiveness of a martial artist and the wisdom of a scholar.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha was taken aback. It wasn&#x27;t the Zhuang with his feather fan and silk turban. Lyn Sha then realized that the conditions he had given were wrong. Zugal Yangsuous title was Jehong Wu Jungu, not Wuho Wu. Zugal Yang is generally referred to as Marque Wu and Marque Wu is a general term for Juul Yang.</p>
<p>However, the person who was postumously named Marque Wu was not Juul Yong, but was mostly a military general trying to exploit a system bug only to get taught a lesson by the system instead. However, this person spent more than 40,000 battlefield energy to meet such demanding conditions, which shows that he is quite steady and must be quite capable. Who exactly is he? Lyn Shia. Check this person&#x27;s attributes. Chapter 159.</p>
<p>So, it was Wong Ming. Check this person&#x27;s attributes. Wong Ming, prime minister of the formerQin dynasty. Race, human, Chinese. Quality, golden legend.</p>
<p>Level. Level one. Attributes. Strength 60 + 12. Spirit 60 + 12.</p>
<p>Constitution. 60 + 12. Soul 60 + 12. Skills. Capable of both military and political leadership.</p>
<p>Firm and remedy. Fair and rewarding and punishing. Top tier strategist. Majesty. Click to view.</p>
<p>Combat power rating 60 stars. Exclusive unit. Internal affairs official. Lynsha blinked. It was Wong Ming.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the message from the main god, Wong Ming instantly understood his mission. With a powerful stride, he arrived before Lin Shiao in a few steps and knelt down in deep reverence. Your subject, Wong Ming, pays respects to your lordship. So, it&#x27;s Wong Jinglu. Please rise.</p>
<p>Liaos earlier doubts turned into joy. He helped Wong Ming up warmly grasped his hands and said, &quot;My acquisition of Wong Jinglu is like Lu Bay acquiring Zhuang or Duan of Chi acquiring Guanjang. My fortune is comparable to that of Fu Jian.&quot; Wong Ming bowed his head humbly. I dare not compare myself to Zhuang and Guan Jong, but I will certainly do my best to assist you, my lord, to repay your kindness in recognizing my talent. Furthermore, I have a question.</p>
<p>Who is this Fu Jian? Uh-huh. Just mentioning it casually. He&#x27;s not an important person. Lyn Sha thought to himself. As expected, the system directly modified the memories of heroes like Wong Ming who are extremely loyal.</p>
<p>His original master, Fu Jian, has disappeared, and only he himself is the one he is loyal to. Jinglu, I&#x27;ll introduce you to a few people who are my right-hand men. You&#x27;ll be working with them from now on. Lyn Shao pulled Wong Ming along and introduced Pay Minitsubing and others to Wong Ming one by one. While letting him familiarize himself with his hero, Lyn Shao also observed and examined Wong Mangs skills.</p>
<p>Wong Mang is a hero whose four stats are all 60 points when he is level one. He is truly a man of both literary and military talents, which matches his skill, capable of both managing internal affairs and commanding the army. A hero in both military and political affairs, Wong Ming&#x27;s internal affairs ability is increased by 50% and his efficiency in handling government affairs is increased by 50%. When Wong Ming is a hero in internal affairs but not leading troops, the Lord&#x27;s production of all resources is increased by 50%. Investment returns are increased by 50% and the production efficiency of all buildings is increased by 50%.</p>
<p>When Wong Mang leads troops, he automatically switches to a general type hero, gaining the all troop command S-rank skill and can reduce losses in logistics support and military equipment. Wongming also possesses another formidable skill, top strategist. Wong Ming excels at using his keen observation skills to formulate tactical plans, which greatly increases the success rate of his strategies. Wong Ming is also highly skilled at strategy formulation. When his strategies are adopted, the overall effectiveness of the strategies increases by 50%.</p>
<p>As for Majesty, it is one of the keys to ensuring Wong Mang becomes the prime minister. It increases the respect of all friendly units other than the master for Wong Mang by 20% and increases the fear of all enemies for Wong Mang by 20% which will affect the morale of the enemy to some extent. Lin Sha nodded repeatedly at Wong Mings attributes and skills. He may not have been as good as Zhuang in strategy and domestic affairs, but he wasn&#x27;t far behind. He was among the top generals in China in terms of both command and personal combat skills.</p>
<p>Wongming is also quite adept. I really struck gold. Over 40,000 battlefield energy. It was totally worth it. After Wong Ming and Lin Xiaos heroes finished exchanging greetings, they looked around Lin Xiao&#x27;s territory and witnessed the efficiency of the Golden Legend peasants and the strength of various Chinese military units.</p>
<p>Just then, the alarm sounded. The demonic tide may be late, but it has arrived. Lyn Sha immediately dawned full armor and grabbed his weapons on the demonic tides in the official zone. As long as the god system assesses your abilities as strong enough, it will always arrange for a stronger demonic tide to attack you. All of my troops are level 40, but they are all gold legendary units and epic excellent units.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some of the monsters in the demon tide are level 50 or 60. Lyn Sha said, &quot;Generals, do not underestimate the enemy.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; the soldiers answered in unison. Be careful when you see that abyss demon with the broken horn. Without level restrictions, his strength may surpass all of ours,&quot; Lyn Sha added. Pay Min said calmly, &quot;I can defeat anyone who is more than 30 levels above me.&quot; Just as Lynsha was about to remind Pay Min to be careful, dark clouds drifted in, obscuring half the sky.</p>
<p>Beneath the clouds, an endless array of demons surged forward. An unprecedented massive magical tide is coming. Wong Ming, who had just been leveled up to level 40 by Lin Shiao, bowed to Lin Shiao and said, &quot;Lord, please allow me to command this battle.&quot; &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re new here, and you dare to lead troops in a battle?&quot; Not only Lin Sha, but also the other heroes around him turned their heads to look. Wong Ming is willing to stake his life on defeating the invading enemy. Great.</p>
<p>Looking forward to Wong Jingls performance, Lin Sha readily agreed, thinking to himself that Wong Ming was indeed Wong Ming, demanding command as soon as he made a move, just wanting to show off. Such a strong yet infinitely loyal subordinate is exactly what he currently lacks. A few hours later, Lynn Shiao, who had been holding the line in the rear, ultimately did not use the Hasha summoning. Imperial heroic soul possession technique as his own powerful troops had already gradually extinguished the demonic tide. A commotion arose as the victorious soldiers returned.</p>
<p>My lord, we are back. The entire army was victorious with not a single soldier killed. Payman&#x27;s shouting voice came over. Thanks to brother Wong Mings excellent command, we were able to defeat this horde of 100,000 monsters without any major incident. Lyn Sha looked over and saw Wong Ming and Pay Min with their arms around each other&#x27;s shoulders with Hoing and Chin Leonu behind them.</p>
<p>Their expressions a mixture of admiration and resentment. It seems that Wong Mings forthright personality is quite compatible with the generals under his command. Hatsubing was a master of war, no less than Wong Ming, only he was a little older and less experienced. Lyn Sha nodded in satisfaction. He had witnessed Wong Mings strength.</p>
<p>However, returning with the soldiers was also an abyss demon whose body was covered in lava and riddled with wounds. Brans is weaker than I thought. Upon closer inspection, Lin Sha realized it was a two-horned abyss demon. My lord, Wongming bowed down first. This abyssal demon is one of the generals of this demonic tide.</p>
<p>Just as we were about to kill him, he suddenly said that he had important information to report. Rest assured, &quot;My lord, General Hua and young Master P have severely injured this demon, and he is powerless to resist.&quot; &quot;Oh, do you have any news to tell me?&quot; Lyn Shao stood with his hands behind his back and asked calmly. The abyss demon spewed sulfurous steam from its nostrils and said haltingly, &quot;My princess Andrea invites the human lord Lynn Shia to be her guest.&quot; &quot;I have important matters to discuss.&quot; Lynn Shia frowned slightly, sensing that this was not a simple matter. Lyn Sha, once this is accomplished, your highness may arrange for the human Lynn Shia to marry into your family. If human Lyn Sha agrees, I will open the portal now.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia, huh? All the generals turned their attention to Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha frowned even more. Shameless. Here we go again. Don&#x27;t try to fool me.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha thrust his sword into the abyss demon&#x27;s chest. Chapter 160. Semi- divine artifact completed, but the special effects are terrible. Lyn Sha thrust his sword into the chest, killing the abyss demon. As the abyss demon turned to ashes and slowly disappeared, the demons are truly determined to destroy us.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha addressed the crowd with righteous indignation. These devils, one after another, keep bringing up their princess, trying to smear me. Every time there&#x27;s a demonic surge, she has to come and shout it out as if she&#x27;s afraid no one knows how desperate Andrea is to get married. She&#x27;s afraid others won&#x27;t know this, which has been messing with me. Lyn Sha shook his head and said, &quot;You all know best what kind of person I, Lyn Sha, am.</p>
<p>How can we let these low-level schemes and tricks affect us and make us lose our composure?&quot; &quot;Yes, except for Wong Ming.&quot; All the soldiers nodded solemnly in agreement. The demon race is our sworn enemy. &quot;Yes, except for Wong Ming.&quot; All the soldiers continued to nod. Lyn Sha stopped and looked at the soldiers with suspicion. The soldiers all wore solemn expressions and serious demeanor except for Pay Min who seemed unable to suppress a smile.</p>
<p>Pay Min, get out of here. You&#x27;re a black sheep. Lyn Sha kicked Pay Min out of the line. Lyn Sha noticed out of the corner of his eye that Wong Mings brows visibly furrowed. It seems that Wong Ming couldn&#x27;t stand this relaxed and comfortable superior subordinate relationship.</p>
<p>Well, he is a person who values order very much. Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;Ding! Your hero Wong Mings loyalty has reached 100%. Ready to go through fire and water.&quot; &quot;Well, on the surface he&#x27;s a conservative, but inside he&#x27;s incredibly happy.&quot; &quot;My lord, I have heard rumors about you and this demon princess,&quot; Wong Ming said in a low voice. &quot;We Chinese are of noble birth and should indeed not have any dealings with the demon race. It is truly our good fortune that our Lord is not blinded by beauty or misled by information of uncertain truth.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha nodded. What you said makes a lot of sense. I will pay attention. Just then, Lyn Sha felt a voice calling from within. It&#x27;s the third shadowy figure.</p>
<p>Why are ancient demons seeking me out at this time? Could it be? Is the semi- divine artifact modified from angel cards finished? Lin Shao felt a surge of excitement and quickly made the arrangements. Wong Ming Hoing Chin Leang Yu another beast tide may be coming soon. So be prepared to defend. I need to leave for a while. When I am not here, all decisions shall be made by Baoi.</p>
<p>Yes, my lord. Lin Sha arrived at the war hall and immediately began to silently recite a spell in his mind. Lin Bing Dha Ja Jean Li Chen Shing. In an instant, the world spun around. Lin Shao appeared in an unknown place.</p>
<p>The buildings, both real and elucory, are scattered across the sky. The earth is broken, and cold winds blow through the fragmented air. Chaos, decay, secrecy, and strangeness. Three dark figures were already waiting ahead. He, the second shadowy figure, immediately gave a bitter laugh, and Lyn Sha couldn&#x27;t help but purse his lips.</p>
<p>Damn, how many more times will this petty ancient demon try to steal the laugh? Stop laughing. How many soul elders did this guy eat? Your laugh is even more awful than the potato itself. What is a soul hall elder? Never mind, you don&#x27;t know anyway. It&#x27;s from a Chinese online novel. I&#x27;ll copy it down for you later as a friendly gift.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao shook his head, ignoring the second shadowy figure, and instead looked at the third shadowy figure who had a worried expression. Senior number three, is my semi- divine artifact ready? The third shadowy figure stood there, stunned and unresponsive. Senior number three, third brother. The leader of the shadowy figures couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer and shouted, startling the third brother awake. Huh? Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Okay. The third shadowy figure was enveloped in mist as he said evasively, &quot;I&#x27;ve finished making your semi- divine artifact. It&#x27;s this one.&quot; He pulled out a gleaming long sword and handed it to Lyn Sha. This is a weapon made by using a long sword of legendary gold quality as its base and incorporating the mythical angel card. It can cut through iron like mud and is indestructible.</p>
<p>It even contains a trace of divinity, so it can protect you from mental magic, curses, charms, and so on. Only the third shadowy figure hesitated as if he wanted to say something, but then stopped. Just what? Originally, semi- divine artifacts had special effects, but I can&#x27;t enchant this one with skills or special effects right now. So, at the moment, it can only be considered an unparalleled long sword. What? Lyn Sha was taken aback.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the difference between a weapon without any special effects and a fire poker? View properties, unnamed weapon. Quality, mythical, incomplete. Attributes, base attack power, 1550. Special attributes, none. Although this baseline attack power is almost insane.</p>
<p>It really is just a fire poker, Lyn Sha blurted out. Upon hearing this, the third shadowy figure scratched his head sheepishly. I originally wanted to enchant it with a top tier defensive skill like divine descent or holy shield, but the second brother insisted on enchanting me with the blood witch&#x27;s sexual harvest or the succubus absolute charm or at the very least the centur strong body and exceptionally long talent skills saying that you would definitely need them. The third shadowy figure asked, &quot;I&#x27;ve never even heard of that centaur&#x27;s next skill. Thank you so much, Hashan, for your exceptional talent.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia glanced at the smug second in command in black and shook his head helplessly. My elder brother said that it needs to be enchanted with forbidden level destruction magic such as annihilation wound and death finger. The third shadowy figure said, he said that when you draw your sword and prepare to duel with the enemy, and the enemy has already taken a fighting stance. If you suddenly strike the enemy on the head with a death finger, it will definitely have the effect of catching them off guard.&quot; Lyn Sha then looked at the dark-kinned leader who was putting on a serious and aloof expression. Adult times have changed.</p>
<p>Lynsha silently recited the line in his mind. He never expected that the seemingly most composed leader of the shadows would be so unpredictable. The three of us argued endlessly and finally decided to enchant God&#x27;s descent, nutrition, and death finger on them. &quot;Good, very good,&quot; Lyn Sha thought expressionlessly. As a result, the skills conflicted.</p>
<p>All the skills disappeared, and even the swords four-dimensional attribute bonus was gone. The third shadowy figure said, &quot;Later, we tried enchanting other skills, but all of them failed. Sorry, we have no choice but to deliver this semi-finish product to you. At least it&#x27;s quite sharp. You can use it to chop radishes or something.&quot; Lyn Sha suppressed a twitching smile and asked, &quot;You turned a semi-deine artifact into a piece of scrap metal that can&#x27;t be enchanted.</p>
<p>In fact, I feel that this weapon can still be enchanted. I can sense the magical fluctuations. the previous enchanting skills have merged into one and are chaotically attached to the weapon. If there is a skill or effect that happens to match this chaotic state, perhaps this semi- divine artifact will become normal. We&#x27;ve tried thousands of skills and effects and none of them match.</p>
<p>I simply can&#x27;t figure out what to do. So, you can give it a try, the third shadowy figure said earnestly. Me? Lyn Sha smiled. You ancient demons who have lived for thousands of years have tried so many skill effects and none of them match. How would I know what effects they are? A 100 instant kill of someone named Haong.</p>
<p>Ding. Enchantment successful. The unnamed weapon has been enchanted with the effect. 100% chance to instantly kill anyone named Haong. The system has automatically named it Hero Slaying Sword.</p>
<p>Congratulations on obtaining the sword of slaying heroes. Lyn Sha, three dark figures. Are you kidding me? Chapter 1 1612. Shawn by Chian reports for duty and relocates her territory. Lyn Sha picked up the sword of slaying heroes and checked its attributes.</p>
<p>Sword to slay heroes. Quality mythical incomplete. Attributes. Base attack power 1550. Strength + 100.</p>
<p>Spirit plus 100. Constitution plus 100. Soul plus 200. Special attribute 100% chance of killing someone named Hua Xiang. Lin Sha put down the Jean Xang sword without expression.</p>
<p>The three dark figures opposite all had serious expressions. One looked up at the sky and another looked down at his toes. Congratulations, young friend. You have obtained a semi- divine artifact that you have chosen. Looking across the entire blue star, the total number of semi- divine artifacts plus divine artifacts is definitely no more than 10.</p>
<p>You have become one of the most powerful people in the world. The leader of the shadowy figures suppressed a laugh and finally managed to finish speaking. If any of these 10 people is named Huang, then I am the most powerful person in the world. Think positively. Maybe there really is someone named Haong.</p>
<p>Big Brother, there are only two people from Long Shia domain among the holders of the 10 divine artifacts, and neither of them is named Hua Xiang. Nobody in other countries has the surname Hua either. Hey, second brother, why are you stepping on me? Then thank you for your comforting words, Lyn Sha said calmly. The green hills remain unchanged, and the clear waters flow on forever. Farewell.</p>
<p>Just as the leader of the shadowy figures was about to wave his hand, Lynn Shiao suddenly added, &quot;By the way, a demon from the abyss said that Andrea had something important to discuss with me, but I ignored it. I wonder what the relationship is between the seniors and Andrea, so let&#x27;s keep an eye on it.&quot; The leader of the shadowy figures was taken aback, then slowly nodded to indicate that he understood and then waved his sleeve to see Lynn Sha off. In the dense forest of Lnon district, a man dressed entirely in black, his face masked except for his eyes, carrying two Japanese swords, one long and one short, was moving silently. Fumako, one of the four great ninjas dispatched by Kenzo Doora from the Shikoku region. The two regions share borders and apart from some natural barriers and the need to avoid powerful lords guarding the frontiers, there are many areas where travel is unimpeded.</p>
<p>This resulted in people from both regions frequently meeting each other. Kenzo Dohura has been imprisoned, but my superior still ordered me to continue the mission of assassinating Lin Shiao. While stealthily observing his surroundings, Fuma Codoro pondered. Since the discovery of what appears to be traces of Lin Shia in the forbidden zone of the dead, no further clues about him have been found. It feels like a master of disguise or infiltration cleaned up the remaining traces.</p>
<p>Is this person so cautious and cunning? Really a newbie who has just entered the official zone. Just then, thunder rumbled from the distant mountains. A large patch of dark clouds covering half the sky drifted rapidly toward a certain location. Is this a demonic tide? Such a large-scale event, this demonic tide is quite significant. I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s a level 50 or 60 lord leveling up.</p>
<p>Codorofa was about to leave. A possibility suddenly occurred to him. Perhaps it has something to do with Lin Shiao, so he changed direction and stealthily moved into the distance. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s consciousness returned to his territory. He opened his eyes and found himself standing in the war hall holding the semi- divine artifact, the sword of slaying heroes.</p>
<p>Is a semi- divine artifact a joke? Lyn Sha shook his head helplessly. It&#x27;s sharp enough, so apart from those nine divine and semi-deine artifacts, there shouldn&#x27;t be any other weapon that can fight against it. After comforting himself, Lyn Sha walked out of the war hall and encountered Wong Ming and a group of soldiers walking back to their territory. Greetings. Your lordship.</p>
<p>The invading beast tide has been completely wiped out. Lyn Sha nodded. His hero was indeed very capable. The communicator rang and it was Tu Shan by Chian. Lyn Sha connected the call and Tu Shawn by Chian&#x27;s youthful face and busted lowly body appeared on the communication interface wearing animal ears and a white lace Lolita dress.</p>
<p>She still has an adorable innocent look on her face. Brother Lyn Sha, are you surprised? me, the kidney deficiency man, Shun Ningming, and I just finished three books and are now in the main area. Hey, pretty girl. Don&#x27;t call me that nickname. It sounds awful.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s disdainful voice rang out, and his head reappeared on the general selection screen. His dark circles under his eyes still even more pronounced than his smoky eye makeup. Sigh. These flower fairies are still too thirsty. I should make them restrain themselves.</p>
<p>This thought flashed through Linhaos mind. Boss, we&#x27;ve arrived at the official area. What are your orders? I can&#x27;t wait to get started. And then there&#x27;s Chun Ningming, that quiet guy. He can&#x27;t wait to get to work either.</p>
<p>The scene shifts to Chun Ningming, who bows to Lin Shao and says, &quot;Boss Lin Sha.&quot; It turned out that the three of them had just entered the official area and were reporting for duty at the city lord&#x27;s mansion. Brother Lyn Shao Tu Shan by Chin took back the communication interface and said to Lyn Shao, &quot;We are still waiting here for everyone to gather before we go in to report to the city lord.&quot; But the guards and other young lords here seemed to be very polite to us. Tu Shan by Chian leaned closer mysteriously and said, &quot;Following brother Lin Shia is really the right choice. I feel like my status has risen.&quot; He said casually, &quot;Of course, my boss is amazing. He&#x27;s only been in the official zone for a few days, but he&#x27;s already helped the official zone win the resource competition.</p>
<p>The entire Lnon region has received trillions of resource rewards. The city lord generously set aside 30% for public expenses and distributed the rest equally among all officially registered lords in the districts. We just joined and we were allocated tens of thousands of resources, which means we don&#x27;t have to work for a week. It&#x27;s a great deal. In addition, the existence of the luck talisman is enjoyed by all lords, which increases both lifespan and physique, making them strong and healthy.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; Lyn Sha said with a laugh. &quot;The little bit of physical enhancement you gained can&#x27;t outweigh your wasteful spending. Now that everyone&#x27;s here, get to work. I&#x27;ll talk to you again after the audience is over.&quot; The three vassel lords all nodded in agreement, then shut down their communications and went to report to Chu Yusi. After waiting a moment, Lyn Shao sent his precise coordinates via private message and granted access to the three people in his territory.</p>
<p>Soon the portal opened and a white stocking lowly, a school uniform boy and a scarred silent man arrived in Lyn Xiaos territory. Boss, brother Lyn Sha, boss Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha nodded and led the three to the war hall, asking, where do you three place your territories? After the three told him their location, Lynsha pondered for a moment and said, &quot;Let&#x27;s move here and live near my place in Hulu Pass. This location is excellent with abundant resources. The monsters nearby aren&#x27;t too difficult, while there are powerful bosses to challenge within a medium distance.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no one around.&quot; Lyn Sha pointed out several locations on the huge realistic sand table. Although I am more powerful now, I have made more enemies. As my vassal lords, you are likely to be targeted. These are the best positions available. You can consider them.</p>
<p>The three understood that what Lin Sha said was true. So, they decided to return to their territory to relocate. I&#x27;ll cover the relocation costs. Lyn Sha waved his hand and threw in several relocation talismans. Yay, brother.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha is so nice. Tu Shan by Chian rushed over again, hugging Lin Xiaos arm and rubbing against him. Lyn Xiao calmly withdrew his hand again, saying, &quot;The amazing touch and elasticity. Then everyone can get started. After the relocation is complete, I&#x27;ll give you all a big gift.</p>
<p>Chapter 162, Hashau reinforced cement and concrete. A few days later, in the vast hilly terrain of the official district, Lin Shao, Ding Lelay, Tu Shan by Chian, Hiz, and Chuning Ming led heroes and soldiers forming a force of over a thousand people that traverse the mountains. I called you all here today to introduce you to something great, Lyn Sha said. But this requires several materials that the current god system cannot name. So I simply called all of you together so you can recognize these materials and build the wonderful things I&#x27;m talking about on your own.</p>
<p>What is it? Brother Lin Sha Tu Shan by Chin asked hopping and skipping. He a building that can protect you well and is not restricted by territory so it can be built outside the territory. Lynn Sha didn&#x27;t say much and led his troops forward slowly. During this time, he saw Wong Ming, Huubing, and Shin Leong Yu diligently running around, scouting, surveying the terrain, arranging scouts, and reorganizing the troops from time to time. A team exploring another world under the arrangement of a few people is as solid and steadfast as an army on a march.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re here. Lynn Shia nodded as he saw the Rocky Mountain in front of him. This is the first material, limestone. Gentlemen, let&#x27;s begin mining. wild monsters guarding this desolate mountain, nor any indication of mineral veins.</p>
<p>Why would they want to mine these white stones for no reason? But Lyn Xiao&#x27;s mystery and power still led them to choose unconditional obedience. So Pay Min was dragged by Lin Shiao to do hard labor. What? You want me to attack this mountain? Stop talking nonsense. Your Frostorn and Fire Delight are both legendary weapons. What difficulty is there in attacking this kind of mountain? Pay Min was forced to unleash his eastward strike sword technique, which caused rocks to fall continuously.</p>
<p>Several vassal lords also had their own heroes who unleashed some high burst magic and quickly blasted a lot of rocks out of the mountain. Using magic to mine is no less effective than the large machinery in my original world. Lyn Shia nodded with satisfaction. It seems like I found a path to wealth. After the rubble was blasted out, hundreds of farmers and flower fairies joined in.</p>
<p>The golden legend says that the farmer&#x27;s hoe is indestructible. When swung, it leaves only after images and quickly breaks the large stone into gravel. All right, put everyone into the god system warehouse. If there&#x27;s free space to take advantage of, why not take advantage of it? With the logistical hassle gone, Lynn Shiao distributed tens of thousands of tons of crushed stone to everyone for storage. Next, the next target, Clay, to kill monsters of appropriate strength based on the strength of the lords.</p>
<p>His brilliant mind was also working at high speed, managing to train and advance simultaneously. Because of his understanding of wild monsters, the monsters he chose for his vassal lords and himself were just the right strength. Neither too difficult to level up and cause casualties, nor too easy to gain little experience. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s smooth and skillful maneuvers impressed the lords and his heroes, who looked at him with nothing but admiration. We&#x27;ve arrived.</p>
<p>This is the clay soil. Let the farmers dig it up. All the farmers continued working and quickly dug up a large amount of clay. Next, I will demonstrate how to synthesize the materials we need. Lyn Sha took out a piece of iron ore, crushed it into powder, then took out the limestone from before, crushed it into powder, and mixed it with clay powder.</p>
<p>Then, Lyn Sha summoned Oh, Yzi, the master blacksmith, who raised his hand, and a flame shot into the air, leaving Lin Sha speechless. What happened to believing in science? What does it mean that this blacksmith can directly summon spirit fire? Oh, Yzi controlled the flame. First, slowly burning Lin Xiao&#x27;s limestone and clay mixture powder into a molten clinker. Then, it is mixed with iron powder in ground. Finally, a grayish white powder appeared.</p>
<p>This is the new material I&#x27;m going to teach you about, cement. I&#x27;ve learned it. Under the influence of eternal peace and prosperity, continuing the lost learning of the sages, all lords have gained a 5x increase in learning speed. In addition, the method of making cement is not complicated so they can learn it all in one go. But boss, what&#x27;s the use of this thing used for building construction? Why do we have to craft the materials ourselves when we can just prepare the basic materials from the systems list and let the farmers build? He asked in confusion.</p>
<p>Besides, we have many high-grade materials on the battlefield of 10,000 races, such as diamonds, ton wood, and meteorite iron, which are all extremely hard materials. Why not use those materials to build the structures? Will this powder work? Lynsha nodded. In fact, he had discovered this when he first arrived in this world. In the real world of Langsha Kingdom, all buildings were constructed using magic, or rather directly by the power projected by the main god system, the battlefield of all races. The world has gained more convenient things, but has lost traditional and reliable craftsmanship using diamonds, ton wood, and meteorite iron is certainly possible, but can you gather such a massive amount of materials right now? Lynn Sha waved his hand and a design drawing appeared before everyone.</p>
<p>This is a legendary special building. Golden legend quality Hashia Tulu construction blueprint 1. The words Hasha have been censored by Lin Sha. Requirements: 2,000 meteorite iron, 1,000 star moon stone, 1,000 obsidian, 2500 fine wood, 2500 fine stone, 2500 fine iron, 2500 fine copper, 50 aggerwood trunks. Defense 1 million plus.</p>
<p>Damage value, base attack power, 1,000 depending on the number of garrison troops. Special ability one, shelter. Shelter all designated units within a 10 km radius. enhance their defense, provide early warning, and can urgently collect fleeing units. Special skill two, absolute defense.</p>
<p>The Tulu is immune to damage from magic and skills below grade A. Reduces damage from magic and skills above grade A by 80% and reduces all physical damage by 90%. Special skill three, livable. Tulu can be used for designated units to live and provide the ability to resist the dangers of nighttime battles between all races. It can also produce fresh water on its own.</p>
<p>When besieged, morale will not be reduced and the holding time will be increased by 50%. Construction time for 180 hours. Construction requirements golden legendary farmer. Wow, the lords present were all in an uproar. A building of legendary gold quality.</p>
<p>1 million defense points. Absolute defense. He exclaimed in amazement. My three territories plus the walls only have 20,000 defense points. Doesn&#x27;t this mean it&#x27;s more than 50 times stronger than my own house? And it can even attack enemies.</p>
<p>Heay shouted, &quot;I want to move in. I want to move in. My Yaoya needs her own room. This Tulu is indeed a powerful building of legendary quality.&quot; Dinglay however poured cold water on the idea. Unfortunately, the requirements for this building are too demanding and we cannot meet them at present.</p>
<p>Meteorite, star moonstone, and obsidian sell for astronomical prices in the official zone. It would take us several years to accumulate enough to make enough. And agarwood tree trunks, that&#x27;s also a very rare material, etc., &quot;Brother Shia, you mean?&quot; Lyn Sha nodded. Why are we going through all this trouble? Isn&#x27;t it just to replace these materials? Agurwood trunk. I have an agggerwood forest.</p>
<p>Golden legend farmers. I give it to you. Meteorite iron, star moon stone, and obsidian can all be completely replaced with cement, refined stone, and refined iron. That&#x27;s what we call reinforced concrete. Chapter 163.</p>
<p>Sudden danger. The astute Wong Ming. Reinforced cement concrete. The vassel lords repeated the tongue- twisting name, their faces full of confusion. It certainly can&#x27;t compare to the top tier materials from the battlefield of 10,000 races, but at least there&#x27;s plenty of it.</p>
<p>Lynsha chuckled and snapped his fingers. Let&#x27;s build it right here. Then dozens of farmers came to the crowd and mixed the freshlymade cement powder with river sand, spreading it evenly. Several flower fairies continuously summoned water, which was slowly added to the cement powder. In a short time, the desolate countryside became a bustling construction site.</p>
<p>Once the mixture was stirred until it became evenly viscous, several blacksmiths stepped forward, added the special refined stones unique to the battlefield of 10,000 races, and continued stirring. Then, Lynn Sha took out Agurwood as the main beam, refined iron as the steel reinforcement, and all other materials were prepared. Learn the golden legend quality tulu construction blueprint one and master the method of building tulu. Ding. You have learned how to build tulu.</p>
<p>Build the tulu immediately. Ding. Your materials are insufficient. You are missing 2,000 meteorite iron, 1,000 star moon stone, and 1,000 obsidian. Use alternative materials.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha picked up the thoroughly mixed cement and with a flash of white light, the cement was collected and analyzed by the god system. The strength of this alternative material passed the test. Its magical conductivity is weaker, but its toughness is stronger. The main systems assessment, it can be used as a substitute, but the attributes of the tulu will change. Accept.</p>
<p>If accepted, this construction method and material ratio will be added to subsequent tulu construction projects. Except ding. You need 500 ordinary farmers or 350 excellent farmers or 10 legendary gold farmers. Use the golden legendary farmer for construction. Immediately 10 legendary golden farmers came over, brandished their tools, and began construction.</p>
<p>The main god system projected a huge phantom image and the farmers operated it swiftly as if casting a building spell and soaring through the clouds. Construction has begun. But even with Lin Xiao&#x27;s eternal peace which have the time, it still requires 240 hours. In other words, it will take 10 days for this Hasha Tulu to be completed. During this period, Lynn Shiao will use camp runes to ensure that farmers can work at night and will not be swallowed up by the darkness of the battlefield of 10,000 races.</p>
<p>This place happens to be the hub between my territory and yours. So, I built the Tulu here so that we can support each other. Of course, this is also where the largest limestone and clay resources in the area are located, making it convenient for us to mine them at any time. Dinglay added. Building the tulu here also helps to control this resource.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha nodded. Now I will teach you the methods of building tulu. Lyn Shia used the continuing the lost learning of the sages technique to teach everyone the construction methods of the Chinese tulu. He can easily teach the skills he already possesses. Thank you, boss Lin Shiao.</p>
<p>Thank you, brother Lyn Shao. The lords were extremely impressed by Lin Xiao&#x27;s ability to teach them how to build tulu earthn buildings in China. I just asked the god system. If I build the tulu according to my method, the overall attributes will be weaker. The defense value will only be 800,000 and the reduction against magic damage will only be 50%, but the reduction against physical damage will be 95%.</p>
<p>Overall, it&#x27;s still a building with a golden legend, just a few minor weaknesses. Lin Sha was speaking when Wong Ming walked up to him with a serious expression. My lord, I have something important to report. Please feel free to speak. Wong Ming didn&#x27;t speak, but just lowered his head, his face heavy.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao understood Wong Mings character, and Wong Ming knew that the people around him were his most trusted vassel lords. But if even he felt that the vassel lords shouldn&#x27;t hear it, it must be a very important matter. Lyn Sha waved his hand, signaling Ding Lay and the others to step back. My lord, we have lost a faceless one. Um, Lyn Sha became alert.</p>
<p>How did he die? He quickly checked his panel and sure enough, the Faceless Ones column read 19. The Faceless Ones are epic units with combat power equivalent to well-known monsters such as Nest Demons, Abyss Demons, and Cyclops at the same level. Most importantly, they were elite spies created by the demon princess Andrea. They were cunning, unpredictable, and cautious by nature. The Faceless Ones can also transform into any human form.</p>
<p>The evidence Lin Sha recently obtained of Sakura Shichurro and Roland&#x27;s brutal massacre of their own kind was filmed by a faceless one who infiltrated Japanese territory. After the deed was done, all 20 faceless men returned unharmed. And now on the vast wilderness of the Lan district, a faceless one has actually died. The matter has not yet been fully investigated,&quot; Wong Ming said in a low voice. &quot;But I have reason to suspect that a master has infiltrated our vicinity.&quot; Lyn Xiaos eyes suddenly narrowed.</p>
<p>When the main force came out to search for new mineral veins, General Huatubing, General Chin Leang Yu, and I arranged for the White Spear soldiers to guard and keep watch on the perimeter while the Faceless Ones patrolled and kept watch for dozens of kilometers around. Their squad leaders contact each other every 30 minutes, and the Faceless One had already disappeared when they last contacted him. The team members communication indicated that he had been killed in action and the squad leader could not find his body. Wong Ming spoke rapidly. I already know about the lord&#x27;s deeds.</p>
<p>The heavenly people organization and the upper echelons of the four kingdoms region all want to kill the lord. Therefore, I suspect that a high-ranking lord or hero has already infiltrated the area. Lynn Sha remained calm. He slowly stroked his chin, his mind racing, and said slowly. Bowsi&#x27;s concealment skills are still intact.</p>
<p>All my teleportation portals are blocked. Before we take action, we use the celestial perspective to confirm that there are no lords within a radius of nearly 1,000 km. How did the enemy find us? Wong Mang, my subordinate suspects that the demonic tide was too intense and was observed. It should have arrived nearby, but it has not yet determined our location. Perhaps it wasn&#x27;t confirmed that it was me.</p>
<p>They must be here for you, Lord. Didn&#x27;t you see someone break into the forbidden zone in the war hall earlier? That person was incredibly stealthy and left no useful traces, but his destination, the forbidden zone of the dead, is obvious. Lyn Sha nodded in agreement. Wong Mings observation, memory, and comprehensive analytical abilities were indeed impressive. We can&#x27;t open the portal and go back directly now.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the enemy will roam around nearby and eventually find my base. Our only option might be to take him down. Wong Ming, do you think the opponent is strong? My lord, even a lion must go all out to hunt a rabbit. There are no level restrictions in the official zone, but lords above level 100 are mostly engaged in expeditions outside. The enemy is a lion, and we are rabbits.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha interjected. But the enemy hates us to the bone. So naturally, they won&#x27;t send us a barely strong experience boost like in a novel. Wong Ming said, &quot;Therefore, I believe that it is not an exaggeration to overestimate it no matter what.&quot; Lynn Sha summoned Pay Min. Can you kill a level 40 plus Faceless One silently without him sending any information? Pay Min pondered for a moment.</p>
<p>Understanding the Faceless One&#x27;s specialties. No, killing the Faceless One is not difficult, but preventing him from sending out telepathic communications is. Lyn Sha nodded. The enemy&#x27;s strength is at least equivalent to a powerful level 70 hero. Huh? How did you calculate that? Pay was surprised.</p>
<p>Paymen is over level 40, but he can fight against level 70. If Payman can&#x27;t do that, then the enemy is stronger than him. payment. Although it feels a bit off, I&#x27;ll just take it as the Lord praising me. Chapter 164 countermeasures powerful ninjas exposure.</p>
<p>I think we need to raise the threat level of the enemy a bit. Let us say they are stealth assassins with a minimum level of 70 and a maximum level of 100. Wong Ming tugged at his beard, his expression still anxious. You&#x27;re right. This is the strongest enemy I&#x27;ve encountered since entering the battlefield of myriad races.</p>
<p>There are no level restrictions, no suppression, only naked killing intent toward me, Lyn Sha said. And it&#x27;s impossible for us to reach level 70 in the short term. The good news is that the other party should only be one person. The traces observed in the forbidden zone of the dead only show the trajectory of one person. with a numerical advantage and playing on our home turf.</p>
<p>We might still have a glimmer of hope. If his name were Haong, he wouldn&#x27;t be afraid at all. Lyn Sha thought to himself with a self-deprecating smile. Unfortunately, the other party was clearly sent by the Celestials or the Japanese. So, the possibility was zero.</p>
<p>Hands in a fist salute. My lord, I suggest that we take immediate action to intercept and kill this scoundrel before he can figure out our actual situation. Oh, you already have a plan. Exactly. Somewhere in the Eastern Kingdom, an elderly ninja knelt on a Tatama mat, leisurely drinking tea.</p>
<p>The communication rang and the elderly ninja slowly opened his eyes. After seeing who it was, a hint of somnity appeared in his eyes. Lord Haidtojo, the voice on the other end was authoritative. Why has Fumako still not achieved anything? Has your ninja lordship truly fallen? Or is it that this commission was made by Kenzo Dohara and now that he&#x27;s imprisoned, you&#x27;re just sherking your responsibilities? Faced with the interrogation, the elderly ninja chuckled and said, &quot;Prime Minister, please calm down. That Lynn Shiao is indeed too cunning.</p>
<p>Even one of my four strongest ninjas has to admit his prowess.&quot; Oh, instead of trying to find a solution, you&#x27;re praising the enemy. Your excellency, please trust our expertise. Fumodoro has been infiltrating the Rhinan district for 2 weeks, but we only recently made a breakthrough. Explain. There must be a master of stealth or disguise around Lynsha.</p>
<p>In addition, he is cautious, cunning, and suspicious by nature. After finding a few traces of the forbidden zone of the dead, Fumako has made no further progress. Prime Minister, please calm down, but lords all need to be upgraded. Yesterday, Fumodoro observed a giant demonic tide in the wilderness of the reunion region, which is how he obtained a clue. Demonic tide? You mean Lynn Sha upgraded to level four in less than half a month after entering the official server? Exactly.</p>
<p>Only people like that are qualified to be our opponents. A hint of smuggness flashed in the old ninja&#x27;s eyes. It&#x27;s a pity that his genius was both his strength and his weakness. It was because of the dark cloud of the demonic tide that he was exposed and Fumako found a faceless one who had planted a sentry nearby. The Faceless One.</p>
<p>Tojo Hideki&#x27;s tone became more forceful. That&#x27;s right, the Faceless One. Although the Faceless One is powerful, a level 40 Faceless One is still too weak in front of the level 85 Fumakoto. Hideaki Tojo said, &quot;When Lynn Shiao defeated those fools from the celestial realm, he used the faceless ones. These are epic units of the demon race, and very few people are qualified to recruit them.&quot; The elderly ninja couldn&#x27;t help but smile slightly.</p>
<p>So, Lyn Shiao is nearby. Now that the centuries have been found, why haven&#x27;t we found Lin Sha yet? Your excellency, that&#x27;s why I praised Lyn Sha. He is too cunning. The Faceless Ones have telepathic communication. So the wind demon has no choice but to kill him with one blow.</p>
<p>But Prime Minister, rest assured, within 3 days, Fumakodoro will be able to search this area of tens of thousands of square kilm, find Lin Sha, and then kill this fiend. The voice on the other end sounded satisfied. One of the four great ninjas at level 85. If he can&#x27;t even take down a level 40 lord, he might as well commit Sepuku in a heartbeat. That&#x27;s inevitable.</p>
<p>This is the best plan I can think of right now. Wong Mang said, &quot;If any of you have better strategies or additions, please bring them up.&quot; Hitsubing and Chin Leong Yu exchanged a glance and shook their heads. &quot;No more.&quot; Pay Min shrugged. &quot;Anyway, no matter who comes up with the strategy, I&#x27;ll still have to fight the enemy one- on-one. I&#x27;ll save my energy for fighting and not think about it anymore.</p>
<p>Lynn Shia, that&#x27;s because all you know how to do is fight. After saying that, he turned to Baoi and asked, &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Ba shook her head. I have no problem. Lyn Shia then looked at Dinglay. I haven&#x27;t even had a chance to show off with you yet, but I already need to use you.</p>
<p>Dinglay laughed. Fortune favors the bold. Besides, I&#x27;m just playing a supporting role. The one who truly decides the outcome is you, Shia. Go.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao nodded and looked at everyone. This will be very dangerous, but we have no choice but to do it. I have already arranged for Tu Shawn by Chin and the others who are not very strong to leave quickly. Wong Ming has done everything he can to utilize available resources, but there will definitely be losses in some units. I just hope that you can all return safely.</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern, Lord. Don&#x27;t worry, brother. Shiao. Fumodoro stealthily moved about, carrying two Japanese swords, one long and one short, and occasionally using secret techniques to observe his surroundings. He was certain that Lyn Sha was nearby, but the official area was too vast, and the location Lyn Sha had chosen was in a desolate wilderness.</p>
<p>Even though he saw the dark clouds passing by the demonic tide, he could only roughly confirm the direction. But that was enough for him to encounter the Faceless Ones under Lin Xiao&#x27;s command if it weren&#x27;t for the complete level advantage. Codor Fulma wouldn&#x27;t have been confident of easily killing the Faceless One. The demon star Andrea is indeed quite skilled. If I hadn&#x27;t ambushed and killed the Faceless One with a cany and quickly followed up with a Kai slash, he would have spotted me in the next second.</p>
<p>Codor Fuma pondered silently. The Faceless Ones are truly born centuries, possessing telepathic communication capabilities, and even their sentry range is so vast. He had searched hundreds of kilometers, but had not encountered another faceless one or any other clues about Lin Sha. I will not give up. Hey, Gamat.</p>
<p>Just as he was trying to cheer himself up, Fumako suddenly heard a faint voice talking in the distance. The atmosphere was low and subdued as if they were having a secret conversation. Something&#x27;s up. Fuma Codoro immediately perked up, formed hand seals, cast dozens of ninjutsu spells on himself, drew his katana, and slowly crept over to investigate. Upon getting closer, Fumoro realized that they were a group of level 70 or so nolles.</p>
<p>Baka, that&#x27;s not the target. Fuma Codoro cursed under his breath and prepared to leave. Baka, not the target. His own curses, however, rang out like thunder. The nullles moved swiftly and accurately with the lead wolf letting out a furious roar and firing wildly towards the source of the sound.</p>
<p>Codorofa throws out Kana in retaliation. After a fierce battle, the jackal was easily defeated and Codoruma only broke out in a light sweat, tearing a small section of his clothing. What was that sound just now? Why was my voice amplified? Fumoro continued his search and soon he smelled a different scent. When he went to investigate, he stepped on a dead branch and was attacked by more than 20 cannibals. After defeating the cannibal, Codor Fuma sustained minor injuries.</p>
<p>Over the next few tens of minutes, Fuma Codoro encountered several more waves of wild monsters that inexplicably discovered his presence. After the fierce battle, Codoruma was panting heavily and had sustained some injuries. Baka, I&#x27;ve been exposed. Someone&#x27;s playing a trick on me. Chapter 165 times almost up.</p>
<p>Codor Fuma thought of when he sensed something was wrong was to retreat. As a renowned ninja who had been in the industry for many years, he never took risks when he felt it was dangerous. As long as I escape, I&#x27;ll have plenty of opportunities to return with other strong reinforcements to continue the search. Anyway, Lynn Sha can&#x27;t escape. If his Japanese portal hadn&#x27;t been restricted in the Long Nan region, he would have immediately opened it and escaped back.</p>
<p>Fumo immediately set off, fleeing back the way he came. The trees on both sides rushed past as he pushed his movement technique to its limit. Suddenly his footing gave way and Codoro Fumo was startled. Trap. Fuma.</p>
<p>Codoro stepped into a deep pit and fell rapidly to the bottom where sharp weapons lay. The pit was wide and smooth and with nowhere to grab onto, Codoro Fuma could only watch helplessly as he fell in and was pierced by a sharp weapon. With a poof, Fumodoro s figure appeared on an open ground dozens of meters away, leaving only a straw doll in the deep pit. Damn it, there are even purely physical traps. Fumako cursed.</p>
<p>Having fought on the battlefield of all races for many years, he had mostly encountered magic or skill-based traps. His magic resistance and physical instincts had long since adapted to them. &quot;This was entirely my fault,&quot; Codorma thought to himself. From now on, I&#x27;ll have to take you guys seriously. Then Codor Fuma quickly changed direction and fled.</p>
<p>When I get serious, no trap can fool me. Another section of rope was lightly touched by Fuma Codoro, who immediately rolled away to dodge, avoiding the range of the subsequent trap attacks. A mere trifling skill. Codor Fuma could even feel smug. A dozen bearmen behind him, awakened by the trap, glared angrily at him.</p>
<p>Ninja art. Invisibility technique. Unwilling to waste time and energy, the ninja immediately used invisibility techniques to avoid the bear man. Holding his breath and taking a detour. But after walking only a few hundred meters, they triggered another trap, waking up several king cobras.</p>
<p>Fumoro drew his katana and flashed past, slicing the king cobra into several pieces. Your trap laying skills are quite good. However, as long as you set a trap, you will leave a flaw. I have already discovered you. With a loud shout, Fumako launched a surprise ninja attack, instantly advancing hundreds of meters to spot a sneaky figure.</p>
<p>Huh? The figure had a beautiful face, a slender figure, and a curvaceous body. It was surrounded by only some green leaves, and a pair of translucent wings were slowly fluttering. A flower fairy. How could such a weak creature be the maker of a trap? The flower fairy was startled by the sudden attack of the wind demon Codoro and instinctively threw out poisonous seeds to retaliate. With a casual swift movement, Codor Fuma cleaved the flower fairy in two, showing no mercy whatsoever, and blood splattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Uh, Yao Yao is dead. The flower fairy exploded on the spot, and Fumoro was splashed with a trace of blood. The exploding flower fairy is just a flower fairy. The one who&#x27;s really lying in ambush for me is someone else. Codor Fumo once again used his ninjutsu to charge forward only to find himself in the territory of a tree spirit.</p>
<p>A thousand-year-old tree spirit slowly opened its eyes and its vines suddenly lunged forward. Fuma Codoro dodged and counterattacked in a sorry state, spending quite a bit of time to kill the tree spirit. After all that back and forth, he hadn&#x27;t found Lin Xiao&#x27;s trail and had instead exposed himself. When he tried to escape back, he was lured into the wilderness by traps and flower fairies. And Fuma Codoro ser flared up.</p>
<p>Baka, are you kidding me? Lyn Sha, come out and face your death. Fight me like a man. What kind of genius lord only knows how to use underhanded tactics? You can&#x27;t defeat me by just relying on monsters and traps. There is no monster in this wilderness that can defeat me. Before he could finish speaking, Codor Fuma&#x27;s foot slipped again, nearly falling into a new trap.</p>
<p>He quickly swung out his grappling hook and escaped. Then another wave of enraged monsters charged up and angrily engaged in battle with the ninjas who had disturbed their rest. In the distance, Ba, hidden beneath the forest witch&#x27;s cloak, held her breath in tension, only slowly wiping away her sweat. An hour later, Codor Fuma finally figured out the ambush tactics and patterns. He was no longer troubled by the outdated but surprisingly effective physical traps, nor did he disturb the wild monsters anymore.</p>
<p>As a result, his speed increased significantly. A figure reappeared ahead and the faint sound of singing drifted over. Fuma Codoro cautiously approached. He discovered that they were actually a large group of flower fairies. The leading flower fairy was playing an ancient musical instrument and singing a ballot.</p>
<p>The remaining flower fairies sat cross-legged on the ground, swaying their bodies to the rhythm of the song. What should have been a harmonious and natural scene appeared somewhat eerie to Codor Fuma. Fuma Codoro Esatana was dripping with blood and his face was full of murderous intent. These flower fairies must be related to Lin Sha. The fact that they dared to swagger in front of him now meant that there might be a new trap.</p>
<p>Use Ninjutsu. Fumako used his aerial vision to survey his surroundings, confirming there were no ambushes. He then carefully prepared a straw doll in his arms before slowly approaching. Once I wandered aimlessly on the dark road, the breeze stings my soul. I can&#x27;t find my way.</p>
<p>The flower fairy captain had already seen Fuma Codoro, but she was not afraid at all and continued to sing healing and warm songs. Fuma Codoros gaze turned cold, and with a flash of his blade, a flower fairy sitting and listening to music was decapitated. Baka, I&#x27;m giving you one minute to tell me where Lin Sha is. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t will end up like her. No flower fairy paid him any attention.</p>
<p>He continued singing and swaying his body. A gentle breeze stinging my soul. I can&#x27;t find my way. It&#x27;s almost time. Fumako said grimly.</p>
<p>The song continued. How many tears are needed to complete this journey of life. 10 9 8 7 3 2 1 Flower Fairy. May I look forward to flying together in the distant sky to newly created beings? Baka Fuma Codoro stepped forward, a cold smile on his face, and brandished his katana. One slash, the flower demon was killed.</p>
<p>Another slash, a flower fairy fell. Codoro Fuma slashed and killed flower fairies one after another while his singing continued unabated. Life&#x27;s journey is so long and I crave your smile to complete it. Baka Fumakoro got carried away with the killing and became covered in blood. In the end, all the flower fairies were killed and he came before the flower fairy squad leader.</p>
<p>Are you still going to sing or not? The flower fairy squad leader, fearless and with I&#x27;ll sing written all over her face, defiantly looked at Fuma Codoro and sang, &quot;Life is such a journey, I crave your smile to complete it. Open the door of freedom for me. Take my hand, new creation.&quot; With a flash of light, Fuma Codoro finished off the flower fairy squad leader and turned to leave. I am Fuma Codoro. Lyn Shiao, get out here right now.</p>
<p>The roar came from afar. Chapter 166. Stopping Codoro Fuma at all costs. After slaughtering all the flower fairies, Fuma Codoro suddenly roared. He couldn&#x27;t stand those flower fairies seemingly bewitched, deathdeying attitude, stretching out their necks like ducks for him to slaughter.</p>
<p>Finally, the flower fairy captain looked at him strangely. Even though her life was in his hands, she still had a smug look on her face. This enraged Codor Fuma, who couldn&#x27;t help but roar out in anger. Bakayeru, these flower fairies are working without fear of death. This is a cult.</p>
<p>You think your head will grow back after you cut it off? Fuma Codoro knew that as an assassin, he should retreat quickly if he was exposed before even getting close to his target. He shouldn&#x27;t linger in the fight, much less roar and declare war. He shook his head, feeling that his emotions had indeed been quite volatile today. Maintain the original plan. We will withdraw and return to take revenge another day.</p>
<p>We cannot let our emotions control us anymore. Fuma Codoro turned to leave, his resolve even stronger this time. However, as soon as I turned around, I heard a commotion behind me. A huge wave of monsters surged toward Fuma Codoro s location. Flower fairy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the flower fair&#x27;s flesh and blood that attracted the predators in the wilderness. Codor Fuma understood the reason. He quickly used ninjutsu to wash himself clean and conceal his scent and form. He decided to bypass the monster horde and avoid unnecessary battles. However, although his idea was good, some people prevented him from having his way.</p>
<p>A pebble struck Fuma Codoro precisely, leaving a strong aura of flower fairy flesh and blood on his body. Um, monsters swarmed in, but Codor Fuma used his ninjutsu to charge left and right, slaying them. In the heat of the battle, Codor Fuma suddenly left a clone behind, then teleported to the spot where he had thrown the pebble and slashed down with his sword. when a loud crash was heard and the knife was blocked. Fumako saw a burly man nearly 2 m tall with a broad back and thick waist covered in elaborate iron armor.</p>
<p>Even his face was covered with an iron mask. The burly man held a giant blade more than 3 m long. The blade gleaming coldly. It was with this blade that he had just caught his own attack. was knocked back more than 10 steps by a single blow from Fumoro before he finally stopped and then immediately charged out again.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s interesting. Fumodoro watched helplessly as the burly man charged towards him, his giant blade slashing down on him. Clang. He raised his Japanese sword and easily blocked the strong man&#x27;s full force attack. That&#x27;s not bad.</p>
<p>Probably around level 50 or 60 in terms of strength, but it&#x27;s still not enough against me. Before he could finish speaking, the burly man swiftly swung his sword down again. Fumodoro hastily drew his short Japanese sword to block the attack. When Baka, your skills are shameless. Which hero of Lin Sha are you? I am merely a soldier.</p>
<p>The burly man spoke in a deep booming voice, his long-handled broadsword slashing incessantly. Each strike sending sparks flying everywhere. Little soldier, do you think I&#x27;m an idiot or has my brain gone mad from listening to too much music? Fumo was furious. Despite the level difference, he was still able to kill the monsters in no time. Even though he was facing the Modo Dao Iron Guard in front of him and several wild monsters chasing after him, he then struck the Mod Dao Iron Guard with a cany.</p>
<p>The armor of the burly man in front of him was split open, revealing another layer of chain mail underneath, and the cany only went in halfway before getting stuck. It&#x27;s useless. No amount of armor can help against absolute power. Although I admit you&#x27;re tough, Fuma Codoro narrowed his eyes. Fire release.</p>
<p>Great fireball technique. A sudden burst of flames erupted from the burly man&#x27;s body, causing him to sway before collapsing heavily to the ground. A humble man fighting for his country has no regrets even in death. The strong man died. Oomph.</p>
<p>He can be considered a samurai. If your level weren&#x27;t so low, you might be able to fight me. Fuma Codoro planned to leave with a whoosh. A crossbow bolt shot out, but Codor Fuma dodged it by tilting his head. He immediately spotted his target.</p>
<p>Another soldier dressed like a tin can. Are all of Lin Xiao&#x27;s men this cowardly? They only dare to hide behind their armor. Fuma Codoro rushed out, changing his form to dodge the crossbow bolts three times in a row. You&#x27;re dead once I get close. One strike through the wind.</p>
<p>What? Despicable. Fumodoro almost fell into the trap again. It turns out that Lyn Xiao&#x27;s people never intended to duel him. Whoosh! The arrow flew past and the ninja in midair barely managed to adjust his body, but was still hit in the arm by the crossbow bolt and blood splattered. Ninja art damage transfer.</p>
<p>Fumodoro transferred the damage directly to the head of a monster chasing him and the monster died instantly lying face up. Having escaped the trap, Fumako finally reached the tin can. Die you coward. Bang. What? Suddenly, the man in the tin can pulled out a horizontal knife and actually caught the blow he was about to receive.</p>
<p>Codor Fuma also carefully examined the man. Are you Lin Xiao&#x27;s hero? The lowly are merely soldiers. Fuma Codoro shook his head, picked up his katana, and once again engaged the tin can in battle. Less than 30 seconds later, the ninja suddenly stabbed a shuriken through the gap in the tin can&#x27;s eye, and the tin can fell to the ground dead without uttering a sound. They can be considered a formidable unit.</p>
<p>Codorofa was about to leave. Another arrow came flying. Will this ever end? On the other end was a phantom shooter wearing overalls. Wearing overalls is a weird trend you brought. Women in my great Japan are wearing them.</p>
<p>Damn it. Wearing that stuff is so inconvenient. Oh no, it&#x27;s so unattractive. NO Riri Fuma Codoro swiftly and decisively defeated the phantom archer. I can&#x27;t let them lead me by the nose anymore.</p>
<p>I have to leave immediately. Codor Fuma felt his physical strength was declining drastically. His substitute straw doll, life-saving tools, and ninjutsu reserves were almost all used up in the few hours of fighting wild monsters and escaping traps. But then another wave of monsters blocked his path. As Codorum was about to leave with his woodrelease clone, he turned a corner and was blocked by two burly men with bare arms, each wielding a long spear.</p>
<p>Without a word, the man with the long spear thrust forward while Fumodoro threw a canai that slashed both of their arms. The poison causing them to collapse instantly. Using a single sword to break a spear is too troublesome, but I&#x27;m an expert in using poison. The sound of hooves clattered as several cavalrymen spotted Codoro Fuma and immediately fired. Fuma Codoro released his clones for close combat and within minutes both he and his clones perished.</p>
<p>These troops are only around level 50, right? Their strength is almost level 60. What&#x27;s wrong with me? Lyn Sha has only been in the official zone for a short time. How come he has level 60 troops? Could it be that he has powerful reinforcements and that&#x27;s not working? My head is getting dizzy. Fumakodoro stumbled and fled. Whenever he killed a monster in front of him and prepared to speed up, there was always an armored greatswordsman, a crossbowman, a knight, or a barbarian spearman blocking his way.</p>
<p>Along with them came traps that were difficult to guard against. Fuma Codoro could only fight with all his might to kill the enemy. But his head was getting dizzier and dizzier, and finally he spat out a mouthful of blood. Baka, it&#x27;s a flower demon. I&#x27;ve been poisoned by the flower demon.</p>
<p>That song is poisonous. The song itself isn&#x27;t poisonous. The poison is the drug that causes trapping, a type of drug used to induce convulsions. A voice drifted from afar. Chapter 167.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha appears. A sword comes from the east. As the voice faded, a figure slowly appeared. It was Lin Sha. He was dressed in dark armor, holding a long sword.</p>
<p>He was tall and slender with a straight posture and a handsome sculpted face. But at this moment, his face only showed sorrow and resentment. On either side of him followed two generals, one in gold and one in silver, both clad in armor. The golden armored general had a face like jade, fair skin, and clear features. He wore golden armor and a silver fur trimmed cloak, looking majestic and awe inspiring.</p>
<p>The silver armored general was a female warrior draped in a bright red cloak exuding a heroic and unparalleled beauty. Thought Fumodoro. Lyn Shiao, it really is you. You actually dare to show up? Fumodoro sneered calmly stood up and watched Lin Sha slowly approach. You wanted to kill me and here I am.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha said slowly, his face cold. Anyway, even if a highle ninja like you tracks me down, I can&#x27;t escape, can I? Fumauro burst into laughter, feeling extremely pleased. The frustration of being toyed with by Lyn Sha for the past few hours was swept away. You do have some self-awareness, Lyn Sha. When you humiliated Japan and Kenzo Dohurra, the outcome was already predetermined.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll find you sooner or later. You can hide today, but you can&#x27;t hide tomorrow. Come on, fight me like a real man, and I&#x27;ll give you a glorious death. Glory. Duel? Is the duel you&#x27;re talking about fair? Lyn Sha slowly said, &quot;I&#x27;m only level 43.&quot; Haha, young man.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no such thing as fairness in this world. You&#x27;re level 43. I&#x27;m level 85. Just wait. You&#x27;re only level 43.</p>
<p>So, your greatsword units, cavalry archers, armored infantry, and spearmen are all around level 40. Lynh Xiao&#x27;s face was so dark it looked like it was about to drip water. Exactly. Such combat power at level 43. I thought it was an epic unit at level 50 or 60.</p>
<p>Fumodoro was shocked for a second. Then his expression turned extremely dangerous and sinister. He muttered to himself. This young man is incredibly strong and his troops are unexpectedly powerful. My previous estimate was wrong.</p>
<p>I reckon he has legendary troops under his command. Five legendary unit types. Lyn Sha is only in his 40s and he already has five legendary unit types. This child must not be allowed to live. What are you muttering to yourself over there? Lyn Shao said coldly.</p>
<p>Have you forgotten what I just said? Fumakuro was taken aback. Why was he talking to himself? He had always thought that what he was thinking in his heart had turned into talking to himself. Then another wave of dizziness hit. Oh no, it&#x27;s poison. Baka Lyn Shao, you are despicable and shameless.</p>
<p>You actually poison me. If you have the guts, fight me face to face. What kind of fairness is this? Poisoning me like this. Huh? Old people, there&#x27;s no fairness in this world. Lyn Sha returned the words to Fuma Codoro verbatim.</p>
<p>The ninja snorted coldly, enduring his physical discomfort. When exactly did you poison me? Why did I get infected even with my high poison resistance? It&#x27;s very simple. It&#x27;s when you killed the flower fairy, Lynn Shiao said coldly. All the flower fairies have ingested the entangling poison, a highly poisonous substance that has entered their bloodstream. When you kill them, the poison will be sprayed onto you.</p>
<p>What? If I don&#x27;t kill them, they&#x27;re doomed anyway. Of course, Lyn Sha said frankly, Baka, you pervert. You used your own men as bait to poison me. I dare not accept such praise. Compared to you who kill your own people just to win the resource race, you are still slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao said, &quot;My troops, my Mod Dao iron guards, divine arm archers, White Spear soldiers, great Han Champion cavalry, and Guan Ning iron cavalry all sacrificed themselves for the greater good. I will settle this score with you sooner or later.&quot; What a strange name. Is this Lyn Xiao&#x27;s real name? Aren&#x27;t you afraid I&#x27;ll reveal it by saying this name? Don&#x27;t worry. The dead can&#x27;t talk. You call me a dead man.</p>
<p>Come at me if you dare, you idiot. Codorofa leaped up and unleashed a swift I eye slash at Lyn Shao. The strike missed its mark. Lyn Xiaos figure stood much further away from him. It was poison.</p>
<p>The poison made me lose my sense of distance. Without giving Fuma Codoro time to think, Lyn Shao waved his hand, and more than a dozen archers appeared, raising their giant crossbows and firing a volley. Fuma Cottoaro used ninjutsu to dodge, further depleting his already limited chakra energy. Ahead, a dozen or so iron guards with long swords formed a human wall to block codoruma s attack route. To the side, a dozen or so white pole spearmen thrust their spears to block codoruma as flanks.</p>
<p>The sound of hooves came from behind again, and the Guan Ning cavalry opened fire immediately. The gunpowder struck the ninja, sending a cloud of blood mist flying. Fumako used a forbidden technique to kill three mo Dao iron guards, break through the human wall, and rush towards Lyn Shao. Generals, one with gold and one with silver, attacked together with lightning speed. Fumodoro suddenly stopped, turned around, and slashed twice, one to the left and one to the right, knocking the two generals away.</p>
<p>Now that only Lin Sha was standing in front of him, Fuma Codoro revealed a smug smile. Just then, Lyn Shao raised his hand and unleashed a sword strike. This sword strike was like the Milky Way pouring down, like countless stars descending upon the earth. This sword strike came rushing towards us like a meteor streaking across the sky or a blazing sun falling. A sword comes from the east.</p>
<p>Fuma Codoro dodged and attacked simultaneously, pushing his movement technique to its limit. I never expected that the most powerful one here would be Lin Shia. You little rascal. That sword strike was impressive enough, but your level is too low. You still can&#x27;t hurt me.</p>
<p>While still in midair, the poison took effect again. He coughed up a mouthful of black blood, felt the world spin, and plummeted straight down. Ninja art soul burning technique. Codor Fuma activated his secret technique once again. As a renowned highle ninja, he still had a way to save his life.</p>
<p>Go to hell, Lynsha. The secret technique has a limited time limit, and Fuma Codoro planned to finish the battle quickly. But at this moment, Lyn Shao raised his hand again and assumed the starting stance of the sword strike from before. Fumako was startled and prepared to dodge again. Sure enough, a dazzling sword strike appeared once again, piercing right through Fuma Codoro.</p>
<p>How is that possible? Fuma Codoro muttered to himself as his body shattered into several pieces and exploded. Then a new figure appeared from not far away, spitting out several mouthfuls of black blood and tried to run away without looking back. The sword light flashed again, following closely behind Fumako. When did Lin Sha become so amazing? Huh? It&#x27;s you, the mysterious hero in white. Fumako yelled that he was now seriously injured, had used up all his life-saving and survival items, and had also used up his stand.</p>
<p>Moreover, even though he used a substitute, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s so-called deadly poison still clung to him, making him dizzy and causing his fighting ability to drop drastically once again. His limbs also began to twitch. This poison actually acted on the nervous system first and then on the muscles. Facing this whiteclad hero who could kill the sword saint e fumodoro believed that he currently heavily injured had no chance of winning. Chapter 168 level 43 versus level 85 victory.</p>
<p>Fumako threw out a smoke bomb and changed direction to sneak away. But in just a moment, his stealth was exposed, and he was located again, stained with a blood red mark. Baka, he lowered his head and charged forward, only to be blocked by a wall of mo Dao iron guards. Get out of the way. After several surprise attacks, even the seriously injured Fumodoro couldn&#x27;t break through the defenses of the Emo Dao iron guard.</p>
<p>He used his speed to change direction and encountered another swordsman dressed similarly to the whiteclad hero. The swordsman swiftly drew his sword and exchanged several blows with Fumakodoro. The whiteclad hero caught up and Fumakodoro, unable to kill the swordsman for the time being, had no choice but to continue his escape. An arrow flew in and pierced Fuma Codoro s shoulder. He no longer had the strength to use damage transfer.</p>
<p>Bang! Another gunshot rang out, the three-eyed musket splattering directly at the ninja. He tried his best to dodge to the side, then suddenly jumped up, leaping onto the horse and knocking the Guan Ning cavalry down. He then jumped onto the horse himself. Fumodoro grabbed the reigns and prepared to leave on the Guan Ning iron cavalry&#x27;s horse. At that moment, the knight who had fallen to the ground got up, drew his long sword, and cut off his beloved horse&#x27;s leg with one stroke.</p>
<p>Damn it. Fuma Codoro shot a shuriken which pierced the eye of a Guan Ning cavalryman. The knight, in a fit of rage, continued to charge forward, brandishing his long sword. But after taking two steps, his face turned purple and he collapsed and died. Bang! Bang! A small squad of Guan Ning cavalry appeared and opened fire simultaneously.</p>
<p>The three-eyed musketss rained down on the corpses of the ninja and his comrades behind him, firing with a series of crackling sounds. Fumoto was hit by more than a dozen bullets, spitting out black blood. He threw out several shuriken, but the Guan Ning cavalry opposite him neither dodged nor avoided them. They raised their arms to protect their faces and charged forward fearlessly with their spears. Clang, clang, clang.</p>
<p>Several knights fell from their horses, and the remaining knights lances pierced half an inch into the body of Fumodoro before stopping. Fumako struck several knights, their blood splattering everywhere. The remaining knights continued to wield their heavy three-eyed musketss, slamming them down on Fumao. The sound of arrows cutting through the air came from afar. The archers with divine crossbows in the distance had already locked onto the enemy who was fighting with the Guan Ning iron cavalry and kept firing crossbow bolts.</p>
<p>The ninja was hit by several arrows in just a moment. Baka Fumodoro still had his last bit of strength left. He used his secret technique again and with a loud bang sent all the Guan Ning cavalry in front of him flying. Pay Min finally arrived, raising his hand to unleash a streak of light that shot straight toward the ninja. Flash, flash.</p>
<p>Codor Fuma frantically urged his consciousness, but he was still pierced by the streak of light and half of his arm was neatly severed off. Black blood gushed out and Fuma Codoro used the blood as a catalyst to unleash blood escape. Two swordsmen arrived, their swords flashing, piercing through Fuma Codoro s body, but he had already escaped. The swordsman thrust at the flowing black blood, but it had no effect. Black blood quickly burrowed into the ground about to escape.</p>
<p>Just because I used sword comes from the east doesn&#x27;t mean I only have one sword technique. Pay Min sneered. Japanese prepare to die. Sacrifice oneself to break through thoughts is activated. Burning life force using lost essence as a catalyst enhances one&#x27;s combat power.</p>
<p>For every 1% of life lost, one gains 2% more strength and spirit. Upon breaking through the barrier, one detonates the attacks paying men has inflicted on the enemy, causing massive damage. As soon as the sacrifice to break mind was activated, the body of Fumako on the ground and the black blood on the ground immediately exploded into a burst of light. Boom! Fumako was blasted out in a sorry state covered in blood with one arm severed, one leg blown off and deep bone revealing wounds on his abdomen and chest where his internal organs already blackened could be vaguely seen. He no longer had the strength to stand up.</p>
<p>All around the MO Dao iron guards, white pole spear soldiers, Guan Ning iron cavalry, great Han Champion cavalry, divine arm archers, and unnamed swordsmen were all on high alert and slowly surrounded them. Pay men dressed in white walked at the very front. You you all despicable. I&#x27;ve been weakened too much by the poison. Otherwise, how could a group of you level 40s be able to deal with me? Fumako said haltingly, &quot;You Chinese are so despicable and shameless.</p>
<p>I would rather die than submit to you. I hate this attitude of living a mundane life the most.&quot; Lyn Shao slowly walked over with Hortubing and Chin Leongyu. A simple life? Fumako asked puzzled. &quot;I&#x27;m just insulting you Japanese. You keep calling me China so I can&#x27;t insult your lives.&quot; Lyn Sha spat.</p>
<p>You call us despicable, but aren&#x27;t you despicable when you slaughter your own kind just to win? You can&#x27;t win, so you flip the table. Isn&#x27;t it despicable to send an 85th level ninja to deal with a lord who has just entered the official zone? You say, &quot;I&#x27;m despicable for using poison, but wasn&#x27;t it despicable of you to kill my soldiers with poison shurikens?&quot; Lynhos face had never been so furious before. His handsome features were distorted with rage. He said coldly. Do you know that my troops have never suffered any losses? To deal with you, an 85th level ninja lord.</p>
<p>They have fought bravely and relentlessly, ready to die for you. They can only see the mistakes of others, but not their own crimes. They have small courtesy, but no sense of righteousness. They bow politely to everyone they meet, claiming to be the most courteous. Yet they ignore the huge incident of the Fukushima leak and allow sewage to be discharged into the world.</p>
<p>Is it really enough to just bow and apologize when something goes wrong and say, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry to solve everything.&quot; Fukushima leaked. Fumako felt like he couldn&#x27;t understand Linia&#x27;s words. Don&#x27;t you dare interfere. Lynn Shiao roared. Today, you will pay for my brother&#x27;s lives.</p>
<p>A sword came from the east and thrust forward, but Codoro Fuma desperately turned his body to avoid a fatal blow. Huh? Fuma Codoro was about to mock Lin Sha. The drug took effect, causing him excruciating pain that made his whole body convulse. You should be glad that I am far more merciful than you. I could have severed your tendons and let the poison kill you slowly.</p>
<p>Codor Fuma&#x27;s eyes. As long as he had a moment to catch his breath, he still had a chance. But I won&#x27;t leave myself with any hidden dangers. Lynn Shiao said, &quot;I not only want to watch you die, but I also want to watch you be reduced to ashes and use your ashes as fertilizer for flower fairies. I also want to invite a wizard to chant a reququum for you.&quot; Codoruma sis, you how cruel you are.</p>
<p>Thank you for the compliment. Pay Min and several swordsmen simultaneously unleashed a sword strike from the east. The iron guards wielded their long-handled swords and the white pole spearman. The archers unleashed a volley of fire. The Guan Ning cavalry opened fire simultaneously.</p>
<p>There were also the Han Dynasty champion cavalry and the Phantom Archer drawing their bows and shooting arrows. Fuma Codoro instantly coughed up blood and was dismembered beyond any hope of survival. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s expression did not soften in the slightest. Everyone on high alert. Send a flower fairy to loot the bag and disinfect everything found.</p>
<p>White pole soldiers and moa soldiers, keep poking holes in his corpse. Poke his body into a civ, then burn it. I&#x27;ll just watch it turn to ashes. Don&#x27;t spare the land stained with blood. Burn it all.</p>
<p>Liao&#x27;s face was ashen as he watched the soldiers operate. He saw the ninja&#x27;s corpse seemed to twitch, filled with resentment. Finally. Ding. You have defeated the player from the Shikoku region.</p>
<p>Codor Fuma, what you receive? Lyn Sha sneered. You little brat. The system didn&#x27;t give any notification sound. How could I not know you weren&#x27;t completely dead? Chapter 1 169 postwar summary. A heavy price.</p>
<p>Deaths. 11 iron guards with mo Dao. Six archers with divine arms. 12 iron cavalry of Guan Ning. 18 champion cavalry of the great Han.</p>
<p>23 white-shaped spearmen, 13 phantom archers, one faceless one, all flower fairies. &quot;Even if the flower fairy didn&#x27;t die,&quot; Lin Sha said, waving his hand. &quot;Yes,&quot; Wong Ming said in a low voice. &quot;The number of wounded is about three times that of the dead. But even the seriously wounded are slowly recovering after entering the territory thanks to the territo&#x27;s healing effects.</p>
<p>Yes, only the dead. The wounded can recover and severed limbs can grow back. That&#x27;s the advantage of the golden legend Lord&#x27;s Mansion, Lyn Sha said. But we still suffered heavy losses and learned a painful lesson. It was already the second day after the great battle, but Lyn Sha still couldn&#x27;t forget his fight with Fumakoro.</p>
<p>Level 43 versus Level 85, and not just any level 85. Lyn Sha had already checked as soon as he returned. Fuma Codoro was a well-known ninja in Japan, the founder of the Fuma school and one of the four great ninjas of Japan. This is a top tier ninja lord, possessing countless magical artifacts, secret techniques, and extremely rich combat experience. In order to keep him in the dark and prevent his location from being exposed, Lin Sha mobilized his entire army and used every means at his disposal, all under Wong Ming&#x27;s scheme.</p>
<p>First, there&#x27;s Baoi, Lin Ziao&#x27;s current partner and lover, whom he has to personally intervene with. Of the necromancer orb, the mythical level Baoi was over level 40 with all her attributes higher than Pay Mins. But she was, after all, a weak woman with absolutely no combat experience. Ba&#x27;s mythical skill, peerless demoness, allows her to influence fate. She can amplify, shrink, and transfer the effects of specific skills.</p>
<p>Skills that are too powerful cannot be manipulated. So after she put on the forest witch&#x27;s cloak, her concealment and invisibility skills reached Srank and even Fumodoro couldn&#x27;t find her. She followed Fumako closely, using her skills to expose him, attracting monsters to gang up on him and depleting his stamina and endurance. When Lynn Shiao chose his landing spot, the monsters in this area were in too powerful. So there was no possibility that they could directly and severely injure Fumakoto.</p>
<p>During this time, the White Spearman and Ding Lays dwarf miners quickly dug various traps. The White Spearman possess extensive experience in mountain warfare and have inherited the pure physical traps of ancient China, while the dwarf miners excel at digging tunnels. The two groups work hard to dig and set traps, creating the second layer of obstacles for Fumakoto. Then there are the flower fairies. These free-spirited daredevils are skilled in using poison, but their poison is basically ineffective against ninjas who are experts in using poison.</p>
<p>Not to mention the level difference of more than 40 levels. So Lynn Sha made all the flower fairies take the drug that caused the poison to enter their bloodstream. and through suicide they would transfer the poison to Fuma Codoro. Ordinary poisons have no effect on Codor Fuma but the tethering poison developed by Emperor Taong of Song is different. As long as the problem of poisoning can be solved and the poison is applied to him, Codorofa will definitely be poisoned.</p>
<p>However, in the battlefield of myriad races, even the S-rank poison, the chi- trapping poison is greatly diminished in effectiveness in the face of the huge level difference. Lyn Sha was also prepared for this. If S-rank poison could dominate the world, then a novice lord could kill a god king of the first level with poison, and he wouldn&#x27;t need to work hard to level up. The flower fairies had no complaints about Lin Sha s arrangements. They even came up with a bizarre scene of a cult leader singing which enraged Codoruma causing him to become infected with even more toxins.</p>
<p>The flower fairy actually found this novel way of dying quite exciting. The newly planted flower fairy captain laughed and said that if Fuma Codoro was still alive, she would like to do it again and let this ninja see what a real new creator is. Poison greatly weakened Codor Fuma as combat power and the combined effects of monsters and traps allowed Lin Xiao&#x27;s team to fight him. Once he realizes he&#x27;s fallen into a trap, Fuma Codoro might choose to retreat. At that point, no one can stop him and he&#x27;ll have to rely on his own troops to hold the line.</p>
<p>The Mod Dao iron guards stepped forward. They drove away and lured wild monsters to form an encirclement while forming a human wall to surround and intercept the desperate ninja. One word, waste time. This depletes Codoro Fuma s life-saving methods and exhaust his stamina, allowing the poison to penetrate deeper into his body. However, the difference of more than 40 levels made battle losses inevitable.</p>
<p>In the end, after paying a heavy price, Lin Shao first drew the attention of Fuma Codoro and Pay Min then launched a sneak attack from behind. With their combined efforts, they killed the strongest enemy Lin Sha had ever encountered. A level 43 team killed a top tier level 85 lord. I don&#x27;t know if anyone will be able to do it in the future, but it is unprecedented. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s face was gloomy as he slowly said, &quot;But I can&#x27;t be happy.</p>
<p>Every single soldier in the Chinese army is my brother, the apple of my eye. They should be making great contributions on the battlefield of all races and bringing glory to China. They sacrificed themselves in vain because of the treachery and cunning of the Japanese. &quot;My lord, you have done very well. There is no genius in this era who can compare with you,&quot; Wong Ming said, standing beside him.</p>
<p>&quot;But I can do better, can I?&quot; Lyn Shao suddenly stood up and looked at the soldiers in the war hall. We have encountered a formidable enemy, but the problems that have been exposed are objectively real. If we get caught out by Codor Fuma this time, we&#x27;ll get caught out by another expert next time. Lyn Shiao said loudly. The iron guards of the Mod Dao are fierce warriors who are clad in armor and wield sharp weapons.</p>
<p>Even three layers of iron armor could not stop the sharp blade of Fuma Codoro. Oh Yi, what are your thoughts? Oh, Yzi quickly stepped forward, bowed, and said,&quot;Lord, the bright armor rewarded by the god system is under development and will be completed within 3 days.&quot; Lyn Sha slowly shook his head, &quot;Not enough. The rewards for waiting for the Warh Hall to issue missions are far from enough. The first layer can be upgraded from fish scale armor to bright armor, doubling the defense. The second layer can also be upgraded.</p>
<p>We can upgrade to meteor chain armor using materials unique to the battlefield of 10,000 races. Can you do it? O Yi paused for a few seconds, then slowly said, &quot;I am 80% confident.&quot; &quot;Very good,&quot; Lyn Sha continued. The archer&#x27;s eyelids under his helmet were also hit by a shuriken from Codor Fuma. &quot;I thought of a material, Shintai crystal from the battlefield of 10,000 races. It&#x27;s transparent and has a hardness and toughness comparable to Shintai.</p>
<p>Think of a way to make this into goggles. Equip the archers with the divine arm archer first and then extend a program to all Chinese military units. Yes, the white shafted spearmen wore breastplates and wrist guards, but their arms were bare. I asked Leang Yu, and he said it was because they often had to climb mountain walls, so they couldn&#x27;t wear heavy armor that would restrict their movement. Lynn Sha continued, &quot;I&#x27;ll provide you with some animal hides so you can experiment and have the white spearmen wear a layer of tough leather armor underneath to increase their defensive capabilities.&quot; Yes.</p>
<p>In addition, chapter 1 70 hugging the thigh, chrysanthemum, and sword. Lyn Sha threw out one idea after another, arranging for O Yi to research and test them. O Yzi&#x27;s eyes grew brighter and brighter. After all, he was a legendary hero and a master blacksmith. The challenging task given by the lord rekindled his competitive spirit.</p>
<p>That concludes the equipment upgrades, Lynsha said. But no matter what, the most important thing is still hierarchy. Without hierarchy, everything is just empty talk. Lyn Sha raised his hand and waved it, and the huge sand table in the war hall was updated again. Lyn Sha asked Baoi to bring out a pile of pebbles and place them at various points on the huge sand table.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll use pebbles instead of monsters. Lyn Sha said, &quot;I&#x27;ll skip the quality part since everyone here is of gold legendary quality, and the monsters here, no matter how high their quality, won&#x27;t exceed gold legendary.&quot; The green stones are the monster spots where the level is below 50, and they pose no threat to you. Yellow stones indicate monster spawn points with levels between 50 and 60, while red stones indicate monster spawn points with levels between 60 and 70. Black stones indicate the most dangerous monster spots, which are not advisable to challenge at this time. White stones represent nests or gathering places of monsters with a population of more than 500.</p>
<p>While Baoi was still arranging the stones, Lin Shao said. Next, Wong Ming will take charge of the overall arrangements, dispersing and reorganizing the various troop types to form teams. You will be divided into dozens of teams. Some will stay behind to guard the territory and take turns on duty, while the other teams will go out to hunt monsters, cooperate in combat, and fight on multiple fronts. Quickly, immediately go and level up.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao said, &quot;As long as the level is raised with the abilities of our Chinese soldiers and heroes, we will be invincible. We will never again be oppressed by class differences.&quot; &quot;Everyone, did you understand?&quot; &quot;Understood!&quot; the soldiers shouted in unison. &quot;I, Lyn Sha, will make those who offend China pay the price.&quot; Some soldiers were already moved to tears by the tragic scene. Their lord had just accomplished an unprecedented feat, defeating a top tier lord more than 40 levels above him. But he was feeling depressed and lost.</p>
<p>The reason is simply because some of our Chinese soldiers have lost their brothers. The lord buried his brothers and immediately returned to his territory where he pondered all night. The next day, the lord immediately dispatched his top blacksmith who offered over a dozen suggestions for improvement. It&#x27;s also that these Chinese soldiers can be less injured. To help them level up quickly, the Lord even used a god-like perspective to memorize information on all the monsters in the vicinity, distinguishing them by color on a giant sandbox and arranging them one by one.</p>
<p>Lord, you truly value these Chinese soldiers and treat them like brothers. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s extensive knowledge, exceptional memory, and leadership qualities further impressed them. After the meeting, only Baoi remained by Lin Xiao&#x27;s side. Your efforts alone are not enough. Lyn Shiao murmured.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m really stupid. I can improve myself. I have powerful backers. Why wouldn&#x27;t I use them? If the Japanese government sends an 85th level ninja, they will send a second, even stronger assassin. My aunt Dugu will definitely not let a genius like me who is ties to ancient demons die like this.</p>
<p>So, let her send bodyguards to protect me. It would be unreasonable not to use connections. It doesn&#x27;t fit my genius persona. Lynn Shiao immediately decided to contact Duga Nonwang and request her majesty the queen to provide him with some powerful bodyguards, which would greatly reduce his future pressure. Of course, you only need to protect yourself for a period of time when you can&#x27;t handle things on your own.</p>
<p>For other things, like hunting and exploring, you should do it yourself. This time it was a level over 40 above me. Next time it&#x27;ll be a level 100 lord. Even if my entire army is wiped out, I still won&#x27;t be able to win. And among the people I&#x27;ve messed with is a level 100 lord.</p>
<p>Huawei, the leader of the celestial beings. You beat up the young ones. Now it&#x27;s the older one&#x27;s turn. I also need to find an older one to back me up. Huh? I don&#x27;t have the ID number of the dragon summer domain lord.</p>
<p>Then I can only call my old squad leader and asked her to think of a solution or give me her majesty the queen&#x27;s number directly. Lynn Sha opened the communication page and dialed Dugu Xiaoan. However, the call could not be connected. What happened? Very good. Your talent is being stimulated at an increasingly higher level.</p>
<p>Dugu Nanuang nodded approvingly and said, &quot;Come to me once a week from now on. I will personally train you for 2 hours and I will provide the talismans for your round trip. You have such great talent. It would be a real shame not to make good use of it. Never let love and romance delay your cultivation progress.</p>
<p>Love and romance. Dugu Jalon, who had just put away the Thai sword, looked on in astonishment across from Dugu Nanuang. She wore a light purple robe and had a sword at her waist. She looked ethereal and stood proudly. But when she heard her aunt&#x27;s words, her usually pretty and aloof face showed a very vivid expression.</p>
<p>Well, I&#x27;m just reminding you that there is no man in the entire blue star realm who is worthy of my jaanon. Dugu Nanuang smiled slightly. What she had just said was just a joke. Auntie, you&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s talking to me. But why don&#x27;t you ever mention your own marriage? Dugu Jaolons eyes flashed with a cunning light.</p>
<p>After training and in private, she and her aunt were very close and she even dared to joke about the lord of Langsha domain. Me as the domain lord, I worry myself sick over the affairs of the dragon summer domain every day. Besides, my identity is sensitive and any man who gets close to me. Dugu Jalon sneered. Most of them don&#x27;t have good intentions.</p>
<p>The two stunning beauties exchanged a glance and involuntarily shook their heads. Then he smiled knowingly. All right, you should go back now. Lord of the domain. Lord Jabbron requests an audience, someone announced from outside the door.</p>
<p>All right, you can come with me to see Khalil Jabbron and see what he has to do today. The gatekeeper sounded quite anxious. Dugu Nanuang exhaled a deep breath. The relaxed and intimate feeling she had just experienced with Dugu Jelon vanished instantly, replaced by an aura of noble majesty that was neither swaying nor inviable. The two opened the door and entered the reception room.</p>
<p>The tall, white-haired old man, Khalil Jabbron, with a high nose, blue eyes, and a full head of white hair, looked somewhat anxious. Upon seeing Dugu Jalon arrive, Jibron was visibly taken aback for a moment, then bowed and said, &quot;Lord of the domain, Miss Dugu, Mr. Jabbron, you seem very anxious,&quot; Duga Nonuang said in a cold voice. Lord of the domain, I just saw a prophetic scene during my meditation. Khalil Jabbrron said anxiously.</p>
<p>I see that we are all gradually sinking deeper into the dark fog and many figures are searching for a way out on the edge of the darkness. Among them are Lord Domain Lord Jin Wuang, many virtuous people and Miss Dugu, but a figure who looked a lot like Lin Sha walked the fastest. He seemed to know the way and had already stepped out with one foot. But suddenly a chrysanthemum and a long knife stabbed at him from behind. I was startled awake from my meditation and came to seek the domain lord&#x27;s help in analyzing this.</p>
<p>But I feel this is a bad omen. Dugu nonwang s eyes gradually narrowed and her oppressive aura slowly and involuntarily emanated from her. Chrysanthemum and sword the Japanese. Are the Japanese planning to ambush and kill Lynsha? Chapter 171. Yamamoto Isuroku searching for the missing lord.</p>
<p>Are the Japanese planning to ambush and kill Lin Shiao? Upon hearing Dugu Nanuangs words, he himself was startled. Then she realized that she had forgotten Lin Xiao&#x27;s situation. He led the Lan region to victory over the Four Kingdoms region in the resource competition, gaining massive resources. Through a bet, he also won the Luck Talismen from the Four Kingdoms region, allowing hundreds of millions of lords in the Lnon region to enjoy the benefits. It also exposed Kenzo Dohura&#x27;s true colors, causing internal strife in the Shikoku region.</p>
<p>Hate Lynn shouted the bone. If that happened, he is currently just a lord who has just entered the official district. If he is found by the assassins sent by Japan, the consequences will be unimaginable. Shameless. Dugu Nanuang blurted out that if she could think of it, the Japanese must have thought of it, too, and might even have already done it.</p>
<p>Dugu Jalon glanced at her aunt with slight surprise. In her memory, her aunt had always been a composed person who would remain calm even if Mount Thai collapsed in front of her. She must have encountered situations more critical than this before. And she had never seen her aunt so slightly out of control. Shaolon, let&#x27;s go right away and find Lin Shia.</p>
<p>Dugu Nanuang pulled Dugu Jaon along, ready to depart when Jibron spoke up. Lord of the domain, please calm down. In the prophetic scene, although Lin Sha was injured, he broke his chrysanthemum and shattered his long sword. You should be fine for now. Lord Domain is extremely busy, there are even more important matters awaiting your attention.&quot; Duga Nanchuang calmed down a bit and nodded, saying, &quot;Thank you for your reminder, Mr.</p>
<p>Jibron. All right, Shaolan. Go and find out about Lyn Xiao&#x27;s current situation right away and see if the prophetic scene has already appeared. I&#x27;ll go make some preparations and arrange for a skilled person to secretly protect Lin Sha. Upon hearing this, a hint of pride flashed in Jibron&#x27;s eyes, and he nodded slightly.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s wrong with Duga? Jaalon. He hasn&#x27;t answered my calls. If I can&#x27;t latch onto the strongest thigh, then I&#x27;ll latch onto the second strongest thigh, and I&#x27;ll go find Chu Yusi. Jang Dong Madman, the city lord of Lan City in the Lan district, must have some skills. Like a weary old mother determined to find a good school district for her child, Lynsha immediately thought of the second way to curry favor with powerful figures.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s do it. Lyn Shao immediately gave instructions, instructing Wong Ming to coordinate all matters within his territory except for Baoi. Whether it was agricultural development, mining, or training various units, Wong Ming coordinated everything. As the prime minister of the formerQin dynasty and a figure in later historical records compared to Guanghong and Jugal Leang, Lin Shiao estimated that Wong Ming&#x27;s political, intellectual, and command abilities were basically at their peak. If judged by a game like Romance of the Three Kingdoms, these three attributes would be at least 95 or above, if not 99.</p>
<p>It would definitely be better to entrust my territory to Wong Ming than to manage it myself. Moreover, Wong Mings performance in the previous battle to intercept and kill Fuma Codoro earned him everyone&#x27;s respect and recognition. Although he was only Lin Xiao&#x27;s sixth hero, Wong Ming was the oldest and naturally dignified. Coupled with his outstanding abilities and Lyn Xiao&#x27;s obvious trust, it was only natural that the soldiers obeyed his command. After arranging everything, Lyn Shao tried to contact Chufinga, but no one answered.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao opened a portal and stepped directly into Lan City. Just go directly to the city lord&#x27;s mansion to find Chu Yusi. If he has any questions, he will definitely ask Dugu Nanuan. Here in the main hall of the city lord&#x27;s mansion, Chu Yusi still sat in the main seat with officials lined up on his left and right, anxiously craning their necks in anticipation. The great general of Japan has arrived.</p>
<p>As the loud voice rang out, a group of Japanese envoys stroed in arrogantly. The officials remained silent, shrinking back as they watched the Japanese procession approach. Upon seeing this, Chu Yusi snorted coldly. The Japanese envoy, still dressed in a kimono and wearing wooden clogs, walked straight toward Chui. The leader was a man with a salow complexion and a light beard.</p>
<p>He was quite handsome and imposing, much better than Kenzo Dohara. From afar, the man laughed heartily. Chui, it&#x27;s been many years. I&#x27;ve heard you&#x27;re still as eccentric as ever. I, Yamamoto Isuroku, have come to visit you in person.</p>
<p>What? Aren&#x27;t you welcome? When Yamamoto Isuroku arrived, Chu Yusi reluctantly rose to greet him and led him to a guest seat. Yamamoto Isuroku is the Grand General of Japan, whose status far surpasses that of Dohurkenzo. In Japan, his position is only below that of Prime Minister Tojo Hideki and a few other high-ranking officials. Chu Yusi as the head of Lan district is even slightly inferior in status. After Yamamoto Isuroku took his seat, the Japanese people stood to his side looking down at the dragon summer group opposite him with their heads held high.</p>
<p>I was unaware of General Yamamoto&#x27;s presence. What brings you here? Chu Yusi too lazy to be polite? asked directly. Upon hearing this, Yamamoto Isuroku first gave a cold laugh, then said in a deep voice, &quot;I am here today to lodge a strong diplomatic protest with your country and your region.&quot; &quot;What? All the officials of Langia were shocked upon hearing this. A diplomatic protest? That&#x27;s a big deal. Yesterday, a high-ranking lord of my eastern kingdom went missing.&quot; Yamamoto Isuroku said his last known location was in the official district of your Lan region and he even sent a distress signal saying that he was being ambushed by an organized and planned conspiracy in the Lan district and that his life was hanging by a thread and he was in extreme danger.</p>
<p>Therefore, on behalf of the Kingdom of Japan, I request that the Lan District of the Kingdom of Langia allow members of my special task force to enter the Lan District to search for the missing lord. As soon as Yamamoto Isuroku finished speaking, the hall erupted in noise. Ridiculous. Absurd. Chu Yusi stood up abruptly.</p>
<p>How could your lord from Japan have disappeared in my Lan district? Yamamoto Iseroku said he was carrying out a secret mission in conjunction with the western European region and was just passing through the LN region. I cannot disclose the details. However, this lord is of great significance to my eastern kingdom. Therefore, I, Yamamoto Iseroku, as the grand general of the Eastern Kingdom, have personally come to your Lnon city to lodge a diplomatic protest and demand that if you were indeed involved in the plot to attack my Eastern Kingdom, Lord, please stop immediately and return the Lord. We will discuss the losses and compensation later.</p>
<p>Impossible. Utterly absurd. Shu Yusi shouted. Your donging lord has absolutely nothing to do with my Lnon district. All right, if you did not attack my lord, please allow our task force to enter the Lonan region to search for him.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Isuroku sneered. That&#x27;s a reasonable request, isn&#x27;t it? Nonsense. You think I&#x27;m being reasonable? Chu Yusi cursed angrily, but was pulled back by an official beside him. Lord Chu, mind your image. The officials of Lshia Kingdom also began to whisper among themselves.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re only asking to search for their high-ranking lord. They have no other demands. That&#x27;s not unreasonable, is it? Yes. Since it&#x27;s a joint mission with Western Europe, it must be very important. And our Lnon region should help.</p>
<p>We have nothing to fear if we are upright. Since we have not taken any action against the Japanese lord, we are not afraid of their search. Yes, Lord Shu. What&#x27;s wrong with letting them search? Chapter 172. You want to reignite the war? We can&#x27;t agree.</p>
<p>The fact that the Japanese general has personally come speaks volumes about the importance of the situation. We should prioritize the greater good and help Japan this time. It would be a friendly gesture of mutual assistance with our neighbor. The officials from Liao were still chattering on when Chu Yusi finally couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. He shoved aside the official beside him who was advising him to mind his image and shouted, &quot;Shut up all of you.</p>
<p>What kind of behavior is this? Do you want to become a laughingstock?&quot; Yamamoto Iseroku, I absolutely cannot agree to your request. Chu Yusi said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t even investigated why your lord is in my Lan region, yet you dare to use that as an excuse to try and enter my Lnon region? How laughable.&quot; Yamamoto Isuroku sneered. I have already stated that this high-ranking lord is passing through Liao on a secret mission. I don&#x27;t seem to have any obligation to explain what kind of mission it is to you, do I? With that, he narrowed his eyes, raised his aura, and shouted, &quot;My Eastern Kingdom has fought the Dragon Sea Kingdom 37 times in the past 100 years, winning 36 and drawing one. Western Europe is home to many powerful nations.</p>
<p>Is it any of your business, Longa, to question our joint mission with Japan and Western Europe? I, Yamamoto Ioku, have already shown you great respect by coming here in person. You dare to stop me from entering the Lan district to search? Are you really besieging my lord? Aren&#x27;t you afraid that war will break out again between Japan and Lia? The last sentence was uttered by Yamamoto Isuroku with an air of profound authority. All the officials present except for Chu Yusi took several steps back, cold sweat pouring down their backs. Chu Yusi&#x27;s train of thought was also interrupted by Yamamoto Isuroka&#x27;s shout, but he still stiffened his neck and shouted to himself, &quot;No means no. Oh, Lord City Lord, the greater good must be considered.</p>
<p>Lord of the city, General Yamamoto has only requested to search for the missing Lord. He has no malicious intent. Why can&#x27;t we allow it?&quot; &quot;Yes! Yes, Lord.&quot; City Lord, don&#x27;t act rashly. Our Lung Sha cannot afford another battle. filled with indignation when he saw that Chu Yusi had to resist the Japanese envoy while also being wary of his own bureaucratic team betraying him.</p>
<p>The young official knew that he was of low status and his words carried little weight. So seeing this situation, he suddenly came up with a plan. He quietly started a live stream and the camera was pointed at the people who were fighting. He wanted to expose the current dispute to the public so that everyone in Lia would know the shamelessness of Japan and the incompetence of Liao officials. Even if it means being punished and losing the right to be an official again, I am willing to do it.</p>
<p>The live stream started and people started coming in. But the argument in the main hall continued. The Japanese team was aggressive while the Lia officials were yielding at every turn, clearly showing the difference in their power dynamics. Chu Yusis eyes grew colder and colder. No matter who tried to persuade him, he remained unmoved, gritting his teeth and refusing to let the Japanese enter Longan district to search for the missing lord.</p>
<p>Seeing that the atmosphere was almost right, Yamamoto Isuroku casually stood up. Chu Yusi just admitted. Today, our special task force is entering Lan District. Do you see any officials on your side? You&#x27;d better agree, but you have no choice but to agree. That&#x27;s right, Lord City Lord.</p>
<p>This doesn&#x27;t cause us any loss. Isn&#x27;t it a loss to let others enter our territory under false pretenses, to lose face, integrity, and national dignity? Chu Yusi said through gritted teeth. Then let&#x27;s compromise your lordship. How about we ask the various powerful nations of Western Europe to arbitrate and mediate? Yes, the western European countries are all representatives of democracy and freedom and they are also strong in the spirit of contracts. They also have the advantage of strong national power.</p>
<p>Let them take the lead in arbitration. I think this matter can be resolved in this way. It&#x27;s excellent. If we win, Japan won&#x27;t make any more demands. If we lose, the whole world will think that the Japanese should be allowed in and we&#x27;ll just do as they say.</p>
<p>Shu Yusi&#x27;s words sparked a flurry of comments from the officials who kept insisting that he agree to the Japanese request, much to his dismay. At this time, the officials are incompetent and utterly incompetent. Shameless Japan, barking and howling. Lord Shu, this demand must not be agreed to. If we agree to the Japanese today, our descendants will curse all the officials present.</p>
<p>As the loud voice rang out, the people arguing in the hall stopped and turned to look. It turned out to be Lynn Shiao and a group of young lords who pushed past the gatekeepers and stroed in. Lyn Sha said all those words loudly. Seeing Lyn Sha leading the lord straight towards Chu Yusi, everyone finally realized what was happening. How dare you cause such a disturbance at the city lord&#x27;s mansion? How dare you? Who gave you the audacity to trespass into the city lord&#x27;s mansion? I am the last disciple of Lord Dugu.</p>
<p>Of course, I have the courage given by the Lord himself. Lyn Sha was not afraid at all. He casually made up a story and directly invoked the great reputation of Aunt Dugu, which shocked the many officials in the hall who wanted to make trouble. Their questions were stuck in their throats. This kid doesn&#x27;t play by the rules.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao, tell me why you can&#x27;t agree. When Shu Yusi saw Lin Shiao and his group approaching, he felt a sense of relief for no apparent reason. Taking advantage of the officials hesitation, he asked them a question, &quot;Lord Shu, this is clearly in humiliation of Lia, a test of his abilities.&quot; Lyn Sha walked to the center of the hall, looked around, and said loudly, &quot;To demand entry into the territory of a sovereign state without any reasonable justification is an insult. insulting Lshia&#x27;s sovereignty and being trampled underfoot by the Japanese. If we agree to the Japanese&#x27;s request to enter Lon territory to search for someone today, they&#x27;ll dare to come to your house to search for someone tomorrow.</p>
<p>Today they say a highranking lord has gone missing. Tomorrow they ll blame Lshia for even a dog going missing. This is a test. Making unreasonable demands. Observing Lang Shas reaction.</p>
<p>Assessing Lshias capabilities and risks is also a test. Preparing for future war. My little ones, am I right? In the hall, Lyn Xiaos words were firm and resolute. Faced with the sudden question, everyone from Japan fell into an eerie silence. Gentlemen, you can understand, can&#x27;t you? Lyn Sha turned around and looked at the official.</p>
<p>And there are some self-righteous little cuties who place their hopes on Western European countries. Don&#x27;t you know that Western Europe and Japan are in cahoots? Those who keep advocating for agreeing to this unreasonable demand are either stupid or malicious. Lord Shu, such officials are no longer fit to hold their positions without doing any work. I suggest they be replaced. Lyn Shao said, &quot;We absolutely cannot agree to the Japanese demands.</p>
<p>If we do, the backbone of Liao will be completely broken. That&#x27;s right. Behind Lin Shiao, Ding Lelay, Shufinga, Julie, Wong Bo, Panch Shan Yu, Lu Jaoing, Guang Jun, Chinuandu, and all those who had participated in the resource competition were present, and they all applauded and cheered. Let the Japanese give up on that idea. Get back to Japan right now.</p>
<p>The sovereignty of Lia is inviable. Chu Yusi nodded in approval. Finally, a sensible lord had emerged, whose words hit the nail on the head, exposing the Japanese conspiracy and giving them a good slap in the face. The officials of Liao were also shocked by Lin Xiaos words and murmured, unable to speak. If I agree, will my spine be completely broken? So, what seemed like no loss was actually just the Japanese testing us.</p>
<p>Despicable, cunning. Just as Linhaos words had slightly brought the situation under control, Yamamoto Isuroku suddenly stood up. Huh? How laughable that you, a mere commoner lord, have no right to speak to me. Chapter 173. Dugu Nanuang appears and issues a challenge.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Isuroku suddenly stood up and let out a loud shout once again changing the balance of power between the two sides. Lynn Shiao, this is none of your business. The highle diplomatic meeting between the two countries is none of the business of unqualified people to point fingers. Lord Shu, get rid of all these uninvited newbies. Otherwise, I will refuse to continue negotiating with you.</p>
<p>Strange, you keep saying you won&#x27;t talk to me. But how do you know my name? A mere commoner lord? Lyn Sha tilted his head and asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot; I am Yamamoto Isuroku, the great shogun of the Eastern Kingdom. Yamamoto Isuroku. Lyn Sha looked surprised and even picked at his ear with his finger. Did I hear that right? I am Yamamoto Isuroku and I will never change my name or surname.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Isuroku said arrogantly. First it was Kinszo Dohurra, then Isuroku Yamamoto. And is there anyone else among you named Hideki Tojo? How dare you address my Japanese prime minister by his given name? My Japanese prime minister is Tojo Haidakuni, not Tojo Hideki. The key is Kuwin, and Kuwin is the key, so there&#x27;s no difference. Lyn Sha laughed and said, &quot;It seems we&#x27;re all old acquaintances.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no need for you to beat around the bush. Tell me, how far along is your plan to invade Lia?&quot; Insolence. Yamamoto. Isoku roared. Who gave you the right to question this general? Lord Shu, why haven&#x27;t you driven this brat away yet? Yamamoto Isuroku gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>His fierce gaze revealing his true colors and said, &quot;If you don&#x27;t ask him to leave, well have no choice but to take our leave and abandon diplomacy in favor of other means to handle this matter. Don&#x27;t blame us for not informing you beforehand.&quot; &quot;Just as Chu Yusi was about to speak,&quot; Yamamoto roared again. &quot;Does Liao really want to start a war with my Japan? Why are you shouting so loudly? Are you feeling guilty?&quot; Lynn Shiao remained calm and composed. A stark contrast to Yamamoto Isuroku, who was shouting and yelling beside him. Lord Shu, the so-called disappearance of the Lord is just an excuse for these petty people.</p>
<p>Whether they agree or not, they will find an excuse to invade Lia. Lin Shia sneered. The wolfish ambitions of the Japanese are obvious to all. You have no right to speak here. Yamamoto roared.</p>
<p>Chi, do you really want war? The atmosphere became extremely tense. On one side, there was the aggressive Japanese general and his arrogant team. On one side, there was the stubborn lord of Lan city and the cowardly officials of Lan district who were adept at backstabbing. Many young lords were also watching from the hall. It seems that the fates of Lia and Donging converge at this very moment.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s start the war. A voice came from behind. Neither Chu Yusi nor Linsha. The officials, realizing what was happening, bowed in unison, lord of the domain. Lyn Sha also turned his head and saw Duga Nonwang, dressed in gorgeous clothes and with a cold and noble temperament, walking with a murderous aura.</p>
<p>She was tall and slender, with a cold and aloof face, looking only in her 30s. Her fox-like eyes were bright and slightly upturned at the corners with clear and bright pupils. Her skin was as white as porcelain. Her features were striking and her demeanor was composed. She was truly a stunning beauty, a strikingly beautiful woman with an appearance that could topple kingdoms and cities.</p>
<p>She wore an elaborate headdress and a long dress with intricate patterns. The extravagant jewelry and dress did not detract from her charm at all, but rather made her appear even more elegant and noble. When she appeared, she shone like a bright pearl, attracting everyone&#x27;s attention while making people afraid to look directly at her. Beside her was a tall old man with a high nose and blue eyes. When Yamamoto Isuroku saw Duga Nonwang, he could only bow and greet her.</p>
<p>Lord of Dragon domain, greetings, General Yamamoto, you&#x27;ve been pressuring me about whether Lord Lia City wants to start a war. Duga Nanuang said coldly. The answer from my dragon Sia kingdom is let&#x27;s go to war. Did you hear me clearly? This Yamamoto Isuroku was stunned and Shu Yusi who was standing next to him also looked at Dugu Nanuang with surprise and uncertainty. So it turns out that Lord Dugu is the madman of Jangdong.</p>
<p>A thought floated through Chu Yusi&#x27;s mind. I Chu Yusi know that I cannot act rashly in this situation. Yet the domain lord directly demands a head-on confrontation with Japan. This is a major diplomatic matter between our two countries. Lord lonely domain.</p>
<p>It cannot be decided in a single sentence. Further consultation and discussion are necessary. I am the domain lord and I make the decisions. Dug nonwang said coldly. General Yamamoto wants a war.</p>
<p>So I will give you one. In addition, Dugu Nanuang turned her head and looked at Lin Sha, who stood calmly in the center of the hall and said, &quot;Lin Shiao is my last disciple, essentially a reserve officer. I hereby declare that every word he says is valid. From this moment forward, Lin Shiao is promoted to deputy city lord of Lnon City. His duties include assisting the city lord in contacting the Japanese envoy and formulating plans.&quot; Well, now Lynn Shiao is qualified to speak with you, General Yamamoto.</p>
<p>Thunder rumbles, thunder roars. Lyn Xiaos expression also began to falter. Aunt Dugu, what are you doing? A mere squabble of pride has pushed me to become the deputy city lord. You stormed over here as if you knew everything that had happened. Aren&#x27;t you afraid of entrusting this to the wrong person? At that moment, out of the corner of Lyn Xiaos eye, he saw a figure in purple slowly walk into the hall and stand behind the crowd.</p>
<p>The stunningly beautiful woman nodded to Lin Sha from afar when she saw him looking at her. Lyn Sha nodded slightly in response. It&#x27;s the old squad leader again. Has the old squad leader made his move once more? On the other side, under the supreme pressure of Dugu Nanuang, Yamamoto Isuroku was sweating profusely. He had only intended to use the aura and power of the Japanese nation to force Chu Yusi.</p>
<p>But he did not expect that Dugan Nanuang would suddenly arrive with an even stronger aura and greater courage than him. Knowing that preparations in Japan were not yet fully complete, Yamamoto Isuroku under pressure gritted his teeth and said, &quot;It seems that Lord Dugu has no intention of resolving this matter peacefully. Peaceful resolution. What a joke. When did General Yamamoto ever consider resolving this matter peacefully? Dugu Nanuang coldly flung out a small, broken, bloodstained iron plate, which crashed to the feet of the Japanese people with a loud bang.</p>
<p>Your scheme began the moment your country&#x27;s ninja lord entered my Lan region to assassinate Lin Sha. What? Everyone present was greatly surprised. Yamamoto Isuroka was takenback. He bent down and picked up the iron plaque on which the words wind demon were faintly engraved. For a moment, his eyes darted around, filled with surprise and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Dugu Nanuang said, &quot;Your missing lord was merely sent to assassinate my closed door disciple. Your so-called search is nothing more than a further search for Lin Xiao&#x27;s location to assassinate him and also serves to humiliate Lia and undermine Lia&#x27;s sovereignty. From the very beginning, this was a conspiracy by your Japanese nation. You&#x27;ve wanted to start a war with Lia for a long time. Dugu Nanuang&#x27;s words were clear and calm, devoid of any emotion, but the truth she revealed chilled everyone to the bone.</p>
<p>Japan has long harbored ill intentions and planned to continue its invasion of China. So it was indeed your country that killed Kodoruma. Yamamoto Isuroku had regained his senses. His voice was low and cold as he sneered. Your country killed my highranking lord.</p>
<p>This grudge cannot go unavvenged. After saying that, Yamamoto Isuroku raised his head, his cold eyes fixed on Dugun Nanuang in front of him. Japan is issuing a declaration of war against Dragon Sea. Chapter 174 Dual Arena Battle 230 million tales. Japan is issuing a declaration of war against Dragon Sea.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Isuroku looked at Dugan Nanuang and said, &quot;Word by word, I, Yamamoto Isuroku, as the shogun of the Kingdom of Japan, hereby issue a declaration of war to the Kingdom of Lia on behalf of the Kingdom of Japan. The Kingdom of Japan is about to engage in a battle of national destiny with the Kingdom of Langia.&quot; A battle for national destiny. The crowd in the hall erupted in uproar. The National Fate Arena Battle is the highest level of combat conflict in the battlefield of all races apart from formal battles between two countries. In fact, the National Fortune Arena is often viewed as a battle only.</p>
<p>It is more structured, has rules and conditions, and is a battle witnessed by the main god system. Unexpectedly, the Japanese team, which originally came only to make diplomatic proposals, actually agreed to go to war and directly named the National Fortune Arena. Good. Seeing the tall, elderly man beside her nod slightly, Duga Nanuang immediately agreed without hesitation. So be it, a national destiny contest.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to stake the next 10 years of your Japanese nation&#x27;s destiny on it. He Lord Dugu has quite the ambition. The national fortune arena follows the principle of equality. So your dragon kingdom will also bet 10 years of its national fortune. No problem.</p>
<p>Dugan nonwang said calmly. Good. Lord Dugu is a straightforward person. But I have one more condition before the national fortune arena. First open the heroic martial arts arena.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Isuroku abruptly changed the subject pointing at Lin Shiao. And he must participate. What? Everyone present was taken aback. The heroic arena is a battle arena specifically for young lords and participants cannot be above level 50. Participating in the martial arts arena is generally aimed at the opponent&#x27;s young prodigy with the goal of stifling the opponent&#x27;s future masters in their growth process and eliminating the opponent&#x27;s fighting force.</p>
<p>Therefore, the casualty rate in the heroic martial arts arena is extremely high. Both sides fight with all their might. The heroic arena itself doesn&#x27;t offer any major rewards. Its main purpose is to kill. Yamamoto Isuroku has opened the heroic martial arts arena for Lin Shiao.</p>
<p>The Japanese general specifically named Lin Shiao as the target. Amidst the discussions, Lin Sha stood proudly showing no sign of backing down. Dugu Nanuang slowly said, &quot;What if I don&#x27;t agree?&quot; Heih he if longa doesn&#x27;t agree I naturally can&#x27;t force him to start a duel in the arena Yamamoto Iuroku said leisurely we have no choice but to return to Japan and discuss the matter with our allies to plan for the future the national fortune arena is witnessed by the supreme god so it can be considered fair this time I the general want to have a duel with you in the national fortune arena after we go back and discuss it perhaps we will have a better way to maintain the dignity of my Eastern Kingdom. At that point, it won&#x27;t be something that can be solved by simply opening the National Fortune Arena. You shameless.</p>
<p>In the hall, Chufinga stepped forward and shouted angrily. Lyn Shia only has F-level talent. You specifically asked Lynn Shia to participate just to kill him. You want revenge now that Lyn Sha has exposed your plot. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>That token just now belonged to the missing lord from Japan, didn&#x27;t it? Our domain lord already said that it was you who sent your lord to assassinate Lynsha. Now they&#x27;re using the national destiny arena as leverage. It&#x27;s utterly shameless. Dugu Nanuang also turned around. Her stunningly beautiful eyes looking at Lin Shiao.</p>
<p>You know this is aimed at you. If you don&#x27;t agree, I&#x27;ll refuse. Dugu Nanuang swords echoed directly in Lin Xiaos mind. Lyn Sha was immediately amused. Aunt Dugu could even transmit voices.</p>
<p>She really had some tricks up her sleeve. Master. Lyn Sha bowed and greeted him with master, thus confirming their relationship. Then he said frankly, the national destiny arena is about to begin, and we need 3 months to prepare. Victory in the heroic martial arts arena can greatly influence the national fortune arena and boost morale.</p>
<p>As the deputy city lord of Lnon City and the official in charge of this negotiation and diplomatic event, I naturally have an inescapable responsibility to meet the demands of the Eastern Kingdom for participation in the war. Of course, I&#x27;m willing to participate,&quot; Lyn Shao said loudly. &quot;To live, be a hero. To die, be a ghost among heroes. I, Lyn Sha, am willing to participate in the heroic martial arts arena for Lia.</p>
<p>If I win, I will serve my country and people. If I lose, it will be a glorious victory, and my life will not have been in vain. Good. In the hall, the young lords who had come with Lynn, Shiao cheered loudly, extremely excited. I, Ding Lay, also want to participate in the heroic martial arts arena.</p>
<p>Count me in, Wong Bo. I, Chufinga, will definitely go. The crowd was outraged. Seeing this, Yamamoto Isuroku sneered. Lord Dugu, the National Fortune Arena will open in three months and the Heroic Martial Arts Arena will open in one week.</p>
<p>Do you agree or not? Dugu Nanuang turned around with a cold face, looking down at Yamamoto Isuroku like a queen and said, &quot;The National Destiny Contest is a gamble on the nation&#x27;s fate over the next 10 years.&quot; Yamamoto Isuroku. All right, Lynn Sha must participate in the heroic martial arts arena. Lynn Shiao said coldly. I can participate in the heroic martial arts arena, but if my Lia Kingdom wins the heroic martial arts arena, you will have to pay 230 million tales of silver. 230 million tales.</p>
<p>Yamamoto was taken aback and sneered. Why 230 million? I like this number. You&#x27;re worth that much money. Lyn Xiao, I&#x27;m covered in diamonds. Yamamoto Isuroku was humiliated.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiao&#x27;s shamelessness was infuriating. You set conditions and we can set conditions, too. Lyn Shao said, &quot;You only need to pay these 23,000 tales of silver if you lose. But if you win, you can get rid of me once and for all and no longer need to send ninjas to assassinate me. I imagine the reward you received from the heavens was quite substantial, wasn&#x27;t it, Yamamoto?&quot; Isuroku narrowed his eyes, his killing intent radiating.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha, however, remained unfazed and continued. What scared? Don&#x27;t dare to come. Thinking of the several powerful geniuses on his side, Yamamoto Isuroku felt he would never lose and said, &quot;Orogant brat. What good would it do to agree?&quot; Okay, let&#x27;s sign the contract. Dugu Nanuang immediately signed a contract with Yamamoto Iseroku under the witness of the main god system.</p>
<p>The countdown to the National Fortune Arena and the heroic martial arts arena has officially begun. He you&#x27;ll all realize sooner or later that there&#x27;s no good outcome to going against my great Eastern Empire. Your Lang Shia is about to suffer another defeat. The great empire of thousands of years ago will eventually be crushed and forever trampled underfoot by my eastern Japan. And all of this stems from this unremarkable young man.</p>
<p>Is it worth it? Yamamoto Isuroku made a harsh statement, gave Lin Shia a cold look, and then turned and led the others away through the side door. At this moment, there was a commotion outside and a security guard came to report. Lord, City Lord. A large number of lords have arrived outside the city lord&#x27;s mansion, shouting that they cannot compromise with the Japanese and that war is the only option. Many more lords are trying to break into the city lord&#x27;s mansion hall and we can&#x27;t stop them.</p>
<p>Chu Yusi frowned. What&#x27;s going on? How did they know what happened here? Dugu Nanuang walked gracefully to the main seat of the city lord&#x27;s mansion and sat down directly. I think we should let him explain it himself. Her gaze fell upon a young official at the back of the crowd. Lynn douching, &quot;Step forward.&quot; The young official walked out with a calm expression.</p>
<p>With all the officials eyes fixed on him, Dugu Jaolon spoke again. &quot;Lynn Shiao, take the rest of you and leave. Make sure to reassure the lords outside and explain the situation inside to them. The heroic arena is now entirely in your hands. Do not let down the expectations of everyone in the Dragon Sa Kingdom.&quot; Dugu Nanuang said, inunciating each word clearly.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t lose your life and disgrace me. Chapter 175. Shock. Gene Wuang. Selection.</p>
<p>Extra. Extra. General Yamamoto Isuroku of Japan has suddenly arrived in the Lan district, making unreasonable demands and humiliating the Lia Kingdom. The officials of Lan fell silent. The young lord Lynn Shao rushed to the city lord&#x27;s mansion and angrily berated the officials and the Japanese envoy delegation.</p>
<p>Duga domains main force supports Lin Shiao and publicly appoints him as the deputy city lord. Lia and Donging immediately signed a contract for a battle on two arenas, the national fortune arena and the heroic martial arts arena. The 38th major war between the dragon Sia Kingdom and the Eastern Ining Kingdom in nearly a century is about to begin. Extra extra. Inside Lan City, a newspaper vendor named Zilangen loudly hawkked his wares.</p>
<p>The breaking news was broadcast repeatedly in the Lan District chat channel and even throughout the entire Lang Shia domain chat channel. An unprecedented uproar swept through every corner of the Dragon Sea Kingdom with discussions rising and falling like waves. From officials at all levels to novice lords, as well as teachers, students, and ordinary people in the real world of the Dragon Sa Kingdom, everyone quickly learned about the matter. Japan is about to go to war with Dragon Sia again. Well done, Longia.</p>
<p>Well done, your majesty. We absolutely cannot let the Japanese take advantage of us. and Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha is also great. He just led us to victory in the resource competition and then uncovered the Japanese conspiracy.</p>
<p>Lia will win. Go Lia, I want to sign up. I want to sign up for the heroic martial arts arena. In no time, countless people were discussing this matter on the streets and in chat channels. She&#x27;s gone mad.</p>
<p>That woman, Dugan Schwang, is so impulsive, so easily starting another war with the powerful Eastern Kingdom. Some veteran lords couldn&#x27;t help but join the discussion in the chat channel. They were senior, older, and had seen a lot of the world. Most of them held important positions in Lia and had little faith in Duga Nonwang, an impulsive young person. The moment they spoke, the previously heated chat channel fell silent.</p>
<p>She shouldn&#x27;t have been made the domain lord in the first place. When she first took office, she fought to a draw with Japan and then immediately lost a match. She hasn&#x27;t learned her lesson yet and wants to fight Japan again. Do you think the kingdom of Japan is so easy to deal with? We are all seasoned warriors and none of us have ever defeated the Lord of Japan. The Japanese warriors bushidto spirit which is characterized by their willingness to die for their cause far surpasses that of my dragon Sia.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re doomed to lose to Japan. In the past century, we have fought Japan 37 times, losing 36 and drawing one. Can we win? The vast majority of veteran lords were not optimistic about the dragon kingdom. That&#x27;s right. If we start a war lightly and lose again, I think Dugu Nanuang should resign as the lord of the dragon sia domain.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all because of that young lord Lyn Shiao. He&#x27;s just a brat. All he knows is how to show off. All the civil and military officials knew they should be prudent, but he insisted on making the Japanese lose face and became furious. This unpleasant incident with Japan was all his fault.</p>
<p>That bastard is utterly despicable. The Dugu family is no longer what it once was. Each generation is worse than the last. I think we should let someone else take the position of the next Dragon summer domain lord. Our Lia truly cannot afford another defeat.</p>
<p>Whether it&#x27;s a battle on the front lines or the somewhat fair national destiny arena witnessed by the main god system. I&#x27;ve heard that Dugun Vois has staked another 10 years of the nation&#x27;s destiny on this one. It&#x27;s truly that Lynn Shiao actually dares to dream of winning the 230 million tales of silver in the heroic martial arts arena. How laughable. What a terrible thing.</p>
<p>Alas, Longa is no longer the Longa of thousands of years ago. He is merely an aging giant. How can he fight against the rising Japanese nation which is like a new son? In my opinion, it would be better to merge into the Japanese sphere as soon as possible and become a member of the greater East Asia co-rossperity sphere. The chat channel fell silent. Everyone was angry but dared not speak out.</p>
<p>Just as pessimistic and negative emotions were reaching their peak. A jarring voice rang out. You bunch of old fogies, you&#x27;d be fine if you didn&#x27;t go to the battlefield, but instead you&#x27;re here spouting sarcastic remarks who just said they wanted to join the greater East Asia co-rossperity sphere. Come out here. I, Gene Wuang, will beat you to death.</p>
<p>It turns out it was Gene Wuang, the patriarch of the Gene family, one of the 10 chief lords of the dragon summer domain, a powerful lord who has been fighting in the ninth heaven for many years. Gene Wuang kept talking. Are you all just showing off your seniority here? Who&#x27;s more senior than me? They hold high positions and enjoy wealth and luxury, yet they don&#x27;t think about making any contributions to Lia. Lord Lia is charging into battle, and you&#x27;re all making sarcastic remarks from behind. Lyn Shia was right.</p>
<p>What a bunch of incompetent and utterly worthless people. What&#x27;s that saying again? Holding a position without doing any work. An elderly lord retorted. Gin Wuang, when did you start speaking up for Lyn Sha? Why can&#x27;t I speak up for Lyn Sha? He&#x27;s the one who killed your descendants. Which descendant? Oh, damn it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s because I gave too many of my lucky charms. Whatever. Gene Wuang said, &quot;It&#x27;s none of your business what my Gene family does.&quot; Lyn Xiaos outburst yesterday against the Japanese and officials of Lan District is enough for me to say a few words of justice for him. Also, you should show some respect to Lyn Shao. He is now the deputy city lord of Lon City, and his rank may even be higher than some of you old fogies.</p>
<p>Jin Wuang spoke at lightning speed, seemingly without needing to catch his breath, and coupled with his incessant chatter, he unleashed a torrent of abuse that left the older lords utterly exasperated. They didn&#x27;t dare continue chatting in the public channel and sheepishly logged off or went to chat privately. The chat channel was finally free and a lord jumped out. Gene Wooang, you old devil. I knew you were a good devil.</p>
<p>From today onwards, you and Lyn Shia are my favorite people. Gene Wuang, I&#x27;m sorry. I made a terrible joke about your descendant Gene Dang before. I won&#x27;t do it again. Gene Wuang, don&#x27;t bring up the sore spot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the chat channel, Gene Wuang angrily berates the pessimistic old lord, and the clash between the two forces is different. In front of the city, Lord&#x27;s mansion was packed with people three layers deep. Brothers and sisters who want to participate in the heroic martial arts arena. On behalf of brother Lynsha, I would like to thank you all. It is you who have shown the entire Lung Sha the spirit of youth.</p>
<p>A figure stood on a high platform shouting loudly. It was Dinglay. But this martial arts arena is an extremely brutal arena where both sides must fight to the death and the casualty rate is extremely high. I know your sincere patriotism, but those who are not strong enough will only be sending themselves to their deaths. So, Brother Lynn Sha set the rules.</p>
<p>Dinglay shouted. First, you must defeat any one of brother Lin Xiaos three vassel lords. Ding Lay pointed to Tu Shan by Chian, Heay and Chuning Ming on the stage, and Tu Shan by Chian proudly puffed out her chest. After defeating them, you can then challenge me to a duel. Only if you can defeat me or gain my approval can you participate in the heroic martial arts arena.</p>
<p>Chapter 176. The past of Dugu. Battles between soldiers and generals. Mr. Khalil Jibron, do you also think I was too impulsive? In the unassuming ancient palace, Dugu Nanuang asked in a low-key manner, &quot;Lord of the domain, neither country can afford to lose face.</p>
<p>If we are hesitant and cautious in everything we do, the Dragon Sa Kingdom will only sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire of decline.&quot; Did Mr. Jibron not predict this battle? Khalil Jabbrron said, &quot;The fate of nations is in constant flux. Even a small change can alter the entire situation. Such a big matter. I can&#x27;t see through it.</p>
<p>Finally, Jabbron slowly said, &quot;Lord Dugu, you should listen to your heart. Once you&#x27;ve chosen something, you should do it firmly. Seeking divine intervention or divination for everything is not the behavior of a wise ruler. Thank you for the reminder, Prophet.&quot; Khalil Jibron rose to take his leave. After a long while, Dugen Nonwang sighed softly.</p>
<p>Shaolon, do you also think I&#x27;m too impulsive? and he must have her reasons for doing this and Gallon will only support her. Dugu Jaalon slowly walked out from a corner of the room and said softly, &quot;Dugu Nanuang was present the entire time while she was talking to Khalil Jibron. The Japanese assassination attempt on Lin Shiao brought back some bad memories for me.&quot; Dugu Nanuang gestured for Jaon to sit down facing her. I&#x27;ve never told you how your parents died. Dugu Jaolan immediately understood and his voice became slightly serious.</p>
<p>Is it also related to the Japanese? That&#x27;s right. Back then, I was just a chief lord following in the footsteps of my sister and brother-in-law fighting together for dragon. My brother-in-law is the lord of Lshia. Back then, he led Lia in the 36th war against Japan. In the early stages of the war, after years of forbearance and biting his time, Lang Shia had recovered a great deal of strength.</p>
<p>We launched a surprise attack and forced the Japanese to retreat in defeat. Dugu Nanuang sis, but it was quickly replaced by her usual coldness. But who knew that just as the war between the two countries was raging, my sister and brother-in-law were assassinated in Lsha Kingdom and both died. Dugu Jaolons eyes darkened. Although there is no conclusive evidence.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I found traces of chakra energy unique to Japan. A small amount of holy aura and my sister and brother-in-laws wounds match the wounds on the Japanese sword. Therefore, Dugan Nanuang said coldly, &quot;This matter is inextricably linked to the Japanese. The other chief lords and I all believe that the assassination was carried out by the Japanese. But even if we knew, what could we do? When two countries are at war, they will stop at nothing.</p>
<p>Can we go to another country to complain about the death of our leader? I was appointed to succeed as the lord of the dragon summer domain in a time of crisis. But in the end, I was still unable to maintain the advantage that my sister had built up. That battle ended in a draw. This is also the only battle in nearly a hundred years that my long sha has not lost. Dugan Nanuang gave a self-deprecating laugh.</p>
<p>Then I fought another battle and you know the result. In return I have 10 years of peace and 10 years of being subservient. So today when I learned that Lin Sha had been assassinated, memories flashed through my mind and the forbearance of the past 10 years exploded overnight. There was both impulse and premeditation involved. Gudunang regained her aloof demeanor and smiled slightly at Gudu Jaolon.</p>
<p>Your classmate Lin Shiao also played a role. Lynn Sha Khalil Jabbrron has always told me that Lin Shia is one of the future hopes of Lia and his current performance is quite remarkable besides his mysterious identity and numerous scandals and entanglements. Dugu Jalon said, &quot;But it&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing that we all know about the ancient demons.&quot; And then there&#x27;s the demon race, his strange troops and heroes and his abilities. Duga Nanuang said, &quot;Although I&#x27;m covering for him, do you really believe his lord talent is only F- level, even with your SS level talent and my secret support, you still always lag behind him in the battle of 10,000 races.&quot; Auntie, that&#x27;s because my talent hasn&#x27;t been fully developed yet. Dugu Jaolan retorted unconvinced.</p>
<p>He Shaolan, your talent is very useful, so be sure not to forget to practice. Dugu Nanuang affectionately stroked Dugu Jaons hair and smiled. Grow up quickly. The future domain lord position is reserved for you. So Annie promised me I&#x27;d also participate in the heroic martial arts tournament.</p>
<p>Yes, the Dugo family has always been at the forefront. It&#x27;s good to gain more experience. Besides, my sister and brother-in-law kept it a secret very well. No one knows that you are their descendant. However, I have another task for you as well.</p>
<p>Just as the two stunning beauties of the Dugu family were discussing matters and Ding Lay and Tu Sha by Chin and the others were enthusiastically selecting a lord. Lynn Sha returned to the lord&#x27;s mansion. That&#x27;s how it happened. Jinglu. Do you have any suggestions? Whenever there are unresolved matters, whether internal or external, we can consult Wong Ming.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha thought to himself. Wong Mang stroked his thick beard and paced back and forth in the Lord&#x27;s mansion. I never imagined that this Japan would be so much stronger than I remembered, Wong Ming said. However, we should meet force with force and water with earth. The principle remains the same.</p>
<p>We should just deal with whatever comes our way. Having said that, Wong Ming stopped and slowly said, &quot;This martial arts arena is divided into two camps, one against the other and the other against each other. They fight soldiers, generals, and lords, and the tournament is a single elimination draw. The winners must continue to fight until the final champion is determined. All participating units must be at least level 50.</p>
<p>When it comes to fighting lords, it will inevitably be you, my lord, who will personally take the stage to deal with the enemy. Now that you are already a level 48 lord, you have a week to upgrade to level 49 and take the lead in level. Then it depends on how well you perform, my lord. To be honest, your martial arts skills are already among the best of the lords, and your equipment is impeccable, but just in case, you still need to learn from young master pay and get yourself a better set of armor.&quot; Lyn Sha nodded. Although he had an SSS level talent, his strength lay in his all-around abilities and lategame potential.</p>
<p>In a one-on-one fight, he might not be able to defeat an S-level specialized combat lord. It&#x27;s all right. I still have a trump card. I can strengthen myself at any time. And you&#x27;ll see when the time comes.</p>
<p>If he really couldn&#x27;t win, he could possess the spirit of an emperor and become a lu shioer Xiang Ji or someone who could crush his peers. Lyn Shao thought to himself. Then I can rest assured, Wong Ming continued. This duel is a contest of heroes and the one who will participate is undoubtedly Young Master Pay Min. Wong Ming exclaimed.</p>
<p>Young Master Pi is the sword saint of the Tang Dynasty. I have never seen anyone whose martial arts can surpass Young Master Pace. Lin Shia nodded in agreement. Pay Min is really strong in one-on-one combat. This round is the most stable.</p>
<p>In the soldiers duel, 100 soldiers must be selected to participate in the entire arena competition. Soldiers cannot be changed midway and they must fight until the very end. There are so many unit types to choose from. Melee and ranged, physical and magical, cavalry and infantry, as well as ninjas, assassins, rangers, and more. Wongming pondered for a moment and said, &quot;The troop type chosen for this level requires careful consideration from our lord.&quot; Chapter 177, summoning special forces, outwitting the Chinese order.</p>
<p>Indeed, the combat segment of the martial arts arena was a considerable challenge for Lin Sha. Lyn Sha possesses numerous legendary golden units from China, each with top tier strength, but none of them are truly well-rounded. There are the Iron Guards of the Mod Dao, armored brutes with maximum attack, defense, and health. One strike from them can shatter both men and horses. However, the iron guards of the Mod Dao cannot fight on horseback and have no ranged abilities.</p>
<p>The divine archer boasts incredible defense and a maximum range of 500 me. They are also formidable in close combat rivaling legendary melee units. However, the divine archer is not a cavalry unit and lacks speed and agility. White spear spearmen are powerful attackers with long spears and great swords. They also carry bows and can use ranged weapons as secondary weapons.</p>
<p>Their ranged abilities are comparable to epic archers. They are also a mobile unit that thrives in the mountains. However, White Spear spearman cannot ride horses and their defense is somewhat lacking. The Guan Ning iron cavalry as a cavalry unit was quite well-rounded, possessing ranged and melee combat skills, proficient in musketss, bows and arrows, spears, shortsords, and horseback riding. However, the Guan Ning iron cavalry could not fight on foot, which was a weakness, and their defense was not as good as that of the heavy infantry emo dao iron guards and shimi archers.</p>
<p>If the battle area is relatively small, the cavalry will be unable to maneuver effectively. Lynn Sha shook his head. There was also the great Han Champion cavalry here and after referred to as the champion cavalry. This was an exclusive cavalry unit recruited by Hoitzubing. They were good at long distance raids, extremely fast, and their bows and horse equipment were superb.</p>
<p>They were the ace of field battles, but similarly, their defense was not enough. They were only considered top level light cavalry. They also had no way to use their strength in small battlefields. The ranger, Payman&#x27;s exclusive unit, is indeed very strong. In a one-on-one battle, no one among his legendary units can defeat it.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao even suspects that the rangers attributes are close to those of a mythical unit. However, the recruitment speed for rangers is too slow and the current number is still too small, only a dozen or so. A dozen or so rangers would take turns attacking and each of them would experience combat intensity 10 times that of a normal soldier. Secondly, the range class is somewhat lacking in both ranged ability and defense and may encounter kiting tactics. This is a martial arts arena where both sides will fight to the death against Japan, not a friendly one-on-one sparring match.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao and Wong Ming both agreed that the selection of troops should be as full as possible. After all, this is a battle between nations, and Japan will definitely take it very seriously. As a long-established superpower, the types of troops they produce should have a great many of epic and legendary quality. Furthermore, in accordance with their style of killing their own lords for the sake of resource competition, the participating troops were to be a mix of ranged, melee, physical, magical, cavalry, and assassin units along with a number of suicide units. As long as we discover that Lia has powerful troops, we can use suicidal troops to deplete Lias troops, and victory will be a piece of cake.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, Lyn Sha realized that none of his current unit types seemed capable of reliably winning the match from the very beginning through a series of battles. Lyn Sha paced back and forth. I need special forces soldiers. Special forces? Wong Ming asked puzzled. The elite of the elite, proficient in almost all combat methods, Lin Shao said.</p>
<p>And also able to form battle formations. Only soldiers of this type can have the last laugh in the arena of martial arts. Wong Ming, a military strategist, asked with puzzlement, &quot;According to the rules of the battlefield of all races, recruitment tokens are for a single type of soldier. Could it be that Lord wants to recruit a new type of soldier that meets your requirements?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s right. Well recruit again.&quot; Lyn Sha quickly checked his myriad races battlefield energy and nodded.</p>
<p>He had used up all the myriad races battlefield energy when recruiting Wong Mang, but now he had several thousand units left, which should be enough to make a gamble. Lyn Shia took out the recruitment token. Use Hasha summoning to consume one energy point and summon a Hasha exclusive unit. Continue to consume the energy of the battlefield of myriad races and set the conditions for this Hasha summoning. Roll call.</p>
<p>Baywei army. Ding. Your Hasha token energy is insufficient. As expected, recruiting several thousand Bey warriors wouldn&#x27;t be enough. Lyn Sha thought to himself.</p>
<p>Beway army was the elite force within Eufay&#x27;s army. On horseback, they were heavy cavalry capable of charging into battle. On dismount, they were heavy infantry able to form ranks and fight. They could also use the divine crossbow for ranged attacks. They once decisively defeated tens of thousands of enemy troops under Wu with only a few hundred soldiers.</p>
<p>Change the targeted summons to iron eagle warrior. Ding exclusive unit already exists in the current dragon summer world. Cannot be summoned again. Lyn Sha was taken aback. There were still troop types that he couldn&#x27;t recruit with his hasha token.</p>
<p>There are also exclusive troop types that already exist in the dragon summer world. The Iron Eagle warriors been passed down to this day. Lynn Zhaos mind raced. He thought of something but quickly moved on from it as the current matter was the most important. Changed the targeted summons to Wei Wu Zu.</p>
<p>Ding. Your Hasha token energy is insufficient. Lyn Shia shook his head. Hua Ling, you&#x27;re too arrogant. The Chinese troops in your Chinese token are all legendary level.</p>
<p>Just those few dozen troops. If I just draw randomly, I&#x27;ll eventually draw the troops I want. You&#x27;re charging such a high price for a targeted summon. Then I&#x27;ll take a gamble. Lynn Shiao changed the recruitment conditions for the Hashia order again.</p>
<p>Requirement one for this event is a powerful unit capable of both ranged and melee combat with top tier attack, defense, speed, and stamina. Requirement two, able to serve as both cavalry and infantry. Requirement three, able to carry out special missions and also able to form battle formations and fight tough battles on the battlefield. The recruitment talisman flew into the sky. A portal appeared and a troop of soldiers materialized.</p>
<p>In the hazy light, it was clear they were clad in heavy armor, each holding a horse with long bows and spears slung across their backs and various other weapons at their waists. Ding! You have successfully recruited the soldier using the recruitment token. Meanwhile, at the city lord&#x27;s mansion on the arena set up by Ding Lei and his group, dozens of people had already passed the test. Among them were a group of lords who participated in the resource competition with Lin Shao. Zuli, Wong Bo, Shufunga, Guang Jun, Shunuandu, and others all came.</p>
<p>While Pans Shan Yu and Lu Jaoying who were resource type lords were persuaded to leave by Dinglay. Firstly, they are not good at fighting. Secondly, resource-based lords are indeed more valuable and should contribute their energy in the rear. In addition, there are some new experts. Anyone else want to join? He asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>He had already defeated several lords and was now both excited and exhausted. Who defeat him? Tu Shan by Chian and Chin Ningming are qualified to challenge Ding Lay. Haha. Is there anyone else who wants to test their skills against me? Tu Shan by Chian stood on the arena, hands on her hips, looking smug. We always thought we were weak, but after arriving in the official area, we realized that we are already considered strong.</p>
<p>He whispered to Tan by Chin with emotion. It&#x27;s all because we have a good boss. Tu Shan by Chin nodded. Of course, my little sister herself is also very powerful. Sha, with your skill level, I bet the other guys just don&#x27;t want the fight to get in the way of your Lolita outfit and embarrass you.</p>
<p>Then I&#x27;m still better than you. As the two were bickering, a figure slowly approached. He was tall and thin and slowly raised his head. I also want to participate in this martial arts arena. Who are you? Lynn douching.</p>
<p>Tu Shan by Chin and Heay exchanged a glance. They couldn&#x27;t recognize the person in front of them, but the name seemed somewhat familiar. Chapter 178. The addition of two first place winners. Lynn Douching.</p>
<p>Lynn Douching. The two exchanged a glance and shrugged. I think I&#x27;ve heard of it, but you also need to pass the test to participate in the heroic martial arts arena. Sorry. We need capable people to guarantee our chances of winning.</p>
<p>I understand. Please make your move. Lynn Douching said expressionlessly, his emotions completely unaffected. No assessment is needed. He conjoined directly.</p>
<p>A voice came from behind. It was Ding Lay. The tall and imposing Ding Lay walked slowly towards us with a smile on his face. Lynn Douching, the first genius lord to enter the official zone in the Lan region last year. Later, due to certain events, I chose to become an official in the Lan district as a reserve cadre.</p>
<p>Although my leveling speed slowed down, my strength was still there. People like this don&#x27;t need to be assessed to participate in this competition. Dinglay extended his hand and shook hands with Lind Douching. It&#x27;s an honor to meet you. Lynn Daoings expression remained unchanged and he nodded slightly to Ding Lay.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t expect anyone would still remember me, the person who became dejected after entering the official area. Dinglay laughed and said, &quot;I remembered the names of all the geniuses from the previous year because I originally wanted to be one of them. You have already achieved it,&quot; Lin Daoing said calmly. &quot;Certainly,&quot; Dinglay responded with a smug look. A smuggness that even made Lin Dao, who had been calm and collected, pause for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;By the way, as an official of Lan District, why are you participating in the martial arts arena? I became an official naturally for my ideals and now I&#x27;m participating in the martial arts arena naturally for my ideals as well. I never expected that last year&#x27;s top ranked newbie lord would be an idealist. A clear melodious voice drifted over from afar. However, I think your participation in the heroic martial arts arena has more to do with that, doesn&#x27;t it? Ding Li and Lin Daoing turned around at the same time and a stunningly beautiful figure dressed in purple slowly walked over. Dug Jalon, the first person from Lan District to be promoted to a formal district this year.</p>
<p>Dinglay looked at Lin Daoing, then at Dugu Jaon. His expression a mixture of confusion and surprise. Two top masters have arrived at the same time. Could it be that they both want to join the heroic martial arts arena? Lin Daoing looked at Dugu Jaolan who was slowly walking towards him and suddenly smiled saying calmly, &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Mansion in Lan City, broadcasting the entire conflict with Yamamoto Isuroku. The officials of the entire Lan district were furious.</p>
<p>In the end, the result of my punishment was that I was asked to participate in this heroic martial arts arena. You&#x27;re the one who started the live stream.&quot; Ding Lay and the others were all surprised. It is indeed I, Lynn Douching said proudly, bowing slightly. Boss, please accept my bow. Heay immediately stepped forward.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve always admired brother Lin Shiao and now I want to say I admire you too. Tu Shan by Chin followed suit. The usually tacetern Chin Ningming also turned his head and gave Lynn Douching a serious look. In recent times, Lynn Shiao has undoubtedly been the most talked about person. He first defeated the celestial beings organization leader who had descended from the broken zone with the abilities of a novice lord and wiped out the entire legendary and epic legion of black flame.</p>
<p>He left behind the inspiring and bold statement. Since there are no more torches, I am the only light which shocked the entire LN district. Upon entering the official zone, they immediately won the resource competition, exposed Kenzo Dohura&#x27;s conspiracy, and ruined his reputation. It also brought 10 times the resource rewards and luck charms that increased lifespan and resources to everyone in the LN region. Then, in the city lord&#x27;s mansion, in front of tens of millions of people watching the live broadcast, he angrily rebuked the Japanese envoy and accepted the challenge of the martial arts arena.</p>
<p>He was immediately promoted by Lord Dugu to the position of deputy city lord of Lnon City who have entered the battlefield of 10,000 races in recent years and everything he does attracts the attention of thousands of people. He himself never makes a mistake. His words and actions are consistent and he is both passionate and composed. Lynn Shiao has already become an idol for young lords in recent years. And the person who started the live stream is the unsung hero that everyone is looking for.</p>
<p>It was he who made the scene of Lin Sha speaking out for justice spread online, exposing the conspiracy of the Japanese. It was he who enraged Lord Dugu, who ordered Chu Yusi to deal with more than a dozen officials on the spot, rectify the atmosphere in the Lan region, and bring the L non region together as one again. Lynn Douching did all of this. Just starting a live stream. Why are you being asked to enter the heroic martial arts arena? This punishment is quite peculiar, Dinglay asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>This is the result of Lord Dugu&#x27;s strenuous efforts. Lynn Douching said calmly. Because of my live broadcast, the officials of the entire Lan district made a fool of themselves and were criticized by the Lord and the people. My actions have greatly affected the stability of the Lan district, infuriating these officials. Lynn Douching smiled faintly.</p>
<p>They are obsequious to outsiders, but they still have some skills and methods when it comes to internal affairs. Even though both Lord Chu and Lord Dugu have stated that they will not pursue the matter, some officials still brought up certain regulations and articles to punish me. It was Lord Dugu who was well-versed in legal principles and found a way for me to redeem myself. I see. Dingle and the others all shook their heads inside.</p>
<p>Lin Daoings secret live broadcast exposed the Japanese conspiracy and united the people of Long Nan district to fight against the enemy. But this also slapped the face of those incompetent officials. So he was ostracized and forced to participate in this martial arts arena. Don&#x27;t worry, although I took a minor official position to improve the atmosphere when I first entered the official district, and my strength hasn&#x27;t improved quickly enough, I still have the ability and won&#x27;t hold anyone back. Then welcome to join us.</p>
<p>Ding Li and the others registered Lynn Douching. Do you want to participate in a duel, a contest of soldiers or generals or a duel? I&#x27;ll participate. Me too. I&#x27;m joining the heroic arena this time. However, I only participate in duels and duels.</p>
<p>Dugu Jaon, who was standing to the side, also said calmly. Welcome, welcome. Dinglay laughed heartily. The winners from last year and this year are here, which increases our chances of winning even more. Brother Lin Shia will be so happy to have two such powerful ally figures.</p>
<p>Tu Shan by Chin interjected. If we all help brother Lynn Shia clear out the weaker opponents, he&#x27;ll be able to win the championship more easily. Lynn Douching and Dug Jaolon exchanged a glance and both smiled. I&#x27;m helping the Lon region. If we can fight to the end, I won&#x27;t give up the championship.</p>
<p>The Duga family is never satisfied with second place. Oh, Tu Shan by Chin stood there stunned. He could only smile awkwardly and pull her away, whispering, &quot;Geniuses are all proud and arrogant. How can you directly say that they are not as good as boss Lyn Sha? Tell me quietly.&quot; Lynn douching. Hey, you kid with dark circles under your eyes.</p>
<p>I can hear you. A few days later, the prelude to this national destiny contest, which has attracted the attention of billions of people, the heroic martial arts arena, officially began. At the border between the two countries under the watchful eyes of Dugu Jaolan and Tojo Hideayaki, the chief strategist of the Eastern Kingdom, the main god system slowly lowered a massive multi-purpose arena. Chapter 179. The battle begins.</p>
<p>Ronin appeared. As the ring slowly descended, the contestants from both countries entered the arena. At a great distance, Dug Nanuang and Donga Inkuan listened to the message from the god system and nodded in confirmation once again as leaders of a nation, officially opening the heroic arena. In an instant, all channels in the Lan region and even the entire Lang Sha Kingdom started broadcasting live, showing this competition between elite young people from two great nations. The giant arena begins to slowly fold, only appearing when the corresponding scene is used, eventually leaving only the most basic area to display the two people fighting in the arena.</p>
<p>The heroic arena descends upon the border between the two nations of the battle of 10,000 races. There are no live spectators. All battles are broadcast live by the main god system. Each country sends a team accompanied by a team leader with the rest of the participants being participating lords, heroes, and troops. When the main god system determines that one side has lost, the battle will only end when the participating lord or team leader voluntarily concedes defeat.</p>
<p>The judgment criteria of the god system are generally very broad and it often stops the fight only after one side has already died. This is one of the reasons why the heroic martial arts arena is so brutal. The basic terrain gradually took shape and the lords of both sides gradually became clearly visible. It&#x27;s here. It&#x27;s here.</p>
<p>In longa&#x27;s various live streams, quite a few people were paying attention to this matter and some people immediately started shouting excitedly. Wow, so many new faces. There are so many people I don&#x27;t recognize. Of course, only those below level 50 can participate in the heroic arena. So, it&#x27;s mostly new lords from the last few years.</p>
<p>Moreover, most of them are from the Lan region. It&#x27;s normal that you from Long Bay don&#x27;t recognize them because the Lan region started this whole thing. So, the Lan region took the initiative to shoulder the responsibility. From the live stream perspective, the lords from the Lan region participating in this competition waited quietly in a hall. They were either sitting or standing, showing no signs of tension and appearing very relaxed.</p>
<p>Holy crap, I saw an absolutely gorgeous woman. Someone with sharp eyes shouted, &quot;That&#x27;s the top ranked rookie lord in the Lan region this year, Dugu Jaolon.&quot; A voice reminded them. It&#x27;s the Dugu family. One of the four great families of Langsha Kingdom. They&#x27;re from the same family as our domain lord.</p>
<p>The Dugu family is indeed powerful, producing many great experts. That&#x27;s Lynn Douching over there. He was the number one rookie lord in the Lan region last year. In the live stream, Dugu Jaolan, dressed in purple, resembled a serene and aloof lotus flower, radiating a dazzling light that made it difficult to look directly at her. Regardless of her actual strength, everyone watching the live stream could tell that she was the most beautiful new lord of the year.</p>
<p>M Dingle, Chufunga, Guang Jun, Shenda, Julie, and Wong Bo are all experts. This person then began to list the other top competitors. It&#x27;s best not to lose these experts. They are all promising candidates for future Chief Lords. Wow, there&#x27;s also a busted girl wearing animal ears and white Lolita stockings.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m drooling. Be serious. That&#x27;s Lin Xiao&#x27;s vassel Lord Tu Shan Chien. Tan by Chian. Then the man with dark circles under his eyes next to her must be he.</p>
<p>He really does look like he has kidney deficiency. These people are here to participate in the heroic martial arts arena. Aren&#x27;t they qualified? Anyway, it was all arranged by Lin Shao. Lyn Shiao is the deputy city lord of Lan City in charge of this martial arts arena. His status is only below the team leader Chu Yusi.</p>
<p>Oh, Lyn Shao is out. In the live broadcast room, Lin Shao slowly walked over. He first came to Lin Dao Chung and the two exchanged pleasantries. Then Lin Sha came to Dugu Jaolan and talked to her. &quot;What a perfect couple,&quot; someone exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, Dugu Jaolan is exceptionally beautiful and Lin Shiao is handsome and imposing, the two standing together are truly a feast for the eyes. Unfortunately, the Dugu family is a powerful clan. Even if Dugu Jaolon is just an ordinary member of the family, it is not something that a commoner like Lin Sha can get his hands on.&quot; H commoner? Hasn&#x27;t Lynn Shiao already become the deputy city lord? We&#x27;re still quite far from the Dugu family. All right, stop arguing. Let&#x27;s look at Japan.</p>
<p>Holy crap. Isn&#x27;t that Sakura Shikaru and Roland, too? Weren&#x27;t they locked up in prison? How did they get out? From another live stream perspective, dozens of Japanese contestants were kneeling upright on the ground with their team leader, Yamamoto Isuroku, holding a samurai sword and sternly reprimanding them. Among these lords kneeling on the ground were Sakura, Shichiro, and Roland, who had committed heinous crimes in the resource competition. The Japanese are really stubborn. Aren&#x27;t they afraid these two will continue to kill their own kind? Maybe they&#x27;re just being used as cannon fodder.</p>
<p>Hei, Sakura, Shichiro, and Roland are both lords with S-class talents. It&#x27;s impossible to leave them and used. As for how to use them, whether to redeem them or to use them in the death row camp, it all depends on the Japanese leader arrangements. Everyone agreed that this made sense. And then they looked at the ID.</p>
<p>Gene Wuang, what are you doing here again? Why can&#x27;t I come? You, the chief lord, have way too much free time. Don&#x27;t you need to be stationed and fighting outside? I am merely an avatar, Gene Wuang said smuggly. This is one of my signature techniques. Oh, I see. It&#x27;s a clone with no combat power.</p>
<p>The kind that Lin Sha completely ignored on the spot. Gene Wuang. The live stream was noisy, and everyone seemed to have gotten used to the unpretentious, knowledgeable, and somewhat amusing patriarch of the Gene family. The fact that Gene Wuang spoke up for Lin Sha back then shows that although he liked to laugh strangely, he didn&#x27;t really take Lin Xiao&#x27;s past actions to heart. All right, the ceremony in Japan is finally over.</p>
<p>Dozens of lords from the east sea drank the wine in front of them, smashed it on the ground, tied white cloth strips around their foreheads, and had ferocious expressions. Hey, they shouted in unison. Their momentum was astounding. Everyone exclaimed in amazement. This is the Bushidto spirit of Japan.</p>
<p>Their fighting will is extremely strong. The first phase of the heroic arena and the specialized arena has officially begun. fighting soldiers. The god system has begun selecting lords, starting the elimination rounds. The radiance fell upon a lord of the eastern kingdom.</p>
<p>The lord stepped forward, shouted loudly, and those around him clenched their fists to cheer him on. Go, let dragon kingdom witness the true power of an eastern superpower. Let the remnants of Langia&#x27;s army witness the power of my Japanese soldiers. With a flash of light, the lord vanished and reappeared in a wilderness, the wilderness arena. The participating lords are surrounded by an invisible light curtain from the god system and suspended in midair.</p>
<p>They can only summon their own troops in command and watch their troops, but they cannot participate in the battle themselves. He simply waved his hand and 100 Japanese ronin appeared. I, Honda Toyurro, along with my fellow Japanese Ronin, challenge you all. People of Lang Shia Kingdom, make your move. Everyone shifted their attention to Lia&#x27;s side where light flowed and the god system was selecting people.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia raised his foot and kicked he in the butt. It&#x27;s your turn. Then the radiance of the Supreme God fell precisely on Heay. Chapter 180. A shocking surprise.</p>
<p>The flower fairy makes a great contribution. Heay was kicked away by Lin Sha and just then the light of the god system shone on him causing him to disappear into the air. When it reappeared, it was already on a desolate battlefield. He sporting two huge dark circles under his eyes looked around blankly. Is it my turn already? Across from him, Honda Toyurro glared and shouted, &quot;Who goes there? State your name.</p>
<p>He never heard of it.&quot; Honda Fuji Chiro shook his head. My unit is the epic unit, the Japanese Ronin. Every one of them is a Japanese samurai, highly skilled in martial arts and fearless in the face of death. What class of soldier are you? He scratched the back of his head, summoned his 100 flower fairies, and said guilty, &quot;Are they elite troops?&quot; &quot;What? Flower fairies? Elite troops dare to participate? You really don&#x27;t know the immensity of heaven and earth. Eay gave a ry smile.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t understand either. The boss tells me to go, so I go anyway. I don&#x27;t have to fight. Honda Toyurro sneered. I see you don&#x27;t take this arena battle seriously.</p>
<p>Then I&#x27;ll send your flower fairy on her way sooner. Honda Toyurro waved his hand. And 100 Japanese Ronin, shouting and grinning menacingly, charged forward. The live stream room, which was just filled with anticipation, is now in complete chaos. Lia actually sent he and they used the flower fairy, a highly skilled soldier who is good for nothing but beauty.</p>
<p>How can we fight like this? A ronin could kill the three-headed flower demon with a single slash. Lyn Shia, is the Lia team just messing around? The flower fairies were still looking at each other, completely bewildered. My lord, Yao Yao is still sleeping. What&#x27;s wrong? The charging ronin had already swiftly swung his sword and killed the outermost flower fairy. Pathetic, Honda Toyurro said disdainfully.</p>
<p>Demons, fight them. I&#x27;ll treat you to a feast in my next life. Seeing the flower fairy being chased by the ronin and thinking that this was the first battle of the heroic martial arts arena with countless people watching his performance, he raised his arm and shouted, &quot;This is boring.&quot; The sleepy flower fairies were chased away by the Japanese Ronin and few of them were interested in fighting back. &quot;Fight, I&#x27;ll give you 3 days off in your next life.&quot; He then patiently guided him. Yao Yao is naturally good at slacking off and lacks motivation.</p>
<p>Then I will ask a magician to fertilize the roots of your plants. Huh? Last time it was that old lecher who came leerously splashing water on people. Yao Yao, a proper soldier, doesn&#x27;t like that at all. In the live stream, everyone couldn&#x27;t help but put their hands to their foreheads. What the hell is this farce? You keep saying next life all the time.</p>
<p>Is this how you motivate your troops to fight? Honda Fujiaro couldn&#x27;t help but taunt. Even if your flower fairy dares to fight back, what can she do? Weak elite troops simply cannot break through the defenses of my epic troops. I think the only use of flower fairies is to be sold to brothel in my great Japanese empire as service staff. Huh? You damned old Japanese bastard. A flower fairy cursed as she ran away.</p>
<p>Although Yao Yao is very adventurous, she can only touch things that Yao Yao likes. Yao Yao only likes lords and dukes. Hearing this, Heay, who was exhausted from shouting, suddenly had a sudden thought. Fight demons. If you fight with all your might, I&#x27;ll let you touch my boss Lin Xiaos abs in your next life.</p>
<p>Huh? All the flower fairies present stopped and looked at he in disbelief. Yay, that&#x27;s great. Charge sisters, fight for glory. Before Honda, Fuji Chiro, and the Japanese Ronin could react, the flower fairies that had been fleeing suddenly turned back and swiftly unleashed a barrage of poisonous seeds at the Japanese Ronin. What? This cowardly flower fairy isn&#x27;t fleeing, but is actually approaching my troops.</p>
<p>Caught off guard, dozens of Japanese Ronin were directly hit by the poison gas and began to bend over and cough. Baka the Japanese Ronin who had been ambushed by the flower fairy coughed a few times but quickly recovered and was furious with embarrassment. How dare you, my esteemed epic unit. Insult me. Prepare to die.</p>
<p>With a single stroke, the Japanese Ronin killed another flower demon. These Japanese ronin are all powerful Japanese samurai who have been defeated in battle. Although their strength has not reached the golden legend level, they should not be underestimated. Gene Wuang then explained, &quot;The reason Japan send out Ronin is mainly because they value their fearless nature and the methods of desperat. No matter which type of unit Lia chooses, the Ronin can inflict extremely fierce losses on Lshia&#x27;s units.</p>
<p>Even if Lia produces a golden legendary character, it may be lost due to the Ronin&#x27;s exhaustion and its stamina may be severely reduced. It is very likely that it will not be able to last in the next battle.&quot; This is the Japanese tactic. If Lia sends out powerful troops at the beginning, they will be worn down like this and will not be able to achieve final victory. And the weaker troops are no match for the Japanese Ronin. Lia&#x27;s side is quite clever.</p>
<p>They directly send out the flower fairy. Since they&#x27;re going to lose anyway, they might as well use the flower fairy to minimize their losses. Gene Wuangs words resonated with everyone in the chat channel. So that&#x27;s how it is. The lords of Lshia do have brains after all.</p>
<p>Breaking the morale of the Japanese is also a good tactic. But before he could finish speaking, a flower fairy on the battlefield suddenly exploded. Yao Yao wants to be the first to touch the lord&#x27;s abs. The flower spirit charged into the ranks of the ronin, scattering poisonous seeds before suddenly exploding. Bang! Purple poisonous mist sprayed out, and the force of the explosion knocked over a group of Ronin.</p>
<p>Uh my eyes. A group of ronin were blown to the face by the flower demon and rolled on the ground in pain. What? Honda Fujiro was shocked again. Shameless. They actually used unit self-destruction to wear me down.</p>
<p>Defense. Defense. With these shouts, the Ronin quickly formed ranks. But the flower fairies didn&#x27;t give them a chance. One by one, they fearlessly rushed forward and self-destructed.</p>
<p>Baka, how come they aren&#x27;t afraid of death? Have they really been bewitched? The ronin&#x27;s formation was thrown into chaos, and the flower fairies kept spraying poisonous seeds to confuse their vision before self-destructing. The sounds of explosions mingled with the laughter of the flower fairies and the jostling and pushing of them. Me first. Me first. I&#x27;ll go first.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Honda Toarro noticed that the ronin poisoned by the flower demon were in increasing pain. And those whose eyes were blasted out were no longer moving and had died. Shameless. Honda Fuji Churro wanted to admit defeat, but all the flower fairies self-destructed in that short time. All the Ronin were stunned by the explosion.</p>
<p>Although they only suffered minor injuries, they were all poisoned by the flower demon. I surrender. I surrender. Honda Toyurro shouted. Battle over.</p>
<p>He the contestant from Long Sha Kingdom has lost all his units and is declared the loser. The voice of the main god system came through. Honda Fujiro quickly ran towards his unit. On the ground, nearly half of the Japanese Ronin were lying down while the other half were rolling around in pain and howling. Baka, they&#x27;re all poisoned.</p>
<p>Quickly, take them back to our territory for treatment. With a flash of light, Honda Toyurro and the remaining Ronin all disappeared. Ding! Player Honda Toyurro has withdrawn from the battle and will be unable to participate in subsequent arena matches. The next match begins. Everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>Chapter 181. Falling into a disadvantageous position, Lin Shiao makes his appearance. The first match on the martial arts arena shocked the people of both countries. This is truly a series of unexpected twists and turns, someone murmured. I originally thought the flower fairy was used to mess with the Japanese mentality, but I didn&#x27;t expect the flower fairy to actually work.</p>
<p>When I saw the flower fairy go up, I thought it was a hidden unit, but I didn&#x27;t expect it still couldn&#x27;t defeat the Japanese Ronin. I thought the flower fairies were going to be completely defeated, but they turned out to self-destruct, and they&#x27;re also highly poisonous. The Japanese were so frightened they immediately surrendered thinking the flower fairies were going to win. But then they all self-destructed and the battle was declared a loss. We thought the arena was over, but their poison knocked out all the Ronin and the opposing lord also gave up the match.</p>
<p>Did we actually make a profit? We made a profit. Of course, we made a profit, Gene Wuang said with satisfaction. The superior flower fairy unit replaced 100 epic units. How could it not be profitable? Harah, we&#x27;ve also dampened the arrogance of those bastards on the other side, making them afraid to use such underhanded tactics again. That&#x27;s a win.</p>
<p>Yes, Lord Long Lia did a great job. When dealing with enemies, you have to be even more ruthless than them. Everyone agreed, but some were still a little hesitant. It is really inhumane for the flower demon to self-destruct. Oomph.</p>
<p>The heroic martial arena is inherently a place of extreme violence. Since we&#x27;re going to die anyway, it&#x27;s worth it to take such a strong enemy down with us. If I were Heay, I would burn some paper money for the flower fairies as a reward. No wonder that kid he always talks about the next life. Someone realized rewarding flower fairies for their next life.</p>
<p>What kind of devilish way of boosting morale is this? It really is a next life. They&#x27;ll all self-destruct. By the way, why did he say he would reward the flower fairy by letting her touch Lyn Xiao&#x27;s abs in her next life? An eerie silence fell over the live stream. It seemed no one could answer the strange question. Ahem, let&#x27;s keep watching the battle.</p>
<p>The next contestant is about to enter. It&#x27;s Lynn douching. The main god systems combat phase initially started as an elimination tournament where all lords who signed up for combat would be selected to participate. The main god system will actively assess the strength of the contestants and randomly select them from within a range. Of course, each participating team can also send its own people.</p>
<p>After the bizarre battle between the flower fairies and epic troops, the Japanese dared not act rashly, fearing that Lynn Sha might cause some further trouble. They could only let the god system randomly select a lord. Meanwhile, in Langia, Lind Daing and a Japanese lord were also teleported to the heroic battlefield at the same time. This time, the battlefield is set in a small forest. Lind Douching smiled slightly and with a wave of his hand, a 100 female fairies with elucory wings on their backs, wearing purpleointed soft hats, with dark skin and beautiful figures flew out.</p>
<p>What? Another flower fairy? The lords of Japan were takenback. They were almost driven to PTSD by Heizay&#x27;s self-destructing flower demon. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a dream demon. This epic unit, which looks very much like a flower fairy, is almost the strongest among the fairy class. This time, the Eastern Kingdom randomly selected a tall and majestic lord who summoned the Nodachi samurai, which is also an epic unit.</p>
<p>Japan is really strong. Lynn Shiao, who was watching the battle from the sidelines, said calmly. Both of the lords are epic level units. This is the foundation of an old empire. Chu Yusi, who was in charge of the team, was also watching the match.</p>
<p>He tilted his head and asked, &quot;Do you think Lin Daing has a chance of winning?&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; Lin Shao said. &quot;A person who can get first place must have some skills.&quot; Sure enough, shortly after the battle began, the dream demons took advantage of the fair&#x27;s speed and high affinity with the forest to enter the forest and engage in battle with the Nodachi samurai. Under Lind Daings command, the fairies outnumbered the enemy, gaining a local advantage and slowly whittling down the nomadic katana warriors. In the end, Lind Daing lost 12 dream demons, but annihilated the enemy army. The nodachi samurai did not put much pressure on Lind Daing at all.</p>
<p>Dragon Sia Kingdom secured a victory. I have fulfilled my mission. Lind Daoing said calmly upon returning. You still have the strength to fight again. So, let&#x27;s look forward to your performance in the second round.</p>
<p>Chu Yuzi was very pleased. The victory of Lia Kingdom greatly encouraged the viewers watching the live broadcast. And amidst the cheers of the crowd, the third elimination round began. The third match was still randomly selected. Lya&#x27;s team had a lord who had been selected by Ding Lelay and others and he encountered Ing Shichiro on the other side.</p>
<p>Sakura Shichiro S unit type is Tatommy archer, a legendary gold unit and a renowned ace archer of the Eastern Kingdom. Although their range capabilities are similar to those of the long bowman of the British Empire, their range is not as long. But the archers of the Far River region also possess a certain degree of melee combat ability. As expected, Lord Lia had his head shaved. The superior troops of Lia couldn&#x27;t even get close to the archers of Yuan Jang before they were riddled with arrows.</p>
<p>Damn it, what bad luck! We ran into the enemy&#x27;s ace. How can someone as guilty as Sakura Shichiro be allowed to participate in the heroic martial arts tournament? Faced with the crowd&#x27;s righteous indignation, Gene Wuang slowly said, &quot;In the current elimination rounds, someone will always encounter Sakura Shichiro. Luck doesn&#x27;t matter.&quot; As for the guilty, their crimes are committed by Japan, and their decision to go on stage is also made by Japan. Victory is more important than anything else. Let&#x27;s see what happens next.</p>
<p>Battle after battle ensued with Lia&#x27;s team giving their all against the aggressive Japanese team. Each time when the Japanese side selected a particular lord, Lin Shiao and Chu Yusi immediately countered by using units that countered each other. When Liao went first, he chose to play randomly to avoid being exploited by the Japanese. However, over the past 1 or 2,000 years, the accumulated knowledge and experience of the developed countries of Japan have ultimately been beyond the reach of the Dragon Sea. Even though Lia had tried its best to develop tactics against Japan, the difference in the quality of its troops still made the outcome of the battle extremely unpredictable.</p>
<p>Apart from Chufinga&#x27;s leopard berserker narrowly defeating Roland&#x27;s Japanese monk soldiers, Dinglays Naga Queen narrowly defeating the Japanese warrior ninjas, and about 10 others, including Julie, Wong Bo, Chinuanandu, and Guang Jun, achieving victories in the dueling rounds. All other lords suffered defeats. Meanwhile, nearly 30 people in Japan have already achieved victory. There&#x27;s no way around it. The participating troops from Japan are mainly epic level or at the very least the strongest among the excellent level troops, and the five lords, including Sakura Shichiro, are actually legendary gold tier units.</p>
<p>Now, Chu Yusi will be under a lot of pressure. Gene Wuang commented, &quot;In the next round of battle, these 10 or so people from Lang Shia Kingdom will have to fight against nearly 30 people from Donging. On average, each lord&#x27;s troops have to fight three times as many enemies. If we win, we must continue fighting until all units are down. It seems we&#x27;re going to lose the first round of the heroic martial arts arena,&quot; Gene Wuang said, somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;Old devil, have you forgotten someone?&quot; A viewer bluntly reminded Gene Wuang, have you forgotten how your descendants died? Gene Wuang, are you ever going to stop? If you dare bring this up again, I&#x27;ll come down through the internet and refine you into the 10,000 souls banner. All right, I forgot someone. There&#x27;s still one person from Longa who hasn&#x27;t played yet. He created several new types of soldiers and generously shared his training methods. Although I haven&#x27;t mastered them yet, overalls have gone up in price.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha has made his appearance. Chapter 182. The white armored Bayer makes his debut. The light from the god system stopped flashing and landed directly on Lin Sha. Everyone held their breath quietly anticipating what tricks this young man on whom all the people of Lshia had placed their hopes would pull.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha has arrived. Old demon, what kind of troops do you think he will send out? Guster, Cullinan, or Shining. Lynn Shia, who was casually browsing the comments in the live stream, almost burst out laughing. The Rolls-Royce model name and military unit that I made up myself are now being passed down by word of mouth and actually being used by people. Lyn Sha shook his head slightly, wondering which name he would have to make up this time.</p>
<p>Some people have researched Lynn Shiao and know that he previously used a powerful and mysterious unit to defeat the Black Flame Legion, so they have some understanding of him. Gene Wuang chuckled twice, staring intently at the live stream and said, &quot;I think Lyn Sha has no problem winning once or twice with his strength, but to win every time and keep winning until the end, I think it&#x27;s a bit risky whether it&#x27;s the Gust Archer Cullinan Iron Cavalry or the Flash Spirit Iron Guard. There are five golden legendary units in Japan as well as so many powerful epic units. They will definitely target Lin Xiao&#x27;s units. So, I&#x27;m also very much looking forward to seeing what type of troops Lin Sha will use.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, the entire Japanese team also knelt on the floor with solemn expressions. The light fell on the last man, so the strongest one is chosen last, huh? Sakura Shichiro muttered unconvinced. As an S-rank talent lord, his eyes never left the even more imposing man before him. Yamamoto Isuroku approached the man and solemnly handed him his sword. Toyottomy Jinichiro Kuen, I beg you, the man stood up, bowed deeply, and accepted the sword.</p>
<p>I will not fail in my mission. A flash of light and the man vanished. Lyn Shiao and Toyottomy Jinichiro both appeared on the battlefield opened up by the main god system. This is a battlefield with complex terrain, including hills, streams, groves, and wilderness. Lynn Shao immediately spotted the extraordinary and murderous man opposite him.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao, I am Toyi Jenny. Please remember my name. I look forward to your guidance in the upcoming battle. The information Shu Yusi had given Lynn Shiao quickly came to mind. Toyottomy Jinichiro is one of the most outstanding young lords in Japan in all of Japan.</p>
<p>The lord&#x27;s talent is guaranteed to be at least srank and higher talents are not out of the question. Born into one of the five great families of Japan, he was trained from a young age in combat skills, strategy, tauist magic, knowledge, and martial arts. And he had virtually no weaknesses. Take this. Toyottomy Jinichiro summoned his own troops.</p>
<p>fiery red vests, fiery red armor, fiery red banners, and long spears in hand. It was a heavily armored cavalry unit whose entire color scheme was red. The Teada Red Guard. The thought flashed through Linhao&#x27;s mind. It&#x27;s the Teada Red Guard, the most powerful heavy cavalry in the Japanese Empire, capable of facing off against the three major European cavalry regiments.</p>
<p>Moreover, they are more flexible, able to form formations to charge the enemy or become skirmishers to harass them. Someone in the live stream exclaimed in surprise, &quot;This can be considered one of the most amazing golden legends in Japan. Where is Lyn Shao? Is Lin Sha using the Flash Spirit Iron Guard? The Flash Spirit Iron Guard can counter heavy cavalry?&quot; Not necessarily. Once a unit type is selected, it cannot be changed. If Lyn Shiao chooses the Flash Spirit Iron Guard, he will be at a disadvantage against ranged and magic units.</p>
<p>Look, Lyn Xiaos troops are coming out. As everyone waited expectantly, Lyn Xiaos troops emerged from the portal. This is a group of soldiers dressed in white armor and riding tall horses. Their gleaming silver white armor covered their entire bodies, somewhat like the Guan Ning cavalry, but denser and thicker from their calves to their thighs to their groin, waist, breastplate, handguards, shoulder guards, and helmets. All were uniformly white.</p>
<p>The white helmets were topped with long gun tips, and beneath them, their fierce eyes and scarred, rough-skinned faces were visible. Their facial features were also quite unique with higher foreheads and more prominent jaws which combined with their sparse beards left a deep impression on everyone. Some people in the live stream gasped when they saw these white armored warriors appear as if a kind of fear was ingrained in their blood. He&#x27;s like a devil, someone murmured. These white armored warriors rode on armored horses, but their weapons were dazzlingly varied.</p>
<p>They carried long bows and long musketss on their backs and had 70 arrows in their quivers at their waists. In addition, he was equipped with a 4 m long spear, a sword, a dagger, a short axe, a sickle, a pistol, short spear, a whip, 40 hemp ropes, two woolen ropes, and four steel spears, javelin. These weapons, either hanging from the waist or tied to the horse, though numerous, did not appear crowded in front of the burly combat troops. They had a full hundred riders which were quickly summoned and lined up in formation. Lyn Shiao, I do not kill nameless ghosts.</p>
<p>What kind of soldiers have you summoned? My Teada Red Guard will make them die knowing why. From afar, Toyotomy Jenny shouted, &quot;What are their names?&quot; Lyn Shaol looked at the hundred white armored warriors with a complicated expression, finally made up his mind, and said loudly, &quot;White armor Baya, it would be their honor to die at the hands of the white armored Bayer.&quot; After the red guards on the other side have had their necks washed clean, the knight at the head of Linhaos formation turned his head slowly to look at Lin Sha upon hearing this, then lowered his head and punched his chest. Then all the white armored knights turned around and bowed to Lynn Sha together. Calling them by their first names and allowing the white armored warriors to stand gloriously on the battlefield is a sign of the lord&#x27;s recognition of them. Ding! Your unita Aguedin has reached 100% loyalty, ready to go through fire and water.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the notification from the main god system, Lyn Shao silently nodded to the hundred white armored warriors. A god Buru, you will command this battle. Yes. The white armored warrior at the head of the group responded in a horse voice. His voice sounded eerie and shrill as if it were coming from two burnt broken gongs.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha sighed inwardly. He never expected that the special forces soldier he recruited would be by Jaayala. As a Han Chinese and a history enthusiast, he had some understanding of events in Chinese history, including how the Zu family was ultimately destroyed in another version of China and how the Manchu Ching dynasty implemented policies such as keep your head but not your hair, the 10 days massacre and the three massacres. Lyn Sha believes that a large part of the backwardness of modern Chinese history is due to the policies and actions of the backward Manchu rulers. Therefore, when this elite force from the earlyQing dynasty appeared before Lin Shiao, his thoughts were complicated.</p>
<p>First, their own Guan Ning cavalry became restless. Faced with their mortal enemy, the Guan Ning cavalry were taken away by Hoy Sububing for training, thus avoiding conflict. Secondly, this army composed of barbarian tarter soldiers showed a certain degree of maladjustment and vigilance on the battlefield of all races, which was unprecedented. Secondly, after testing the combat capabilities of this group of white armored Bayer, Lin Sha was extremely impressed with their fighting prowess. Chapter 183.</p>
<p>Defeating cavalry with infantry, white armored warriors, achieve merit. As an enemy, the power of Baala once made Lin Shiao, who was associated with the Zhu family and the Han people, hate him to the core. But then I thought, aren&#x27;t the white armored Bayera also a member of the great Hasha military? This group of people were born in the northeast, lived and prospered in the land of white mountains and black waters, and ultimately fought for the greater China. Even if the Manchus are backward and ignorant, what does that have to do with by Jia Alla, who is a warrior in that other world? Didn&#x27;t these Mans eventually settle in the northeast? Hundreds of years later, when that great nation was founded, the northeast became the eldest son of the republic, building heavy industry for the motherland and creating that golden age together. Therefore, Lynn Shiao convinced himself that he was now not only a Hanchinese, but also a representative of the entire Hasha people in this other world.</p>
<p>Since Huasha is a broad concept, the term can also be used to refer to the ethnic minorities of Hashia, specifically the Baala, who are part of Hashia. Aren&#x27;t the White Spear spear soldiers also soldiers of the southwestern barbarians? If we recruit the Keshik cavalry in the future, they will be the trump card of the Hanchinese and Mongol people. Such capable soldiers. If we can use them, then let&#x27;s use them. With this in mind, Lin Shao gladly accepted by Jaayala s offer to join him.</p>
<p>Their squad leader was named Urguna Agued, the first Peturu of Shung Jing. After receiving the information from the god system, he quickly led his soldiers to join Lyn Xiao&#x27;s territory and train with other warriors. Only now has he made his first appearance, fighting against the Red Guard of the Eastern Kingdom. Opposite, the Teada Red Guards were takenback when they saw the white armored Bayer appear. They were startled by their eerie demeanor, strange faces, and fierce indifferent eyes.</p>
<p>But they quickly calmed down. They&#x27;re just people on the other side. The mighty Teada Red Guard. Would they be afraid of the enemy? Don&#x27;t be frightened by their terrifying appearance. The Japanese cavalrymen encouraged each other and launched a charge before Lin Xiao&#x27;s white armored cavalry could finish preparing.</p>
<p>Their primary objective is the small hill in the center of the battlefield. Once they cross the river and reach the highest point of the hill, they can charge down the long slope and use the immense momentum of the cavalry to wipe out the enemy in one fell swoop. These white armored soldiers didn&#x27;t even have a place to run away from. There was a forest not far behind them, and if the cavalry entered the forest, they would basically be doomed. The fiery redclad red guards spurred their war horses and quickly charged toward the small hill in the center of the battlefield.</p>
<p>At this moment, Baijabayala slowly completed the formation. Are we going to lose? We&#x27;re moving so slowly. The opposing red guards are almost up the hill. In a battle between two cavalry units, whoever occupies the advantageous formation will gain the upper hand. These white armored guys are intimidating in appearance and carry a lot of weapons.</p>
<p>But do they actually have any real skills? Lyn Shia has so many powerful troop types at his disposal. Why did he choose this particular troop type for this battle? Even many people in the live stream didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the strangely named white armor barrier unit in the waiting area of the martial arts arena. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s diehard fans, including two Shan by Chin, Ding Lelay, and Heay remained full of confidence. Just wait and see. If our boss dares to use this type of soldier, it must be incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>No one noticed that the moment by Jaayalo appeared, Dugu Jalon, who had not participated in the battle and had been elegantly watching from the waiting area subtly narrowed his pupils. When Lin Shao shouted by Jia Baya, Dugu Jaolan quietly sighed. On the battlefield, Agden glanced indifferently at the Teada Red guards who were beginning to climb the hill in the distance, sneered, and opened his mouth to shout in strange words and tone. The Baija Bayer team began to change. The men in white armor dismounted and drove their horses away.</p>
<p>Then they shouldered their 4 m long spears and quickly assembled. Without the advantage of cavalry, are you simply giving up and becoming infantry? Toyottomy. Jennyro sneered. Isn&#x27;t this just giving up on yourself? The teada red guards had already reached the top of the hill while the white armored soldiers had set up a spear formation at the bottom of the hill. The Red Guard cavalry, without a moment&#x27;s rest, charged straight down.</p>
<p>The sound of hooves thundered as a hundred riders surged forward like a primordial beast. It&#x27;s no use. Even the fiery sunsp spearman can&#x27;t stop the red guard cavalry. If Lyn Sha brought those armored soldiers with broadswords, that would be fine. But this white armor, the teada red guards were less than 200 m away from the white armored soldiers.</p>
<p>At this moment, the formation of the white armored soldiers changed again. Except for the white armored soldiers in the front row, who maintained their spears pointing diagonally, all the white armored soldiers simultaneously raised their giant bows, drew arrows from their quivers, and swiftly unleashed a volley of arrows, trying to launch a sneak attack with bows and arrows. What are you going to do with the heavy armor of my Teada Red Guard? of the charging Teada red guards fell. Half of the arrows fired by the white armored soldiers were light arrows aimed at the gaps in the armor of the red armored soldiers and at their eyes and faces where they were not protected. The other half were heavy armor-piercing arrows aimed directly at the vital points of the cavalrymen.</p>
<p>These soldiers in white armor are excellent archers. The red guards were no ordinary force. Although more than a dozen men were shot down, their heavy armor and agile movements meant that almost none of them were seriously injured or killed on the spot. They quickly rolled off the ground to avoid being trampled by the cavalry behind them. The rear cavalry also slowed down slightly, allowing those who had fallen to escape and to try to remount and charge the enemy.</p>
<p>At this moment, another volley of arrows rained down from the white armored soldiers and more than a dozen knights fell along with more than a dozen war horses. Warh horses are less defensive than warriors. If shot down, they die instantly. These white armored soldiers shoot arrows horizontally at such high speeds that their trajectories are impossible to predict. Of the red guards shouted, &quot;Baka, charge forward.</p>
<p>Forget about those who have fallen from their horses. This time, no one paid any attention to their fallen comrades. The Teada Red Guard accelerated, and after two volleys of arrows from the white armored soldiers, the distance of over a 100 m was reduced to only 50 m. The first row of white armored soldiers stood motionless with their long spears while the white armored soldiers behind them quickly slung their long bows behind their backs, pulled out steel javelins, short spears, from their waists and raised them high to gather strength. Put drink.</p>
<p>80 javelins flew out and pierced heavily into the ranks of Teada&#x27;s red guard cavalry. Each of the white armored Bayer picked up a steel rod again. Put drink. The Teada red guards were less than 10 m away from the white armored soldiers. Short ax drink.</p>
<p>Whirlwindlike axes flew out from the ranks of the white armored soldiers, felling the entire front line of Teada&#x27;s red guard. Boom. The few remaining red guard cavalry finally clashed with the first rank of white armored Bayer. Half of the white armored soldiers in the first row were knocked down, but the other half withtood the impact, being battered by several waves of arrows, javelins, and finally a wave of short axes. Only 20 or 30 riders from the Teada Red Guards managed to reach the White Armor Army&#x27;s formation.</p>
<p>Kill Agnes s command. The white armored soldiers broke formation and grabbed their most familiar weapons. Charging forward fiercely to entangle the teada red guards who had just gotten up from the ground. Chapter 184. Annihilation of the red guards.</p>
<p>The war of attack begins. Almost everyone in the live stream was stunned. No one spoke. They all stared intently at the live stream screen. It was as if the battle between Lin Xiao&#x27;s powerful troops and the Black Flame Legion was being replayed.</p>
<p>This time the white armor soldiers seemed to be replicating the miracle of that time. The mighty Teada Red Guard, one of the strongest military units in Japan, heavily armored knights who could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the three major nightly orders of Europe, were wiped out before they could even reach the white armored soldiers with a single charge, with seven or eight out of 10 of them being taken down. The endless barrage of attacks by the white armored soldiers in particular gave everyone a tremendous shock. When they first appeared, some people laughed at them for carrying so many weapons like they were selling groceries. But now they can&#x27;t laugh anymore.</p>
<p>The white armored soldiers are terrifying. Baka, do you think your bunch of ragtag soldiers can defeat the Teada Red Guards so easily? Toy Jinichiro roared. Let them see the might of the Red Guard. Red guards who were shot down suffered minor injuries while a few were seriously wounded. When they saw the white armored soldiers coming towards them, they quickly got up, either unfassening their Japanese swords or picking up their spears, ready to fight.</p>
<p>Our teada red cavalry is not only heavy cavalry capable of charging into enemy lines, but also consists of top tier warriors who can fight even after falling from their horses. Toy Jenny Chiro shouted. Thinking you can defeat me by knocking me off my horse? You&#x27;re too naive. Come, let&#x27;s have a glorious duel of warriors. A red guard soldier wielding a Japanese sword shouted.</p>
<p>He was met with several arrows, a steel chisel, and a short axe. The soldier quickly dodged, but an arrow still struck him through a gap in his knee armor, causing him to writhe on the ground in pain. A knotted rope fell from the sky, strangled his neck, and dragged him out. The Red Guard soldier hurriedly drew his short knife, intending to cut the ropes. At that moment, a long spear pierced straight into his exposed lower neck, killing the Red Guard soldier instantly.</p>
<p>This is shameless. Outnumber them. Besides, what kind of weapon is a rope? Toy Jenny launched into a tirade of curses. You lack the spirit of Bushidto. Across from him, Lyn Shao seemed to ignore him, simply nodding in satisfaction.</p>
<p>To deal with wild beasts, you need hunters. The strongest fishermen and hunters between the black waters and the white mountains, the top hunters are perfect for killing the wild beasts of Japan. On the battlefield, the white armored Bayer and the red armored troops, one white and one red, formed a striking contrast, allowing everyone watching the god systems live broadcast to clearly see the battle. Faced with the pursuit of several red guard warriors, a white armored Bayer did not hesitate at all and ran away. He was clad in heavy armor, but ran extremely fast.</p>
<p>The red guards couldn&#x27;t keep up with him. Just as the red guard was about to change targets and annihilate the others, the white armored Bayer turned around, drew his giant bow, and fired an arrow. The armor-piercing arrow pierced the flesh, severely damaging the red guard warrior, who had to stop and rest as the remaining red armed warriors continued their pursuit. The white armed warrior assumed a dual stance, but suddenly unleashed two javelins in quick succession. The red clad samurai were elite warriors who parried the javelin at close range.</p>
<p>But what they didn&#x27;t expect was that following one of the javelins was a spinning throwing axe. The flying axe cleaved the face of one of the red guard warriors, shattering his demon mask and penetrating three tints of the bone, splattering blood all over his face. Immediately afterwards, another arrow pierced the right eye of the red guard samurai. This samurai, just like his unit name, was as red as could be. Extremely red.</p>
<p>Wow. In the live stream, everyone was amazed. Such scenes keep appearing everywhere. These white armored warriors, after unhorsing the heavy cavalry of Teada&#x27;s Red Guard, engaged in a fierce close quarters battle. Only then did everyone realize the white armored soldiers possess extremely powerful combat abilities and they are unruly, ruthless, and vicious.</p>
<p>As long as they have a numerical advantage, they will not hesitate to fight outnumbered. But if they fall into a disadvantageous position, they will run away immediately. The Teada Red Guards, heavily armored, couldn&#x27;t catch up at all. But once they stop chasing, these fierce white armored soldiers will turn around and brutally attack the Teada Red Guard&#x27;s rear end. In a one-on-one fight, the Teada Red Guards with their outstanding individual combat capabilities were no match for the white armored soldiers.</p>
<p>Long distance. The white armored soldiers can use bows and arrows. Although they cannot shoot as far as the archers of the sun never sets, their angles are tricky and their archery skills are excellent. Mid-range, the white armored soldiers would throw javelins, which were powerful, heavy, and had strong penetrating force, medium, and short distances. Before engaging in close combat, the white armored soldiers throw short axes, which are extremely effective at piercing armor and causing great damage.</p>
<p>Close quarters combat. They are extremely skilled with both spears and short swords, and can switch freely between unconventional weapons such as ropes and sickles. member of the Teada Red Guard seized an opportunity to get close and launch a fierce attack only to find that these white armored soldiers also have armor underneath their white iron armor making their defensive capabilities truly astonishing. They cleaved through the outermost layer of rolled iron armor, revealing chain mail underneath. Break through the chain mail and you&#x27;ll find studded cotton armor underneath.</p>
<p>Sorry. Even though the cotton armor was broken, the white armored Bayer was in dead. During this time, he had already killed at least two or three red guard warriors. Thus, the advantage on the battlefield was established the moment the Teada Red Guard fell from their horses. The white armored Bayer, outnumbered and outgunned, fought while running, besieging the enemy and attacking reinforcements, quickly and fiercely defeating the Red Guard warriors so badly they couldn&#x27;t even lift their heads.</p>
<p>Baka Baka. Under the impotent rage of Toyotomy Jinichiro, the last Teada Red Guard samurai was pierced to death by a spear. Battle over. All of Toyottomy Jinikairo&#x27;s units have been eliminated, resulting in a loss for the Japanese player. The indifferent voice of the Supreme God rang out, followed by a flash of white light, and both sides were teleported back to the rest area.</p>
<p>&quot;Well done, Chu Yusi was the first to step forward and congratulate Lin Sha. I have merely fulfilled my mission,&quot; Lyn Shao said modestly. &quot;The elimination rounds are over, and the next match is the arena battle. Everyone, take a break. Boss Lynn Shiao, you&#x27;re amazing.</p>
<p>Heay excitedly stepped forward to congratulate him. No wonder all my flower fairies like you so much. Upon hearing the word flower fairy, Lyn Shia gave Heay a strange look. That expression seemed to say, &quot;If you give the flower fairy such a weird reward again, you&#x27;d better watch out for my beating.&quot; Heay chuckled sheepishly and scratched his head sheepishly. Boss, could you then fulfill your promise to the flower fairy? No.</p>
<p>Get out. Tu Shan by Chin, Ding Lay, and the others rushed over. Tu Shan by Chin jumped up and clung to Lyn Xiaos arm like a koala, her feet gripping Lin Xiaos, her fluffy cat ears swaying back and forth on Lin Xiaos face. Brother Lynsha, you&#x27;re amazing. I want to have your babies.</p>
<p>Lyn Shiao ripped off the cute little girl in white stockings again and chuckled expressionlessly. figure who was walking over was stunned for a moment when she heard Tu Shawn by Chin&#x27;s words and then shook her head with a smile. Lynn Shiao, congratulations. Also, your team has a really good atmosphere. Thank you, class monitor.</p>
<p>Do you have time? I&#x27;d like to talk to you about something privately. Tu Shan by Chen and Heay immediately exchanged a glance, their expressions playful. Please. Seeing Lin Shiao and Dugu Jaon walk to the quiet area of the rest area, Hay couldn&#x27;t help but nudge to Shaun Bian. Hey, do you think she has a thing for the boss? It&#x27;s interesting.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s great. They&#x27;re a good match. Tan by Chian casually replied, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you jealous?&quot; H I&#x27;d be content to be Lin Xiao&#x27;s concubine. What&#x27;s there to be jealous about? TCH, no ambition. He curled his lip.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the two returned looking perfectly normal. The announcement from the main god system sounded again. The arena battle begins. All 10 victorious lords from the dragon sia kingdom have made their appearance, dividing into 10 battlefields to confront the 10 lords from the eastern Japan. The winner will continue to fight against the winner of the other side until all units of one side are defeated.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao makes another appearance. Chapter 185. of the countermeasures against Japan. The archers of Tatami Baka Yamamoto Isuroka&#x27;s face turned ashen to lose so completely. The entire Teada Red Guard was wiped out, managing to kill only seven of the enemy.</p>
<p>Toyottomy Jinny Chiro, you have disappointed me greatly. The enemy&#x27;s unit types are too strange and I I have no experience. Toyottomy Jiniurro replied in a flustered manner. Snort. Don&#x27;t make excuses.</p>
<p>A loss is a loss. Yes. Jinichiro Toyota lowered his head deeply. Yamamoto Isuroku brandished his katana. No need to think about it.</p>
<p>This white armored Bayer must also be a legendary gold tier unit. This also aligns with our worst case scenario. But we still have 30 lords while they only have 10. Everyone, the arena battles will begin soon, and you may all encounter Lin Shiao. What good methods do you all have to deal with Lin Xiaos white armored soldiers? Remote.</p>
<p>Sakura Shichiro glanced smuggly at Toyotomy Jinichiro and spoke first. I observed that the white armored soldiers firing range is less than 200 m. We can use longrange attacks to wear them down. With my skill buffs, my archers from the distant river have a range exceeding 300 m. I can wear them down with archers.</p>
<p>Yamamoto nodded. You&#x27;ll be the first to go and deal with Lin Xiaos white armored soldiers. First one up? Sakura Shichiro asked in surprise. My lord, I am not like some people who can eliminate Lin Shiao all by myself. Isn&#x27;t it just fighting and running? Do you think the archers of Tatami can&#x27;t outrun heavily armored soldiers? Baka Yamamoto Isuroku glared at him and Sakura Shichiro immediately fell silent, arrogant and complacent, looking down on everyone.</p>
<p>If you can wipe out Lin Xiaos troops, I&#x27;ll give you the top credit. But if you lose, we need a backup plan. Yes. What other ways do you all have to deal with Lyn Xiao&#x27;s white armored soldiers? magic, shadow warrior, the heavily armored pheasant blade cavalry can fight. Cavalry arcoers and me, the Tokugawa crossbow.</p>
<p>Seeing the high morale of the participating lords, Yamamoto Isuroku nodded in satisfaction. He can wear Lin Sha down. In the live stream room opened by the god system, hundreds of millions of viewers are watching. Although Lin Sha won, can Longa win the upcoming gauntlet match? 10 against 30? I doubt it. With a flash of light, Lyn Shao stepped into the battlefield once more.</p>
<p>On the far opposite side was a handsome young man, but he was gritting his teeth. Lyn Shiao, you are destined to lose today. So, it&#x27;s Sakura Shichiro. What? You were violated in prison and you hate me so much. Lyn Shao said calmly.</p>
<p>Shameless, vulgar, and disgusting. Sakura Shichiro s face twisted in disgust. Everything I have is thanks to you. bear my wrath. What do you mean? Thanks to me.</p>
<p>What a joke. Lynn Sha interrupted Ingiro calmly, picking his ear and saying, &quot;If you hadn&#x27;t killed your own kind, none of this would have happened, would it?&quot; As expected, you Japanese are encouraable. You can only see others and not your own problems. That&#x27;s what they call a leopard can&#x27;t change its spots. You Sakura Shichiro was furious.</p>
<p>Archers from the distant river charge. 100 fully equipped archers from the distant river immediately formed a formation and slowly advanced. They carried long swords on their backs and held long bows in their hands. This attire indicated that they were capable of both ranged and melee combat, making them rare and versatile archers. On this side, 93 white armored beer watched indifferently as the enemy walked towards them and the leader Actton suddenly smiled disdainfully.</p>
<p>The strangely pronounced voice rang out again and by Jaayala walked towards the enemy formation. Great, they want to have a duel. How could the white armored soldiers possibly be a match for mytomy archers? Sakura Shichiro&#x27;s eyes suddenly lit up. Preparation. The archers from Yuan Jang stopped 400 meters away.</p>
<p>All of them drew their bows, aimed, and prepared to fire. The archers had excellent eyesight. They watched silently as the white armored soldiers approached in a scattered and disorganized manner. Seeing the indifferent expressions on their faces and the way they looked at them like they were dead, they couldn&#x27;t help but shudder. Concentrate.</p>
<p>The captain couldn&#x27;t help but remind them. and the archers of the far river archery team finally stabilized their formation. Put out a command 100 arrows flew into the sky and then the arrows rained down. Archers of Tatami are skilled at shooting arrows into the sky and then using inertia and gravity to pierce the enemy&#x27;s armor. They used this tactic to defeat countless heavily armored legions.</p>
<p>The arrow was still in the air when the white armored Bayer suddenly accelerated and ran wildly. The already sparse formation scattered even further. Arrows that take two seconds to travel to the ground are easily dodged by the white armored soldiers. I see the viewers in the live stream realized the reign of arrows from 100 archers isn&#x27;t dense enough. It&#x27;s too difficult to cover the entire battlefield.</p>
<p>Skilled soldiers like the white armored soldiers can dodge arrows by observing their trajectory. Damn it. Sakura Shichiro shouted. Keep firing. Concentrate your firepower and take out a few of them first.</p>
<p>Archers from the distant river drew their bows again, and the charging white armored Bayer was already only 200 m away from them. Put the arrows flew into the sky again, this time aimed at the dozen or so white armored soldiers running at the forefront. 100 arrows were evenly distributed, covering the white armored soldiers advance and evasion routes, leaving them with no way to avoid them. Suddenly, the dozen or so white armored soldiers running ahead stopped abruptly, turned around, and nimly rolled backward like rabbits. They actually ran backwards.</p>
<p>Most of the arrows missed their mark. Only a few arrows anticipated the white armored soldiers trajectory, but the rolling white armored soldiers absorbed most of their force, and only three white armored soldiers were injured. Baka, keep the fire going. But at this moment, the white armored soldiers had already reached a distance of less than 200 meters from the archers of Yuan Jang. Actton smiled sinisterly.</p>
<p>Kill. The white armored soldier drew his long bow and fired an arrow as he ran. Move and fire. The arrow followed a slight parabolic arc and without ascending into the air and landing, swiftly pierced the ranks of the archers in the distant river region. More than a dozen archers from the distant river fell to the ground.</p>
<p>What? The archers from the far river region were shot down by the white armored Bayer. Is this still their ace archer or is it that by Jabayala is the real Trump card? The viewers in the live stream were shocked and buzzed with discussion. Meanwhile, Sakura Shichiro was also jumping up and down in anger. Stop launching projectiles. Just shoot them directly.</p>
<p>The two sides were now more than 100 m apart. At this distance, with the strength of the elite archers on both sides, there was no need for them to launch their arrows. They could simply raise their hands and fire at each other. The white armored Baya wore three layers of armor, and the archers from the distant river also wore thick armor. Both sides carried hard bows.</p>
<p>The archers duel has begun. Archer from the distant river, suppressing his anger, switched to armor-piercing heavy arrows and drew his bowring at the approaching white armored soldier. Arrows flew swiftly towards them. Suddenly, the white armored Bayer, who was advancing, lunged to the ground. His three layers of armor tumbled with his massive body, dodging the arrows.</p>
<p>From the Yuan Jang archers, was about to rain down. The white armored Bayer retaliated with a volley of arrows while rolling around. Another group of archers from the distant river fell. The archers from the distant river immediately retaliated with a horizontal shot. Before everyone could see clearly, Baija Beayala rolled forward again, using the roll to dodge and reduce the damage from the enemy&#x27;s arrows.</p>
<p>At the same time, he drew his bow and knocked an arrow while rolling and immediately shot the arrow forward after one roll. Archers from the distant river could hardly hit the white armored Bayer. Even if they did hit him, most of the force was absorbed by the rolling armor by Jiaala s arrows are fast and accurate, flying from tricky angles and able to shoot down the archers of Yuan Jang. After several rolls, the white armored Baya had already killed more than half of the Yuan Jang archers. Chapter 186.</p>
<p>The situation is dire, boosting morale. Baka shameless Sakura Shichiro s stomping foot echoed through the waiting area of Japan. Toyottomy Jinichiro who had been keeping his head down and remaining silent suddenly felt inexplicably cheerful. As a young genius of this generation, he has always been invincible. Their own troops were utterly defeated by the unknown white armor soldiers and looked down upon by others.</p>
<p>Now Sakura Shikaru is experiencing this feeling too on the battlefield. Soon the archers from the distant river could not hold out any longer and the remaining dozen or so archers hurriedly sought cover to avoid the increasing number of arrows from the white armored soldiers. There&#x27;s one last move, Sakura Shichiro thought to himself, clenching his fist. There are dozens of lightly wounded archers from the distant river region who have been hit by arrows and more than a dozen who are still in good condition and capable of fighting. Once the white armored soldiers charge over, the archers from the distant river can pick up their long swords and rush in to kill them.</p>
<p>Huh? Sakura Shichiro could finish speaking. The white armored Bayer had already rushed in front of the Tatami archers. An archer from the distant river drew his long sword only to be met with a 4 m long spear that mercilessly pierced his body. &quot;You! How can you use such a long weapon?&quot; La o opposite him sneered, drew his weapon, ignored the yuan jang archers, and immediately went to find the next victim. Elsewhere, the white armored Bayer soldiers who rushed up employed various methods: steel bars, javelins, throwing axes, spears, swords, and ropes.</p>
<p>The one-sided brutal defeat of the Teada Red Guards that had just occurred was repeated. Tatammy archers touted as capable of both ranged and melee combat are ultimately only good for secondary support roles in close combat, even inferior to the Teada Red Guards. They&#x27;re only decent against ordinary melee units among the elite or epic unit types. To attack someone like that is simply courting death. No, my archers of toty in a tag team battle.</p>
<p>The fighting must continue until all of one side&#x27;s units are wiped out. Sakura Shichiro could only watch helplessly as his legendary units were mercilessly killed one by one. The battle ended quickly and the two were teleported out of the battlefield. Lyn Sha took stock of the surviving white armor Bayera and found that apart from five people who were shot down by arrows and seriously injured and seven or eight others who were slightly injured, there were almost no losses. still 88 white armored Bayer who can play.</p>
<p>As for the five seriously injured, Lynn Shia released them back into his territory to heal at their own pace. Upon arriving at the rest area, Chu Yui and the other contestants briefly congratulated Lin Shiao before returning to watch the match with somber expressions. Lyn Shia understood the reason. Although we won, the Dragon Sea Kingdom is still at a disadvantage overall. The duel is just an appetizer in the martial arts arena.</p>
<p>Even if you lose, it won&#x27;t affect the overall situation too much. Lin Daoing came to Lyn Xiaos side, his eyes also fixed on the screen, and said, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. I couldn&#x27;t win against the heavy armored pheasant cavalry. I only managed to exchange all of my dream demons for 20 knights.&quot; Lyn Sha smiled faintly. Thank you.</p>
<p>In that kind of flat terrain, it is indeed difficult for dream demons to use their abilities. The two continued to observe the changes on the battlefield in silence. As battle after battle ended, all of Lia&#x27;s players soon returned. Apart from Lin Shao, only Chufinga, Dinglay, and Shunandu won. This means that six people from the Japanese side won.</p>
<p>Next, four people will fight against 26 people. Everyone&#x27;s expression turned very serious. Even among the viewers in the live stream, very few were happy. Currently, only Lin Xiao&#x27;s strength remains intact. Some analysts have suggested that Lin Shiao still has nearly 90 people.</p>
<p>Dinglays Naga Queen has over 50 left. Chufinga&#x27;s spotted leopard berserkers only have 23 left, and Shinuandu&#x27;s diamond golems only have 30 left. The scariest thing is that we can analyze that Linhao&#x27;s unit must be a gold legendary, but the other three&#x27;s units are only epic. There are also four legendary unit types and more than 10 epic unit types in Japan. How can we possibly win like this? Lia might lose the next match.</p>
<p>An atmosphere of anxiety began to spread and someone asked Gene Wooang a question. Old Devil, what do you think? I believe it is too early to draw conclusions, Jin Wuang said calmly. I advise you not to be too pessimistic. What that person said earlier was not correct. You mean Liao will win? No, I mean Liao won&#x27;t lose so quickly.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia can at least last a few more games. TCH. Even Lin Shiao alone couldn&#x27;t defeat Japan&#x27;s nearly 2,000 troops with only 80 or 90 different types of soldiers. In the end, Longa still lost. While the losers were arguing in the live stream and pondering their next move with serious expressions, Lin Sha, who was watching the argument, smiled.</p>
<p>The group who were feeling down were somewhat puzzled. They only saw that there were still 26 lords in Japan, but they didn&#x27;t see the efforts you all just made. Lynn Shiao slowly walked up to the crowd and said loudly, &quot;Although we lost six men, Lynn Douching decimated 20 heavily armored pheasant sword cavalry. The head hunters of Julie crippled the Tokugawa crossbowmen on the opposite side and Wong Bo figured out the patterns of the cavalry arquable, exposed their tactics, and seriously wounded more than a dozen of them. These are Japan&#x27;s elite troops, the legendary golden units.</p>
<p>Their weakening can play a crucial role in the battle. Therefore, your contributions are truly remarkable. Leave the rest to me. As Lyn Sha finished speaking, the Lord&#x27;s gloomy mood improved somewhat, and the eyes of those lords who were blaming themselves seemed to light up again. A flash of light and Lyn Sha was teleported to the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel much better.&quot; The athletes in the rest area murmured to themselves. I think Lin Shiao is a pretty easy person to get along with. Julie whispered. I&#x27;m convinced that he&#x27;s the team leader. Wong B said with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>Haha. Not bad. Not bad. The more I look at this kid, the more I like him. Chu Yui, who had remained silent to avoid putting pressure on the other contestants, nodded in satisfaction, fearless in the face of danger, strong under pressure, and able to inspire others.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao is a man of his word. I have faith in him. The lord of the domain made the right choice in appointing him as the deputy city lord. Sigh. If only I had a daughter.</p>
<p>Haha. The lords were overjoyed and even the usually aloof Dugu Jaolon had a slight smile on his lips. Chufinga glanced at Chu Yusi with a mournful look. But before she could speak, she was also teleported to the battlefield by the god system. For battlefields have been reopened and the battle has begun.</p>
<p>In the first desert terrain, Chufinga&#x27;s 30 odd epic spotted leopard berserkers faced off against 70 epic level combat ninjas from the east. The second battlefield is a swampy terrain where Ding lays 50 odd Naga queens face off against the epic unit from the east, the Tokugawa crossbow. The third battlefield is the arena where Chun Schwandu&#x27;s diamond puppets fight against one of Japan&#x27;s ace teams, a full strength shadow warrior commando squad. The fourth battlefield is a relatively wide plane. Lynn Xiao&#x27;s 88 white armored Bayer soldiers face off against the Japanese ACE unit, a legendary gold tier unit.</p>
<p>80 heavily armored pheasant blade cavalry. Chapter 1. 87 Tokugawa Hayabusa heavy armored pheasant blade cavalry. Battle begins. Hundreds of millions of people in the Lsha Kingdom were all glued to the live broadcast.</p>
<p>Although it was just the prelude to the National Fortune Arena and the first part of the heroic martial arts arena, the excitement of this series of battles was already captivating. Moreover, due to the long-standing feud with Japan, the people of Lung Sha also hoped that their lords could win on the battlefield and prove themselves. Lyn Sha appeared on the live stream, attracting the most attention. At this moment, the 88 white armored bars reappeared, still as indifferent and fierce as ever. Their strange faces and dark skin weathered by time made them look like the most ferocious beasts in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Across from him, Tokugawa Hayato, the lord of Japan, solemnly bowed to Lin Sha in respect. Lin Shiao Jun, I am Tokugawa Hayyato, one of the top five lords of Japan in this generation. I have been practicing for two and a half years since I entered the battlefield of all races. In this battle, I will give it my all. I&#x27;ve heard that Lin Shiao Jun is a new generation genius of the Dragon Sea Kingdom and the Deputy City Lord of Dragon South City.</p>
<p>It would be an honor for me, Tokugawa Hayabusa, to have the opportunity to duel with Lin Shiao Jun. Please give me your guidance. Hi, with a hint of surprise, then nodded slightly. I won&#x27;t hold back. It is not the fault of a virtuous person to be born in a country of petty people.</p>
<p>Tokugawa Hiyato moved with lightning speed. His heavily armored pheasant sword cavalry quickly assembled and without any further ado launched a legionary charge. Heavily armored pheasant cavalry are like a lowprofile version of the Mod Dao iron guards on horseback. Each of them carries a long-handled broadsword which is extremely sharp. They wear heavy armor and their horses are also heavily armored.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their courage and strength and can be considered another ace heavy cavalry unit similar in role to the teada red guards. The difference is that the heavily armored pheasant cavalry focuses more on stacking defense and attack like a running tin can. Moreover, the heavy armored pheasant cavalry has only been around for a few years, so its reputation is not as great as that of the teada red guard. The thunderous sound of hoves rang out as the heavily armored cavalry began their charge. It&#x27;s over this time.</p>
<p>The heavily armored pheasant cavalry&#x27;s defense is even stronger than the Teada Red Guard. I&#x27;m afraid the white armored Bayer do have many ways to deal with them. Yes, most importantly, this time the terrain is flat with no terrain obstacles, which is a great advantage for the cavalry. Even if these white armored Bayer used long bows and heavy arrows, the cavalry would be at their faces in one or two shots at most. The sheer force of the heavily armored pheasant sword cavalry is probably no less than that of the Tutonic Knights in Europe.</p>
<p>Can the white armored Bayer in the front ranks withstand their charge with their infantry lances? Before the two sides even clashed, the viewers in the live stream were already starting to worry. On the Japanese side, Yamamoto Isuroku also nodded in satisfaction. Of the four battles, only Lin Xiao&#x27;s side had a terrain advantage that was completely favorable to his side. Tokugawa Hayyato is also a rare genius. He seized the opportunity and immediately organized a cavalry charge.</p>
<p>This time, Lynn Shiao should have no way to resist. In the Dragon Summer Rest area, all the lords stared intently at the four battles that were taking place simultaneously. Lyn Xiao&#x27;s battle map was the most straightforward and both sides engaged in the fight with minimal talk and preparation with most people watching Lyn Xiaos battle. However, Lord Long Lia felt mostly regret. Lyn Sha, you must keep it up.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao, this time it&#x27;s a bit risky. If we lose, we lose. There are still the general and Lord battles. We can win them back. Sigh.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all my fault. I didn&#x27;t use more heavy pheasant cavalry. Lyn Shiao, I&#x27;ll apologize to you when you come out. Heavily armored pheasant cavalry charged toward Lin Xiao&#x27;s position with thunderous hooves. The impact is palpable even through the screen.</p>
<p>Just when everyone thought the white armored soldiers were doomed. Suddenly, Actton whistled. All the white armored soldiers whistled in unison just like Actton. 88 horses came running out. The white armored soldier mounted his horse and rode away.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. That&#x27;s right. When the white armored Bayer first appeared, they were cavalry. However, in these battles, the white armored soldiers formidable infantry combat capabilities caused everyone to overlook this point. Now they&#x27;ve recalled the horses.</p>
<p>Could it be? Facing the charging heavy pheasant cavalry, Bja Bayala did not hesitate at all. Turned around on his horse and fled. The battlefield was a flat plane, neither too big nor too small, but large enough for two cavalry units to maneuver freely. Everyone was astonished by Jiaala had summoned his horse so he could escape. The heavily armored pheasant cavalry gave chase while the white armored Bayer charged ahead.</p>
<p>Gradually, everyone realized a problem. The heavily armored pheasant cavalry couldn&#x27;t catch up with the white armored Bayer. The white- armored bay seem to be not as tall, but they have better endurance. Moreover, the white armored horses do not wear such thick armor, so they can carry a lighter load. Just when the heavily armored pheasant cavalry realized that they were being chased around in circles by the white armored Bayer on the battlefield and could not be caught up, the white armored soldiers maintained their distance, mounted their horses, drew their long bows, and unleashed a volley of arrows.</p>
<p>Mounted archers, someone exclaimed. These white armored soldiers have so many attack methods. They can even be mounted archers. Arrows rained down, striking the heavily armored cavalry s formation. Despite their heavy armor, the white armored soldiers accurate archery caused several heavily armored cavalrymen to be shot in the eyes and faces or their horses falling off their mouths.</p>
<p>Damn it, chase after them. The heavily armored pheasant wielding cavalry gave chase while the white armored Bayer accelerated once more. When the heavily armored pheasant sword cavalry got tired, the white armored Bayer once again controlled the distance and unleashed another volley of arrows, felling several knights. This tactic, though shameless, is undeniably effective. A viewer in the live stream said, &quot;The white- armored Bayer are truly a military force that has no marshall ethics, no methods, and only cares about victory.</p>
<p>They may flee at any time, but they will come back at any time.&quot; It&#x27;s really amazing, doesn&#x27;t their repeated desertions affect morale and military discipline? You have to understand that on the battlefield, every soldier&#x27;s every move is magnified infinitely. If a soldier turns to run away, how do you know if he is luring the enemy or if he is really running away? One person lures the enemy while the rest actually run. If even one person escapes, it will trigger a chain reaction potentially leading to the complete defeat of the army. Therefore, military discipline is paramount. Anyone who runs away will be killed.</p>
<p>But the white armored Bayera could ignore this rule. Individuals, scattered groups, and collectives could all run away. But everyone, including the commander, believed they would come back to continue fighting. Everyone marveled as they watched by Ja Bayer use an unsolvable method to continuously kite down all the heavily armored pheasant blade cavalry. Then the white armored soldiers dismounted and became infantry, cautiously and ruthlessly, reaping the lives of all the wounded and fallen riders.</p>
<p>Battle damage zero. Hi facing him gritted his teeth but there was nothing he could do. After all the heavily armored cavalrymen had perished, Tokugawa Hiayato took a deep breath and bowed to Lin Shiao saying, &quot;Thanks for the advice. I&#x27;ve lost. I&#x27;ve also identified the weaknesses of the heavy pheasant cavalry.</p>
<p>We will work on addressing those weaknesses in the future.&quot; Lyn Shia nodded slightly. He had a somewhat favorable impression of this upright and polite Japanese man. You&#x27;ll soon realize that you didn&#x27;t lose unjustly. Chapter 1 1881 against 21. Let&#x27;s go.</p>
<p>With a flash of light, Lyn Shiao returned to the rest area. Because Lyn Xiaos kite-flying tactic took a long time, the other three participating lords had already returned before him. Chunwandu&#x27;s diamond puppet was no match for the shadow warrior assault team and has been defeated. Chufinga&#x27;s leopard berserkers were lucky. The desert terrain gave them a significant advantage.</p>
<p>And with Chufinga fighting with his back against the wall, he defeated the battle ninja, who were also epic level units. But the panther berserkers only have less than 10 men left, and they are destined to lose the next match. However, the kid had completed his task and was happily pacing around in front of his father, his red hair extremely flamboyant, which made everyone grimace. Dingle performed well. His battlefield was a swampy area which provided a significant advantage against the halfhuman half-snake Naga race.</p>
<p>At the start of the battle, the Naga queen infiltrated the swamp and approached the Tokugawa crossbowmen, defeating this ranged unit in close combat with only about 10 casualties of her own. Lynsha nodded. This was the reason why he didn&#x27;t bring a single type of soldier with combat capabilities. It was too easy for them to be targeted. When the battlefield environment changes, advantages and disadvantages will be magnified infinitely.</p>
<p>Next, we have three more lords, Chu Yusi concluded. There are still 23 lords on the other side. We all have heavy responsibilities, so let&#x27;s not let our guard down. Lord, you could say we only have two lords on our side. Anyway, Shufinga won&#x27;t be able to gloat for much longer.</p>
<p>Can&#x27;t you let that redhead be happy for a little while longer? Haha. Thanks to Lyn Xiao&#x27;s encouragement, everyone gradually accepted the current situation and the atmosphere wasn&#x27;t so heavy. In the Japanese rest area, Yamamoto Isuroku and a group of lords gathered together for a discussion. Two legendary cavalry units and the shadow warrior assault team. Yamamoto Isuroku said, &quot;And that guy, Lynn Shia, still has 88 white armor soldiers.</p>
<p>The rest are no threat, but this guy is the most hateful, so I&#x27;ve decided to treat him with care. You two don&#x27;t engage Lynn Shiao in battle yet. All epic units stepped forward. The rest periods during the tag team battle were very short and soon the battle resumed. The three were teleported to the battlefield.</p>
<p>This time Chufunga encountered a powerful cavalry and arrobe team and the spotted leopard berserker was instantly annihilated. The red-haired boy returned to the rest area dejectedly. Dingle encountered one of the epic Japanese unit types, the shogun at spearman. Relying on his ability to become stronger by showing off, Dinglay made boastful remarks on the battlefield, startling the opposing team. Then his Naga Queen attribute was enhanced, allowing him to charge in and slaughter his opponents to victory.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao encountered a group of ninjas. There are many different schools of ninja in Japan. Upon seeing the ninjas, Lynsha immediately warned Actton to be careful. The white armored ninjas cautiously approached and after killing several ninjas, they began to accelerate. Suddenly, the ninjas who were at close range through smoke bombs, gunpowder, and poison darts, instantly taking down two white armored Bayer in the smoke.</p>
<p>The white armored soldiers were on guard and resisted. But the ninjas, seeing that their plan had been exposed, rushed forward fearlessly to chase after the white armored soldiers. It turns out that the Japanese wanted to play a war of attrition, use a suicide attack by special forces to exhaust Lin Xiao&#x27;s white armor barera. The white armored soldiers turned tail and ran again. The white armored soldiers in the front ranks fired arrows and used spears to block using their three layers of armor to defend against the suicidal ninjas.</p>
<p>The white armored soldiers in the back row had already untied the hemp ropes. They combined the hemp ropes, short axes, steel chisels, sickles, and other tools into different props, used the terrain to set up traps, and then use these props to directly create all sorts of bizarre weapons. Before long, the front row white armored soldiers retreated and joined the rest of the white armored soldiers. The white armored soldiers gathered together, relying on the terrain and traps. Ahead lay traps, mechanisms, and roadblocks set up by the white armored soldiers.</p>
<p>In the middle is a white armored warrior wielding a long spear and a sword. Behind them was a group of white armored Bayer holding long bows and firing arrows. Now, the ninjas who were eager to learn from the kamicazi special forces were unable to continue their advance. Even if they used smoke bombs, they would be blocked by traps and then killed by the white armored soldiers. After a period of stalemate, the impatient ninjas launched a collective charge, taking down two more white armored Bajaras before being wiped out, ending the battle.</p>
<p>Four of Lyn Xiao&#x27;s white armored soldiers were poisoned and killed in battle, leaving 84 white armored soldiers still able to fight on the battlefield. Now, Lia only has the troops of two lords, Lin Sha and Ding Lelay, left to continue fighting, while Donging has 24 lords left. In the next match, Ding Lay was attacked by the Japanese Lord&#x27;s elite unit, the foot soldiers, and the Naga Queen was almost completely wiped out, was riddled with arrows by the white armored Bayer. In the next match, Ding Lay encountered a cavalry and arabus unit and was completely wiped out. Lynn Shiao was attacked again by Roninfoot soldiers, but by Ja had learned from experience and wiped out the enemy at the cost of only one minor injury.</p>
<p>The dueling arena battle between Lia and Donging have been completed and only the 84 white armored Bayer warriors led by Lin Sha remain from Lshia. Although Lyn Xiao&#x27;s forces seem to be intact, Yamamoto Isuroku had already begun to sneer because the battles to come will be without rest. There are still 21 lords in Japan, one against 21. This is something that has never happened before in history. In the 3,000 years of Lang Shia history, there has never been such a person.</p>
<p>Everyone&#x27;s heart was in their throat. Lyn Sha remained calm and composed, waving to the crowd before being absorbed into the battlefield by the god system. The first three battles are against the elite troops of the east Japan with the aim of wearing down the white armored Bayer as stamina. By Jaala remained calm and collected. When encountering infantry, he would use a triple attack of bows, arrows, javelins, and axes.</p>
<p>When encountering archers, he would roll forward and shoot them out. When encountering heavy cavalry, he would fight them off on horseback. The next three battles will be a war of attrition against the white armored Bayer by the epic units of the east. Monk soldiers, battle ninjas, and ronin took turns fighting, willing to sacrifice human lives to save the life of the white armored warrior. Unfortunately, the effect was not good, resulting only in two white armored baras being seriously injured and forced to leave the field.</p>
<p>That Lyn Zhiao&#x27;s white armor seemed to have reached its limit. In the seventh match, the elite Japanese cavalry, the Aquaers, make their appearance. This is a force led by the Japanese genius date Caesar. The cavalrymen carry arquabus and lances to attack. The cavalrymen first use the arquabus to break through the enemy&#x27;s formation and then charge in with their lances to kill.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after discovering that this unit was similar to the Guan Ning iron cavalry, the white armored Bayer stopped paying attention to these low-budget versions of the common people. On the opposite side, the Japanese cavalry slowly approached and slowly raised their arquibus. These are the musketss they are holding. Due to their large caliber, they prefer to call them cannons. With 300 m to go, the fully equipped and ready to go white armored ba yala began to move.</p>
<p>I think I&#x27;ve missed something. Upon seeing the cavalry and arquable appear, Gene Wuang suddenly said, &quot;I seem to remember that when these white armored Bayer people first came onto the field, they also seemed to be carrying something that looked like a musket.&quot; Before Gene Wuang could finish speaking, the white armored soldiers each pulled out a long narrow musket and aimed it at the cavalry arcoers opposite them. What? Before date sea bureau could react, the white armored Bayer took the initiative and fired a volley of musketss. The final outcome is self-evident. The white armored soldiers who were old rivals of the Guan Ning iron cavalry had long since developed counter measures against the Guan Ning Iron Cavalry&#x27;s musketss.</p>
<p>They had a longer range and after firing their arrows, they charged with bows and arrows and finally charged with lances. Only a dozen or so riders fell from their horses and they annihilated the Japanese elite cavalry and arabisers on the other side. At this point, Lyn Shao still had 75 white armored Ba Yala members. There are still 14 lords left in Japan. There was no time to rest.</p>
<p>The battle resumed. Chapter 189. Endless exhaustion. White armored soldiers after 20 consecutive battles. The Dragon Xiao fans watching the live stream were on tenor hooks the whole time.</p>
<p>If Lynn Shia had lost outright, no one would have blamed him since he was the lord who held out until the very end. But Lyn Sha fought seven matches without losing and his strength was still relatively intact. If Lyn Sha could continue to fight 14 more rounds of gauntlet battles and win the final duel, no one would dare to believe it. But for some reason, everyone was secretly waiting for something. As if there was a sliver of hope that a miracle might happen.</p>
<p>The domain lord&#x27;s judgment is correct. Someone murmured. Maybe Lyn Sha really can bring about a miracle. Some people said, &quot;Even though he has achieved this much, I think Lynn Shiao is a rising star that Lia will focus on cultivating. He may very well become the chief lord in the future.</p>
<p>Old devil, you&#x27;re also a chief lord. What do you say?&quot; Gene Wuang snorted coldly in dissatisfaction. It seems you finally remembered that I am a chief lord. So, do you think Lin Sha can win or not? It&#x27;s hard to say. This time, Gene Wuang did not directly deny it, but gave an ambiguous answer, which shows that with his experience, he did not dare to make a conclusion about Lin Sha, who had repeatedly created miracles.</p>
<p>While everyone was discussing, Lynn Sha had already started fighting. It seems that Japan is determined to wear down Lin Sha and will overwhelm him if necessary. Bastard like madman. These soldiers seem to be excited as if they had been injected with chicken blood and as fearless as heroic martyrs. They completely disregarded their own losses.</p>
<p>Even if a group of them died, they would hold off one white armored soldier, leaving the others a chance to kill him. Four, five consecutive matches. All the units used were epic level units, including melee, ranged cavalry, archers, and assassins, charging headlong into battle without any strategy. At first, the white armored Bayer could use their bows and arrows and horsemanship to fly kites and defend themselves with spears. But by the fourth battle, Baja Bayer had run out of arrows.</p>
<p>Even the best archers among the white armored soldiers only carried 70 arrows each. In the relentless non-stop battles where they could neither rest nor replenish their arrows. Once their arrows ran out, the white armored soldiers lost a major weapon for wearing down the enemy without taking any damage. After running out of arrows, the white armored soldiers still had musketss. But by the fifth battle, their musketss, which had limited ammunition, had also run out.</p>
<p>The white armored soldiers also had steel javelins, which could be recycled, but each soldier only had four. and the throwing distance was not far enough. Thus, in the sixth battle, when they encountered the epic archers from the east again, the white armored soldiers inevitably suffered casualties. The opposing archers clearly realized that the white armored soldiers ranged attacks had become ineffective, so they tried to wear them down with ranged attacks. At Actton&#x27;s command, the white armored soldiers mounted their horses and transformed into heavily armored cavalry, wielding long spears and charging forward amidst a hail of arrows.</p>
<p>This time, after annihilating all the Japanese archers, the white armored Bayer still had 67 men left. In the seventh scene, the Japanese heavy infantry made their appearance. The white armored Bayer fought footto-foot using javelins and axes to inflict heavy losses on the opposing heavy infantry and then use spears and swords to engage in close combat and annihilate the enemy. There are still 63 members left in the white armor Baya. This is not the level that Linhao&#x27;s white armored soldiers should have.</p>
<p>Someone in the live stream noticed the problem. Logically speaking, even without bows and arrows, the white armored soldiers should have no losses when fighting against infantry. Well, Gene Wuang, we&#x27;ve all overlooked one thing. By jaala as stamina is starting to decline. Everyone was odd.</p>
<p>Since his debut, Bja Bayera has fought in 20 battles. Even if we only consider the series of matches, Bja Bayera has already fought 14 matches without stopping. In 20 battles, more than 1,700 enemies were killed with each white armored Bayer killing an average of nearly 20 enemies. Keep in mind that the opposing team consists of units with excellent base stats, epic base stats, and several gold legendary units, each of which is extremely powerful. Now that the fighting has reached this point, the lords of the Eastern Kingdom are no longer concerned with their own lives, only caring about exchanging lives for lives.</p>
<p>piling up white armored by a lot to death. Such an enemy is even more insane. Despite this situation, the white armored soldiers fought 20 battles. If it were any type of unit today, even the three great nightly orders of Europe, even the physically powerful demons, even the tireless rock golems, even the titan golems that mages love the most. Gene Wuang believed they had all died from exhaustion long ago.</p>
<p>These white armored Bayer have managed to maintain their fighting strength and morale for so long. So Lyn Xiao&#x27;s white armored soldiers have been fighting for this long. Someone in the live stream said, &quot;He&#x27;s persisted for so long. So long that we thought his soldiers could just keep going indefinitely. I doubt even the legendary angel has the strength left to fight this far.&quot; This man&#x27;s words resonated with everyone and they were all surprised to realize the formidable strength of Bjaala.</p>
<p>Who exactly are these men with fierce looking faces? Everyone looked at Lynsha. The battle continued and Lynn Sha did not teleport back to the rest area. He remained watching the battle from above the battlefield within the Lord&#x27;s area set by the god system. He remained silent, his expression still, his gaze distant. warriors fight silently, neither giving orders nor interfering, letting these fierce warriors fight according to his own ideas.</p>
<p>Lyn Xiaos face revealed neither joy nor sorrow, and no one knew what he was thinking. But just seeing him standing quietly, looking so confident, everyone felt there was still hope. Even so, Baija Bayala still has seven battles to fight. Next up, the cavalry. The white armored Bayer lined up to resist the enemy, annihilating the enemy army, leaving 45 men remaining.</p>
<p>Next up, the assassin by Ja Bayer used up almost all of his consumable items to set traps and consumable weapons to intercept assassins, annihilating the enemy army. Only 41 enemy soldiers remained before Baija Bayer could even retrieve his steel rod. The next battle began. Next up, the archer. The white armored Bayer charged again, annihilating the enemy army.</p>
<p>However, in this battle, the epic archers of the Eastern Kingdom shot only at the horses, sacrificing their own lives for their horses lives, killing almost all of them. Next up, swordsmen and shieldmen. White armored Bayer can only engage in close combat with swords and shields. As battle after battle raged, the roars of the white armored soldiers on the battlefield gradually turned into howls and silence. The expressions of the people from Lsha Kingdom grew increasingly solemn and worried.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Iseroka&#x27;s expression grew increasingly contorted and furious. Despite repeated battles fought with the same desperate tactics, the white armored Bayer have not yet been completely defeated. Even though the remaining white armored barbarians could barely lift their hands and their faces were covered in blood from their eyes. Even though their white armor was no longer visible and had been completely replaced by red and black. Even though their armor was almost completely damaged and offered little protection, their weapons were almost all used up with spears broken and swords dulled and some of them were using stolen weapons.</p>
<p>But the white armored Bayer kept winning. He stayed on the battlefield. The troops that Yamamoto Isuroku sent were mercilessly killed one by one by the white armored soldiers. Finally, Yamamoto Isuroku had only one lord and one last type of soldier left. The shadow warriors assault team is almost at full strength.</p>
<p>Only 13 white armored Bayer, their armor tattered, their weapons broken, and barely able to stand. The battle continues. Chapter 190, Battle of Soldiers. Victory. The warriors fate.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao stood silently in midair on the battlefield. 13 men by Ja Beaala fought 26 battles, killing more than 2,000 enemies, while his own force dwindled from 100 to 13. Lyn Sha felt a little ironic thinking about how wild boar skin from that world also started out with 13 suits of armor. On the opposite side, the Japanese lord filled with madness and smuggness was teleported in. His face was contorted, and he stared at Lin Sha with a fierce look as if he were about to grind his teeth to powder.</p>
<p>Chinese, your soldiers can&#x27;t hold out. Their armor was completely destroyed. Their weapons were either dulled or broken. They are all injured and exhausted. They can barely stand up.</p>
<p>And I, my shadow warrior commando team, still has 93 members, all at their peak. This is one of the elite units of our great Japan. A legendary gold unit capable of assassination and melee combat. Its speed and agility are unmatched. What do you have to fight me with? The young Japanese lord was spitting as he spoke, seemingly venting all the pain he felt watching Lyn Xiaos white armored Bajara kill his teammates one by one and all the torment he had endured while waiting silently.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha, give up. If I were you, I would surrender now. Otherwise, these 13 warriors are destined to die under my shadow warriors blade. If you surrender, you can save these 13 lives. These 13 people will be grateful to you for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll also establish an image of treating soldiers well in everyone&#x27;s eyes. Recruiting soldiers will be much easier in the future. Can you bear to let warriors with no hope of victory die in vain? They killed so many people for you, fought over 20 battles for you, and have earned you enough honor by fighting to this extent. Give up now. Your results are good enough, Lyn Sha.</p>
<p>No one will blame you for not persevering. Did you hear that? The young Japanese lord&#x27;s words were piercing, their echoes reverberating across the battlefield. He waited for Lyn Xiaos reply with a cold smile, not forgetting to raise his hand high. If Lyn Xiao&#x27;s answer is no, or if Lin Shao delays by not answering, he can issue the attack order at any time. Restore the white armored soldiers stamina.</p>
<p>Not a chance. Hearing the words of the Lord opposite him, Lyn Ziao&#x27;s gaze slowly descended and landed on the group of white armored soldiers. Just then, Actton slowly turned around, his face covered in blood with only one eye open, and slowly met Lin Xiaos gaze. Lyn Sha and Actton stared at each other for two seconds. Lyn Sha nodded slowly and Actton slowly turned his head away.</p>
<p>How is it, Lyn Sha? The Japanese lord laughed exaggeratedly. Are you ready to surrender? You&#x27;ve already abandoned your troops. No, Lyn Sha said slowly. I will not surrender, nor will my troops. The Japanese lord&#x27;s gaze turned cold.</p>
<p>Do you really intend to be so cold-blooded towards your own troops? Your actions will make all branches of the military lose faith in you. My troops say that the best fate for the White Armor Bayera is to use up all their weapons in the final battle, kill the last enemy, and then die of exhaustion. Lyn Sha said coldly. He won&#x27;t stop until he&#x27;s wiped out all of you Japanese devils. You, the Japanese lord roared.</p>
<p>Since you don&#x27;t care about the lives of your soldiers, don&#x27;t blame me. He swung his arm fiercely and the 93 shadow warriors vanished in the form of green smoke. When he reappeared, the shadow warrior was less than 10 m away from the white armored Bayer. Shuriken flew out and the battle began. In a single exchange, half of the white armored Baraf fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Many of the viewers of the live stream couldn&#x27;t bear to close their eyes. They also agreed with the Japanese lord&#x27;s words. Lyn Sha was already strong enough to have come this far. But these exhausted white armored soldiers could not possibly defeat the well-rested shadow warriors. They couldn&#x27;t bear to watch the massacre.</p>
<p>They just wanted to close their eyes and wait for the notification sound from the god system indicating the end of the battle. 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes. The expected notification tone never sounded, and some people couldn&#x27;t help but open their eyes. Oh my god. The scene before him left him speechless for a long time.</p>
<p>The fierce battle continued, leaving behind a field littered with the corpses of shadow warriors and white armored soldiers of the Baija Bayer remain. The battlefield was piled high with corpses, making it difficult to walk, and the blood had turned the ground at deep dark black. by Jaba Yala fought relentlessly using his fists to hammer, his teeth to bite, his arms to lock, and even his braid to strangle the enemy. The shadow warrior s shuriken was deeply embedded in the body of the white armored Bayer, who immediately pulled it out and used it as a weapon to stab another shadow warrior in the eye socket. The shadow warrior leaped and slashed almost cleaving into his chest from the shoulder, but was caught by the white armored Bayer, who grabbed the shadow warrior&#x27;s blade, seized him, and smashed his head to pieces with a headbutt.</p>
<p>The onlookers stared, mouth agape, their eyes revealing shock, tragedy, and anger. They watched as Lias troops fought 27 battles, battling until they were out of ammunition and food. Yet they still refused to give up and continued to fight to the death. An indescribable emotion quickly welled up in their hearts, bringing tears to many eyes and choking their voices. The onlookers watched with tears in their eyes as the shadow warrior and the white armored Bayer fell one by one until no one moved anymore.</p>
<p>The shadow warrior and the white armored Bayer s corpses were scattered all over the ground. No, there is still one person who can move. It was a one-eyed man in white armor. He pushed aside the corpse that was pressing down on him. Slowly stood up and looked coldly at the Japanese lord who was already sitting on the ground in shock with his single eye.</p>
<p>He had dozens of wounds on his body. His three layers of armor were long gone. His helmet was knocked off and his braid was broken off during the battle. He was almost covered in blood. Even when he stood up, blood kept gushing from his mouth.</p>
<p>But he is still alive. That was the captain of the white armor Bayera, the number one Beturu of Shing Jing or going to act. Ding. Battle over. All units of the Japanese player have been eliminated, resulting in a loss for the player.</p>
<p>With a flash of light, Lin Sha and the last survivor, Actton, were teleported away and disappeared. Lyn Sha won. You won. We won. After a brief silence, a wave of cheers suddenly swept in, echoing throughout the entire chat area.</p>
<p>Upon returning, Lin Sha, without taking a break, immediately took Actton to the sanatorium where the team doctor brought by Chu Yusi immediately began to treat Actton. Actton, lying on the floor, was barely breathing. &quot;We have lived up to the title of Bayer,&quot; Actton said haltingly. &quot;My lord, dying now is the best possible end for a warrior. We just haven&#x27;t made amends for the mistakes we made.</p>
<p>Keep going. Lynn Shia interrupted Actton before he could continue speaking, saying, &quot;You&#x27;re just soldiers. What&#x27;s wrong with that? Even if you made any mistakes, you have already redeemed yourself through the battle, so there is no need to mention it again.&quot; Lyn Sha grasped Actton&#x27;s hand. From this day forward, the Manchu warriors will forever be members of the Chinese nation in this world. Actton&#x27;s usually cold and fierce eyes lit up for the first time.</p>
<p>Then he tilted his head to the side and closed his eyes tightly. Cheating. Cheating. Yamamoto Isuroku&#x27;s furious roar also rang out on the international channel at that moment. Chapter 191.</p>
<p>The path of white armor taking it to the United Nations. Cheating. Longa is cheating. Yamamoto Isuroku&#x27;s shrill voice rang out. Yamamoto Isuroku.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t accept defeat, can you? Chu Yusi immediately responded, &quot;What kind of behavior is it to yell and scream when you lose?&quot; Yamamoto 57 said, &quot;I have every reason to believe that Lynn Sha cheated. I just inquired with the top lords of Western Europe, including the Rothschild and Jacob families with long-standing traditions. They frankly admitted that even their angels could not withstand 27 consecutive battles against the military strength of my eastern kingdom. Moreover, even when the last soldier was killed and all ammunition and food were exhausted, no one deserted or betrayed them, not even with 100 points of loyalty. Lyn Sha must have used some strange method to cheat.</p>
<p>As soon as Yamamoto Isuroku finished speaking, Chu Yusi laughed in anger. Ridiculous. A battle witnessed by the god system can be cheated. Chu yusi said, &quot;You Japanese really are like this. When you win, you win.</p>
<p>But when you lose, you accuse others of cheating.&quot; Yamamoto Isuroku. What if I said, &quot;I suspect that Lyn Xiao&#x27;s troops are colluding with the demons.&quot; Everyone was taken aback with demons is a serious crime. Yamamoto Isuroku slowly said, &quot;As everyone knows, the demon race&#x27;s soldiers are fearless and physically powerful, and these white armored soldiers.&quot; Humph Yamamoto Isuroku sneered. The white armored soldiers look so ugly and fierce. They might be a new type of soldier developed by the demon races Andrea, and the relationship between Lin Shia and Andrea is the talk of the town.</p>
<p>Someone immediately retorted, &quot;Are the white armored soldiers human or demon? Doesn&#x27;t the god system know that? If they were demons, how could they be allowed to participate in this competition? He he, you&#x27;re all too naive. As long as the white armored soldier has a higher percentage of human blood, the god system will determine that he is still human. Yamamoto isoku retorted. It&#x27;s very simple to do this hybridization. Lyn Sha provided the human race and Andrea provided the demon race.</p>
<p>Through hybridization, a new type of human demon hybrid was born. These white armored soldiers must have been created in the same way. Just like Lynn Shia and Andrea being together, that&#x27;s hybridization. Seeing that everyone was silent, Yamamoto isku continued. Anyway, if you don&#x27;t give me an explanation today and tell me the real secret of by ja yala, our donging kingdom will definitely lodge a strong protest against your langa&#x27;s actions and we will report the unusual situation of Lin Shiao and by Jaob.</p>
<p>Take this to the United Nations. Yamamoto Isuroku&#x27;s words shocked everyone. Andrea, demons, hybrids, one after another, these unheard of secrets left everyone in shock and confusion. forgetting to refute him for a moment. At this moment,  you, Yamamoto Isuroku.</p>
<p>I thought you&#x27;d be a bit stronger, but you&#x27;re just like Kenzo Door. You cheat when you can&#x27;t win and always try to shift the blame onto me for the demon race. Can the demon race really be used as a scapegoat to contain everything? Lyn Sha spoke angrily, directly naming Yamamoto Ioku and cursing his entire family. You, how can you be so undignified as an official? How can you use foul language? Yamamoto Isuroku was taken aback. He was forced to retreat step by step by Lyn Xiao&#x27;s angry scolding, and his momentum was completely gone.</p>
<p>He could only stammer. There&#x27;s no dignity in talking to a beast like you. You can&#x27;t insult me. I&#x27;m a high-ranking official from Japan. If you insult me again, I&#x27;ll lodge a diplomatic protest with your dragon kingdom.</p>
<p>You said you wanted to protest last time, which led to this arena. This arena still can&#x27;t shut you up. Don&#x27;t you have any shame? You, Yamamoto, Iceoka blushed. I didn&#x27;t need to prove anything. Lyn Sha said, but in order to let all the beasts know that I, Lyn Shao, am innocent and that the Lsha troops are also innocent human troops, I will tell everyone the secret of the white armor Bayer.</p>
<p>The atmosphere, which had been somewhat noisy due to the argument between Lin Shiao and Yamamoto Isuroku, instantly became completely quiet. Even Yamamoto Isuroku himself didn&#x27;t retort. He nudged his attendants, signaling them to get their notes ready while he listened intently for Lin Sha to continue. Baija is the strongest warrior among the tribes that survived the hardships of a dangerous region. Lyn Sha slowly began to speak there.</p>
<p>For most of the year, there is biting cold wind and endless snow. It&#x27;s difficult to cultivate the land there, and there aren&#x27;t enough grasslands for grazing. There are only continuous forests and rivers. The people who live there fight the fiercest battle for survival every day. They hunt, they fish, and most of them have mastered superb archery, trap setting, and trap detection skills.</p>
<p>Because if we don&#x27;t catch any prey, we might starve to death tomorrow. The harsh life also cultivated their extraordinary endurance, physical strength beyond that of ordinary people and barbaric customs. Almost everyone in this group was a soldier and everyone was a skilled fighter because if they were not strong enough, they would be killed by their prey. Later, this group of people were conscripted by the conquerors and became real soldiers. Their fierce determination in struggling on the brink of death, and their honed skills quickly made them outstanding warriors.</p>
<p>Lynn Shiao said loudly, &quot;This is my unit. Why do we use so many weapons? Why are we physically strong? Why do we fight to the death? Why do we use any means necessary? This is the result of their struggle against wild beasts and nature. But that&#x27;s not enough. Not enough to reach such a formidable level.&quot; Yamamoto Isuroku shook his head in disbelief. O, this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Lyn Shao smiled faintly and said, &quot;These barbarians can join the army as early as 15 years old. After joining the army, there is an opportunity to become an unarmored ordinary infantryman. Only those who become familiar with the battlefield and survive will receive rudimentary armor and become armored soldiers. And then they will begin the assessment. Those who pass the test will be assigned to the infantry and those who excel will be assigned to the cavalry.</p>
<p>Then based on the number of kills on the battlefield, those who kill more will be promoted. Slaying a level 100 opponent grants you the ability to wear red armor. Lin Sha said, &quot;You have to kill a 100 enemies to become a red armored Bayer. Then select the best archer and horsemen among the red armored warriors to be the white armored Bayer.&quot; So you understand now, right? The reason why the white armored Bayer are so powerful is because each of them emerged from mountains of corpses and seas of blood. Even in such a barbaric tribe, hundreds of thousands of people could only muster a few hundred white armored warriors.</p>
<p>Each of them is a master hunter, a master killer, a master weapon maker, a master trapper, a master horsemen, and a master archer. They are the strongest warriors in that tribe. These hundred white armored Bayer have already taken more than 10,000 lives. So why are they so powerful? Because they cannot afford to fail. They only have victory or death.</p>
<p>Demons? We don&#x27;t need demons to crossbreed with. These people are already devils enough. Lyn Sha sneered and said, &quot;As for you, Yamamoto Isuroku, how could you know that demons can interbreed with humans? Are you just like douan crying stop thief in the thief&#x27;s name? Immersed in the legendary selection process of Bai Yamamoto Isuroku finally snapped out of it and hurriedly said, &quot;Don&#x27;t talk nonsense. This is just a guess. Guess? You&#x27;re making wild guesses based on the innocence of a Long Sha official? I&#x27;m lodging a diplomatic protest with you.&quot; Lyn Shao said, &quot;In response to your insults to our side, in the upcoming duel, Japan must pay each of our heroes an appearance fee of 100,000 silver coins in advance before we will participate.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I will report the matter of Japan framing Liao officials to the United Nations.&quot; Chapter 192. Acceptance, great reputation, visitors. Good. Lyn Shao immediately used the same tactics against Yamamoto Isuroku, leaving him speechless and unable to refute. Upon seeing this, everyone cheered loudly.</p>
<p>Are we only allowed to bully Long Sea from Japan, but not allowed to fight back? You Japanese always throw around accusations, lodge diplomatic protests, and threaten to take it all the way to the United Nations. Now Lynn Shiao is presenting the facts and reasoning and by Jaaya as suspicions have been cleared. He&#x27;s going to turn the tables on you and take your slander of Liao officials to the United Nations. Regardless of whether Yamamoto Isuroku will agree to Lyn Xiao&#x27;s outrageous demands. Seeing Yamamoto Isuroku speechless, everyone felt a great sense of relief.</p>
<p>As expected, to deal with Japan, you need someone like Lynn Shiao who doesn&#x27;t play by the rules and is truly determined when things get tough. You What do you mean you? If you&#x27;re bad, practice more. If you can&#x27;t handle losing, don&#x27;t play. Yamamoto Isuroku dared not speak again and slunk off the computer, leaving only Lin Xiao shouts behind him and the laughter of the others. Remember to pay your appearance fee or we&#x27;ll beat you to a pulp in the duel later.</p>
<p>Haha. Shaking his head, Lyn Sha also logged off. Before him lay Actton&#x27;s face, serene as if he were asleep. Upon seeing Yamamoto Isuroku&#x27;s slanderous remarks, Lyn Sha disregarded the aftermath and immediately engaged in battle. Angrily revealing the origins of the white armored Bayer, thus giving these hundred warriors who fought to the death a final honor.</p>
<p>If they actually recruited the Bay army, perhaps they would perform better in the face of this relentless attack. Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;Even if half of the Bayway army were to die, let alone 100, my heart would ache so much I couldn&#x27;t breathe.&quot; As for the white clad by a llama, to be honest, from the very beginning of his time on the field, Lyn Sha knew that he wouldn&#x27;t be too heartbroken if this type of soldier died. Because at that time, Lyn Shao always regarded the Baija Bayer as a foreign race. until the final battle, until the white armored Bayer fulfilled the glory of warriors, and the entire army was wiped out. &quot;Well,&quot; Lyn Sha sighed softly and grasped Actton&#x27;s hand.</p>
<p>&quot;After this battle, I have come to understand your hearts. You are just a group of warriors. All you&#x27;ve ever wanted is to be part of my large family. If I recruit Bayer again next time, I will try my best to make myself and everyone in the territory except you.&quot; Of course, the premise is that you must not keep your cues anymore. That&#x27;s the principle.</p>
<p>I will acknowledge that you are also part of China. Farewell, Beturu, Lynn Shiao said solemnly, gently putting down Actton&#x27;s hand, which was covered with calluses and wounds. The white armored Bayer was the latest unit Lin Sha recruited, but it was the only unit to be wiped out as a whole. After saying goodbye to Actton, Lyn Sha turned and left. Huh? The deputy city lord.</p>
<p>The team doctor in the distance suddenly called out to Lyn Sha, &quot;Is there something you need?&quot; Lyn Shao composed himself and asked with a question in his mind. &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you take your soldiers with you when you left?&quot; &quot;K, deputy city lord, take this big guy back to rest as well. It&#x27;s really inconvenient to leave him here. Rest.&quot; Lyn Sha blinked. He isn&#x27;t dead.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not dead. The team doctor blinked. I&#x27;m an A-rank medical lord. I can bring someone back to life in less than 3 minutes if their head is severed. I didn&#x27;t say he was dead, did I? But just now, his head tilted to the side and his eyes closed heavily.</p>
<p>That was due to exhaustion. So, I used the tortoise breathing therapy on him to allow his body functions to recover slowly and avoid leaving any after effects. Before the team doctor could finish speaking, Lynn Sha walked over awkwardly, waved his hand, and took Actton back to his territory. I have something to do. I&#x27;ll be going now.</p>
<p>Yes, deputy city lord. Seeing Lynn Sha vanish in a flash of light, the team doctor laughed heartily. I never expected that the deputy city lord who treats enemies with the harshness of winter would be so adorable when he&#x27;s embarrassed. Dough Bing won. And according to the rules of the heroic martial arts arena, Lia has already scored two points.</p>
<p>Next is the duel and the winner gets three points. The final duel between lords will award five points to the winner. With Lia having secured the first victory, the chat channel was filled with a joyful atmosphere. Celebrate. Celebrate.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to celebrate all day long before tomorrow&#x27;s duel begins. How many years has it been since we&#x27;ve had a victory? So, let&#x27;s have a few drinks to celebrate today. Thank you to everyone who fought bravely. Thank you, city lord Lyn Shao, and thank you, Queen Dugu. It was her discerning eye that discovered Lyn Xiao&#x27;s talent.</p>
<p>Ha. Lyn Xiaos reputation continued to rise, spreading across the vast land of Lia, whether in cities or villages, whether in the real country of Langia or the battlefield of all races in the Lia domain through the live broadcast of the main god system and the widespread praise from person to person. In addition, the processing and embellishment by information middlemen. Wherever there is well water, one knows Lyn Sha. A clear, melodious voice rang out from within the ancient palace.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re bad at the game, practice more. If you can&#x27;t handle losing, don&#x27;t play. An interesting kid. The clear, melodious voice seemed to be conversing with someone. By the way, Shaolon, have you moved over yet? Not yet.</p>
<p>Why are you so slow? Are you embarrassed? The women of our Dugu family are no less than men. We do things entirely according to our own will. So why should we care about the opinions of others? You played an extraordinary role in the past as I have already mentioned. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m asking you to move in with him. What&#x27;s there to be embarrassed about? You&#x27;ve already told him.</p>
<p>No, you only mentioned by Jia. You can be sure he&#x27;s connected to the ancient demons. Yes, that&#x27;s what I think too. You want to outdo him in the duel and then move over to carry out the mission. Okay, let&#x27;s do it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Ancient demons are not some heinous species. Don&#x27;t forget, we also have intricate connections with ancient demons. It must be kept secret. After the call ended, the clear, melodious voice seemed to be talking to itself. I&#x27;m starting to understand Andrea better now.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s quite an interesting lad. I&#x27;m becoming more and more interested in him. By the way, we should ask Jabbron Andrea about her recent activities. She&#x27;s been quiet for a while now. Knowing her personality, she&#x27;s definitely brewing something big.</p>
<p>Following the battle, Lynn Sha returned to his territory. Everything in the territory was in perfect order, even more prosperous than when I was there. All of this was managed by his strongest all-around hero, Wong Ming, Wong Jinglu. Lyn Shiao granted Wong Ming the highest level of authority besides his own and Baois. The golden farmers continue to be summoned, constantly cultivating one golden field after another.</p>
<p>And with the super special effect of eternal peace, they continuously produce highquality grains. Two barracks and several hero specific buildings are constantly recruiting powerful Chinese soldiers, continuously replenishing Lin Xiao strength. Even the various buildings are upgrading themselves, making the most of every opportunity to improve. The flower fairies were working in the mines near the border. While in the deeper valleys, wild monsters were shouting slogans as they enthusiastically dug into the veins.</p>
<p>Their many heroes lead various troop types to farm and fight monsters in the vast wilderness outside their territory. Lyn Sha was about to find Wong Ming to inquire about the territory situation. My lord, you&#x27;re back. A stunningly beautiful woman in a dark red cloak ran out in surprise and threw herself into Lyn Xiaos arms. Ma Lyn Shiao felt the warmth of the beauty in his arms and gently stroked Baos hair.</p>
<p>He Ba greets the city lord. Naughty, I&#x27;ll punish you. Lyn Xiaos hand gently landed. Uh my lord, please don&#x27;t. We have guests here.</p>
<p>Um chapter 193. Dugu Jaolan and Baoi. Payman&#x27;s good fortune. Um, a guest has arrived. Lyn Shao realized what was happening and turned around.</p>
<p>He saw a beautiful figure standing not far behind him, looking at him with a half smile. My lord, please forgive me. Ba whispered. When the lord left, he handed over the territo&#x27;s authority to Mr. Wong Ming.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Miss Dugu wanted to visit and Wong Ming asked for my opinion. I remembered that the lord said that apart from the three vassel lords, Miss Dugu and young master Chu could come and go freely within the territory. So I agreed. It&#x27;s all right. Lyn Sha waved his hand.</p>
<p>Dugu Jaon slowly approached. These past few days, every time I see you, beautiful women throw themselves into your arms. Dugu Jaolon parted her lips slightly and said softly, you&#x27;re quite the lucky one, old classmate. Haha, old squad leader. Welcome, welcome.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha quickly stepped forward. I, Lynsha, am a gentleman. I have no other companion but Baoi. Please don&#x27;t misunderstand, old squad leader. Oh, so you&#x27;re admitting to having a relationship with this heroine.</p>
<p>Dugu Jaolan slowly looked at Baoi and Baoi also raised her head, looking at Dugu Jaolan with a slight shyness. One is a young woman, not yet 20, and the other is a legendary figure who has lived for thousands of years and even served as a queen. Yet their temperaments are completely opposite. Like her aunt, Doug Jaolon was aloof and elegant with an unconscious air of superiority. Baoi was alluring, seductive, pure and gentle, and mature and captivating.</p>
<p>But her temperament was more delicate. The two stunning beauties met only once and even though they were both friendly and there was no conflict, Lynn Shiao discovered that their roles in the family were completely different. One was a bright and elegant lady, the head of the household. The other was a charming and gentle concubine. I just don&#x27;t know which man is worthy of a woman like Dugu Jalon as top tier in terms of family background, beauty, and ability.</p>
<p>Lin Sha nodded and said to Dugu Jaon, &quot;Of course, Baoi has feelings for me, and I cannot be ungrateful to her. Baoi is my companion, and everyone in my territory knows this. Even outside, many people know that boss Lin Sha was rewarded by the system with a hidden female hero,&quot; said Lonely Gallon with a half smile. Lyn Shiao and she exchanged a glance and smiled knowingly. &quot;By the way, I didn&#x27;t know that the class monitor had graced us with his presence.</p>
<p>What can I do for you? Can I come if I don&#x27;t have any instructions? Dugu Jaolan smiled mysteriously. Just consider this a visit between old friends. May I wander around your territory? Sure. Lin Shiao along with Dugu Jaalon and Baoi strolled through the territory. At this moment, the heroes were all fighting on the frontier, and there weren&#x27;t many troops patrolling the territory.</p>
<p>So the group simply watched the farmers and flower fairies working in the territory and chatted about everyday matters from time to time. Dugu Jaolon was accompanied by two women who occasionally glanced at Lynsha. Both of them were tall and slender. One of the female soldiers was heroic and spirited with bright and lively eyes. She would occasionally glance at Lin Sha with a curious look.</p>
<p>The other person was a few points taller than Dugu Jaolan with a European appearance, wearing a golden mask that covered the upper half of his face, and his right hand and left leg appeared to be golden prosthetics. A guest flashed through Lin Xiaos mind. Just then, Wong Ming walked over with Pay Min. My lord, young Master Pay Min has completed his leveling up and is now at level 49, 90% complete. I have already forbidden him from further training.</p>
<p>then let young master pay Min accompany the lord. Upon seeing Pay Min, Dugu Jaolons eyes lit up. The two female attendants behind him also turned their gazes over, staring intently at Pay Min. Pay Min was dressed in spotless white, his face with sharp features, exuding a carefree and unrestrained air with a slight smile playing on his lips. So your hero in white is called Pay Min.</p>
<p>Dugu Jalon nodded. This humble one, Pay Min, greets Lord Dugu. Pay Min knew that the visitors were distinguished guests, so he greeted them politely and then accompanied them for a walk. Speaking of which, I have to thank you for reminding me of Baijabaya s pursuit, Lin Shiao said sincerely to Dugu Jaolan. If it weren&#x27;t for your reminder, I might not have been able to unleash their full potential and achieve victory in the battle.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re welcome. I only happened to see this record in an ancient book, Dugu Jaolan said casually. He he unintentionally. An ancient book? The old squad leader&#x27;s words were quite profound. Where can you find any ancient Chinese books these days? Anyone who can see ancient books is practically connected to ancient demons.</p>
<p>Lyn Shia chuckled, not exposing Dugu Jaons words. The two strolled and chatted for a while longer before Dugu Jaon took her leave. After the three of them disappeared through the portal, Pay Min stretched and lazily said, &quot;There&#x27;s always been a feeling that she&#x27;s inspecting her future home, choosing a good spot for herself to move in.&quot; Lynn Sha chuckled. How could you have such a thought? Of course, the only one worthy of Lord is this Miss Dugu. You two are classmates, so you have an advantage of being close by.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it&#x27;s perfect that she&#x27;s moving in. The Lord&#x27;s harm needs a principal wife like Miss Dugu to keep things in order. Nonsense. Does the Lord not find Miss Dugu attractive? Or is it that he can no longer tolerate other women after marrying Miss Ba? Ba who was standing to the side quickly grabbed Lyn Xiao&#x27;s arm. Ba is just a hero.</p>
<p>It is already a great honor for me to accompany the Lord. The Lord must not delay his important matter of getting married and starting a family because of Baoi. Lyn Sha waved his hand, signaling Baoi to calm down. Well, Baoi has directly positioned herself as a concubine. She&#x27;s truly born with the divine body of a concubine.</p>
<p>Gurudu Jaolon is a member of one of the four most powerful families in Lshia today. No matter if it is for political reasons or other reasons, it is impossible for him to be with a commoner. Lynn Shao frankly told his partner Baoi as well as Pay Min who was both his master and servant and his friend. Ah, no wonder the Lord has already become the deputy city lord. Pay Min teased.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t the Lord say never to underestimate a young man&#x27;s potential? One day when the Lord rises to prominence, what will the four great families matter? Yes, pay men, you come from a powerful and influential family. I believe what you say. The two looked at each other and burst into laughter. On another note, &quot;My lord, don&#x27;t you think that the two women behind Miss Dugu are after me.&quot; Payman scratched his head ungracefully and sighed. &quot;Could it be that my luck with women is about to change, pay?&quot; &quot;One is a valiant heroine, no less than Lord Chin Leonu.</p>
<p>The other is a tall, beautiful woman of foreign origin.&quot; Ba couldn&#x27;t help but chuckle. Young Master Pay has finally come to his senses. I think they are indeed after you, but it&#x27;s not a stroke of luck in love. What is that? I&#x27;m here to fight you. Hey, Mina, huh? How did you find out, Lord? Lynn Shia smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Because you can&#x27;t hide the look in someone&#x27;s eyes when they want to kill you. Watch out for that woman with the prosthetic leg. Shell beat you up sooner or later. After saying this, Lyn Sha embraced Ba and left, his voice carrying far away. Get some rest.</p>
<p>Tomorrow&#x27;s duel is up to you. If you lose, your luck with romance will be gone. Chapter 194. This is my hero, the sword saint. On this day, gongs and drums resounded and firecrackers crackled.</p>
<p>With yesterday&#x27;s triumphant start at the martial arts arena, the people of Longshot Kingdom are extremely excited, high-spirited, and cheerful. Even their conversations have become more optimistic. The first small victory in over a decade has caused such a reaction from the people of Long Shia shows just how unsatisfactory Long Shia has been in recent years. Don&#x27;t get too cocky. The heroic arena has three parts.</p>
<p>We won the first one, the soldier duel, but we only got two points. Gene Wuang tried to persuade everyone to calm down. Even if we win the duel and get three points, we still can&#x27;t get five points in the final duel against the Lord. The result is still a draw in the heroic arena and we&#x27;ll have to play a tiebreaker. So don&#x27;t be too happy yet.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen it all before. Shut up, you old devil. A chief lord who is several hundred years old is not as surprising as city lord Lin Shiao who is not even 20 years old. You seeing that no one appreciated his efforts, Jin Wuang had no choice but to say, &quot;I have also made some contributions to nurturing Lin Xiaos growth.&quot; Everyone was speechless. Lynn Shiao couldn&#x27;t help but feel ashamed when he saw the chat content.</p>
<p>He thought to himself, &quot;Jean Wuang is sacrificing the life of a worthless descendant, and the overall shooter is famous all over the world.&quot; However, as the chief lord who was like an old demon, Gene Wuang did not use his power to oppress others, nor did he retaliate against himself. He truly had the demeanor of a senior master. Aside from that cackling laughter and the powerless clone, shaking his head, Lynn Shia went to the rest area. All the lords participating in the competition have taken their positions accompanied by the heroes they are preparing to fight. Similar to the battle, it starts with an elimination tournament.</p>
<p>The main god system selects people to engage in one-on-one duels, and the loser is eliminated. Unlike the battle system, the lord cannot choose the order of appearance. It is all determined by the main god system. After the top 16 are determined by both sides or if one side has too many eliminated players and has fewer than eight heroes left, the group stage will begin directly. The final battle ends when all heroes on one side are defeated or killed.</p>
<p>Heroes are not a unit type and it is difficult to replace them once they are lost. Therefore, there is an additional option for the lord to decide whether to concede defeat for the hero. In order to prevent the hero death rate from being as terrifying as that of combat troops, aside from the lord surrendering voluntarily, the only other options are the hero dying in battle or the god system determining that the hero has lost all ability to resist and voluntarily stopping the fight. Nevertheless, in the past, nearly half of the duels on the martial arts arena still resulted in a death rate because killing an enemy and counter killing often happened in an instant and even lords could not react in time. In the rest area, Lyn Sha led Pay Min forward slowly, nodding to each lord.</p>
<p>Boss, over here, he waved excitedly and greeted Lin Sha. Lyn Sha approached Hay and saw him. Ding Li Shin Ningming Tu Shan by Chian and others boasting and competing with each other each leading their own heroes. Lyn Xiaos heart skipped a beat. Is he a finally recruiting heroes after his subordinates are all flower fairies? My lord.</p>
<p>A sickeningly sweet voice rang out and a green fairy pounced into Lin Xiaos arms. Huh? Yao Yao, it&#x27;s you. Of course, it&#x27;s Yao Yao. Yao Yao is a hero, too. Lynn Shiao exasperated pulled away the flower fairy squad leader who was clinging to him tightly only to be groped by her along the way.</p>
<p>Yay! Yao Yao touched the lords. Before the flower fairy could finish speaking, he grabbed her and covered her mouth in horror. You can&#x27;t just say things like that. A low chuckle came from Pay Min behind him. Lynn Sha put his hand to his forehead and said, &quot;He&#x27;s a after this arena match, I&#x27;ll punish you by making you give me another hundred flower fairies.&quot; The flower fairy captain&#x27;s eyes lit up instantly.</p>
<p>Yao Yao is going to serve the Lord. Oh dear, please stop talking. He scooped up the flower fairy captain and exclaimed, &quot;Boss, look at this beauty&#x27;s heroine. She&#x27;s got some brand new stuff.&quot; Lyn Sha then turned his head and saw Tu Shawn by Chin&#x27;s hero. Brother Lyn Shao, this is my hero, the unforgiven master Yasuo.</p>
<p>Tuchan Bchin happily introduced her hero to Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha glanced at the young man with a high ponytail, a murderous look on his face, a burly build, and a long sword in his hand and nodded. Very good. Looks very strong. He Thank you for the compliment, brother Lynsha.</p>
<p>This is a sword saint. You know, he&#x27;s very strong in one-on-one combat. This is a hero I carefully selected. Good snort. Pay Min.</p>
<p>The kid behind him suddenly let out a faint snort. Brother Shia, let me introduce my hero to you as well. Dinglay walked over. This is my hero. A reward I got from an epic chest.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s incredibly powerful. Dinglay said with a proud look. Sword Sainto. Samuru. Lin Shiao turned his head and saw a tall, muscular, green-skinned orc hero with two long fangs standing next to Ding Lay.</p>
<p>The hero immediately bowed deeply to Lin Sha to show his respect. &quot;This face looks so familiar.&quot; &quot;Locktar ogre?&quot; Lyn Sha asked tentatively. Unexpectedly, Samurus eyes lit up upon hearing this. Great Earth goddess, even the Lord understands the ancient orc language. Please allow me to serve my Lord as I would a lord.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry about it. I saw this in an ancient book. Just follow the Lord and do a good job. I&#x27;ll reward you if you do well. Lyn Xiaos casual remark almost poached Ding Lays hero, leaving Ding Lay with a resentful expression.</p>
<p>Brother Shiao, when will you teach me the ancient orc language? I&#x27;d like to increase my hero loyalty. I&#x27;ll definitely do it next time. Your loyalty as a sword saint is quite high. Lynn Sha chuckled. I&#x27;ll definitely do it next time.</p>
<p>Snort. Another cold snort came from behind. It was that kid Pay Min again. What&#x27;s wrong with this kid today? Just as Lin Sha was about to turn around and asked Pay Min. Two tall figures walked over.</p>
<p>Dugu Jalon said from afar, student Lynn, &quot;It&#x27;s quite lively here. Are you having a pre-show competition between your heroes? Count me in.&quot; Dugu Jalon walked in front, followed by the tall red-haired woman who wore a half-g gold mask and had a golden prosthetic limb. The woman revealed half of her face and snow white chin. Her cloak barely trailed on the ground. She had a slender figure, a mysterious aura, and an air of arrogance that seemed even more hottie than Dugu Jaolon.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you. This is Marlenia, who has some unique insights into swordsmanship. She really wants to spar with a true master swordsman. She&#x27;s heard there&#x27;s a sword saint here. Dug Jalon said calmly.</p>
<p>Would you mind if she sparred with that sword saint? Yasuo and Yuro s gazes suddenly met, sparking a connection. Dinglay and Tu Shan by Chin exchanged a glance and shouted, &quot;My hero is the sword saint.&quot; Lyn Shiao glanced helplessly at Dugu Xaolon and shrugged. &quot;Class monitor, you&#x27;re joking again.&quot; The two looked at each other and smiled. Snort. Pay Min let out another soft, cold snort, which caught Marlinia&#x27;s attention.</p>
<p>The redhaired woman was about to walk towards Pay Min. Chu Yusi&#x27;s voice rang out. On your marks. 5 minutes until the duel begins. Chapter 195.</p>
<p>Why does no one say Lin Xiao&#x27;s hero is very strong. The duel begins. In the live stream room set up by the God system, hundreds of millions of viewers flocked in. Both teams players were in the rest area preparing their heroes while the chatter in the live stream room had already started. Yesterday&#x27;s victory put everyone in high spirits and people started chatting more.</p>
<p>Do you think we can win this duel? I think we should be able to win. Although Lia&#x27;s national strength is not as good as Japan&#x27;s, it has a large population and many outstanding heroes. Heroes have always been one of the strengths of my dragon kingdom. I think it&#x27;s feasible. So everyone, who do you think are the strongest heroes among our group of young players from Lia? Once the topic was brought up, everyone offered their opinions.</p>
<p>I think first of all, the two champions from last year and this year are very strong heroes. Someone said, &quot;All I know is that last year&#x27;s hero was Gandalf, a rare magic type hero.&quot; Yes, I had the privilege of witnessing it once last year. It was indeed very strong, at least at the epic level or above. Yes. And there&#x27;s also this year&#x27;s number one, Dugu Jalon.</p>
<p>Although I don&#x27;t know who her hero is, you can see it, too. The man reminded everyone. Look at the woman next to Dugu Jaolon. She&#x27;s the hero she&#x27;s fighting this time. Just looking at her posture, she looks really powerful.</p>
<p>Dingle. This kid&#x27;s hero is a half orc wielding such a long sword. He must be very strong. I just heard someone say it was a sword saint. That&#x27;s quite a name.</p>
<p>I think the heroes of Julie are pretty good too. Chufing Olaf, the leader of the Berserkers, is an epic hero. Wongbo looks very strong, too. Chandosian. Amid the discussion, a voice asked, &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t anyone say that Lyn Xiaos hero is very strong?&quot; There was a moment of silence in the live stream.</p>
<p>Then everyone burst into laughter. Haha. The man puzzled asked, &quot;Why are you laughing?&quot; Someone responded, &quot;You mean Lyn Xiao&#x27;s hero in white? Is there even a question? It has to be the strongest. That&#x27;s right. Anyone who&#x27;s paid even a little attention to Lyn Xiao&#x27;s exploits in the newbie zone probably knows him.&quot; The man was puzzled.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m from the Long Bay region. I haven&#x27;t paid attention to this before. Can you tell me about it? Back when Ding Lay was Lin Xiao&#x27;s rival, he once single-handedly defeated three top masters. King Bo of Joli Pans Sha Yu and Lyn Xiao&#x27;s whiteclad hero. In the live stream, someone vividly described that hero in white defeated Dinglay with just one sword strike.</p>
<p>Also, when the black flame army attacked Lyn Shiao, did you know who the heroes he led were? The ultimate sword saint. That Wuji sword saint is also a renowned one-on-one hero in the official server, having slain hundreds of heroes. He is one of the most capable assassins of the terrifying organization, the Celestials. But even the sword saint of Limitless was killed by Lin Xiao&#x27;s whiteclad hero with his most proficient killing move. Wow, that&#x27;s strong.</p>
<p>And another thing, have you ever seen Lin Shiao use that flowing Starfall sword technique? That whiteclad hero can do it, too. And he&#x27;s even stronger. And also, I heard that the demon Brans from the abyss was brutally beaten up by the whiteclad hero. The crowd chimed in, each adding their own details about the whiteclad hero&#x27;s glorious exploits, leaving those who had never witnessed such a spectacle filled with longing. We are so excited about this duel because we have already considered the hero in white as one of the champion candidates.</p>
<p>Everyone understood. But then someone asked, &quot;If our heroes are so powerful, don&#x27;t the Japanese have any powerful heroes? If our strongest hero encounters the strongest hero from Japan right at the start of the elimination rounds, wouldn&#x27;t we be eliminated immediately? Everyone paused for a moment. Even if they were optimistic about the situation on Lord Long Lia&#x27;s side, they would not think that the heroes on the Japanese side were weak. After all, Japan is a longestablished power that can easily field six legendary gold units and dozens of epic units in its combat system. I do have some insights into your question.</p>
<p>Gene Wuang reappeared mysteriously. All the battles are arranged by the god system and the god system will make distinctions to avoid the strongest heroes meeting at the beginning. In the knockout stage, the generals selected by the main god can only be one of two kinds. First, a duel between two relatively weak heroes. Secondly, we will assign powerful heroes to weak heroes, thus allowing the powerful heroes to advance smoothly.</p>
<p>Only in this way can we have the exciting round of 16 matches that follow. Those powerful heroes can also be called seed heroes. Gene Wuang&#x27;s patient explanations paid off, and everyone finally understood that the god system had taken this into consideration long ago. That&#x27;s good, too. So, we can see these truly powerful heroes go further and compete with equally matched opponents.</p>
<p>Pay Min, who was secretly watching the live stream chat, was overjoyed. Although he maintained a calm and collected demeanor, befitting a reclusive master, the slight upturn of his lips betrayed his smuggness. &quot;All right, enough showing off. Look, you haven&#x27;t even played yet, and everyone already thinks you&#x27;re one of the strongest heroes.&quot; Lyn Shao joked. Huh? Kids martial arts skills are truly outstanding.</p>
<p>This time I will surely make a name for myself and bring glory to my ancestors. Pay Min glanced at Lyn Sha again. And you still want to spread the fame of my lord. All right. All right.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s your turn. Yes, my lord. I&#x27;ll keep showing off when I get back. With a flash of light, Lin Shia and Pay Min entered the battle arena. At the same time, nine other Dragia lords also entered the battlefield to fight against the Japanese lords.</p>
<p>The knockout stage has officially begun. Everyone stopped their discussion and watched intently as 10 simultaneous hero battles unfolded. Look, it&#x27;s a his hero is a flower fairy. I&#x27;ve never heard of the flower fairy hero. And the pretty girl was also taken advantage of.</p>
<p>Her champion was Yasuo, the unforgiven. Look, they&#x27;re about to start fighting. Look at Len Sha. The hero in white has arrived. The hero in white moved.</p>
<p>Huh? Why isn&#x27;t the enemy hero reacting? The Japanese hero is dead. Did the hero in white win? Lyn Shia and the hero in white have been teleported out. That&#x27;s way too fast. Really? Really? It&#x27;s over before I even started watching. Everyone was taken aback and quickly looked for the hero in white.</p>
<p>With a flash of light, Lin Sha and Pay Min returned to the rest area. Pay Min maintained the posture from when he drew his sword, slowly sheathing it. His handsome and upright face gradually approached the blade and he gently exhaled. Payman gently blew a drop of blood off the sword. The live stream was quiet for a moment then.</p>
<p>Holy crap, that&#x27;s awesome. Damn, that&#x27;s so cool. The hero in white is so cool. The speed, the aura, the melancholy after killing and the way he blows away the blood. Lyn Sha is awesome.</p>
<p>The hero in white is awesome. Chapter 196 sword saint. It&#x27;s the sword saint again. Payman&#x27;s face turned pale. Across from them in the Japanese rest area, Yamamoto Isuroku also looked astonished.</p>
<p>He knew Lin Shiao was very strong. Lyn Xiaos whiteclad hero was very strong. Theoretically speaking, the god system will definitely arrange for Lin Sha to fight against the weaker lord on its side. Therefore, he instructed his men that if they encountered Lin Shiao and the white-clad hero, they did not need to defeat them. They only needed to defend themselves and hold out for a while before admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Isuroka&#x27;s idea was to avoid losing any heroes just to buy some time so that his side could figure out the whiteclad hero sword techniques and have more ways to deal with them. But to their surprise, with a flash of sword light, their own exceptional level hero was killed on the spot before he could even take two steps. How could it be so fast? How did Lyn Shiao managed to recruit such a terrifying hero? Yamamoto Isuroku was furious. Lyn Shao instantly killed his own lord at the start of the battle, which had a significant impact on both sides. The morale of the Japanese plummeted once again, while the morale of Lshia soared instantly.</p>
<p>Even the other dragon sia heroes who were fighting were encouraged and fought each other recklessly with the weak Japanese lord Sakura Shichiro Toy Jinichiro Tokugawa Hiyato. When you go on stage later, you must deliver a fatal blow and annihilate their heroes of the dragon kingdom showing the might of our eastern Japan. or else you can commit sepukuku baka. In contrast to Yamamoto Isuroku&#x27;s fury, Riawa was in a state of ecstasy. Shouts of Lin Sha is mighty and the whiteclad hero is mighty echoed one after another.</p>
<p>Payman&#x27;s lips were practically trembling with rage. But in order to maintain his composure as a master, he had to force himself to hold it in, making Lin Sha want to shake his head in disbelief. Before long, one lord after another, along with their heroes, were teleported back by the god system. My lord, your hero was so cool. Just now, a sweet cloying voice rang out.</p>
<p>It was he and his flower fairy captain who had returned. The two ran over excitedly, and the flower fairy captain lunged at Pay Min, only to be grabbed and thrown away by Lin Shia. Be more reserved, Yao Yao. Yao Yao also wants to touch this hero&#x27;s abs. Before he could finish speaking, Heay covered the flower fair&#x27;s mouth again.</p>
<p>Young Master Pi, please don&#x27;t mind her. That&#x27;s just how flower fairies are. He boss, you didn&#x27;t expect me to win, did you? I thought Yao Yao, who relied entirely on talking and self-destruction, would definitely be reincarnated this time. He said happily. I never expected the poison the Lord bestowed upon me to be so effective.</p>
<p>Yao Yao s skills are getting stronger and stronger. She can release poison while running around the battlefield and actually poison the sumo wrestler Yokozuna hero to death. It&#x27;s hilarious. So it was Xiaoir&#x27;s famous poison again. Lyn Shao realized a flash of light appeared and soon Ding Lay and Tu Shan by Chin also came out both with smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>My sword saint easily defeated the Japanese samurai on the other side. Dinglay said proudly. In just one minute, a four times damage critical hit killed the enemy on the spot. Misaro is really too strong. Mine is the true master.</p>
<p>My Yasuo killed the enemy champion in just one minute. The enemy champions couldn&#x27;t even touch the hem of Yasuo&#x27;s clothes. Yasuo is truly powerful. Yasuo is the true master. E L Lin Sha looked at the two men who were on the verge of exchanging blows and couldn&#x27;t help but shake his head.</p>
<p>What are you two arguing about? Ding Li and Tu Shan by Chin said in unison, &quot;We&#x27;ll compete for the title of sword saint.&quot; Behind him, Pay Min, who had been quite pleased, let out another cold snort. Lyn Sha was amused. It turned out that Pay Min was unhappy because someone called himself the sword saint in front of him. This kid has quite a bit of vanity. &quot;All right, stop arguing,&quot; Lyn Sha said, stopping the two.</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion, it&#x27;s better to let strength decide the outcome. How about we name the one who fights to the very end the sword saint?&quot; Dingle and Tu Shan by Chin also thought this was a good idea. At this moment, Dugu Jaolon, who had also returned from the battlefield, passed by. She was with Marlenia and seemingly eager to stir up trouble, casually asked. Which hero is the sword saint? Mine is.</p>
<p>Mine is the one, the two of them said in unison. Lyn Sha could only glance helplessly at the troublemaking Dugu Jaolon, who secretly winked at him. Oh my, my lord. This noble woman seems to have feelings for you. Pay joked.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re one step closer to marrying into a wealthy family, Lord. Lyn Sha withdrew his hand and said calmly, &quot;The class monitor has always been like this. Only those who know her well know that she is cold on the outside but warm on the inside and likes to cause trouble. This is just a genuine expression of affection between old friends. Don&#x27;t over interpret it.</p>
<p>Making trouble?&quot; Pay Min&#x27;s eyes lit up. Ugg smack. Lyn Sha suddenly realized what was happening. Turned around and got another sharp wrap on the head. I think you haven&#x27;t had enough of being beaten yet.</p>
<p>Dingle and Tan by Chian exchanged a glance, shook their heads, and left. Their voices drifted from afar. No matter who wins the title of sword saint in the end, I don&#x27;t think it will be the whiteclad hero, will it? H what kind of sword saint has such a foul mouth? And he gets beaten up by the lord all the time. In the first round of 10 knockout matches, Long Sha won eight. Even in the two matches he lost, Lia conceded defeat in time, saving the hero.</p>
<p>If things continue like this, the dawn of victory seems to be just around the corner. Lin Shiao, Dugu, Jaolon, Dinglay, and Tuchan Baian all won with overwhelming advantages. It seems that they are the experts judged by the main god system, and they have been matched with weak opponents to ensure their advancement. Eay also wore down his opponent, which was just a case of two weaklings fighting, and he won entirely by being shameless. After a short break, the second round of the knockout stage began.</p>
<p>Soon, the Lang Shia group&#x27;s initial joy turned to disappointment. In the second match, a master from Japan makes his appearance. Sakura Shichiro s Miiamoto Mousashi instantly killed Lia&#x27;s hero within the first 30 seconds of the game. Honda Tatakatu of Tokugawa Hayato knocked down Ryu Natsu Hiro within the first minute of the game. While Ryunatsu Lord was performing a cool but useless execution move, he slammed his fist on the ground to admit defeat and escaped with his life.</p>
<p>Roland&#x27;s hero was far-flying Sasuke, who defeated the Dragon Summer Hero in less than 2 minutes. The dragon summer lord promptly conceded defeat, but upon returning to the rest area, he succumbed to the poison and died within 3 seconds beyond the help of the team doctor. One after another, heroes of dragon summer were defeated. In the second match, only Chufinga&#x27;s Olaf and Lind Douching Gandalf won. Lia, eight losses and two wins.</p>
<p>The advantage has been completely wiped out. After everyone calmed down, the third elimination round began. In the third match, the true strength of the Eastern Kingdom was revealed. In addition to Julie&#x27;s victory, even Wong Bo lost the match. Lia won four and lost six.</p>
<p>As the competition progressed, Lia Kingdom lost more often than it won. In the final elimination match, Toyottomy Jinichiro, known as the greatest genius in Japan, made his reappearance. Lords of the Dragia Kingdom, I am honored to introduce you. Toy Jinichiro raised his head and declared, &quot;This is the strongest one-on-one hero of my great Eastern Empire. Sword Saint Ishan Ashina chapter 197 Terrifying Strength and the Riddler Lin Sha Sword Saint Ishan Ashina.</p>
<p>Holy crap. Wow. Holy crap. Three. Holy crap.&quot; S rang out simultaneously from Ding Lay.</p>
<p>Tu Shan by Chin and Pay Min. The first two thought to themselves, why is someone calling me sword saint again? While Pay Min was simply annoyed once more, &quot;The sword saint, it&#x27;s the sword saint again. Is the nickname sword saint like cabbage? Something you can just buy anywhere at the market?&quot; On the other side, Asha is matched against Garen, a two-handed swordsman led by Lord Hiroshi of Dragon Street. Damn it, why was my hero matched with Ishin Ashina? Ishin Ashina can&#x27;t be a noob. So, does that mean my hero is a noob? Guanghuan muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Then I&#x27;ve been used by the god system as a stepping stone for Toyottomy Jennyurro. No way. My Garin is definitely not a stepping stone. With such powerful defensive capabilities, even if we can&#x27;t defeat Ishina, we can&#x27;t let the enemy win easily. Garen, go for it.</p>
<p>Give it your all. Don&#x27;t worry about winning. Just hold on for 2 minutes, then we&#x27;ll concede. Yes, sir. The tall man, Garin, wearing thick armor, immediately responded.</p>
<p>The battle begins. Courage. Garin immediately activated his shield to increase his defense while simultaneously gripping his greatsword with both hands and assuming a fighting stance. Opposite them, a samurai dressed in traditional Japanese armor, holding a long sword, slowly walked over. weak, too weak.</p>
<p>Ishin Asha didn&#x27;t even want to look directly at Garen, who was giving it his all, and simply raised his head slightly, pointing his chin at him. I usually only kill experts. I&#x27;ll give you one chance. Just admit defeat. If you don&#x27;t give up in 3 seconds, I&#x27;ll end this.</p>
<p>Damn it. You look down on me like this before the fight has even started. Garren shouted. I am one of the strongest shields. How can I admit defeat without even drawing my sword? Take this, Ishinina.</p>
<p>Charge. Garin&#x27;s great sword suddenly gathered energy and his armor emitted a faint glow. He roared and ignoring Hiatoshi&#x27;s command, charged directly at Asha. A fatal blow. Garin leaped high into the air, charging towards the warrior before him with the force of a thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Oymph. You want to defend. You want to attack. You want to fight, but you don&#x27;t want to fight. Your heart is full of hesitation.</p>
<p>Asha Ishin slowly placed his hand on the scabbard, assuming a Japanese swordsmanship starting stance. He remained calm and composed, his gaze silently fixed on the distance. If your heart is filled with hesitation, your strength will be scattered. Just as Garin&#x27;s great sword was about to fall on Ishin Asha&#x27;s head, one word slash double combo. A flash of light appeared as Ishin Ashina appeared behind Garen.</p>
<p>His posture remained unchanged, but his katana was already drawn. There was blood on the knife. Ishin Ashina Garin swayed and then fell heavily to the ground. The battle is over. The god system immediately executed the teleportation and the screen switched accordingly.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of everyone&#x27;s eye, it seemed that Garin&#x27;s fall on the battlefield had broken him into three pieces. H. The Japanese swordsman is terrifyingly powerful. Tank heroes known for their defense are nothing more than a single blow in front of him. The entire room fell silent.</p>
<p>In the rest area, the expressions of all the dragon lords also became serious. This guy is pretty strong. Chu Yusi sighed. I&#x27;ve long heard that a sword saint hero has emerged from the new generation of Japan and he&#x27;s incredibly powerful. I thought it was just some boastful person giving themselves the title of hero.</p>
<p>This sword saint lives up to his reputation. My sword saint is no weakling either and my sword saint will definitely not lose to Ishinina Dinglay and Tu Shan by Chian immediately replied. Very good. You have this unwavering confidence in victory. That&#x27;s the mindset of becoming a strong person.</p>
<p>Keep it up. You might encounter Ishinina in the next round. Chu Yui nodded an affirmation. Turning his head again, Chu Yui saw Lin Shiao and his white-clad hero, both of whom had strange expressions. The hero in white looked solemn, while Lyn Sha looked like he was questioning the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha, what do you think? I&#x27;ve only ever seen the elderly and the middle-aged with one mind. This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen the young with one mind, Lyn Sha said seemingly to himself. Chui what? Oh, it&#x27;s nothing. I think it&#x27;s very strong. Shu Yusi looked suspicious.</p>
<p>Lynn Sha glanced at Pay Min. Pay Min, what do you think? This sword strike was executed with effortless ease, demonstrating a profound mastery of the sword. Pay Min abandoned his nonchalant attitude and expression and answered seriously. I have never seen such a master swordsman in my life. He will be a formidable opponent.</p>
<p>Pay men with slight surprise. It&#x27;s rare for you to have such a high opinion of someone who uses a sword. Then Lyn Sha added with a sigh, but I think he might use other things, too. What? Lin Shiao simply said, &quot;It&#x27;s nothing. Let&#x27;s continue watching his match.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a pity that many of our heroes can&#x27;t even force him to use his second move.&quot; Seeing that Lyn Xiaos answer was irrelevant, Pay Min looked displeased and whispered, &quot;Oh, riddle tellers are so annoying. I think so, too.&quot; Chu Yusi nodded in agreement. Soon the first round of the knockout stage was over. Since there are still over 60 players present, two more rounds of elimination matches must be played to determine the top 16. However, no one knows for sure how many of the top 16 are from Japan and how many are from China.</p>
<p>On the Dangia kingdom side, the two sword saints are very strong. Gandalf is very strong. The female hero Dugajolon is very strong. And the whiteclad hero is also very strong. But Ishin Ashina is too strong.</p>
<p>The whiteclad hero instantly killed an unknown low-quality hero with a single sword strike. But Asha Ishin was the one who killed Hiatoshi&#x27;s epic quality defensive hero, Garen. The two are not comparable. The difference is clear to everyone. Soon the second round of battle began.</p>
<p>On Lshia&#x27;s side, Hizay, who won, was once again selected to participate in the battle. This time, he wasn&#x27;t so lucky, and he ran straight into Miyamoto Mousashi, becoming a stepping stone for the seated player. The flower fairy captain didn&#x27;t even have time to scream or unleash her self-destruction before she was stabbed to death. &quot;All right, all right, at least we&#x27;ve completed the task and made it to the second round.&quot; He consoled himself. At least I&#x27;m just a skilled hero and I still managed to splatter blood all over that ninja&#x27;s face.</p>
<p>I feel like there&#x27;s something off about your heroes and unit types. Shu Yusi had intended to offer Heiz some words of comfort, but seeing he&#x27;s state, he became somewhat doubtful instead. They&#x27;d really self-destruct just to touch her boss&#x27;s abs. How would they touch them after that? He chuckled awkwardly and said, &quot;Nonsense.&quot; Chu Yuzi still looked at he suspiciously. After a long while, he turned and left, muttering to himself.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re all riddle tellers and that crazy flower fairy. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;ve joined a cult. Maybe I should investigate Lin Shiao and his group another day. Now it was Lyn Xiao&#x27;s turn to take the stage again. Chapter 198.</p>
<p>Sword Saint duel Yasuo versus Ishin Ashina. Look everyone, Lyn Xiao&#x27;s whiteclad hero is on stage. Can the hero in white replicate his feat of instantly defeating the Japanese hero with a single sword strike in the previous round? Is the whiteclad hero stronger or is Ashina Ishin stronger? Both are skilled swordsmen. Will they fight each other? Amidst the discussion and anticipation, a flash of white light appeared and pay men materialized. He slowly drew his long sword, his expression serious, and walked toward the Japanese hero.</p>
<p>Go my hero. The Japanese lord shouted. You can&#x27;t kill my Jimmy Kamehameha Ichiro in an instant. He&#x27;s a master of the Kamehameha technique. Pay didn&#x27;t reply, nor did he instantly defeat the Japanese hero as he had done in the previous match.</p>
<p>He simply held his long sword diagonally in one hand and walked forward step by step. Genmi Kamiya Ichiro holding a shield in one hand and a sword in the other met bay men. Absolute defense. Jenme Kamiya Ichiro instantly became covered in a ring of hard solid stones as armor and he picked up his sword to slash at Bay Min. Pay Min calmly parried the attack with his sword and then thrust out a sword to test the waters.</p>
<p>The two exchanged blows and surprisingly they were evenly matched. The whiteclad hero isn&#x27;t as strong as I imagined. Fortunately, Jimmy Kamiya Ichiro should be able to hold on. Maybe we can still win. The excitement and surprise of the Lord of the East were visible to everyone in the live stream.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s with Lyn Xiao&#x27;s whiteclad hero? Why didn&#x27;t he kill this guy with a single sword strike? That&#x27;s right. The whiteclad hero could instantly kill the opposing hero with a single sword strike in the last match. So why couldn&#x27;t he do it this time? Was the opponent too strong? I&#x27;ve checked this opponent. They&#x27;re just a lowquality epic defensive hero. theoretically a pushover or stepping stone against whiteclad heroes.</p>
<p>What? The whiteclad hero and this hero have been fighting for several minutes and still haven&#x27;t decided the winner. Could it be that the title of hero in white is undeserved? Or is he simply exhausted? Ishina can instantly kill epic Garen, but the whiteclad hero cannot instantly kill epic jimmyi kamiya Ichiro. The difference between the two is now clear. Sigh. It seems hard to say who the number one hero really is.</p>
<p>Skepticism. Lynn Shiao could feel the disappointment surging through the Dragon Sea Kingdoms people, even through the screen. Pay Min did not instantly defeat the Japanese hero. Instead, he used the simplest sword moves and sparred with the enemy hero with a serious expression. Lyn Sha looked closely at Pay Min and saw that he was serious, meticulous, and completely focused, seemingly unaffected by the outside world.</p>
<p>He seemed to be adjusting his physical functions and condition. Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;It seems that Asha Ishan s appearance has indeed made Pay Min feel a sense of urgency.&quot; Having guessed Payman&#x27;s thoughts, felt relieved. He didn&#x27;t urge or give any instructions, but simply watched quietly as Pay Min used Jinmi Kmagayauro as a highle punching bag, practicing his moves and countering his attacks. You still underestimate the heroes in white. In the live stream, some experts noticed Payman&#x27;s condition, Gene Wuang being one of them.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be fooled by his seemingly evenly matched fight with Jinmi Kamiro. The whiteclad hero has always maintained absolute dominance. Gene Wuang said, &quot;He is slowly entering a profound and mysterious realm.&quot; Old devil, you&#x27;ve said so much. So, what realm has he entered? I don&#x27;t practice swordsmanship. I only occasionally sell swords.</p>
<p>How would I know what level he has reached? So, what is your weapon? My weapon is a staff, and I also make and sell staffs. When the sword seller and staff maker saw Gene Wuang introducing himself in such a serious manner, Lin Shia almost spat out his water. This devil also has the potential to be a comedian. On the battlefield, the Japanese lords gradually notice something a miss. Damn it, have I been tricked? It seems Jinmai Kamiya Ichiro can&#x27;t beat this hero in white.</p>
<p>But should I admit defeat? If I surrender before even forcing the white-clad hero to use more sword techniques, Lord Yamamoto might punish me. Why don&#x27;t we hold on a little longer? As the Japanese lord&#x27;s eyes darted around, deep in thought, he saw Pay Min slightly. That&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;ve reviewed the basic sword techniques again, and I should have made further progress. Basic sword techniques? You&#x27;ve been fighting me with basic sword techniques the whole time.</p>
<p>The greatest truths are the simplest. I must review the lessons I&#x27;ve missed in order to reach my peak performance. Pay Min replied calmly. Thank you for your sparring, but you&#x27;re useless now. Jimmy Kamiya Ichiro&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>Was the whiteclad hero about to unleash his ultimate move? Is it that dazzling flowing technique? He roused himself and focused his attention on defense only to see Pay Min still attacking with basic sword techniques move by move. Thankfully, it&#x27;s just a basic sword. Before the Japanese lord could even utter a sound, pay casually thrust his sword through a gap in Jinme Kamiya Ichiro s defenses, piercing his body. Jinmi Kamiya Ichiro is killed in action. The battle is over.</p>
<p>The hero in white has won in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. The viewers in the live stream also noticed Pay Min&#x27;s victory. Defeating an epic level hero at this time should have been a decent achievement, but the words were left unsaid. But everyone understood what followed. This speed is still far from Ishinas.</p>
<p>Lyn Sha and Pay Min teleported back at the same time. Seeing Pay Min&#x27;s high-spirited appearance, Lin Sha nodded affirmatively. Keep up the good work. The battle continued. After several matches where neither side gained an advantage, a series of clashes between weak opponents from Japan and Liao.</p>
<p>Perhaps the words spoken earlier came true for the next two to take the stage were none other than Tu Shawn by Chien X Yasuo the swift sword saint and Ashina Ishin. A duel between two sword saints. The audience in the live stream was immediately intrigued. Everyone, who do you think will win? As expected, most viewers thought Ishin Asha would be the winner. It must be said that Ishina&#x27;s stunning sword strike gave everyone a great deal of shock.</p>
<p>Yasuo, are we going to admit defeat? Suddenly summoned to the battlefield, Tu Shawn by Chien felt a sense of fear. Although I know you are strong, the one on the other side seems to be even stronger. Just admit defeat and I will apologize to the city lord in person. I don&#x27;t want you to leave like this. Tu Shan by Chin could finish speaking.</p>
<p>Yasua interrupted her. Death is like the wind, always by my side. Yasuo slowly drew his long sword. his entire being as sharp and unshathed as a sword. Even if it means death, I will not give up my duel with a master swordsman.</p>
<p>My mind is made up. This is a swordsman&#x27;s honor. Well said. Across from him, Ishin Ashina praised. He bowed solemnly to Yasuo.</p>
<p>I will grant you a glorious death. The two slowly approached each other like two cowboys dueling in the wilderness, facing off, waiting for the moment to draw their guns and deliver a fatal blow to their opponent. The atmosphere grew increasingly tense. Ishin Asha said slowly, &quot;Your lord has become hesitant and you desire a battle. Your hearts are not together which has already caused you to hesitate.</p>
<p>So what if I hesitate? My fate is in my own hands, not in the heavens.&quot; Their eyes met and sparks flew in the air. Take this, the two shouted at the same time. A flash of sword light. Ishin Ashina sheathed his sword. He hesitating.</p>
<p>Hesitation leads to defeat. Chapter 199. The stunning Valkyrie. Yasua lost. Moreover, he was killed by Ishin Ashina with a single sword strike.</p>
<p>Even a powerful swordsman like Yasuo the unforgiven was merely a victim of Ishin Asha&#x27;s sword. This is a top tier swordsman among epic level masters. When the whiteclad hero killed the supreme sword saint, it took him quite a bit of effort. But this asha is the people of Lshia kingdom could no longer sit still. Anxiety spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Tan by Chin teleported back and she seemed very disappointed. Don&#x27;t be sad, beautiful girl. It&#x27;s not that Yasuo isn&#x27;t strong, it&#x27;s just that the opponent is too strong. Eay stepped forward to comfort him. If only Yasuo could be resurrected like your flower fairy.</p>
<p>Tuan by Chian was still in a low voice. She shook her head and looked at Dinglay. It seems that the title of sword saint will have to be reclaimed by your hero. We will definitely go all out. Witnessing Ishin Ashina as strength, Ding Lay was no longer so confident.</p>
<p>Misaro told me that if he were to face Isha Nashina, even if he were to die in battle, he would die with the same dignity as Yasuo. If Misaro can&#x27;t do it either, maybe only Shiaolu and his group have a chance to defeat Ashaishin. The group nodded solemnly, looking at Lin Sha, who was deep in thought, staring at the large screen in the distance. That person was their last hope. The second round of elimination matches ended quickly.</p>
<p>As expected, Lang Shia Kingdom lost more than it won. The third round of elimination matches has begun. A flash of light and Lin Sha and Pay Min were the first to appear. This rekindled the interest of the disappointed Lang Sha group. Lyn Sha is here.</p>
<p>The invincible hero in white has arrived. Can he recreate the miracle of killing the enemy with a single sword strike and boost the morale of the Dragon Xiao people? On the other side, the chosen Japanese lord had an extremely complicated expression. It seems that the god system has determined me to be a stepping stone for the whiteclad heroes. This Japanese hero was sensible, but he did not back down. We Japanese do not retreat without a fight.</p>
<p>Let my hero see just how capable this whiteclad hero really is. Turo, brother, charge. On the other side, a small giant whose muscles looked like they were about to explode charged over. Pay Min with his long sword clasped around his arm calmly approached. The battle proceeded methodically and steadily.</p>
<p>Pay Min and Hu Yulu&#x27;s younger brother fought a fierce battle with neither side gaining a clear advantage. The hero in white is still evenly matched with the Japanese hero. The disappointment on everyone&#x27;s faces was palpable. After a few minutes of fighting, Tiguru&#x27;s younger brother made a careless move. And the white-clad hero seized the opportunity, suddenly stabbing him in the eye with a sword that pierced his brain, ending the battle.</p>
<p>Damn it, we were so close. In the Japanese quarter, Yamamoto Isuroku angrily slammed his fist on the floor. He was so close. Tiguro sand could have taken down that hero in white. If only he hadn&#x27;t run out of energy.</p>
<p>After hurling a few angry curses, Yamamoto Isurokroa suddenly laughed. He turned to look at Toyottomy Jinichiurro who was watching the battle with him and said, &quot;You say the whiteclad hero is a formidable opponent, but in my opinion, he is far inferior to your Asha Ishin. Asha is always wins with a single blow, a crushing victory. But this white-clad hero who is only considered a mid-level hero here will take several minutes to defeat him. Toyottomi Jinichiro smiled reservedly and said, &quot;This is the difference in foundation, sir.</p>
<p>A swordsman can kill anyone who is weak, but when he encounters a strong enough enemy, his true skill will be revealed. Rest assured, my lord, Japan will surely win this duel.&quot; Yoshi Yamamoto Isuroku burst into laughter. The battle continued and Ding Lays swordsman Misaro encountered an epic hero from Japan. After a few minutes of fierce fighting, he successfully killed the enemy. Shendawwan&#x27;s Gandalf also used long-range magic to blast away the Japanese knights on the other side.</p>
<p>Chufinga Olaf was first brutally beaten by the Japanese samurai, then went berserk and despite being seriously injured, killed the enemy hero. And these were just a handful of narrow victories and pirick wins for the dragon sa kingdom. Lia was completely outmatched in the game. At that moment a flash of light appeared and a peerless figure entered the battlefield. Dug Jalon.</p>
<p>Even those who were disheartened by long sa&#x27;s series of defeats were intrigued by the sight of such a stunning beauty. They temporarily put aside their discussion and watched the live stream carefully. In the scene, Dugu Jalon is dressed in a light purple robe with a sword at her waist, looking ethereal and aloof. Her long hair cascaded down. Her beautiful eyes were clear as water.</p>
<p>Her purple dress was as beautiful as a flower, and her long sword was as white as snow. She was indescribably beautiful, elegant, noble, and extraordinary. This is the number one player in the Lone Non newbie zone this year, someone exclaimed. A being capable of overpowering Lynn, Sha must be incredibly strong, right? Her hero, Melia, is just as charismatic. On the battlefield, a tall redhaired woman stood proudly alone, wearing golden armor and a scarlet cloak behind her.</p>
<p>She wore a golden winged helmet, the mask of which covered half of her face, revealing only her fair, flawless lower half, and bright but aloof red lips. Her right hand was a prosthetic arm made of golden armor with a long narrow sword attached to one end. This look made everyone slow their breathing and couldn&#x27;t help but take a few more glances. I didn&#x27;t pay attention in the previous battles, but Marenia looks really cool in her armor this time. By the way, how did Dugu Jaon&#x27;s heroes perform in the previous battles? We won easily, but our opponents were all weaklings.</p>
<p>This is the chance to test this heroine&#x27;s strength because the one taking the stage is Sakura Shichiro Miiamoto Mousashi. Everyone was then surprised to realize that they had been so focused on admiring Dugu Jaolon&#x27;s beauty and her hero&#x27;s charisma that they hadn&#x27;t noticed that Sakura Shichiro, whose face was contorted with rage and his hero Miiamoto Mousashi were their opponents in this battle. Damn it, aren&#x27;t I a seated player? Why were I matched with Dugu Jaon? Am I the stepping stone or is Dugu Jalaon the stepping stone? Sakura Shichiro&#x27;s expression twisted and one thought after another surfaced in his mind. I am a genius from the Shikoku Islands region of Japan and my hero is also a legendary golden hero. I must be a master.</p>
<p>Dugu Jalon on the other side is the number one in the LN region. So her strength must be considerable as well. But according to the logic of the main god system, I should be fighting a complete noob right now like he&#x27;s a then if we think about it the other way around, lonely Garin should just be fighting against one of our outstanding level lords. But the god arranged for me to face off against Dugu Jaon. According to the god system, one of us, Dugu Jaolon, must be a fake expert.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why we were judged to fight each other. So who exactly was sacrificed? who was the stepping stone for the seated players. H baka Sakura Shichiro roared and immediately ordered Miiamoto Mousashi to launch an attack. The legendary ninja instantly turned into a cloud of smoke and vanished from the battlefield. Dugu Xaolon, &quot;Your heroism is nothing but a facade, a stepping stone.&quot; Sakura Shichiro shouted.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s about to be killed by Miyamoto Mousashi. Chapter 200. The legendary five levels 16 emerge. Oh, is that so? Dugu Jaolon responded to Miiamoto Mousashi with a single sentence, then fell silent, calmly watching the battlefield. Damn it, this condescending attitude and arrogant demeanor are just too rude.</p>
<p>Sakura Shichiro was so angry his nose almost twisted. I&#x27;ll make you understand how powerful I am. In the live stream, everyone was puzzled by the arrangement of this match. Isn&#x27;t Miiamoto Mousashi a top seed? His last match was against Heay&#x27;s Flower Fairy. It was obvious that they were just letting him advance to the top 16.</p>
<p>How come he&#x27;s now facing two top fighters, Marlinia and Marinia, at the same time? That&#x27;s right. I remember Miiamoto Mousashi is a legendary hero. There are only five of them in the entire East Japan region. Is the main god system malfunctioning? Yeah, it&#x27;s a battle between legends. Isn&#x27;t that a clash of titans? Gene Wuang then spoke up.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are only two possibilities in the knockout stage. Weak against weak and strong against weak. But the strength or weakness here is relative. For a hero with an S-rank talent skill or a combat power rating of 10,000 stars, an enemy with an A- rank talent of 5,000 stars is a weakling. So you understand now, right? If the god system determines that the difference in strength between the two sides is too great and one side has almost no chance to challenge the other, then they will be placed in the same elimination route.</p>
<p>I see. Everyone nodded. It felt quite good to have a knowledgeable old devil chief lord by their side. No wonder Sakura Shichiro&#x27;s expression was so strange just now. He was also wondering who the weakling was.</p>
<p>As everyone was talking, the battle officially began. With a flash of smoke, Miyamoto Mousashi suddenly appeared silently behind Marlene, wielding a short Japanese sword in one hand and a shuriken in the other, attacking the heroine. The heroine remained standing motionless. &quot;Got it,&quot; Sakura Shiro&#x27;s mind. &quot;Oh!&quot; a cold, mocking voice rang out.</p>
<p>With a nimble turn, Marlinia easily dodged Miyamoto Mousashi&#x27;s sneak attack. I am Marlinia, the Lord&#x27;s Blade. Marlinia&#x27;s lips curled into a slight smile as she said calmly. You can call me Valkyrie. Valkyrie, my foot.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re nothing but a stepping stone for me to get into the top 16. I will definitely kill you. Whoosh! Miamoto Mousashi&#x27;s hands moved swiftly, throwing darts, shuriken, and poison bullets one after another at the heroine. Marlenia was agile and kept dodging. Those dazzling array of hidden weapons and attacks couldn&#x27;t even touch Marlinia&#x27;s fluttering cloak.</p>
<p>Marinia kept looking at the ninja opposite her with a faint mocking gaze. Miiamoto Mousashi&#x27;s movements became faster and faster, but the heroine&#x27;s evasion was as graceful and free as a leaf falling in a strong wind. Everyone stared intently at the battle scene. Is it a clash of titans or an elimination tournament where the strong are weak? Between these two legendary heroes, who is stronger and who is weaker? Suddenly, Marinia paused, then made a lightning fast lunge to the side. First with a shoulder strike, then with a backhand slash using her prosthetic right hand.</p>
<p>The collision struck Miiamoto Mousashi, who had suddenly teleported to that location. The ninja didn&#x27;t even have time to react before his bones were broken. Before the sound of bones breaking could even be heard, Marlinia&#x27;s swift blade had already struck down. A long, narrow blade, even taller than Marlene, sliced through Miyamoto Mousashi&#x27;s body. The ninja stared in disbelief at the bottomless wound on his chest.</p>
<p>His eyes rolled back and he collapsed with a thud. Have you fully realized how big the gap is between you and me? Marinia casually flicked her long sword and turned to leave. Miiamoto Mousashi fallen in battle. Dugu, Jaolon, and Marlinia, who were calm and collected, were teleported back. The people in the live stream remained silent for a full 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Holy crap, that&#x27;s awesome. Her name is Melia. Her name is Valkyrie. Even a legendary gold quality Miiamoto Mousashi is but a single strike against a Valkyrie. Valkyrie, what a wonderful nickname.</p>
<p>strong, beautiful and strong, agile and powerful. I hereby declare that Male Nia is my favorite hero in this duel. What good is it if you like her? The Valkyrie is someone else&#x27;s hero, Dugu Jaolon. What does it have to do with you? I don&#x27;t care. The Valkyrie is the most beautiful.</p>
<p>The Valkyrie is the strongest. We have hope in this duel. Ishina&#x27;s rival is Melia. Is the difference between the golden legendary versions really that big? In the rest area, the lords of Lshia also had their eyes shining. In the previous battle, because the opponent was too weak, Melia didn&#x27;t even have a chance to show her skills and simply killed the enemy with a few slashes.</p>
<p>In this battle, facing the powerful legendary hero of Japan, Marlinia still managed to kill Miyamoto Mousashi with a single strike, thus revealing her formidable strength. Actually, the golden legendary rank is also divided into grades, but you started the heroic arena not long after you arrived, so you may not know about it. This classification is the commonly accepted term in the official area, but no one has ever heard the main god system mention it. Lin Dao, who joined a year earlier, explained, &quot;The quality of the golden legendary also has five levels: low, medium, advanced, high, and perfect. The differences between these five levels are quite significant.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s somewhat like it&#x27;s a bit like the difference between the top student in the best class of the school and an ordinary student, even though they both got into the best key high school. Lyn Sha walked over and answered, &quot;Yes, yes.&quot; Lyn Sha described it very vividly. This is the chasm-like gap between the five social classes. It would be more vivid to use the difference between an ordinary student from Peaking University and Wei Shun as an example. Lyn Sha thought to himself, &quot;It is said that the perfect grade golden legendary quality is no less powerful than the mythical quality whose existence is uncertain.&quot; Lynn Douching continued to explain.</p>
<p>Therefore, if it&#x27;s a matter of crossing several social classes, it&#x27;s not surprising that Marlinia could crush Miiamoto Mousashi. Baka in the Eastern Japan district, the scene was completely different. Yamamoto Isuroku had returned to his rage. Sakura Shikaru, didn&#x27;t you say that your Miiamoto Mousashi, according to the tier classification, is also considered a mid-tier gold legend? How come he couldn&#x27;t even withstand a single strike from that so-called Valkyrie on the other side? A golden legend has become someone else&#x27;s stepping stone. Could it be that the Valkyrie is a top tier perfect golden legend? Sakura Shichiro knelt on the ground, his eyes bloodshot and his fists clenched, but he could only remain silent in the face of Yamamoto s repeated questioning.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Yamamoto Isuroku was furious. Useless trash. Get out of here. Bring in Toyotomy Jennyro. The competition continued and soon the three rounds of elimination matches ended and the top 16 were determined.</p>
<p>Lia&#x27;s side. Only the following pairs made it into the top 16. Lin Shiao and Pay Min, Dugu Xiaolan and Marlinia, Chufinga and Olaf, Lin Daoing and Gandalf, and Ding Lelay and Yuzurro. The martial arts arena is a duel between two opposing factions. This means that the five of them need to defeat an average of two enemies to compete for the final victory.</p>
