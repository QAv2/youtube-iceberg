            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>On July 20th, 1993, the deputy White House counsel to Bill Clinton left his assistant Linda Trip shortly after lunchtime and drove to a well-known Washington DC park. He stepped out of his car. He walked approximately 200 ft to a burm. And the next few seconds of this story would be the subject of five investigations, grand jury proceedings, two special counsel and an inquiry that would result in the impeachment of an American president. On this show, we are going to explore why he died and what his death protected.</p>
<p>And answering that question requires that we explore one of the NSA&#x27;s most powerful programs, Prism. Jeffrey Epstein, Bob Maxwell, international moneyaundering, and of course, Bill and Hillary Clinton. Stick with me for this episode and subsequent episodes for a rigorous investigation, no stone unturned, into the death of Vince Foster, Clinton espionage, international money laundering, and of course, his Jeffrey Epstein connections. &gt;&gt; Left his office 5 hours earlier, saying he would return. Police called it a suicide.</p>
<p>Good afternoon. I have just met with the White House staff. Um to basically talk with them a little bit about the death of my friend of 42 years, Vince Foster. It is an immense personal loss to to me and to Hillary and to many of his close friends here and a great loss to the White House and to the country. As I tried to explain, especially to the young people on the staff, that there is really no way to know why these things happen.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Vince Foster did not arrive in Washington as a cipher. He was the calm center of an Arkansas storm. He was a Rose Law Firm partner, the confidant to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, the longtime friend of Bill Clinton. He was a meticulous counselor, and he was always rock steady with advice. He was brilliant.</p>
<p>He was progressive and by every account he was uncomfortable with the blood sport that occurred in Washington politics. At least that&#x27;s the official story. The official story is that Vince Foster died by his own hand because he was about to testify to Congress. But travel gate. &gt;&gt; The number two person on the Clinton White House legal team.</p>
<p>Foster was involved in the president&#x27;s sometimes rocky judicial appointment process. He also played a role in the decisions that led to the firings at the White House travel office, though an internal White House review of that matter did not criticize him. &gt;&gt; It was Foster who interviewed Judge Steven Brier for the Supreme Court and escorted Brier to meet the president. He was the point man on other unsuccessful candidates for high office, Zoe Bear, Kimble Wood, Lonnie Guineer. He had been criticized in Wall Street Journal editorials.</p>
<p>As deputy to White House counsel Bernard Nusbomb, Foster had been involved in much of the early White House troubles. His office intensely criticized for its role in several events embarrassing to Mr. Clinton. Travelgate, the standoff in Waco, Texas, Zoe Baird, and other bungled nominations. &gt;&gt; The White House travel office is responsible for managing the travel of the White House press corps and the president.</p>
<p>That travel office is an important position for the president, especially when he has friends to pay back as a result of campaign contributions and the election. During the scandal that was called Travelgate, seven people were fired from the White House travel office, something that alarmed the press very early on in the Clinton administration because government employees tend to stick around for a long time. When the press asked why, Bill and Hillary Clinton sent out talking points. There were some rumors that they had engaged in embezzlement. &gt;&gt; The council&#x27;s office where Foster worked has drawn frequent fire for everything from the botched search for an attorney general to its handling of the White House travel office affair.</p>
<p>Foster was never blamed. A few friends said the criticism and an editorial blasting Mrs. Clinton&#x27;s former law firm did distress him deeply. &gt;&gt; The FBI was called in. They conducted an investigation and the blowback started to land on Bill and Hillary pretty quickly.</p>
<p>When seven longtime travel office employees were fired for mismanagement and the travel office director, Billy Dale was indicted, people became very suspicious. In fact, the jury acquitted Billy Dale at his later trial in less than two hours. Unheard of for such high-profile allegations. In reality, Hillary and Bill wanted to replace the staff with their own company, Worldwide Travel. This company was important to Bill and Hill because it was the same company that gave them the fly now pay later benefits during the Bill Clinton campaign.</p>
<p>Obviously, as you know, during a campaign, you have to spend a lot of money traveling from place to place. And this company really hooked Bill up and he wanted to hook them up. Hillary directed Vince Foster to have the FBI investigate, and they did. But when the press learned what Bill and Hillary were up to, the blowback was brutal, and they were looking for someone to blame. That someone was Vince Foster and the former FBI director.</p>
<p>A later investigation would determine that Hillary Clinton herself lied to investigators during the Travelgate investigation, but no charges were ever brought against Hillary. Bill Clinton later impeached for lying to the American public. No charges brought against Bill Clinton. Two weeks before his death, Vince Foster met twice with White House allies and he authored notes that you can see here. He was bracing for hearings.</p>
<p>He was preparing for them. He wasn&#x27;t trying to escape. He confided in White House staff. He was concerned about the travel office issue going public. And he sought recommendations from outside counsel.</p>
<p>He even went to his own lawyer. His own lawyer later refused to discuss that privilege conversation, taking it all the way up to the court of appeals. But was it really travelgate that Foster was worried about? He&#x27;d been no stranger to dealing with tough issues. He worked his way all the way through Arkansas politics and got himself into a cushy job in the White House. No, that wasn&#x27;t it.</p>
<p>He&#x27;d faced contentious battles before. Some wondered if he was about to testify about rumors that he&#x27;d had an affair with Hillary Clinton. Other rumors and sources claimed that he had much more of a sinister secret to hide. And that secret you&#x27;re going to hear about throughout the course of this episode. But let&#x27;s first talk about Bill Clinton and how he got here.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton went from a small town Arkansas boy eventually becoming a draft dodger and ultimately the attorney general of Arkansas. All while his brother Roger was filling his nose along with convicted trafficker Dan Lacader. Think I&#x27;m kidding. Take a look. &gt;&gt; Why? That&#x27;s a little correct.</p>
<p>You got any coat? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he&#x27;s got plenty of &gt;&gt; What did he say? &gt;&gt; Bill Clinton&#x27;s candidacy for governor turned viable after some time in the attorney general&#x27;s office and the donor map started to shift. Pam Haramman, a Democratic kingmaker, engineered introductions with some of Wall Street&#x27;s biggest banks. They lined up with checks. There was also a less savory money circle as well. And one former US attorney described it as this wasn&#x27;t just the Dixie Mafia lining up.</p>
<p>This was coastal money clocking the same opportunity as the banks. When Bill Clinton was elected, he filled the White House with his donors and political allies, including three Rose Law Firm partners, Vince Foster, Webster Hubble, and of course, his wife, Hillary Clinton. As the stain of Travelgate was descending on the office, hearings were inevitable. Foster told his friends that the coming oversight would be brutal, and he asked for the names of lawyers who could help him face it. He was steadying himself for the fight, not to run.</p>
<p>On February 19th, the Chicago Sun Times reported that Hillary and Bill got into a fierce argument. Hillary apparently had smashed a lamp in the family living area. The story spread like wildfire and it was embellished with the claim that Hillary had actually thrown the lamp at Bill in a raging argument. Hillary assumed the story came from White House security and she was really upset that they never denied it. The story was eventually published in Newsweek, giving Hillary quite a terrible reputation.</p>
<p>On the day of the death, July 20th, the British reporter relayed a source who said that the first lady&#x27;s travel changed on short notice. Originally, she was scheduled to come back on a trip from California, flying into Washington, DC to return home that night. Instead, she diverted midair to Little Rock, Arkansas. But when the press asked her for logs to find out if that trip was made and why that trip was made, the paper trail evaporated. The White House never produced travel documents.</p>
<p>What was Hillary doing in Little Rock when her former law partner and potentially former lover, her husband&#x27;s best friend, was laying dead in a park in Washington DC? Why did she have a fight with Bill Clinton that involved throwing a lamp? Why were they so agitated? what was going on. That night after Vince Foster&#x27;s death, Secret Service officer Harry O&#x27;Neal said he saw Maggie Williams, Hillary Clinton&#x27;s chief of staff, moved files from the council suite. Days later, two Rose Law Firm couriers testified that they shredded a box of documents marked VWF, Vince Foster, and the famous torn note surfaced a week later after the official search of Fosters&#x27;s office. That torn note was found in a briefcase, but a lawyer had already testified that he looked into the briefcase and didn&#x27;t find anything like a note. The chain of custody of that note is quite suspicious and something that special counsel looked at very deeply.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bill Clinton, instead of appointing the FBI to investigate such a suspicious death, decided to appoint the Park Police to take point in this investigation. Mind you, one of the most high-profile deaths to hit the White House since John F. Kennedy. And this matter was not to be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who lost its director a day before the death, but instead the Park Police. Well, I&#x27;m sure the proud men and women of the Park Police Office did everything they could, but they certainly are not the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>Senator Faircloth called it out in plain terms. What the law says that a killing or assault on a high government official shall be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Why were the Park Police in charge of the investigation? Why were the Park Police investigating? Why was the FBI not running point? Why wasn&#x27;t this treated like a suspicious death of this kind as a presumed homicide until it was ruled out? The timing wasn&#x27;t subtle. The day before Foster died, as I said, President Clinton fired FBI Director William Sessions. The Park Police, of course, bungled the investigation and Rob Fisk was appointed as special counsel to pick up the torch and carry it further.</p>
<p>Of course, he had obvious connections to Bill Clinton, and nobody expected a diligent investigation here. He bungled it, too. authoring authoring a highly controversial report. Critics of the Fisk report noted that he failed to find the bullet. He failed to account for the last hours of Foster.</p>
<p>He couldn&#x27;t find anyone who saw Foster leave the White House. And he failed to properly investigate and seal off Vince Foster&#x27;s office, causing documents to be removed. Documents that were very important to the investigation. After Fisk bundled After Fisk bungled the report, Ken Starr was assigned as a special prosecutor for the Whitewater investigation. That necessarily required inquiry into Vince Foster&#x27;s death.</p>
<p>Current Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaaugh was Star&#x27;s deputy and he wrote most of the final report. But in 1995, when this investigation began, a special agent tasked with cataloging investigative errors that existed already, sent a memo to Kavanaaugh outlining very deep problems with the prior investigation. Problems that could not be overcome. For instance, there was no gunshot residue samples of the deedants hands, very rare in a death investigation. There were no full scene measurements showing the distance or location of Vince Foster&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>There was no log of who took which photographs, and the photographs weren&#x27;t very detailed, and there weren&#x27;t very many photographs. There was no documentation of an initial vehicle search at the death site. The deedant&#x27;s pager, Vince Foster&#x27;s pager, was returned to the family too early, and nobody took note of the pages that he&#x27;d received just prior. There was no photo of the left hand, the hand that apparently had a gun in it, and inconsistent statements existed about whether the body was moved and what paramedics did. And of course, we&#x27;ve got that briefcase and that note that was found 6 days later after what apparently was an insufficient search of Vince Foster&#x27;s briefcase.</p>
<p>An inconclusive investigation turned relatively conclusive because of a mysterious note found in a location that Hillary Clinton had access to and that Linda Trip had testified people had accessed. But there&#x27;s more. A witness who arrived on the scene testified that he saw Vince Foster&#x27;s hands palms up with no gun. This was later documented in Brett Kavanaaugh&#x27;s notes. There was an official photo later that showed a gun hooked on Vince Foster&#x27;s hand that was hooked on his thumb.</p>
<p>On the House floor in 1994, a member read the witness&#x27;s sworn account into the congressional record, palms up, no gun, and detailed how that witness said that agents pressed him 20 plus times to reconsider his testimony. If the gun is in the hand in the photo, but not in the hand in the scene, something moved. And bodies don&#x27;t move when they&#x27;re in that sort of condition. Retired New York homicide professionals smelled something fishy and they said out loud what many thought quietly. Vincent J.</p>
<p>Scaliz and his forensic photographer both agreed after reviewing the public record. They concluded that this death scene didn&#x27;t add up to a suicide. Instead, they said that the placement looked convenient of the weapon and the body. the tissue and blood patterns were inconsistent with this type of death and that the key photographs that were taken in the case were inadequate. &gt;&gt; The only things we know for sure about Vince Foster&#x27;s death is that he was dead and he was shot in the head and his body was found in this part.</p>
<p>The photographs that were released with his right hand clasping the pistol and his thumb through the trigger guard looks staged. You can call them wrong. You can call them unserious. You could call into question their investigation, but they were asking many of the questions that the press and the American public at the time asked. And unfortunately, Kenar and Brett Kavanagh&#x27;s report didn&#x27;t address much of it.</p>
<p>across the Atlantic. This was getting the attention of London and a Sunday Telegraph reporter who was saying the things that the American press really couldn&#x27;t. Ran a story that said aid was murdered. That was the headline on the Sunday Telegraph. And another story, Swiss link to White House death.</p>
<p>Despite those two credible stories from a large London newspaper, there was no effort by the Star investigation to look into that. Even years later, the Telegraph revisited a key civilian witness, Patrick Nolton, whose statement about a different car at the park and subsequent alleged intimidation made it by court order into the official appendix to the independent council&#x27;s report. Washington dismissed those dispatches then, and of course, because of that, we never got any answers into this witness&#x27;s intimidation by federal agents. Foster&#x27;s papers were missing from his office. The Office of Independent Council&#x27;s own narrative confirms that a torn note appeared in a briefcase that had already been searched and the note wasn&#x27;t turned over to police until the day after the West Wing found it a whole day.</p>
<p>Linda Trip, who was posted outside of council&#x27;s office, recalled a search inside Vince Foster&#x27;s office the day after he died. She recalled hearing people shuffling around the office, and that raised alarm bells in her mind. alarm bells that caused her to have a conversation with independent counsel. And we&#x27;ve got a body neatly laid out on the scene, a gun in a hand with no one hearing a gunshot. We&#x27;ve got Vince Foster&#x27;s glasses landing 13 ft down slope.</p>
<p>No matching ammunition found in the deedants residence. And of course, no bullet was ever recovered despite the fact that Civil War bullets were found all over that Civil War battlefield. One park witness, Nolton, said he drove in and saw a different but after he made that testimony since it didn&#x27;t match up with the official record, he was followed and intimidated. &gt;&gt; Well, for the listening audience, we are talking about the Vince Foster case and I was a Whitewater grand jury witness, Howard, as you know. Um, I drove into Fort Marsh Park uh on July 20th, 1993.</p>
<p>Um, what I saw in the park was two cars. I later that evening after finding out Mr. Foster was dead. I called the uh the park police and I told the park police I&#x27;d seen these two cars in the parking lot. One car was an old rust brown car with Arkansas license plates and the other car was a a light blue metallic blue car with a with a gentleman, a man in in the car.</p>
<p>Um that was the end of that. I never heard from the park police again. I never followed the Foster case. I had no idea that, you know, I heard a guy who committed suicide and I figured that was it. What I saw in the park, this guy acting very suspicious in the blue car.</p>
<p>um which you know made me aware of my surroundings. Um after um like I say after I called the park police that was it. It wasn&#x27;t until nine months later and John may have to intervene here because I get the dates mixed up sometimes but um nine months later I was contacted by the FBI. FBI took over the uh investigation with with the uh Fisk uh investigation and &gt;&gt; Fisk was Ken Star&#x27;s predecessor as independent counsel. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s correct.</p>
<p>I was called by them. I was brought into their office. I was interviewed I was interviewed by uh Larry Monroe and and William Colbell, two FBI agents who assigned to &gt;&gt; Fisk. As I recall your story, your account uh to put it bluntly, you drove into the park to heed the call of nature. &gt;&gt; That That&#x27;s true.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s true. &gt;&gt; And um you saw a very ominous, threatening kind of fellow there. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s &gt;&gt; who was looking at you uh in a threatening way. Yeah, he he that&#x27;s what I say. My awareness was uh was brought to its height.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; A federal court took his allegations serious enough to ensure that his comments were attached to the official report. To make matters worse, the timing of the White House notification of Vince Foster&#x27;s death was incredibly suspicious. Bill Clinton was live on Larry King that evening, and Hillary Clinton was, of course, in the air. Vince Foster purportedly died at around 6:00 p.m. But an Arkansas state trooper, Roger Perry, signed an affidavit stating that he learned of Vince Foster&#x27;s death around 5:15 p.m.</p>
<p>Arkansas time. That&#x27;s 6:15 p.m. Washington time, 15 minutes after Vince Foster&#x27;s death. He claims that a White House aid called the Arkansas governor to tell him what happened, but rescue workers didn&#x27;t find the body until 6:00 p.m. and the White House states that it didn&#x27;t learn of the death until 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>That was a headscratcher for the press and investigators and never fully detailed and the official report. But of course to Hillary, what difference does it make? It&#x27;s possible to learn about a death before it happens. Of course, only if you caused it. Ambrose Evans Pritchard, the Telegraph reporter who was covering this case and wrote detailed reports well sourced about the issues with the investigation, mapped a time riddle and wrote an article that described the very suspicious timing that the White House claims that it learned of Vince Foster&#x27;s death. That riddle overlaps with something else.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the FBI&#x27;s own frustration in real time with the access and claims of privilege and their ability to conduct an investigation in to the White House and Vince Foster&#x27;s death. Now, of course, those are all the suspicious facts that deal with Vince Foster&#x27;s death, but it gets worse. Promise is a case tracking software system. It was developed by a company that contracted with the DOJ called Inslaw. When Insaw stopped receiving Department of Justice payments for the software that it was developing for them to track criminal cases, the company&#x27;s owner, of course, sued.</p>
<p>Suing the federal government is a very hard thing to do. And he was ultimately successful after he hired a former attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to handle the case. Richardson&#x27;s investigation and litigation earned him a court ruling that the government stole promise software and used it. Now, where does Vince Foster fit into this? Well, Promise Software wasn&#x27;t just a case tracking software. That&#x27;s originally what the DOJ was going to use it for.</p>
<p>But it also had the capability of tracking global wire transfers and helping banks track global wire transfers. And in the hands of the NSA, this could be a very powerful tool, especially if you put a little backdoor code into it. This powerful tool could be used to spy on the worldwide movement of money and maybe even engage in a little moneyaundering yourself if you&#x27;re able to disguise certain payments. Now, during the Reagan administration, there was a big battle with Congress that prevented Reagan from using public funds for covert operations, the Iran Contra scandal, and other issues that made Congress very weary of giving over any funds for covert purposes. Of course, these funds are freely given by Congress.</p>
<p>Now, the executive branch, though, decided to find its own way of funding these operations. It needed funding to continue these secret operations to engage in this global campaign that Reagan and start had started and was to be continued. Its source of funding will be a big part of our next episode. We&#x27;re going to go into it a little bit here. Mina, Arkansas gets the center of attention for this next part.</p>
<p>Cocaine trafficking ran through a small airport by a gentleman named Barry Seal, later played by Tom Cruz. You think this story is outlandish and fantastical, but you can look at the DEA record that I&#x27;ll post on my Substack and review all of the case history and see very clearly that a largecale cocaine trafficking operation was going down in Mina, Arkansas. Of course, that happened at the time that Bill Clinton was the attorney general, the person responsible for enforcing the laws in Arkansas. Now, why would such an operation occur right under the nose of Bill and Roger Clinton? Well, we don&#x27;t know exactly who had Bill do this, but we know that he had high friends in high places, including Dan Lacader and Don Tyson of Tyson Foods. These people were later involved in very similar allegations.</p>
<p>There were investigations against Don Tyson for the same sort of conduct and Dan Lasser was actually convicted for doing the same sort of thing and even providing that sort of thing to underage people. Now that sort of operation is very important because the money that was used and generated from that operation needed to be ultimately given over to people to buy weapons and provide them to the Contras. You may think this story is strange, but it&#x27;s widely reported that the US sent money down to rebels so that they could train and fight and engage in the weaponization of American policy. This was done to avoid Congress learning about it. And it&#x27;s very well-known fact.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Were there Contras who relied on the profits of narcotics in order to buy arms and to survive? Yes. &gt;&gt; Feel free to look up the Iran Contra scandal or read further on my Substack if you want some more details about that. But here&#x27;s where Vince Foster comes into play. If you&#x27;re going to create a software system that is going to track monetary systems across the globe and be sold to over 40 major companies, get them to upload it, you need a third party seller. And that&#x27;s where Systematics comes into play.</p>
<p>Systematics was a small Arkansas software company that sold financial processing software to many banks in many countries. And they already had a pretty decent client list. Systematics was represented by a prominent Arkansas law firm. You guessed it, the Rose Law Firm partners Vince Foster and Hillary Clinton. Elliot Richardson wrote this letter and informed Ken Starr of Systematic&#x27;s role and the Rose Law Firm&#x27;s role in defending the software company that was now netting a surprising $700 million a year.</p>
<p>Richardson, who was a former attorney general, Harvard grad, and World War II veteran, is about as credible of a source that you can get. So when he decides to write a letter, you should probably pay attention if you&#x27;re Kenstar. Kenstar didn&#x27;t. Richardson&#x27;s letter outlined how secret companies were set up by Ronald Reagan to fund the Contras. That&#x27;s now known as the Iron Contra scandal.</p>
<p>The former research director of one company discussed how the proceeds of these activities came from drug sales in Arkansas. We&#x27;re going to discuss more on that in the next episode. But one entity that aided in the concealing of these activities was the Rose Law Firm. According to the letter, Webster Hubble, who was the associate attorney general tasked by Bill Clinton looking into the inslaw matter. Remember that&#x27;s the software company that had its software stolen.</p>
<p>He was a former Rose Law Firm partner himself. That&#x27;s a substantial conflict of interest. In the final week of Vince Foster&#x27;s life, Insaw sent Hubble a memo that discussed several witnesses who would testify and corroborate the stealing of Insaw software and its use by intelligence agencies, including the NSA. While the CIA claimed it never bought promised software, records later uncovered revealed that it was offered the software in 1981, disproving their false statements. So, what happened? According to Richardson, his letter and the inslaw owners who wrote their own letters, systematics and the Rose Law Firm sold the stolen promise software globally to enemies and allies alike.</p>
<p>Richardson alleged that a back door was installed into the software for the purpose of engaging in offthebooks transfers. The software was implanted in the world bank, the international monetary fund according to articles published by international banking regulator. It was also installed in the large bank BCCI and clearing houses such as Fedwire chips swift and sprint. These clearing houses and banks, when you add them up, would ultimately be used to be able to track nearly every electronic transaction made by any individual on the planet. Hubble, the prosecutor tasked with investigating the allegations of the stolen software, had performed prior legal services on behalf of systematics.</p>
<p>The whole operation of installing the systematic software was, according to Richardson, bankrolled by Arkansas billionaire Jackson Stevens. Stevens was friends and served in the Navy with former President Jimmy Carter, and he backed Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 presidential run with substantial donations. Bill Hamilton, the owner of Insaw&#x27;s letter, also describes an Israeli MSAD role in the affair. An identical company with a software called Promise, an identical name, was set up in Israel and led by two MSAD agents. You can find Hamilton and Elliot&#x27;s letter located in my Substack if you want to read it for yourself.</p>
<p>The 61page packet that they sent to Kenstar on February 7th, 1995 received absolutely no attention in the final report of investigation. But Elliot and Hamilton were not alone in their belief about Promise, Vince Foster, and money laundering. For instance, other witnesses described Vince Foster laundering money in Arkansas and receiving stacks of cash related to the airport operations in Mina. But it gets worse. Journalist James R.</p>
<p>Norman tried to publish a fully vetted story outlining the systematic&#x27;s role. The story included evidence that Vince Foster&#x27;s slush fund was drained and he was under investigation for his role in the Inslaw affair. According to veteran reporter James Norman, Foster felt the heat when he inquired about his Swiss bank account and found that it was drained. This is a surefire sign that it has been seized by authorities. Norman reported that the account held approximately $2.73 million.</p>
<p>According to Norman, this account was drained because the CIA realized that Foster was working for the Israelis and a report confirmed the existence of an Israeli version of Insaw selling the promised software. Perhaps the additional sale of the promised software beyond certain people the Americans wanted to sell it to was not sanctioned by the CIA or the NSA. The story written by Norman passed legal review, editorial review, liable review. His sources were vetted and they were properly sourced. Forbes magazine was ready to publish the article until people high up in Forbes spiked it, killed the article, and prevented it from going to press.</p>
<p>However, not before it was first sent to Congressman James Leachch. He called the article the most cogently argued of the genre that he&#x27;d seen. The story was also confirmed by an undercover customs investigator, Bob Bickl, who provided similar evidence and testimony. The Norman story alleged that Foster was the behindthe-scenes overseer on behalf of the NSA in exchange for a fee. If he was also working for the Israelis, this would make him essentially a double agent.</p>
<p>This story was leaked to House Banking Chair Jim Leech. And in a half-hearted inquiry, the CIA was asked to verify or lay to rest allegations tying Foster to intelligence matters. All the while, a secret binder filled with documents that would never be disclosed was located in a house vault. The scoop about Israeli contracts and Vince Foster&#x27;s connection would never be laid to rest. It would essentially be ignored and the CIA would deny any involvement with the promised software.</p>
<p>A denial that we later found out through the disclosure of certain records was absolutely false. Later CIA records show that in 1981 the CIA was offered the promised software before it was ever completed. That was something that Hamilton, the owner of Inslaw and the creator of the promised software, was never advised of and never consented to. Now, we could ask Bob Maxwell, the father of Galain Maxwell and the seller of Promise Software globally about what happened here, but he can&#x27;t answer us. On November 5th, 1991, he tumbled off his yacht and died.</p>
<p>Like Vince Foster, his death was very suspicious. Bob Maxwell was widely known to have distributed the stolen promise software on behalf of Israel. The day before Vince Foster died, the FBI lost its director. The night he died, the council&#x27;s suite became a civ, and a week later, a note emerged from a briefcase that basically cleared Hillary Clinton. Investigators logged discrepancies they couldn&#x27;t reconcile and witnesses they couldn&#x27;t keep from leaning on.</p>
<p>The press, with notable British exceptions, mostly blinked and didn&#x27;t provide much investigative effort at all. And the software fight that no one wanted to talk about kept appearing in the footnotes of these reports, but the allegations were never resolved. Now, my name&#x27;s Ron Chapman. I try high-profile cases for a living. I&#x27;ve seen honest mistakes, but I&#x27;ve seen orchestrated ones, too.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s what I know.

But the investigations didn&#x27;t answer our questions and the powerful people pulling the strings escaped justice.</p>
<p>Next time on the next episode of Offair, we&#x27;ll open the Promise File. We&#x27;ll talk more about systematics. We&#x27;re going to talk about Bob Maxwell, Gelain&#x27;s connection, and Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s connection. We&#x27;ll talk about Israeli connections. And we&#x27;ll talk about international money laundering.</p>
<p>Stay curious. I&#x27;m Ron Chapman. This is Offair. &gt;&gt; As regards Maxwell&#x27;s death, there are three plausible scenarios. He was either bumped off or he committed suicide or it was simply an accident.</p>
