            <p>No one has the right to keep fundamental truths away from the American people and humanity. &gt;&gt; Welcome to Watch Mojo and today we&#x27;re counting down our picks for the top 10 most shocking revelations from the Age of Disclosure documentary. &gt;&gt; If you could be in my shoes and see what I&#x27;ve seen and folks like Jay Stratton, [music] there would be zero shadow of a doubt that these things are real and they are not made by humans. Number 10, massive UAP and nukes. The UAP connection to nukes is something we&#x27;ve discussed in other videos, but the thing that makes the firstirhand accounts in this documentary shocking is the size of the UAP that were seen over nuclear installations.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is an emerging and disruptive threat for the United States and truly a national security concern. &gt;&gt; One such object was allegedly witnessed by Mario Woods, a retired US Air Force security forces official. Woods describes a UAP seen hovering above the blast door of an intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM at Ellsworth Air Force Base. &gt;&gt; It was the size of a Super Walmart building. Not just a Walmart, I mean a Super Walmart.</p>
<p>This thing was gargantuan. &gt;&gt; He describes this object as looking like a miniature sun the size of a Super Walmart. Retired US Air Force Security Forces Official Chaz King recounts a UAP event at Vandenberg Air Force Base involving a rectangular matte black object with no windows that was quote the size of a football field. It was just floating there. No propulsion system, no windows.</p>
<p>It was matte black. We observed it for another 45 seconds and then it shot off thousands of miles an hour up the coast. Number nine, stigma and smear campaigns. The documentary reveals how those within the government who have witnessed [music] a UAP on the job might be scared to speak up about their experiences for multiple reasons. We were met with fierce resistance.</p>
<p>The stigma alone and the taboo of the topic, the historical association of UFOs, was something that for most people in leadership positions was was too big of a pill to swallow. Much of it is due to the stigma from decadesl long disinformation campaigns. Beyond firstirhand witnesses, whistleblowers from UAP programs recount real life consequences for attempting disclosure, even within the limits of their NDAs and security clearances. &gt;&gt; He came storming across to me. He said, &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever say that again.</p>
<p>You are never to speak of this.&quot; &gt;&gt; And it made it very clear that it&#x27;s something we shouldn&#x27;t be talking about and just keep our mouth shut. Those who have come forward often become the subject of active smear campaigns. According to Lou Alzando, who left his position at the Pentagon in order to bring the truth to the public, he shares his alleged experiences related to the smear campaign run against him in the documentary. As we continue to make progress, a very powerful disinformation campaign began. This effort was to destroy my reputation and credibility.</p>
<p>Number eight, four score of disinformation and cover up. The US government officials interviewed in the documentary suggest decades of deliberate disinformation aimed at obscuring the truth surrounding UAPs and the stigma that&#x27;s been maintained because of this effort. There&#x27;s 80 years of this data that the public isn&#x27;t even aware of. Unfortunately, this has the possibility of destroying the career reputations and personal lives of those who may desire to bring what they know to the public. Misleading stories, fabricated leaks, and ridicule were used against many who did, including Luis Alzando.</p>
<p>As hard as it was, I was still being privately encouraged by former members of ATIP to continue the fight. And so, that gave me the motivation to continue to press forward. and the fire that we started continued to spread &gt;&gt; by revealing the systematic efforts to confuse and mislead. [music] The film suggests that the public&#x27;s understanding has been shaped by decades of intentional manipulation, including the US government funding certain Hollywood movies to fit the narrative. &gt;&gt; CIA funded Hollywood movies in order to create that ridicule factor that they still use to this day.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Number seven, Satanic Panic and the Devil&#x27;s Work. The documentary shines a light on how cultural and professional pressures have suppressed UAP investigations over the decades. &gt;&gt; We couldn&#x27;t get the leadership in the Pentagon to look at the actual scientific data that showed that there is a strong national security threat. &gt;&gt; They were more worried about the impact on their reputation than they were about the safety of the nation. Alzando recalls being warned that studying these phenomena was quote doing the devil&#x27;s work, reflecting moral and ideological resistance from those within the halls of the Pentagon.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, insiders describe how even mentioning UAPs could damage careers and credibility. &gt;&gt; There really were religious fundamentalist extremists [music] within the Pentagon that had a severe adversity to this topic. According to the documentary, highranking officials proclaimed to those in charge of the programs that quote, &quot;In their world, these are demons.&quot; And the program was quote, &quot;ping demons and messing in Satan&#x27;s world.&quot; This religious stigma and professional risk created a chilling effect, discouraging inquiry and further study at every turn. I&#x27;m briefing about an advanced aerospace vehicle [music] that has been detected on multiple sensors that&#x27;s absolutely there and you&#x27;re telling me that you think these are demons and that we shouldn&#x27;t even look at them and study them. Number six, advanced worldwide impunity and directed energy weapons.</p>
<p>Firsthand accounts described within the documentary detail the US government&#x27;s inability [music] to intercept these UAP because they outmaneuver our own most advanced aerial vehicles. We learned that UAPs present serious national security concerns and a potential existential threat. &gt;&gt; One official interviewed in the film somberly stated it this way regarding a similar UAP event. Quote, [music] &quot;We were unable to maintain air sovereignty over North America.&quot; End quote. Allegedly, this has been happening worldwide since the 1940s, if not earlier, and continues to this day.</p>
<p>To be clear, nonhuman intelligence has been actively conducting ISR, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [music] of some of our most sensitive US military facilities and nuclear sites. A pilot that was interviewed said it was now being witnessed almost daily. In the film, a scientific adviser to the UAP task force claims that credible US government intelligence [music] details a UAP crash in 1989 recovered by the Soviets in which they quote discovered a very advanced direct energy weapon as well as four humanoid alien bodies. The Soviet scientist [music] uh took apart the recovered craft and discovered a very advanced uh directed energy weapon. &gt;&gt; Number five, Need to Know and the Legacy program.</p>
<p>Officials who ran the US government [music] UAP programs, according to the film, were shocked to discover another much larger UAP program called the Legacy Program. hidden away from congressional oversight. &gt;&gt; The Central Intelligence Agency is responsible for the oversight of the overall effort. You might think of them as a little bit as as a headquarters element. The program was said to be retrieving and reverse engineering crashed UAP since the 1940s.</p>
<p>Allegedly, the program involved multiple US agencies. the CIA acting as essentially the headquarters, the Air Force covertly securing and retrieving crashed UAP and any nonhuman bodies that might have been involved in the crashes. &gt;&gt; They basically can get to a site, gather material, whatever it is. And once it&#x27;s in their possession, they have the authority to classify it and therefore make any information about it unavailable to the public. The Department of Energy using their unique classification system to hide this information much deeper than the regular US government [music] classification system was able to do and defense contractors reverse engineering the crashed vehicles.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s possible that even the president isn&#x27;t considered need to know. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;ve used the security and and classification language [music] in the Atomic Energy Act to hide the legacy crash retrieval program. Number four, [music] biological effects from exposure to UAP. The film highlights reported biological effects to those who have interacted with UAPs. They had uh data of military personnel, intelligence officials, and others associated with the Department of Defense who had direct interactions with UAP and because of that direct interaction suffered some kind of medical harm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; According to Dr. Gary Nolan, who was approached by US government agencies to review the data from some of these injuries to government officials. This has included horrific burns that lead to secondary issues as well as scarring inside of their bodies and inside of their brains. &gt;&gt; You could imagine if you get too close to it, you&#x27;re going to get harm. &gt;&gt; He suggests thinking about it like being affected by the energy from the back of a jet engine, just a lot more powerful.</p>
<p>One such official, Mike Flity, is a retired US Navy and Air Force intelligence officer. In the documentary, he recounts his time with the government, including having an experience encountering UAP and having similar biological effects because of that interaction. &gt;&gt; Those of us who have investigated it, we become part of the investigation or investigated by our colleagues. &gt;&gt; Number three, covertly retrieving craft and bodies. According to the film, a secret war has existed where nations since at least 1947 have competed in the recovery and reverse engineering of crashed UAP.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We learned that the legacy program was involved in a longunning secret war with other nations to collect and reverse engineer vehicles not made by humans. The documentary claims that some sites contained nonhuman biological remains which were then stored and studied in classified programs. [music] One official even claims four bodies were recovered during the Roswell crash in 1947. &gt;&gt; The recovered material from the crash, including the bodies, were all sent up to Wrightfield, which is now called Wright Patterson Air Force Base. According to him, they&#x27;ve used classification and security language within the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to obfiscate such recoveries, keeping their existence hidden from the public [music] for decades.</p>
<p>Jay Stratton, who worked on the UAP topic for 16 years as a senior intelligence official on behalf of the US government, even claims that he has seen nonhuman craft and nonhuman beings with his own eyes. I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings. &gt;&gt; Number two, the space-time bubble. The two scientific advisers in the documentary, Hal Putoff and Eric Davis, may have the most interesting lens due to the data they&#x27;ve had access to, which isn&#x27;t even all of it [music] since the legacy program put a stop to their access. The observed UAP capability exceeds that of even the most advanced uh human technologies that are developed in classified black programs.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Their most extraordinary claim that UAPs may operate with a space-time distortion bubble that alters gravitational and inertial forces. &gt;&gt; The craft inside the bubble has a way of altering the bubble&#x27;s properties in order to change its direction of motion. This could explain how UAPs maneuver in ways known physics can&#x27;t explain, including sudden acceleration, silent operation, and seamless transition between air, space, and water. This could also explain why all the UAP photos have always seemed ridiculously fuzzy. A result of the camera trying to capture an object within a bubble that is warping spaceime itself.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s not surprising when someone takes a photo of a UAP, they find they get a fuzzy [music] and distorted picture because they&#x27;re actually taking a photo through a space-time barrier.

<p>According to quantum physicist Dr. Hal Putoff, bodies of more than one type of non-human species have been discovered via [music] these crash retrieval programs. &gt;&gt; The intelligence officials that have briefed on these crash retrievals have talked about a number of different species having been observed to be associated with the crash. The bodies recovered are not all the same type. &gt;&gt; Dr.</p>
<p>Dr. Eric Davis, a scientific adviser to the UAP programs, [music] states that he&#x27;s aware of at least two advanced non-human species, one of which made contact with the legacy crash retrieval program, &gt;&gt; the other which the bodies were recovered by the crash retrieval program in various crashes. He also claims that during private conversations in 2003 with George [music] Herbert Walker Bush, he was told by the former US president of an event involving a UAP in 1964 at Hollowman Air Force Base. During this event, the base was approached by three UAPs, one of which landed and a nonhuman entity deboarded the craft that landed and interacted with uniformed Air Force and civilian CIA personnel. And when he asked for more details, he was told that he did not have a need to know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What do you think? Have these officials convinced you that advanced non-human intelligence exists and that the world&#x27;s governments are aware of this? Or is there another explanation we haven&#x27;t considered? Drop your theories, wild guesses, or even skepticisms in the comments below.</p>
