            <p>hey there welcome back to the Deep dive buckle up because today we&#x27;re going on a wild ride we&#x27;re going to be tackling uh a topic that&#x27;ll probably make you rethink everything you thought you knew about like reality itself we&#x27;re talking about the connection between vacuum energy Consciousness and suppressed Technologies you know it really does sound like a like a sci-fi movie when you lay it out like that but uh the truth is that all these Concepts they&#x27;re uh they&#x27;re rooted in some pretty fascinating science oh absolutely and to help us on this journey we&#x27;ve got some incredible insights from a couple of really interesting thinkers we&#x27;ve got excerpts from conversations with Dan Winter uh a researcher who&#x27;s like devoted years to exploring these topics and we&#x27;ve also got Elizabeth Donovan who&#x27;s an expert in suppressed technology I&#x27;m really excited to um to dive into what they have to say and uh and see what we can uh what kind of connections we can find yeah it sounds like a really uh an exciting uh Deep dive where do we even begin with something this big well I think a good place to start is with the most basic concept and that is the vacuum you know we typically think of it as uh as empty space just a big Cosmic void but what if I told you that it&#x27;s actually uh full of energy okay that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s pretty interesting I&#x27;m uh I&#x27;m definitely intrigued what kind of energy are we talking about here well Dan Winter he sets a figure from um senichi SEI and SEI estimated the vacuum&#x27;s energy density at get this 10 to the 93rd power ergs per cubic centimeter to put that into perspective it&#x27;s more energy than every Star in the observable universe combined oh okay that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a huge amount of energy but if it&#x27;s everywhere all around us then why don&#x27;t we see it why don&#x27;t we feel it that is a great question and that&#x27;s where things get uh really interesting this energy is so fundamental it&#x27;s so pervasive that it&#x27;s like uh it makes up the very fabric of reality you know it&#x27;s like the canvas that everything else is painted on and all the matter that we see and experience the stuff that we&#x27;re made of it&#x27;s just a tiny tiny Ripple on top of this vast energetic ocean so it&#x27;s like the vacuum is this ultimate power source and we&#x27;re just these uh you know little boats just bobbing around on the surface completely unaware of the uh The Depths below us exactly and you know this actually ties into the ancient concept of Maya you know the illusion of the material world what we see as solid stable reality is just a tiny fraction of what&#x27;s really going on yeah it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s pretty profound when you when really think about it it makes you question everything you thought you knew yeah about you know the world it totally does it definitely does now let&#x27;s throw in another kind of interesting concept here and that&#x27;s Zero Point Energy the name kind of comes from the idea that even at Absolute Zero the temperature at which all molecular motion stops this energy it&#x27;s still there yeah I remember learning about that in uh in physics class it always seemed kind of like mysterious to me where does this energy come from if everything&#x27;s supposed to be completely still well Dan Winter He suggests that uh instead of going to zero to absolute zero the wave function of energy actually collapses to something called the plank threshold the plank threshold can you uh remind me what that is again sure it&#x27;s basically the smallest possible unit of measurement in physics like the pixel size of the universe yeah and when energy collapses to this level winter believes it transforms into something pretty wild a longitudinal superluminal gravity wave okay now we&#x27;re uh we&#x27;re getting into some pretty mind-bending territory here a gravity wave that travels faster than light that just seems to go against everything we know about physics that&#x27;s the thing about you know really exploring these topics you have to be willing to challenge everything you thought you knew and just you know be open to new possibilities winter even suggests a more accurate term for all of this instead of zero point collapse he calls it plank collapse so it&#x27;s not about the energy disappearing it&#x27;s about it transforming into something uh something different something that could you know maybe hold the key to locking some of the the universe&#x27;s greatest Mysteries exactly and he goes even further suggesting that the term quantum gets thrown around way too much without really understanding what it means he proposes that everything is actually quantized meaning it&#x27;s all made up of these discrete units of energy so it&#x27;s not just about you know these tiny particles in the the subatomic realm it&#x27;s about recognizing that the whole universe operates on these principles of quantized energy that&#x27;s it now let&#x27;s uh let&#x27;s shift gears for a second here and talk about something that always gets people excited suppressed Technologies and this is where Elizabeth Donovan&#x27;s expertise comes in she brings up this device called the kosy frost device and get this it&#x27;s from 1927 wait 1927 that&#x27;s almost 100 years ago what was so special about this thing well according to Donovan it was a warp propulsion device that could generate 800 times its own weight in gravity who okay that&#x27;s some serious anti-gravity are we talking about a real life flying machine here that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re saying yeah although the details are kind of like shrouded in mystery uh the device apparently used lithium niobate and something called phase conjugate RF pump waves to do this okay you&#x27;re going to have to uh break that down for me phase conjugate what all right imagine you throw a rock into a pond and the waves Ripple outward right phase conjugation is kind of like reversing those ripples making them go back to where they started it&#x27;s about focusing energy in a really specific way ah so it&#x27;s like creating a a laser beam but with gravity that sounds incredibly powerful and maybe a little bit scary too yeah I know right and according to Donovan these kinds of devices they give off longitudinal waves and these waves can be tracked you know they can be monitored so you can imagine why the military would be very interested in something like this yeah that&#x27;s no surprise any technology that can you know mess with gravity would be a total game Cher for uh for Warfare it it makes you wonder how many other uh crazy inventions are hidden away in some secret lab somewhere definitely gets the imagination going that&#x27;s for sure and here&#x27;s where it gets even more interesting both Stan winter and Elizabeth Donovan they kind of hint at this connection between all this Advanced Tech that we&#x27;re talking about and Consciousness really that&#x27;s a connection I wouldn&#x27;t have expected how do they link those two things together well they both point to uh longitudinal waves and this process of squaring them winter suggests that this squaring process this is important for generating gravity and also for understanding consciousness so it&#x27;s like this specific type of energy wave holds the key to uh manipulating the physical world and uh and expanding our our minds that&#x27;s the idea they&#x27;re both kind of playing with and this leads us to another fascinating part of Dan Winter&#x27;s work his uh his view on how we think about electromagnetism he believes there&#x27;s a crucial part that&#x27;s missing from our understanding of this fundamental Force missing what do you mean I thought we like pretty much figured out electromagnetism back in the 1800s with uh with Maxwell equations right well you&#x27;re right Maxwell&#x27;s equations they laid the groundwork but winter points to this guy Oliver heavyside who uh who simplified those equations but in doing so he kind of removed the fourth element that represented spin spin you mean like a like an electron spinning exactly winter argues that this simplification even though it made the equations easier to work with it robbed us of a key dimension in our understanding of electromagnetism it&#x27;s like trying to understand a 3D object by just looking at its Shadow you&#x27;re missing like a whole dimension of information that&#x27;s a great way to put it and winter goes on to say that the next Dimension he defines it as the superposed axis of charge rotation okay hold on superposed axis of rotation can you uh can you break that down for me a little bit imagine a spinning top okay now picture a bunch of spinning tops all nested inside each other each one rotating on a different axis that&#x27;s kind of the idea behind superposed axis of rotation yeah got it but how can we even begin to like visualize something like that it&#x27;s like trying to imagine a fourth dimension it definitely challenges our our usual ways of thinking and here&#x27;s where another fascinating concept comes in the golden ratio winter believes that this mathematical ratio which is found everywhere in nature it plays a really important role in how all these superposed axes of rotation interact the golden ratio that&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s about 1.618 right I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s connected to like Beauty and Harmony and art and architecture exactly and winter believes it&#x27;s also a fundamental principle in the organization of energy and information in the universe He suggests that the golden ratio makes sure there&#x27;s constructive interference between all those spinning Dimensions it creates a stable harmonious system so it&#x27;s like the golden ratio is the conductor of the orchestra it keeps all the different parts working together in harmony that&#x27;s a fantastic way to think about it and he uses DNA and the Brain as examples their structure and function are very closely connected to these uh superposed rotating Dimensions wow it&#x27;s it&#x27;s mindblowing to think that something as as simple as the golden ratio might be at work like the very fabric of our being it really expands how we think about uh about how the universe is organized and winter he argues that because we&#x27;re stuck with this limited way of representing spin in traditional physics we&#x27;re missing out on understanding things like free energy and you know all these other really advanced concepts it&#x27;s like we&#x27;ve been given a tool boox with just a couple of tools we&#x27;re trying to build build you know a spaceship we need more tools a better understanding of how energy and information work together to unlock these Advanced possibilities exactly exactly all right hold on tight because we&#x27;re about to jump into some really deep water here we&#x27;re going to talk about the connection between gravity Consciousness and even lucid dreaming okay now you&#x27;ve got my attention how do those three things even go together well Dan Winter he really emphasizes that gravity is not about bending SpaceTime like uh like Einstein said it&#x27;s actually about the acceleration of ch Arch so instead of a a bowling ball warping a trampoline it&#x27;s more like a magnet pulling in metal filings yeah that&#x27;s a great way to think about it and this has some pretty wild implications he uses the example of UFOs making those crazy sharp turns at high speeds you know He suggests they might be carrying their own inertial frame with them so the turn Isn&#x27;t So jarring so it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re creating their own little bubble of reality within the uh the bigger universe exactly and winter he goes even further and links this to the physics of uh what some people call the Rapture he says it&#x27;s about conditioning the Earth&#x27;s energy array and this could lead to uh more lucid dreaming but also you know maybe some mental instability for people who aren&#x27;t uh who aren&#x27;t ready for it wow okay that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a lot to unpack can you talk a little bit more about this Rapture idea and how it connects to lucid dreaming he&#x27;s basically saying that as the Earth&#x27;s energy field gets more structured and compressed it&#x27;s like entering a more intense energetic en environment and this increase in intensity it could trigger those heightened States Of Consciousness like lucid dreaming but it could also be too much for some people to handle so it&#x27;s like uh if you&#x27;re suddenly exposed to a very bright light some people might adjust but others might get blinded yeah that&#x27;s a good way to think about it he also mentions that uh you know to live in this energy array you got to be centripetal like a Sufi master who can spin without getting dizzy so it&#x27;s about finding a point of Stillness and balance even when there&#x27;s all this energy swirling around you makes sense if the if the energy field is becoming more intense exactly and winter highlights the idea that being able to lucid dream essentially living in a longitudinal array it&#x27;s super important for taking your memories with you when you die hold on taking memories through death that&#x27;s a pretty big concept can you explain that a bit more well think of it this way our bodies are like temporary vehicles for our Consciousness and as we transition out of these vehicles winter suggests that being able to navigate these energy arrays kind of like what we do when we loose a dream it might be really important for holding on to our sense of self and taking our memories with us Beyond this physical life wow that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a really interesting concept so it&#x27;s not just about having these you know Cool Dreams it&#x27;s about developing a kind of Consciousness that can go beyond our physical limitations precisely and this leads us to another fascinating concept plasma intelligence okay I&#x27;m ready for another mind-blowing idea what is plasma intelligence and where does it fit into all of this okay think about the sun it&#x27;s a giant ball of plasma and lots of cultures throughout history have thought of the Sun as being conscious right well winter suggests that this might be more than just a metaphor he says that plasma especially when it&#x27;s organized and coherent it could be capable of supporting some really Advanced forms of Consciousness so it&#x27;s like the sun is this giant conscious being made of uh Pure Energy he even talks about the aru the seven spins or five spins you see in the Sun and he connects it to the heart of both humans and hydrogen this suggests that there&#x27;s a fundamental pattern of organization that connects Consciousness across all these different scales from the cosmic to the atomic that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a beautiful concept it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re all connected through this underlying pattern of spinning energy it is beautiful and this brings us to another really interesting piece of the puzzle High dialectric materials winter explains that these materials allow for really dense plasma charge circulation which he actually quotes to mindfulness so these materials can like boost Consciousness what kind of materials are we talking about think of things like quartz crystals or certain Ceramics they have a special ability to store and transmit energy ah so it&#x27;s like building a super highway for energy to flow through that would allow for more complex patterns of information which might be what Consciousness needs to to thrive exactly and this leads to a really important distinction the difference between AI artificial intelligence and the idea of a soul okay now we&#x27;re getting into some deep philosophical territory here what&#x27;s Winter&#x27;s take on that well AI can definitely copy human intelligence and even you know maybe surpass it in some ways but winter says that AI doesn&#x27;t have a soul so what is it about a soul that makes it so different from AI can you measure it can you quantify it winter thinks that having a soul is all about accessing that longitudinal array that fabric of energy and information in the vacuum from within your own Aura it&#x27;s about being connected to something bigger than ourselves a source of Consciousness that&#x27;s not limited by our physical brains so it&#x27;s not just about crunching numbers and solving problems it&#x27;s about tapping into this uh this deeper level of Consciousness that goes beyond our our physical bodies exactly and this brings us to the importance of infrasound a phenomenon that&#x27;s connected to everything from brain wve entrainment to ancient Energy Technologies okay I&#x27;m intrigued tell me more about this infrasound and how it all fits in think about it like this just like visible light is on a spectrum with different colors representing different frequencies sound also has a spectrum and infrasound this refers to sound waves that are below the range of what we can hear so it&#x27;s like uh a secret language of vibrations that we can&#x27;t perceive exactly and winter believes that intrasound is super important for all kinds of things like harp that program that uses high-powered radio waves to study the atmosphere he also links infrasound to brain waves associated with states of bliss and even the way pyramids generated energy wait pyramids made energy using infrasound how is that even possible that&#x27;s what winter suggests yeah he says that the shape and materials of the pyramids created a kind of resonant chamber that Amplified and focused those infrasound waves and this might have allowed them to tap into the energy of the vacuum itself that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s fascinating it makes you wonder if you know the Ancients were onto something that we&#x27;re just rediscovering now it really does and there&#x27;s one more thing that&#x27;s kind of strange there was a World Health Organization document that showed how ultra low frequency waves interact with the human body and for some reason they took it down that&#x27;s a little suspicious it makes you think that maybe some people know about the power of these frequencies and uh maybe they don&#x27;t want the rest of us to know it definitely raises some questions about what information is being kept from us and why it&#x27;s almost like uh they&#x27;re aware of these frequencies both the good and the bad and they&#x27;re trying to control the narrative around them it really makes you wonder if they&#x27;re also looking into using these Technologies in ways we can&#x27;t even imagine absolutely the possibilities are both exciting and uh maybe a little bit frightening okay let&#x27;s come back down to earth for a second a listener named Riel wrote in and they wanted to know are iPhones designed to like not capture certain things that&#x27;s an interesting question there&#x27;s been talk that uh you know smartphone cameras no matter how good they are they might not be able to pick up certain things in the sky like you know UFOs yeah I&#x27;ve heard that too some people like Dr Hof think that these objects might actually be warping SpaceTime around them and that would make them invisible to regular cameras that&#x27;s a pretty wild Theory remember those UFOs we were talking about the ones that make those impossible turns well if they&#x27;re manipulating their own uh inertial frame then they could be bending reality around them they could be appearing and disappearing how however they want that sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi movie I know right but the line between science fiction and real it is uh it&#x27;s getting blurrier all the time our understanding of physics the technology we use to see the world it could all be holding us back makes you wonder what we&#x27;re not seeing what&#x27;s really out there exactly and this brings us back to the idea of the vacuum is it really nothing or is it something okay let&#x27;s dive back into that what&#x27;s the latest on that debate well all the evidence seems to point to the vacuum definitely being something back in the 1940s the engineers who were designing vacuum tu tubes they had to take the vacuum&#x27;s permitivity and permeability into account for their calculations to work permitivity and permeability those are some uh some big words I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m familiar with those okay think of it this way permitivity this is about a material&#x27;s ability to store electrical energy like how much charge a capacitor can hold and then permeability that&#x27;s about its ability to conduct magnetic fields like how easily a magnet can go through it okay okay I&#x27;m starting to get it but why would those things m matter in a vacuum if it&#x27;s supposed to be empty that&#x27;s the point if you have to give the vacuum permitivity and permeability that means it&#x27;s not just empty space there&#x27;s something there that can interact with electromagnetic fields so it&#x27;s like the vacuum has its own hidden structure it has its own rules that control how energy and matter behave exactly some people call it the ether others call it the quantum vacuum but no matter what you call it it&#x27;s pretty clear that the vacuum isn&#x27;t just uh an absence of matter it&#x27;s an active player in the the whole Cosmic dance of energy and information and you mentioned earlier that it has impedance right so that means it has a resonant frequency you got it and if you could somehow connect to that resonance you could potentially tap into this uh this enormous energy source in the vacuum that&#x27;s the dream isn&#x27;t it free energy but wouldn&#x27;t you need to uh to collapse the wave of that frequency first yeah that&#x27;s where things get really tricky our sources especially down winter they seem to be pretty good at identifying the frequency signature of uh you know that perfect collapse and that could be the key to unlocking this potential and this all ties back to that guy Roger Penrose and his work on Consciousness specifically his book The Emperor&#x27;s New mind where he explores this idea that Consciousness comes from um Quantum processes happening in microtubules in the brain good connection people used to dismiss penrose&#x27;s work as fringe science but he just won the Nobel Prize for his work on spinners and vectors so now people are starting to pay attention to his theories again do you think there&#x27;s something to this idea of um microtubules collapsing the wave function and creating Consciousness it&#x27;s definitely possible steuart Hammer off&#x27;s early model of Consciousness in microtubules it might not have been totally complete but it opened the door for more exploration even if it&#x27;s not the whole story it could be a very important part of the puzzle and it&#x27;s fascinating how this idea of wave function collapse keeps coming up from Consciousness to energy generation to even Gates I know it&#x27;s everywhere Dan Winter he&#x27;s convinced that this implosive charge collapse the very process we&#x27;ve been talking about it&#x27;s necessary for Stargates to open so this fundamental principle of energy coming together and transforming it&#x27;s happening everywhere from the smallest things to the biggest things in the universe exactly it&#x27;s like the universe is speaking to us in this language of energy and geometry and we&#x27;re just starting to figure out the alphabet and this idea of collapsing the wave it also has some pretty big implications for how we think about death and Resurrection that&#x27;s right Freddy Silva&#x27;s film The Art of Resurrection talks about the Templar initiation these individuals had to learn to die for three days which reminds us of uh you know Jesus&#x27;s resurrection so they were going through this symbolic death and rebirth experience maybe they were tapping into these same principles of energy transformation that we&#x27;ve been talking about that&#x27;s a really interesting interpretation and if we connect that with Dan Winter&#x27;s idea about the ability to live in a longitudinal array being important for taking memories through death it seems like mastering these energetic principles could help us overcome physical limitations wow that&#x27;s some pretty heavy stuff we&#x27;re not just talking about physics and Technology here we&#x27;re talking about the nature of Consciousness and existence itself it&#x27;s all connected and this brings us back to that idea of Spin and how it&#x27;s been suppressed in mainstream physics okay remind me how spin got sidelined and why it&#x27;s so important well like we mentioned earlier all of our heavy sides simplified Maxwell&#x27;s equations but in doing so he took out the part that represented Spin and this has had a ripple effect on how we think about electromagnetism and all the fields that are connected to it totally it&#x27;s like trying to understand you know a whole Symphony Orchestra but you ignore the string section you&#x27;ll get some music but you&#x27;ll be missing a huge part of the richness and complexity and Dan Witter says that this inability to properly represent spin is the reason why we&#x27;re stuck in this 3D way of understanding reality it&#x27;s preventing us from grasping things like free energy and all these other advanced concepts he believes that spin is the key to unlocking the next Dimension that&#x27;s the realm where these superposed axes of charge rotation create all those crazy phenomena we&#x27;ve been talking about and the golden ratio with its unique mathematical properties it plays a really crucial role in harmonizing all those spinning Dimensions right it&#x27;s like the golden ratio is the conductor of the cosmic Orchestra making sure all the instruments are playing in tune and creating this beautiful Symphony of energy and information and because we&#x27;ve been taught to think in three dimensions we&#x27;re essentially trying to jam a square peg into a round hole when we&#x27;re trying to understand these Concepts it&#x27;s like those scientists you mentioned who just can&#x27;t wrap their heads around Lawrence covariant it challenges their deeply held beliefs about how the physical world Works they know there&#x27;s more to it but their current framework just can&#x27;t explain it they&#x27;re hitting the limits of their worldview and it&#x27;s making them uncomfortable exactly it&#x27;s like those old maps that warned about dragons at the edge of the world those dragons represent the unknown the things that are beyond our current understanding and going into those Uncharted territories can be both exciting and scary and some people would rather just stick with their familiar Maps even if they&#x27;re incomplete than face the uncertainty of the unknown yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s human nature but as we&#x27;ve seen in this deep dive the most amazing discoveries often lie outside the boundaries of what we think we know okay let&#x27;s shift gears again and talk about something that really caught my eye the connection between the Americans and the Soviets back in the 1970s and 80s especially when it comes to phase conjugation yeah even though they were in the middle of the Cold War it seems like both sides recognize the potential of this technology especially for the military yeah and I&#x27;ve heard that the Soviets were actually ahead of the game when it came to uh phase conjugate radar engineering while the Americans were better at rocketry so they kind of needed each other to fully unlock the potential of this technology it&#x27;s a pretty interesting example of how scientific curiosity and the drive for advanced technology can you know sometimes overcome political differences makes you wonder what other secrets are hidden in those old Cold War files and remember how we were talking about Technologies being suppressed the development of phase conjugation and its potential uses that could be one of those areas where the full story hasn&#x27;t been told definitely something to think about now let&#x27;s talk about something a bit more uh down to earth literally the physics of grounding ah yeah the Sufi Master&#x27;s advice track your attention and follow the gravity through your feet to the Center of the Earth and then to the center of the sun that&#x27;s a beautiful way to describe grounding connecting to the energy of the earth and from a scientific perspective grounding is about literally connecting our bodies to the Earth&#x27;s electrical potential and that&#x27;s been shown to have all sorts of health benefits it&#x27;s like plugging ourselves into this uh this natural source of energy and stability exactly and this goes back to the import of understanding how electromagnetic fields affect our bodies especially those ultra low frequencies we were talking about earlier yeah that who document about the effects of ultra low frequency waves that they removed that was pretty strange it feels like there&#x27;s a real effort to keep us in the dark about those frequencies and their potential effects on our health and well-being it really makes you wonder what other information might be out there what are they hiding from us this is where independent research and critical thinking are so important we can&#x27;t just take what they tell us at face value we have to dig deeper question the official story and look for different perspectives okay let&#x27;s wrap up this segment with something that really captured my imagination the idea of plasma intelligence in the Sun ah yes that ancient wisdom that sees the Sun as a conscious being the source of life and energy for our planet and Dean winter suggested this might be more than just uh a nice idea he actually believes that plasma especially when it&#x27;s organized and coherent could host some really Advanced forms of Consciousness it&#x27;s pretty mind-blowing concept and he links the Anu those seven spins or five spins observed in the Sun to the heart of humans in hydrogen this suggests that there&#x27;s a fundamental pattern that connects Consciousness across all scales from the cosmic to the atomic it&#x27;s a beautiful idea the idea that we&#x27;re all part of this vast interconnected web of Consciousness it is and it makes you think about what other forms of Consciousness might be out there in the universe forms that we can&#x27;t even begin to understand with our limited human perception I know it&#x27;s a very humbling thought we&#x27;ve covered so much ground already and I&#x27;m sure your head is spinning with all these incredible ideas but we&#x27;re just getting started there&#x27;s still so much more to explore in this deep dive stay tuned for part two where we&#x27;ll go even deeper into the mysteries of the vacuum Consciousness and the technologies that might hold the key to uh to unlocking our true potential welcome back it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s really something to think about all these hidden connections isn&#x27;t it we&#x27;ve been talking about the vacuum you know the supposedly empty space that&#x27;s actually like overflowing with energy and the idea that we could actually you know maybe tap into that energy that&#x27;s where things get really interesting yeah for sure free energy who would want that but it sounds almost too good to be true right if it&#x27;s everywhere why haven&#x27;t we figured out how to like use it well that is the big question isn&#x27;t it and it might come down to our understanding of physics just being uh incomplete remember Dan Winter talking about spin being taken out of Maxwell&#x27;s equations he thinks that missing piece understanding how energy spins it could be the key to using the vacuum&#x27;s energy so it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re missing um an important ingredient in the recipe for free energy exactly winter things that squaring the longitudinal wave that&#x27;s the kind of wave connected to gravity and Consciousness that might be how we unlock this energy okay I&#x27;m trying to Picture This what does he mean by squaring the wave well imagine a wave in the ocean now picture that way of curling it on itself getting Tighter and more intense it&#x27;s kind of like that like taking all that energy and focusing it on one point uh so it&#x27;s about concentrating that energy making it stronger yeah makes sense but how do we actually do that that&#x27;s where things get really complicated it involves uh understanding the geometry of the wave you know how it interacts with itself and other fields and this is where the golden ratio might be important again the golden ratio we talked about that before with DNA in the brain how does that connect to free energy winter thinks the golden ratio is a fundamental principle for how energy and information are organized you know in the whole universe He suggests devices that use this ratio like the pyramids they might be able to create a resonance that lets them tap into that vacuum energy so like tuning a radio to the right frequency if you get the shape right you can access that vacuum energy that&#x27;s a pretty good analogy but instead of radio waves we&#x27;re talking about those longitudinal waves which are way more subtle and hard to detect it&#x27;s pretty amazing to think that uh ancient civilizations might have known about these principles and used them in their Tech it makes you wonder what else they knew that we&#x27;ve like lost along the way for sure and it makes you wonder about what other Tech might be out there you know things that have been kept secret because they challenge the way things are speaking of suppressed Technologies Elizabeth Donovan mentioned that these Advanced devices they often give off those longitudinal waves and those can be tracked which makes them interesting to to the military right it&#x27;s like having a giant sign that says here I am even if you&#x27;re trying to be sneaky it makes these Technologies both powerful and uh potentially dangerous it makes you wonder if there&#x27;s like a secret race going on to develop and control these Technologies you know stuff that could change the whole balance of power in the world it&#x27;s definitely imp possible and it connects to that idea we talked about before about information being kept hidden if these Technologies are that powerful it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if the people in charge wanted to you know keep them to themselves it makes you question everything you read and hear right who&#x27;s deciding what we know what&#x27;s being hidden from us and why these are uh these are really important questions to ask it shows how important it is to think critically and do your own research we can&#x27;t just blindly trust what we&#x27;re told we got to dig deeper question the official story and find different perspectives you know all this talk about hidden Tech and secret knowledge makes me think about UFOs there&#x27;s been a lot of talk lately about government&#x27;s admitting that uaps those unidentified aerial phenomena are real do you think there&#x27;s a link between these Advanced Technologies we&#x27;ve been talking about and all those UFO sightings that people have been reporting for like decades I mean it&#x27;s possible right if we&#x27;re talking about technologies that can manipulate gravity and warp SpaceTime then some of the things people report seeing those seemingly impossible movements they might start to make sense right things like those sudden accelerations the right angle turns the appearing and disappearing out of thin air that doesn&#x27;t seem possible with the physics we know now exactly and this brings us back to what Dan Winter was saying about the limitations of how we understand electromagnetism if we&#x27;re missing a key element like spin then it&#x27;s not surprising that we can&#x27;t explain these things it&#x27;s like trying to solve a really complicated math problem but you only have half the numbers you&#x27;re never going to get the right answer that&#x27;s a good way to put it we need a better understanding of how energy and information works you know a more complete view of physics to really understand what&#x27;s going on one of the most common questions about UFOs is if they&#x27;re real why haven&#x27;t they made contact with us openly yeah that&#x27;s a great question and there are lots of theories some say they&#x27;re just watching us studying how we behave and our technology others think they&#x27;re waiting for us to you know reach a certain level of Consciousness before they make contact Dan Winter talks about that right the importance of inhabiting a longitudinal array something that might be connected to our ability to access those higher States Of Consciousness yes and he says that mastering this ability which you know maybe lucd dreaming gives us a glimpse of it could be crucial for navigating those subtle Realms of energy and information the kind of Realms you&#x27;d need to interact with these Advanced beings so it&#x27;s not just about you know having these cool vivid dreams it&#x27;s about developing a kind of awareness that can go beyond what our physical senses can perceive EX exactly it&#x27;s like upgrading your computer&#x27;s operating system so you can run more complex programs we got to expand our ability to see and understand things to really connect with the universe and all its wonders that&#x27;s beautifully put so it&#x27;s not just about technology it&#x27;s about our own inner Evolution too absolutely and this brings us back to that idea of plasma intelligence if the sun this huge ball of plasma can have Consciousness what does that mean for us for our own potential as humans right if Consciousness isn&#x27;t just limited to like biological Life as we know it then the possibilities are uh pretty much endless it makes you wonder what other kinds of Consciousness might be out there in the universe beyond what we can even imagine it&#x27;s a humbling and ons sparing thought isn&#x27;t it it makes all these things we&#x27;ve been talking about even more profound and significant it really does this deep dive has taken us on quite the journey you know from the depths of the vacuum to the heights of human consciousness and we&#x27;re not finished yet we&#x27;ve covered a lot but there&#x27;s still so much more to explore stay tuned for part three where we&#x27;ll continue our deep dive into the mysteries of vacuum energy Consciousness and the technologies that might hold the key to unlocking our true potential welcome back to the Deep dive we&#x27;ve been on quite a journey exploring those mindblowing connections between vacuum energy Consciousness and suppressed Technologies yeah it&#x27;s amazing to think about all that potential hidden in these ideas just waiting for us to unlock it it really makes you question what we think we know know about reality you know right it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re just scratching the surface of something so vast and mysterious and one of the most interesting parts we talked about was plasma intelligence for sure the idea that Consciousness isn&#x27;t limited to just biological life that maybe even the sun this giant ball of plasma could have some kind of awareness yeah it&#x27;s a pretty radical concept but when you consider all the evidence we&#x27;ve been talking about it doesn&#x27;t sound so crazy anymore and this connects to another fascinating thing we&#x27;ve been exploring those High dialectric materials and how they might play a role in like amplifying Consciousness you remember those materials like quartz crystals Dan Winter said they can help create a really dense flow of plasma charge and he actually connects that to mindfulness so it&#x27;s like these materials can create a better environment for Consciousness to grow kind of like a superconductor for awareness that&#x27;s a great analogy it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re making the flow of energy and information smoother letting more complex patterns emerge and maybe that&#x27;s what ponus needs to reach those higher States and this leads to a really big question that keeps coming up what&#x27;s the difference between AI you know artificial intelligence and the idea of a soul yeah we&#x27;ve talked about how AI can mimic human intelligence in some really impressive ways but does that mean it&#x27;s conscious does it have that spark that something special that we think of as a soul Dan Winter seems to think there&#x27;s a really fundamental difference he says having a soul could be linked to accessing that longitudinal array that fabric of energy and information that makes up the vacuum from within your own Aura so it&#x27;s not just about processing information or being smart it&#x27;s about being connected to something way bigger than ourselves a source of Consciousness that goes beyond our physical brains exactly and this brings us back to that deep concept that winter keeps talking about the ability to inhabit a longitudinal array he thinks that mastering this and maybe lucid dreaming gives us a clue about how to do this it could be the key to taking memories with you through death it&#x27;s like learning to explore a different dimension of reality a realm of pure energy and information that exists beyond the physical world and he thinks this ability could be essential for keeping your sense of self and carrying your memories with you you know beyond the limitations of your physical body it&#x27;s a mind-blowing idea that really challenges how we traditionally think about life and death it really does and it makes you wonder about the very nature of Consciousness you if we can learn to exist beyond our bodies what does that tell us about our true potential as human beings right it opens up a whole world of possibilities that we&#x27;re just starting to grasp and it makes all these things we&#x27;ve been discussing from vacuum energy to those suppressed Technologies even more profound and meaningful absolutely it feels like we&#x27;re on the edge of a huge shift in thinking a fundamental change in how we understand ourselves and the universe for sure and it all circles back to Dan Winter&#x27;s point about how we understand electromagnetism he says that by taking spin out of the equations we&#x27;ve basically blinded ourselves to a crucial part of reality it&#x27;s like trying to find your way around a 3D world but you can only see in 2D you&#x27;re going to miss so much important information exactly and winter thinks that this missing piece this understanding of how energy spins it could be the answer to so many of the Mysteries we&#x27;ve been talking about from free energy to Stargates even to the nature of Consciousness itself it&#x27;s incredible to think that something so fundamental like spin could be overlooked for so long it makes you wonder what other important pieces of the puzzle were missing that&#x27;s what I love about exploring these topics it&#x27;s always pushing us to think bigger and question everything we thought we knew it reminds us that we&#x27;re never truly done learning there&#x27;s always more to discover more to explore and more to understand well said so as we wrap up this deep dive are there any key takeaways that you&#x27;d like to leave our listeners with what should they be thinking about as they go about their day I think the most important thing is to stay curious and to keep that sense of wonder the universe is filled with Mysteries and the more we explore the more we realize how much we don&#x27;t know I love that embracing the unknown instead of being afraid of it exactly and I hope they&#x27;ll remember that they&#x27;re not just watching this Grand Cosmic show they&#x27;re part of it they&#x27;re helping to create reality their thoughts their intentions their actions they all contribute to how the universe unfolds that&#x27;s a powerful message it reminds us that we have a responsibility for our own own lives and for how we impact the world around us absolutely and lastly I want them to remember that everything&#x27;s connected from the smallest particles to the vastness of space we&#x27;re all part of this intricate web of energy and information it&#x27;s such a beautiful vision of unity and wholeness it can Inspire us to live with more compassion and understanding for ourselves for each other and for our plant I couldn&#x27;t have said it better thanks for joining us on this incredible journey and thank you to all our listeners for diving deeper with us today we&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts your questions and your own experiences with these fascinating topics so keep exploring keep asking questions and keep diving deep we&#x27;ll see you next time by</p>
