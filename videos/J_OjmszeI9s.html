            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I&#x27;m Tim Ventura from American anti-gravity tocom and this is a follow-up interview with Dr Eugene panoff world famous Russian physicist and chemist known for his work into gravitational waves and gravity beam generation during our previous interview Dr polenov told us that he&#x27;d been able to generate hundreds of pounds of force in beams of pure gravitational energy and we&#x27;re conducting a follow-up interview to learn a little bit more about the details of his experiment uh Dr poov can you hear me okay I read you perfectly one of the responses that we had online was uh with nearly a decade of experience why haven&#x27;t we&#x27;ve been able to see video or photos of your experiments up until now uh well first of all when I began uh those experiments in Finland in tampara uh it&#x27;s not a habit here in Finland to make any videos or photos of the equipment or of the experiment it&#x27;s typical for the United States but here in Europe a bit uh different and the same thing goes for Russia uh especially with the last experiment uh in the um Moscow chemical Research Center because um the whole Center is um a very complicated structure and some of the works are closed for white public they&#x27;re not secret but they&#x27;re simply dangerous because we use high voltage several million volts so they&#x27;re closed and uh uh uh well we have special signs on the walls of the laboratory which do not allow to make any photos it&#x27;s the policy which is accepted at this uh scientific center so I didn&#x27;t want to change the rules oh absolutely well in light of the publicity they&#x27;ve had recently have you given thought to doing any photos or video in the near future uh I think uh I will try to make uh something uh I discussed this possibility uh with the administration they think it might be possible but uh at present we have uh no videos and um no photos at all oh okay well I look forward uh to hopefully receiving some in the future um you know if it turns out that it is possible well to move along um have you been able to obtain uh funding from government or private interests has there been uh a fair amount of Interest that&#x27;s come forward Ward and tried to provide some funding for your experiments uh there is a certain interest from uh several circuits but it&#x27;s private sector mainly because uh governmental policy towards uh all the research in the field of gravity and experimental gravity um is uh it&#x27;s not a popular Trend so uh we don&#x27;t get much money from the government uh of course we use the uh R installation at the technological Center but there is some interest in general all over the world and in the United States in Great Britain but uh uh we didn&#x27;t get any funding from the government uh we get uh rather small funding from uh private sectors as I mentioned but uh our plans are really amazing and uh we need um considerable funding so this uh topic uh gravity is um first of all it is a bit unusual and uh we need some exotic material we need um special installations we need cryogenic systems uh also we need the help of people who are uh top qualified in their own areas and uh this all costs a lot yeah definitely well you know with uh with the actual testing one of the questions that had occurred to me when I was you know when I sat down and took a little bit of time was um it you know as these are presumed to be gravity beams have you noticed any time effects uh it&#x27;s uh difficult to say because uh it&#x27;s not practically a gravity beam it&#x27;s a gravity impulse so it&#x27;s very short in time and because of these limitations as it is short in time we didn&#x27;t notice any time effects and didn&#x27;t even try to measure maybe they&#x27;re present they are definitely present when we are working with the rotating discs definitely and uh we had some uh some experience with this but with gravity impulse generator we simply didn&#x27;t organize any measurements absolutely that that makes perfect sense well you know I I was wondering on a personal note um you&#x27;d mentioned that this was uh over hundreds of pounds of force for a very short period of time and I&#x27;d wondered um has this uh has this been able to punch holes through lightweight substances or is it more of just kind of a motion on them uh it all depends on the um voltage that we apply and also on the structure of the superconducting emitter so at the maximum possibility of our materials at present uh we can obtain um rather big impulses so they are able uh to deform uh metal plates uh with a thickness of couple of inches and uh they are able to make holes in concrete walls so um we are not speaking about some lightweight substances but concrete wall is something very solid and they deform metal uh in the way that a hydraulic press might do it uh but the impulse is very short in time so uh of course we can uh build a system and use several uh Marx uh generators so we can uh give a series of impulses that will uh definitely improve the situation but at present we can um treat different materials uh with our um gravity impulse generator and also what is important that uh we can um heit different objects at Big distances absolutely well you know in in terms of uh putting holes through concrete it makes sense that the holes would remain but with Metals after the metal is deformed do they snap back after the beam is gone or do they remain deformed no they just remain deformed it&#x27;s just uh like um very uh very like a punch uh very short in time so it&#x27;s an U close to an explosion action something like this oh okay okay I you know I&#x27;m I&#x27;m planning on buying um a small superconductor and testing some myself hopefully um I I don&#x27;t have a 5 million volt system I think 5,000 with a very high amperage so hopefully I I doubt that it would do metals but I thought maybe paper might be something to experiment with and see if I can well I I think it&#x27;s possible oh okay well I I&#x27;ll definitely have to move forward with that um well one of the things I was wondering about was whether you&#x27;ve been able to do efficiency calculations for the force beam uh well ja calculated uh some preliminary made some preliminary measurements and uh gave the forces uh in Jes but um we practically uh did not try to calculate uh we wanted to Simply to see the results and how the different objects uh uh react to the um action of this impulse so we didn&#x27;t U make any precise calculations oh okay um you&#x27;d mentioned in the past that this tends to defy conventional relativity Theory I was wondering if you might have any specific examples of things that caught your eye as maybe being not right or outside of what the theory predicts well first of all I didn&#x27;t say that uh our experiments defy conventional relativity Theory no and they don&#x27;t but um if we uh speak about um uh the experiment with the rotating discs I simply mentioned that uh uh where uh rotating uh metal um or super conducting objects at very high speed and uh as this uh rotation um around uh its own axis is um not [Applause] um uh it&#x27;s an absolute um rotation so it&#x27;s uh absolute movement it&#x27;s not relative that&#x27;s why the uh relativity theory is not applicable uh to our rotating discs because it&#x27;s entirely different thing oh okay so it just doesn&#x27;t apply but it it doesn&#x27;t invalidate at all that I I should apologize for getting that one incorrect um oh does the uh does the inertia change in proportion to changes in Mass the the reason that I kind of wrote that down was really in relation to um Fran decino&#x27;s research and he believes that these aren&#x27;t equal that they just tend to appear equal to to us in our frame of reference but I I was oh I&#x27;m sorry well according to our understanding and our experience U we did not make any difference between uh gravitational and inertial bass so we think that they are equal also in case uh with the uh impulses the impulses are too short in time uh to make uh to notice any difference and we didn&#x27;t make any special experiments just uh to distinguish U gravitational and inertial Ms oh okay um oh in in terms of uh the actual emitter the superconductor um you know I&#x27;d read the experimental right up I believe it was 47 mm if I remember correctly but I was wondering if changing ing the size or shape affects the beam output maybe makes it stronger or uh refocuses it perhaps uh well if we speak about the size of the superconductor uh there are some limitations the diameter of the superconductor shouldn&#x27;t be uh smaller than 4 in um because of the uh schw uh Schwarz child&#x27;s radius and uh if we speak about the shape well uh uh the superc conductor can in fact have different shapes and uh the impulse will repeat um the projection of uh a certain shape so it is important oh okay well that may rule out my experiment I the largest I&#x27;ve seen online I think is a 1-in superconductor in the United States at least so not sure if they sell 4in ones although if they did it would be worth the money um well it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very important we um didn&#x27;t get any uh good results with uh smaller superconductors and also it&#x27;s um much more difficult to get a flat discharge with um the superc conductors that are small in diameter oh okay well um have you noticed any changes in uh the molecular structure or uh maybe compression for the targets that you&#x27;ve sent the beam through um like youd mentioned um metals deforming and holes through concrete um on a yeah we did not uh see any um compression effects or any change of the molecular structure it Remains the Same as it was oh okay so it&#x27;s just a large scale deformation from Force but not anything internal then no nothing internal oh um oh I I should ask if the beam loses energy as it penetrates materials um does it does it naturally decrease with distance but but um uh well that&#x27;s an interesting question and uh to our great surprise and we made a lot of discharges so the installation was working for about four years now uh the beam practically does not uh lose energy when it meets um the materials it can pass through the brick wall or concrete uh or metal plates very thick ones and um plastic materials also it seems that uh it doesn&#x27;t lose energy at all which seems a bit strange but um uh we don&#x27;t want to break any laws and uh simply the system where we working it&#x27;s not a closed one therefore the second law of Thermodynamics is again uh not applicable here and if we speak about uh the action uh with a distance the dependence of the energy on the distance uh we don&#x27;t have uh much experimental data but uh what we have now is first measurement at U the distance of 1.2 kilm and uh there is uh no uh loss of energy and the latest experiments uh the distance was 5 kilometers and uh the beam penetrated through several houses which made which were made of um concrete so we did not uh measure any uh loss of energy but um uh According to some calculations and um the evaluations that we made uh with a distance of more than 100 kilometers we should get some decrease um of the energy so it&#x27;s this work awaits us in the future oh okay he you know as well you&#x27;d mentioned 5 km did you notice any change in the focus of the beam uh did it did it widen or perhaps get smaller um as it as it travels uh if uh uh the main solenoid which is um wound um around the chamber is made in a good way then we have a very good discharge and uh practically um it um it uh contains the same uh form as it was but uh with the distance of 5 kilm we notice that there is [Applause] um the beam is not so focused it&#x27;s uh it goes a bit uh a bit wider uh than it it was so there are some deviations uh in the in the shape of the impulse it becomes a bit wider oh okay um you know one of the I collected a few questions online and uh um one person had written me um is it possible to generate more work along the path of the beam than energy put into the beam I I think they were asking about potential overunity applications but uh well uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s surprising uh that uh um uh energy that we put uh inside the discharge uh it&#x27;s uh much less uh than the energy uh which uh the impulse produces and the work that it can um make uh is uh bigger than the energy that we put inside the beam but that doesn&#x27;t mean uh it&#x27;s an over United device simply uh we um create the conditions when the interactions of uh magnetic field and electric field and uh special um behavior of the was Einstein condensate uh so with all these parameters we provide the interaction of um the fields and of the material with the subatomic particles uh we may call it um Z point energy or whatever it is or ether uh but um anyway uh when normal matter interacts with subatomic particles uh special energy is uh obtained and uh we can use this energy so our installation is like a key which uh opens the energy of the subatomic particles this is at least our explanation sure sure well and it sounds like it is kind of opening up perhaps in some ways more energy than is immediately available um yeah that&#x27;s right also uh we are not speaking about any closed system this system is an open one and uh we don&#x27;t break any laws from our point of view oh okay well you had mentioned that you&#x27;re actually working on some Publications and I I guess in some ways that kind of ruins my next question that i&#x27; collected online um they&#x27;d asked if you&#x27;re going to publish more in the near future uh well uh of course the interest uh to this uh problem problem is um growing in all the countries we got a very um interesting offer from China from they have a special project at the University of Beijing and uh there is a certain interest from um the private sector in the United States so as soon as we uh get the funding we will try to organize all these um experiments in a more detailed way uh but um uh at present what is extremely interesting that we measured or we tried to measure the interaction of uh this beam uh with a light and U some preliminary results were published uh last year in the Journal of low temperature physics it was in August it&#x27;s my article with jaavan mzza and we continue this work now and also we tried uh to measure uh the speed uh the propagation spe speed of the impulse and we&#x27;re very cautious about it because we don&#x27;t want uh to frighten uh the scientific community and also we want to be absolutely sure that the results um were checked and rejected um several T of times but it seems that um based on what we have now and we already working for a year and a half uh on this uh the speed of the impulse uh is much higher than than the speed of light and uh uh with the parameters that we use now with the present meters and uh the voltage of uh three and 5 million volts uh the speed uh is about 63 64 C which means that um the propagation speed of the impulse is uh close to it is practically 64 times faster than the speed of light but um we would like uh of course uh to measure all these um parameters using different uh measurement uh systems different approaches at present we used to Atomic Clock and uh we think that our experiments were precise enough but we would welcome of course um the advice of the International Community and um the advice on how to measure the speed of the impulse in a very precise way as soon as we get U good confirmation of the results uh we will try to publish all these information oh okay so there&#x27;s definitely more coming along you know one thing that I found helps with the lifter experiments and others that I&#x27;ve conducted and again if you you know once you reach the point of taking film um I found that film analysis helps a lot at least for my experiments and one of my favorites has been working with smoke and Cloud Chambers and and uh you know by by stopping the tape and rewinding I found that I can find a lot of little things going on that I never noticed at the you know at the time I filmed it so you know perhaps that may be something that&#x27;ll be valuable if if you&#x27;re able to bring a camera in and get some photos yes that&#x27;s a very good approach we&#x27;ll take it into consideration of course well um you know I I was wondering uh you&#x27;d mentioned that there&#x27;s interest from the private sector in the United States and from China but do you know if there are any duplication efforts or replication underway by other groups for your your research uh I know that uh there there was a big interest uh in BO but um I don&#x27;t know their secrets and I know that uh the Department of Defense in the United States is also interested in this program and that&#x27;s why they invited uh Dr ning Le uh to lead their scientific uh laborat uh but uh at present I don&#x27;t know any uh official replication of um my gravity experiments mainly because they are hard to organize they are rather costy and the official attitude uh of the let&#x27;s say politically correct science to this problem is negative so it creates a lot of um difficulties but I don&#x27;t hide anything and uh if people uh contact me directly or by email I usually try to give uh all the advice uh that I have and to share all the experience because the problem is too complicated for one country or for one lab um to succeed and uh the gravity should be studied uh all over the world using the best forces and the brains of different scientists that&#x27;s the key to success absolutely well and I&#x27;ve always had great success in terms of contacting you and you&#x27;ve always been incredibly helpful with my questions and and so I&#x27;m sure others will have a a similar experience but um you know one of the obstacles to Independent replications it sounds like is the 4-in superconductor do you know if those are manufactured and sold anywhere or is it a process that everyone has to go through to build their own uh well uh Frankly Speaking it&#x27;s uh a part of my knowhow but uh if we speak about EXT extremely uh effective emitters but normal emitters which allow simply uh to measure uh small effects it&#x27;s not a problem and U I think that um American superconductor can help uh easily to make the meters of this kind or also there is um a nice firm called uh super conductive components in Ohio Columbus in the United States and they are more or less familiar with my technology and they can uh I I think make their good cont contribution to this oh okay so essentially by using a smaller superconductor you have a smaller effect but that can be tested using more sensitive equipment um well uh Ste uh the diameter of the disc should be not less than 4 in uh no I speak about the structure the structure for very efficient um emitters um is a bit uh difficult and it takes a lot of experience to achieve this structure so uh even if I give the detailed description uh it&#x27;s a bit difficult to make it without my help but uh with um normal emers uh which allow you to push uh a thick book um away from the table it&#x27;s possible to make it it&#x27;s not so complicated oh okay okay well um you know I had one other question about um this person was also asking about video but they were also asking about a moving flat glow discharge and this was something I thought might be in your notes perhaps that I&#x27;d missed when I read through them uh well in order to make uh the video for for the uh flag glow discharge uh we should use a highspeed uh video camera which uh we don&#x27;t have at present so we just want to rely on our uh key inside but it&#x27;s a bit difficult we&#x27;re planning uh to make it but uh even with uh normal I when we have um normal discharge I mean a spark uh as in VRA generator or a flat glow discharge which repeats the configuration of a meter it&#x27;s possible to see it with your own eyes we don&#x27;t need any camera for this oh okay well just to wrap things up cuz we&#x27;re almost out of time again it sounds like you&#x27;re getting amazing results you&#x27;re able to actually you know put holes through concrete and bend Metals with this at 5 million volts um you know these are remarkable results is there anything you&#x27;d like to say in close uh I don&#x27;t think that uh these results are remarkable uh in general this subject called um experimental Gravity Research it has a very big potential and uh if we compare uh the how complicated Pro this problem is to the problem of let&#x27;s say nuclear explosion uh I think that uh Gravity Research is much more complicated but uh even uh if we speak about uh nuclear power uh there was a period in the United States when uh everybody was interested and uh military and people wanted to make uh some researches and the government was interested and then people came came and said could you please make a small explosion and then we will make we will give you money for a big one and um it&#x27;s impossible to make a small nuclear explosion somewhere under ventilation same thing refers to gravity it&#x27;s an enormous problem and uh we can&#x27;t U Get Much if we uh don&#x27;t have an organized approach as it was in the nuclear program for example in the United States so only combining the knowledge of different fields of different physicists and chemists and material scientists theoretical physicist uh only uh making them work together we can uh make a breakthrough in this field because it&#x27;s a very very serious research absolutely well thanks again for your time and we definitely look forward to following up with you uh more in the future thank you you&#x27;re welcome</p>
