            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello and welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel where we try to look at uh obscure and um esoteric theories of everything things that you can use to sort out your whole life and to be able to um see things in a holistic Manner and today is the 320th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and the reciprocal system was originated by dwey B Larsson and Mr Larson uh worked it out over over 60 years of his life um a lot of it solo uh he had a small following you know in the last 20 years or so um he died back in 1990 and uh you know he started out looking for a much a solution to much smaller problems but then he uh eventually had a few epiphanies and he realized that he had stumbled upon something that was much bigger and uh he answered the call and he worked it out and he um made uh some great findings that I&#x27;m trying to share with you here um and I as far as I know this is about the only channel uh that talks about this in any type of detail and um it is a difficult thing you have to uh put some dedication into learning it um but you had to do this for your high school chemistry class your high school physics class uh if you put in that kind of an effort you know uh uh go you you do class every day for half an hour 45 minutes or whatever uh you can make good progress on the reciprocal system the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe of motion so was actually the name of one of Larson&#x27;s books Universe of motion and um it&#x27;s basically saying the universe is composed entirely of motion not matter and not energy but motion and motion for Larson was the relationship between space and time space and time uh thereby are reciprocals of one another and they do not have an independent existence they are only existent together in motion motion is basically a fraction or a ratio uh with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator and motion comes in very many uh different varieties depending on the kind of the coordinates of those time space factors um and in his first postulate he articulates kind of some of the constraints there time and space both have their coordinate aspects meaning that they come in three dimension XYZ coordinates or ukan geometry um so we&#x27;re accustomed to that idea as far as space is concerned we tend to see space in XYZ coordinates but the same is also true of time um even though those two um those two are distinct um XYZ coordinates in space are um they&#x27;re not the same as the coordinates of time they are they are analogous but not the same and then um you also have um what Larson calls clock time and clock space this is a scalar motion uh that is progressing so uh you can think of this in the familiar term with time clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and that uh is uh what Larson calls a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction the clock is getting later but in no specific Direction and then uh in terms of time clock time means that uh everything is getting farther and farther and farther apart heart and um that is envisioned uh using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction um so that is like the clock space or the progression or flow of space and um in addition time and space both are quantized meaning that they have a a minimum uh unit there is a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space if you don&#x27;t have that full unit then you don&#x27;t have either one of those things um and uh this is relevant also for uh forming two two other regions of the universe now um basically uh this this part of the postulate really divides the universe into four parts um because if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time now just think space over time space divided by time I keep in mind that um motion is a fraction with time or space as the numerator space or time as the denominator okay so there&#x27;s many different kinds of motion and each one of them has kind of a different uh time space um setup and the most basic kind of motion that we know of is speed speed is space over time the bicycle is moving 15 miles miles hour 15 miles of space and one hour of time and so if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have a a speed and it&#x27;s what Larson calls the unit speed 1 over 1 equals 1 but this unit speed turns out to be the speed of light so in Larson system the speed of light is unit speed and and uh the speed of light is also uh really like the origin or the um The Ether the reference point the zero point the null point this state of rest of of a universe of motion is motion outward uh in all directions at the speed of light um which contradicts Einstein who says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson is saying that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and that half an entire half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light and then half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light so that&#x27;s the first division that divides the universe into two halves the half that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light is called The Cosmic sector and the half that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light is called the material sector and then within the cosmic sector and within the material sector you have another division uh or really another two divisions that divide each one of those halves uh into two regions so you end up with four separate regions and this is the Quant the quantum boundary So within the material sector you have what is called the timer region and the time region occurs in in places where you&#x27;re talking about less than one unit of space so when an interaction is is occurring within one unit of space remember if you don&#x27;t have Spa if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space because you have to have a a full discrete unit before you have it so if you don&#x27;t have space then you only have time because the universe is made out of space and time it&#x27;s the contents of the universe so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s got to be one or the other or both and so if you don&#x27;t have space you only have time so that is uh what Larson calls the unit space boundary once you cross the unit space boundary you move into this realm of time only and Larson refers to that as the time region so this is really like the microscopic World um the unit of space is 4.56 * 10us 8 m which is you know 12 millionth of a meter and so that is um you know microscopic compared to the size of an atom it is large but compared to the you know our ability to see it with the naked die it&#x27;s it&#x27;s way smaller than that and um so when you are in this small region uh region of less than one unit of space you&#x27;re dealing only with time and so that is and when you cross these boundaries the rules invert um and so when you move into this time region you&#x27;re dealing with a different set of rules and the same as true in the cosmic sector if you&#x27;re talking about being within one unit of time now the unit of time is 1.52 * 10 - 16 seconds so if you&#x27;re talking about an amount of time less than that you are in what Larson calls the space region because if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time then you don&#x27;t have time and if you don&#x27;t have time then you only have space and and uh so this is the realm of uh Cosmic atoms and Cosmic molecules the microscopic in in time and um the Legacy scientists would call that uh antimatter um Larson calls it Cosmic matter so those are the four regions then so you have the material sector and you have the the cosmic sector and then within the material sector you have the time region across this across the unit space boundary and within the cosmic sector you have the space region which is within the unit time boundary and then you know you have the unit speed boundary which lies between the material sector and the cosmic sector and if you cross that unit speed boundary you know the again the rules invert which means that you can extrapolate if you understand the material sector but you don&#x27;t know anything about the cosmic sector you can you can figure out what&#x27;s in the material sector because it&#x27;s the same or what&#x27;s in the cosmic sector because it&#x27;s the same as what&#x27;s in the material sector except that you have to invert the roles of space and time so in the material sector you have three dimensions of space coordinate space and you have progressing time clock time while in the cosmic sector then by extrapolation you have coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space progressing space so that&#x27;s kind of how uh the um first postulate works and that&#x27;s kind of how the reciprocal system works that&#x27;s kind of like the general map and then Larson kind of took those uh and the second postulate basically says that the Universe conforms to the rules of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian so that is um you know uh less important but it&#x27;s just basically setting up the math and geometry of the universe which some of larsson&#x27;s followers have disputed also so we&#x27;ll just you know stick mainly with the first postulate but Larson basically took those postulates and then he uh did a pro process of deduction if this then that well if this is true then this would be true and then if this is true then this would be true and he went through 165 steps of deduction to uh come up with his theoretical Universe about well if my postulates are correct this is the kind of the universe that would result and then he really compared that Universe with the universe that had been observed and measured by the Legacy scientists and in a probably 90% of the things that the scientists have have observed and measured Larson um also theor came up with theoretically and then the other 10% generally has to do with what uh the scientists called relativistic the relativistic the very small the very large the very fast and even the very slow these are um you know where Einstein resorts to all kinds of contrivances to explain like curved space and um you know um where the clock uh the Loren&#x27;s contractions where the clock is moving slower so you end up with things like the twin paradox um where if you&#x27;re moving at the speed of light the clock moves slower uh than if you&#x27;re not moving at all and um Larson uh Einstein generally came up with the math for these things but he didn&#x27;t have the concepts of why the math works that way and Larson talks about that quite a bit uh in some of his Works how his uh the ma the the quantum mechanist and the relativists in in the world of physics and so on they have the math but they don&#x27;t know why the math works or they don&#x27;t have the concepts behind the map and in some cases such as Heisenberg they don&#x27;t even in some cases they don&#x27;t even think that there are any concepts backing it up you know they don&#x27;t think that they have any meaning that they just are um but Larson provides the why and the wherefore for these things you know the reason why we use uh the Loren contractions the reason why we need to use uh um you know so-called curve space is because of this and this and this so now what we&#x27;re doing today is we&#x27;re finishing up this article that Larson wrote on the inter Regional ratio and the inter Regional ratio is basically you know I I divided the universe up into these four parts when you cross from one region to another especially when you cross from the material the macro material sector which Larson calls the time space region to the time region or when you cross from the time space region to the SpaceTime region which is the macrocosmic sector um with your measurements when you&#x27;re measuring across uh one of these boundaries you have to you have to uh compensate by taking into account that you&#x27;re only seeing part of the picture you&#x27;re not able to see everything the way it is because again with scalar motion motion that has a magnitude that has no direction or no specific Direction um it it requires three dimensions of space to describe one dimension of scalar motion and we have three dimensions of scalar motion so there there are two dimensions of scalar motion that are not able to be represented by a reference system by a coordinate reference system and so we have to take that into account and so there is a there is a certain amount of um kind of compensation that you need to uh take in you know take factor in uh about what you&#x27;re not seeing so if you&#x27;re seeing something thing uh you&#x27;re only seeing a certain fraction certain percentage of what&#x27;s actually happening so you have to turn around and multiply that to get the real measurement of things and so this is a crucial measurement that&#x27;s made the inter Regional ratio which help helps you to determine uh for example the basic properties of matter uh the interatomic distance the um compressibility um you you need to use this uh inter Regional ratio in in Myriad different circumstances when you&#x27;re trying to do science with the reciprocal system okay now I did the first half of this paper yesterday so if you want to start at the beginning you want to go back that far uh to yesterday&#x27;s uh p uh yesterday&#x27;s uh video uh but so I&#x27;m going to start here right in the middle of this paper any two scalar magnitudes of the same kind can be added algebraically thus 2 Gall of water plus 3 Gall of water amounts to 5 Gall of water scalar speeds are additive in a similar manner a speed of uh X units added to a speed of Y units arrives at a total speed of x + y units but if the second of these motions is taking place in two scalar Dimensions with speeds of Y and Z respectively the quantities y and z are independent by definition since Z is independent of Y it is also independent of x + y it follows that when a motion is taking place in two or more scalar Dimensions only the speed in one of these Dimensions can be added to another speed again you have to keep in mind that you it requires the entire reference system three dimensions of space to describe one dimension of scalar motion so if you have two dimensions of motion then you&#x27;re not able to represent that in a reference system so um you know so he says when a motion is taking place in two or more scalar Dimensions only the speed in one of these Dimensions can be added to another speed the same principle applies where there are other differences between scalar quantities for example that between Motion in space and Motion in time that&#x27;s what you would get if you crossed that um that unit speed boundary from the material sector to the cosmic sector you go from Motion in space to Motion in time you would do the same thing if you crossed from the uh the macro material sector into the time region you cross from Motion in space to motion in time Motion in the time region is an extension of ordinary vectorial motion into a second speed unit a unit of motion in time which for reason it&#x27;s explained in my books acts as a modifier of the spatial speed that is as Motion in equivalent space rather than a motion in actual time uh as one of Larson&#x27;s followers Dr Bruce Pratt would say we don&#x27;t see time we only see space and so when a phenomena occurs in time we see it as its inverse quantity in space so that&#x27;s kind of like a a a white dwarf star a white dwarf star is an ex uh is a a star that is exploding but the explosion goes beyond beond the speed of light when the the explosion is so powerful that it goes beyond the speed of light that means that instead of exploding into space it starts to explode into time and when something explodes into time we see it as an implosion in space and so the star implodes in space and it becomes super small and super dense like a white dwarf star so that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s an example of of what we&#x27;re talking about here um so it becomes a modifier of the spatial speed that is as Motion in equivalent space uh it&#x27;s rather than a motion in actual time the real motion is occurring in actual time but we see it in equivalent space as the reciprocal of what is the phenomena really is in time so if it&#x27;s exploding in time we see it as imploding in space as long as the net total motion is below the neutral level there are no fractional units in the universe of motion but the equivalent of a fractional unit of space or time can be produced by adding units of the inverse quantity or the inverse entity a speed in the range between one unit of motion in space and one unit of motion in time uh which is two units when measured from the spatial zero can be obtained either by adding a fractional increment to a unit of motion in space or by adding a negative fractional increment to a unit of motion in time like scalar Motion in different dimensions scalar Motion in time is independent of scalar Motion in space and these two different procedures therefore produce results that are independent the full range of the time region motion is two scalar units from zero spatial speed to zero temporal speed in as much as the motion beyond the unit speed level is independent of that in the range below Unity it is not limited to the one dimension of motion represented in the reference system but extends over all three dimensions in each Dimension the speed feed may be either a modified spatial unit or a modified temporal unit as indicated in the preceding paragraph consequently there are two to the3 or eight different permutations of the spatial and temporal motions of these only one the all spatial combination SSS is commensurable with quantities in the reference system and appears as a magnitude in that system if one of the spatial motions is replaced by a temporal motion as in space space time the resulting combination of scalar quantities is different from space space space and independent of it just as the dimensional combination s X+ Z is independent of the combination X+ y the same is true of the other possible permutations the complete list is SSS SST STS stt TSS TST TTS and TTT those are the eight possibilities or you know igen States here then is the size of the container the capacity of the single space unit to contain compound units of motion in which the introduction of time components produces the equivalent of less than a unit of space what we want to do next is to determine how many units of motion in the form of matter can exist in this 8 unit container we have seen that the rotational motion of the atom around one of its three axes is onedimensional each such rotation constitutes one unit of motion and since the container has room for eight units it can accommodate eight of these rotations so far as we have been dealing with dimensions of space space or time uh equivalent space now we need to take into account the fact that the atomic rotation is taking place in three dimensions of motion Each of which can be resolved into three dimensions of space or time in the two additional dimensions of motion the rotation of the atom is two-dimensional okay well I was hoping to get done with this paper uh here today I guess it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not there&#x27;s not much more here okay each unit um of this rotation occupies two of the scalar units of the container thus only four such rotations can be accommodated in each dimension of motion the total number of different combinations of rotations for the motion as a whole is then 8 * 4 * 4 = 128 what this means is that the space unit can contain 128 independent scalar motions only one of which is the SSS combination in the one dimension of motion represented by the reference system appears as an observable quantity in that reference system for the rotational motion alone the ratio of total to observable rotation is 128:1 so when you&#x27;re just dealing with rotational motion alone the inter Regional ratio is 128 but that can be complicated if you&#x27;re if if you&#x27;re dealing with also with other kinds of rotation uh other kinds of motion uh such as vibrational motion the fact that the rotational motion is a rotation of a vibration introduces an additional Factor as the units of motion involved in the vibration add to the total motion content of the atom as explained in my books this this addition amounts to 2 nths of the rotational motion making the complete inter inter Regional ratio 1 + 2 9th of the rotational motion making the complete inter Regional ratio 1 + 2 9th Time 128 to 1 uh which turns out to be uh 1408 over 9 which is 1 15644 now if you are dealing with only u a subatomic particle then you only add one nth instead of 29ths and you end up with the number 142.2 two so you you diff you deal with different inter Regional ratios depending on uh you know what kind of motion you&#x27;re dealing with just the photon is 128 an atom is 156 44 and a subatom is 14222 okay uh go over this very slowly uh if you want to really get it um and uh thanks for tuning in today and uh have a great night</p>
