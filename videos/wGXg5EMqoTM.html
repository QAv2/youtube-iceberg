            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What happens when a scientist gets too close to the truth? Thomas Townsend Brown made a discovery that could change everything. He believed high voltage electricity could bend gravity itself. But after his breakthrough, something strange happened. Instead of going to universities or science journals, his work was absorbed into classified military programs. Brown began working with the US Navy on top secret assignments.</p>
<p>Some believe he was involved in Project Winterhaven, a covert attempt to create flying platforms powered by electrogravidics. Others claim he was reverse engineering craft that didn&#x27;t originate on Earth. No wings, no rotors, no fuel, just silent motion, and gravity itself manipulated. In his final papers, Brown hinted at something chilling. The future of propulsion won&#x27;t be built, it will be recovered.</p>
<p>His name disappeared from textbooks, but not from the files. The patents exist. The tech exists. The only question is who&#x27;s using it now. Want the declassified files? Link in bio.</p>
