            <p>foreign [Music] what we&#x27;re seeing is like medical again I was shocked they&#x27;re ready to go now because if they have an FDA certified device they can upgrade the digital security without having to go back through recertification so they can take a unilateral move and Harden their security and so for them that which makes it kind of fertile brown but I would say that we&#x27;re actually seeing a lot of folks say look we want to get started again with things we can control but the time killer and everyone says need missed it hurry up and get done because before we can deploy a production and scale and commercially it&#x27;s got to actually be standard not the proposed standard it&#x27;s actually got to be ratified though they can kick the tires and they can get dirty with it but to deploy it especially for Mission critical or highly regulated like a bang it&#x27;s actually misstandered but not suggested standard they can&#x27;t use it and therefore that&#x27;s going to be a little bit of a handbrake on scale deployments but it doesn&#x27;t stop experimentation foreign</p>
