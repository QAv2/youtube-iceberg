            <p>If you want to unlock all of the SMGs in Battlefield 6, but you&#x27;re struggling to suppress 300 enemies with LMGs, don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;ve got you covered. Because there&#x27;s still a portal lobby that says you don&#x27;t get any experience towards any of your challenges, but you actually do. So, go ahead and enter this code, Y RDAV, and you&#x27;ll get into this challenge lobby from the legend Bman himself. Put in a weird password and click host.</p>
<p>Then make sure you have the smoke grenade equipped on the support class. Or better yet, if you want this to be faster, you can get the incendiary grenade, but I&#x27;ll show you that in one second. And of course, you need an LMG out. Grab your knife and run forward. We&#x27;re going to go to show you the spot that you&#x27;re going to be getting all of these suppressions at.</p>
<p>Now, in this lobby, you&#x27;re going to have unlimited ammo and gadgets, and bots are going to be placed around the lobby. As you can see, bots there, bots there, bots there, and there&#x27;s also two spots over there and over there. And to get this done, what you need to do is tag all of the enemies. So tag everyone in this group, then throw a suppression grenade. And after a little few seconds while they&#x27;re suppressed, eventually start firing into them.</p>
<p>And once they start firing back, it&#x27;s going to get the enemy suppression. You can see it on the left hand side of the screen right there. There&#x27;s a bunch of those. What you want to do to make this even better is you can go in and redeploy and switch your grenade to the incendiary grenade. Now, if you do this, you can go into those locations that the bots are hiding that aren&#x27;t in those spots where we were just firing at, and you can throw your grenades in there.</p>
<p>That&#x27;ll force more enemies to spawn in the locations right in front of</p>
