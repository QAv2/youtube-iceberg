            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>We know that Townson Brown was born in March uh 27th around March of in 1905. U and of course he died just in 1985 at the age of 80 years old. Last year, October the 27th became his became the 40th anniversary since he passed. Next slide. That&#x27;s picture Townson Brown.</p>
<p>Next what we were going to originally I was doing a 40th anniversary presentation. We&#x27;re going to cut I was going to cover the early life and of town and in it with the it was going to be the early life the curiosity that Brown had when he was a kid. how he got into uh electroinetics or electrogravitics both terms or gravitics is the one most people are familiar with u then in it we&#x27;ll go through the he had the culage tube discovery the cow rejection where he got rejected by Dr. Milikin and then where he returned to Dennis University with Dr. Paul Befield and then how he came across the befield brown effect breakthroughs and patents projects Winter Haven a little bit bonsson laboratory and then his Navy involvement and then final years next town was born in of course we said earlier Zansville Ohio 1905 and he was fascinated with electricity from childhood did as he grew up he became became interested in electricity, electronics and radios.</p>
<p>And he was supposed to be the first person in Zane in Zanesville, Ohio to build a radio when the radio came out. That&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned about him. Next, he attended Don Academy, which was linked to Dennis University when he was in probably middle school. It&#x27;s like a private school. It went all the way to high school.</p>
<p>He had, of course, he had a strong interest in physics and electricity. And he began to build and test devices, simple high voltage systems back when he was actually started, I think, when he was 10 years old. Next, this is Townson Brown and his dad Lewis. And this is him when he was probably about 10. Next slide.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s him at 14 years old. In the background, he&#x27;s on a Curtis aircraft. He actually took a had a little course he took as a teenager that that where he understood how aircraft flew. Xson Brown was of course we know that he was a pioneer because he he was a pioneer in the foundation of electrogravitics which later became kind of involved into electroinetics. His work was of course overlooked by mainstream physicists at the time.</p>
<p>It was a foundation for future future of non fuel propulsion systems and of course his discoveries are reassurging through modern spect replication. Next slide. Now the initial discovery of Brown started with the suspension of a culage X-ray tube on a string. And I think he kind of got this from maybe some science fiction ideas of the time because when growing up there was of course Jules Fern was some of the people he had notably read about Tom Swift and of course HG Wells uh material but he got the idea of suspending a X-ray tube on a string and then when he he turned it on he noticed it moved. At first he thought it was the coolage tube doing it, but after he got to investigating, he realized it was coming from the capacitor.</p>
<p>And this is kind of where the idea of electrogravitics had got started. Next, next slide. Here&#x27;s a picture of a coolage tube. This is just a vintage picture of how big they were back in the that time frame. Next, in 1922, uh, Townson Brown applied at Caltech and, uh, he he went in there with the idea that he thought that maybe the staff, which was headed by Dr.</p>
<p>Robert Milikin, would be impressed with this stuff. But the exact opposite happened with Dr. Robert Milik and he would he he was a Nobel physicist and he had I believe he in opto electronics is where he had got his work that actually supported Einstein&#x27;s theory relativity is where he got noted and was given the Nobel Prize for that but he went in there and he was not he was not open to any new ideas especially from a student and this rejection ction kind of affected Townson Brown in two ways. First, it kind of knock it kind of knocked off his pride and uh but it also made him realize that not everybody&#x27;s going to believe in the things that you&#x27;re doing and it also caused him to get become very determined and bringing forth this new field of energy. Next slide.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s a picture of Dr. Robert Milikin at Caltech about that same time frame. Next slide. After his rejection from Caltech, Brown enrolled at Dennison. And it was there that he also about that same time he started to work in that kind of part-time in the at Sees Observatory because and he noticed that Paul Beield of course shared a lot of similar ideas to gravity that he had shared and this is why That&#x27;s probably why the both of them kind of met up and kind of got got to know each other.</p>
<p>And it was Paul Befield that actually suggested the experiments that Brown did later which are noted in his patent British patent 300311. And there is for the longest period of time after he left the Denison University the the records kind of disappeared but Paul Scheskin was able to relocate the recommendation by Dr. Paul Beville to for Brown when when he got when he went into the Navy. So he was vindicated there. Next uh slide.</p>
<p>Birth of the DI Brown effect. Well, after he had done some of the tests, he found that um that asymmetric capacitors produce a directional thrust. And he this was observed in the air. And also he in his vacuum he made a vacuum tube and he actually noticed it in that vacuum tube and he noticed this in the pat in the original patent the British patent 300 311 the force in would increase when the voltage would rise and if you kept a dialectric separation between the plates and the stronger that in the stronger you kept that dialectric the and the voltage rose without breaking down or arcing over you could you could would this effect would get stronger. This became central to Brown&#x27;s life.</p>
<p>Next video, next slide. Okay. Yeah. Uh it was this it was a it was the revelation of the be brown effect that of course established the foundation for the u further research later on. Next slide.</p>
<p>Here is of course many of y&#x27;all seen these pictures. This is the the British batten where it it shows these it shows these plates and it shows the here it shows it shows each plate it&#x27;s actually going negative to positive and when you apply the negative charge to the positive side it would move in the direction toward positive. Of course, you have the the uh the one he did where it was immersed in one of the tests they did in immersion where they did it in a tank and he got up to as high as he said uh 300 I think it was 350,000 votes. And then the the next picture over here shows the the two lead balls that are separated with a a piece of glass rod in between them. And it would it would when he jolt it, it would move.</p>
<p>Next slide. And then of course this is you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve seen this there&#x27;s a photograph of it later where he had built these two gravitators as he called them and they would spin. Now the gravitators themselves were lead oxide plates originally separated with between them was about a eighth to a/4 in of what they call empire cloth back then which was empire cloth was used on a lot of the old early wires for insulator and heat insulation. And he took the he soaked these in several places. He soaked them in oil, but other time other times he&#x27;s beeswax.</p>
<p>And then he covered these again with uh shellac. And then he it was bake light on the outside. And then there was a small gap on one end with a so that if it discharged it would uh it was 11,000 of an inch wide. It was to keep it from being over voltaged. But when you like I said when you invoke the negative charge to the positive it would it would move in the direction toward the positive charge.</p>
<p>And in the next photo you&#x27;ll see the same this picture here of this drawing illustration where he&#x27;s in his lab at his basement in Sainsville, Ohio. Next slide. Yeah. Here, here&#x27;s the construction of the asymmetric capacitor. Shows it a lot better here.</p>
<p>A lot closer. Next slide. That was the rectangular one. He also built some round ones. And it&#x27;s still the basic same principle.</p>
<p>Next slide. Here&#x27;s the vacuum tube. the one where he had had it back in a vacuum and he had a negative charge going through the vacuum and it going to the positive side. Um, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m kind of surprised on this because he showed this and when he first came out with the patent immediately he was accused of an ion wind effect. And this kind of shows that well ion wind has to have an atmosphere before it can go through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Next slide. Here&#x27;s a photograph of the that picture I was talking about. Down on the bottom is the high voltage source going up and you can just barely see the lines in it where where it hangs. And uh but this was in the basement. Believe it was in the basement of his house in Zainsville, Ohio.</p>
<p>Next slide. His next patent was the 1,97483 US patent electroinetic generator. This is the first time he uses the word kinetic in his patents. And in this patent next next slide I don&#x27;t know if you can see these or not but in them he had already reduced it looks to me like he had already reduced down to one single u electrode And these were longer and there was a separation between the positive and the negative there. But on on I think it I can&#x27;t see that real good.</p>
<p>The figure on the the bottom side there it was more like a fan shape more curved. And whenever I I built some like this, similar to this, and Tim, the first time he came and photographed them, I had them on my table, but they worked pretty well. They were a little bit different, but they did work. And he had these in a circular form to form a motor so that would spin like a motor. And I think this is where he got the idea of of of rotating everything in a a circle.</p>
<p>Uh, it worked. it worked for the time. And then over there&#x27;s he shows a one of them&#x27;s a generator and one of them&#x27;s a um the motor. And the generator works I think kind of opposite of the generator, but it would generate it would generate these fields. And he it looks like he had on this bottom part he had actually had several of them a former motor that would that could actually do some work.</p>
<p>Next pat I mean next page I&#x27;m sorry. Yeah, here&#x27;s a better version of that. It shows the the negative charge spinning and it the generator spinning opposite in the generator. And then on the other side, it shows the the the motor turning in the toward the positive end. It&#x27;s just kind of reversed on this other side on the generator side.</p>
<p>Next slide. Of course, this is the the probably the one of the most famous patents is this 2,949 550 from project Winter Haven which was used to to interest the US Air Force and Navy into his research. And there&#x27;s of course pictures of this where the apparatus is I think I believe that this the one on top was actually like 17 ft in diameter all the way across and then these three foot disc were at the bottom suspended from pose from the top. Next next shot. Yeah, this is the side view of it where he shows the one side the negative and the negative separated from the positive and then they show and this in here shows a power supply being built inside of it kind of and as an illustration of how it would work if it was going to be as an aircraft or a moving vehicle.</p>
<p>Next, next shot. This is a another part of the uh patent. It just shows the um this is more for moving. I I think this is described for more for moving fluid. It can move air or some kind of solution through space.</p>
<p>and the power supply. It shows it shows the high voltage power supply being hooked up on one negative and one positive. And then this of course is where from the negative back side it would flow over to the front or it would move toward it would go from the negative charge to the positive charge. at several thousand volts. Next slide.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s another illustration of it. Again, this is the one everybody sees. You&#x27;ve got the negative charge coming off of the back with the arc electrode with a negative charge that&#x27;s grounded to the center. And then you&#x27;ve got the positive on the front separated with a dialectric separation between the two of them. And again, it&#x27;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just showing it how it would work in real time. Next slide. This is the notes that u Brown sent to Tom Turman. Tom Turman was an electrical engineer and he um had he he had conversed with Townser Brown several times, many many times in fact and Tom Turman was told by Brown in 1967 after several times that he had written him about 1967 he was Brown finally told him he says I can&#x27;t talk to you anymore. Um, they&#x27;re pressuring me to not talk about this anymore.</p>
<p>And that was in the more advanced stages of his research. Next slide. Here are the these are two gravitator sauce saucer discs. This is probably late 40s or early 1950s. Next slide.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a construction of one of those in his laboratory. And he used originally he used plexiglass wood and then plexiglass for these uh where he would put the the circuit electrodes. Next slide. Here&#x27;s a famous picture of Brown holding the three-foot uh disc capacitor. Next slide.</p>
<p>And of course, this is him in the laboratory testing them in uh I believe this is in Long Beach is where this is at where this picture was taken, California. And you can notice one thing you&#x27;ll notice how big the power supply is that he used for these bigger discs. Takes a little bit more watts to move a big a little bit bigger size disc than the smaller ones. I I first started out building these disc for scale and I made a inch mine were an inch and a half in diameter the first ones that I built and I was just under 50,000 volts about 40,000 volts and I was able to get it to work pretty good fairly about one revolution per second and then later as I the biggest ones I made have been 6 in but I made some that were heavier that Each one of them weighed a half a pound each and they were very thick and blunt on the ends. And I think I got the best out of those.</p>
<p>I actually got the best speeds out of those when I was testing them in my at home and when I lived in Amarella, Texas. Next photo. Next. This is this is a this this is another one I built. This is the one that This is a picture of the one that Tim took a picture of and I just showed this.</p>
<p>In this particular one, I had sealed off the high vol I used some real high voltage wire with insulator on it on the front and then I sealed it off with silicone and u the plexiglass. I had it attached. the Plexiglass. Well, standing right across from me was Tom Balone and he was watching it run and he said, &quot;How come you got this high vol high voltage? How come you got that glued to that? It&#x27;s conducting through the plastic.&quot; Well, of course, I looked at him. I said, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s sealed off.&quot; He says, &quot;No, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s conducting.&quot; Later on, I found out BR that Tom Balone was partially right because whenever you get a high voltage stream across plexiglass past about 70,000 volts, it will actually form a posy electric field effect and it&#x27;ll actually move.</p>
<p>But it was actually moving and and they we were it was working. It worked pretty good. But uh I just wanted to note that next next slide. This is the this is uh Paul Aallet&#x27;s explanation of the Bfield Brown effect in subquantum kinetic kinetics. I was going to pull that up.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll go to the next slide. Okay, this is the G-Hill. This is a giill that um was talked about by Brown and Paul Aallet put it in explanation in his books the uh secrets of anti-gravity propulsion and also his subquantum kinetics book where he shows a high K dialectric with a force and then with a Ghill and then a G well gravity hill and a gravity well and um I think This is this could be argued here. Some people would say, well, this is like warping time and space, but uh uh Brown kind of led to that, but uh there&#x27;s a lot of controversy about that. Nevertheless, we know that when you have a strong dialectric and you have the high voltage that it will it it creates kind of a damning type effect and it does move from the negative charge to the positive side positive force.</p>
<p>Next chart. Next uh picture. This is the electro. This is the the patent that this is the one that I built later on of the US patent 3 million 22,430 electrostatic generator. And I built this when I did I built this as a generator.</p>
<p>I did not build it as a propulsion device to move stuff. I just wanted to see if you could build it. Now, I did in my pictures if you um what I did was I I actually used coffee cans and I drilled ho different size holes through it to expand it out. It got got up three or four different sizes and then it came out and I had 20,000 volt capacitors between each one in every one of these and on each side I had two sets of them. So on each side I had about 260,000 volts roughly and on my discharge of the where I had the charge from it I was getting I got about almost a 6 to 8 in spark got it that long on the going from to [clears throat] from that to the um grounding plate.</p>
<p>Next slide. Yeah, this is this is the downstep generator. And I built this when your high voltage system hits the um I built a little grid and it and then I had this hooked to some other series of capacitors and each one of these capacitors were different size. The incoming one was 20,000 votes. And then the next one was lower and lower and lower.</p>
<p>And then in between here, Brown tells you to build a a spike. It was a spiker. It&#x27;s like a point system. It would spin around and it would discharge this. And on my particular research when I was doing this, I was like all the way down the last capacitor which was 50 volts.</p>
<p>I was getting about 14 to 20 volts. The only thing wrong with it was the sparkle wasn&#x27;t working that good. I was only I was getting the amperage from the uh ionizer that was coming out of the top of the of the burner there. And that&#x27;s what I was getting. I was getting se it was showing seven oh just under seven milliamps on that on the discharge side.</p>
<p>So the spiker wasn&#x27;t working as good and I think in this particular instance the I would with modern technology would probably be better to build it more like a digital type of system to go in there to switch it and I think it would work better and be a lot more efficient. Uh, next slide. Of course, this is the patent 3,187206. This um this is the first one. It shows the the column and Brown found this middle column.</p>
<p>The first time he did it, he just used a Pyrex glass. It was didn&#x27;t have any kind of dialectric around it. The one thing he noted in there is that that ball on the bottom end need to be bigger than the column itself. It need to be in circumference and it would it would and he made he said that you didn&#x27;t want it you you want to make sure that it the conduction went through the rod and the you were able to control the timing of this so that the voltage built up at the top into the curved dome or cuic that you have at the top. uh the bottom side there.</p>
<p>He also showed the the tea here in this he he did the same thing. And of course you in project winter haven there were v different variations of that. There was one two three four different balls that were on the bottom. And then uh later after project winter haven was complete he started using applying the uh barium titanate that he used on the column and it it&#x27;s my understanding from Kitselman who had witnessed this Al Kitsman who was a good friend of his he went to Washington DC to see Brown do this and the first time he saw It had the demonstration on it. Um I think this u this dome that he had made u when he applied the voltage to it, it produced about 100 grams, I think he said 100 grams of thrust per newton.</p>
<p>And then later he was able to get he he claimed that he was able to increase it up to 400 g. Next slide. This is the famous uh wedge shapes. Hello. I always like to use this kind of as a version of that.</p>
<p>In this the negative charge is on this side, the positive charge on this side and it would move in this direction I think. And he has different pictures here. He shows the same thing using a uh a coil version of it where when the negative the actually when the positive was below the curve it the flow of electrons would go up and it would raise it up that direction. And this of course is with a series of them put together to create movement or like a kind of a transduction effect. Next slide.</p>
<p>This is a picture of my flame jet generator. Uh this is the one I built in 2018. Now, all this stuff, what you&#x27;re looking at here on the the little red at the bottom are the capacitors, and they&#x27;re sealed in wax. They&#x27;re attached in between each one of these plates. And I had 12 plates.</p>
<p>The plates were just simply to hold the cans in place. And then I wrapped muffler tape around that and sealed it to form the uh to run the flame through. And this stuff in between that is actually ceramic fiber. We used to use it in the uh in the [clears throat] casting operation at the plant. It has a melting temperature of about 3200° F.</p>
<p>And below that, you can&#x27;t see it are the controls. Next one. Next uh slide. This is looking at it from the on this end closest to the end toward the bottom is the where the there was a blower I had in there and I tried to use a blower and then the high voltage power supply came in there and I had the needle right dead center where the flame would would it would charge it up and it would blow through the tube. Next slide.</p>
<p>Yeah. Here. And I used what I used originally was a uh just a Bunson burner. It worked pretty good. Uh the problem I had though was you had to have that where the needle came out.</p>
<p>You didn&#x27;t want it too close to any of the metal because it would start discharging off of it. And I did was able to overcome that by by putting some insulation around it to so that would continue and blow through the the tube of uh of the the burning tube. Next slide. This is the exit end. And this ball on the side over there is a discharge.</p>
<p>I had a a plate a little later I built a grid and the grid would the flame would hit the grid and then it would discharge and then it would it was hooked on the balls over here. The balls were just how I use them because they they work real good with high voltage electricity. Next slide. This is the pulser I built. And right next to that are the series of capacitors I had.</p>
<p>I had about I think I had eight eight or 10 of them. And it they like I said 220,000 volt capacitor then it went through the next one was uh 500 volts and then it dropped to 250 all the way down to 100 then down to 50 volts. Next slide. There&#x27;s a grid. That&#x27;s the grid that I made for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I lost all this stuff. I was up in Michigan. We had a fire and I lost it in the fire back in October 2018, but it was after I&#x27;d done the presentation at Ellswick&#x27;s Tesla Tech Conference. Next slide. Now, I&#x27;m going to stop it right there because this here&#x27;s a part two of the whole uh presentation.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just more or less about Brown going his life going into the Navy. But I&#x27;m going to stop it here and anybody wants to ask questions about the flame jet generator, they can go ahead and we can go ahead and pull them up and they can do that.</p>
