            <p>so now this is a rotating device i designed to put a superconducting disc in here it&#x27;s just on a little uh little dc motor and i&#x27;m just going to spin it up and try different different speeds here and see what happens if there&#x27;s any shielding effect here or disruption to the gravitational field as um podcanoff observed in the 90s and um thing lee talked about and dr ningli and then hitting it with the rf would uh presumably cause uh increased precession a lot like in uh nmr where you excite the the processional motion of the nucleus with radio frequency at the resonant frequency at the larmor frequency uh the rotating superconductors are supposed to set up their own magnetic field and that&#x27;s called the london moment and because of that it could cause um a polarizing field so it&#x27;d be a lot like a type of nmr or nuclear magnetic resonance effect so this is just a basic kind of rudimentary test i was going to attach a accelerometer here to test for changes in just around the superconductor changes in gravitational acceleration and i also had this other sensor i made with piezoelectric discs in it but for now i&#x27;m just going to do this quick and basic ones to test for any weight changes or effects on the weight of this column of water this cup of water here a lot of things in this experiment that i had to try to rule out is uh of course air currents from this thing spinning because it does generate air currents uh so this glass plate here should shield a lot of that hopefully um and vibration this thing is sitting on a like a foam cushion here so that will absorb a lot of vibration and of course i had to balance this rotor here and this is the superconductor i&#x27;m going to use in this test and i&#x27;m not making uh i don&#x27;t have my fingers crossed on this because it&#x27;s a different kind of material which i got off ebay it&#x27;s a i think it&#x27;s a titanium barium calcium copper oxide which is a different composite than the atrium barium copper oxide that was used in those dr podcoff rotating superconductor rotating experiments and also i played around with this in my previous video but it&#x27;s quite and i think it&#x27;s like maybe a millimeter thick so it&#x27;s i would preferably want something a lot thicker and i would want something with the atrium in it but we&#x27;ll see what happens now this is going to be kind of awkward to do so hopefully it works out okay hopefully there&#x27;s just enough to do this i gotta move quick here now if i spin this thing up it&#x27;s going to shoot everywhere so okay here goes i&#x27;ll try to measure the rpm here too 1693 2087 2200 2500 2300 3000 rpm 3300 4000 now i&#x27;m going to turn it off and laser dot i don&#x27;t see moving five six thousand rpm 6500 i&#x27;ll try one more time here we go okay watch the laser dot do 1000 rpm 13 26 3000 rpm five thousand six thousand sixty eight hundred seven thousand eight thousand rpm inconclusive okay so this test i&#x27;m going to try this out which i made some time ago this is a super connecting wire i&#x27;m just going to rotate it really fast on this dremel here maybe up to uh i won&#x27;t be able to measure the rpm but uh it&#x27;s good up to 35 000 rpm at least that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s rated for but i&#x27;m not going to go that high because because of vibration um so it might get up to maybe 5 000 10 000 and so we&#x27;ll just look for any kind of movement on the laser dot there this is going to be tricky because once i cool it because it&#x27;s going to be spinning so fast it&#x27;s going to want to it&#x27;s going to warm up quickly so yeah that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s going to be a defect of this experiment okay so i&#x27;m going to go cool this down there we go getting colder i just thought i&#x27;d include this footage because it&#x27;s so cool and a little dangerous all right that&#x27;s probably good all right it goes crazy there goes hmm [Music] wow see what happened there that&#x27;s what i thought going to make a lot of contact with the air this is all frost so this is going to be zero degrees celsius at the surface and then so most likely it&#x27;s not super conducting anymore oh well i tried all right so i&#x27;m going to do this experiment where i have in here this is a a resin disc with bismuth powder in it and i&#x27;m going to pour some liquid nitrogen in here and cool it down to about minus 196 degrees celsius and then what i&#x27;m going to do is quickly place it on this strong magnet here which is about 4 000 gauss here and what i&#x27;m thinking is that&#x27;s going to suddenly cause the nuclear dipole moments to reorient in alignment with the magnetic field this will be a nuclear polarization much more pronounced than at room temperature so i think that that might cause a gravitational wave which might disrupt the gravitational field here of this this is a cup of water weighing 241.32 grams and so um if there&#x27;s any change here or any gravitational wave or whatever um should cause a disruption in this reading on the digital scale i&#x27;m also going to do a balanced test after this too and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s cold and i need this silly scale to stay on 241.24 nothing on the digital scale 0.22 okay i don&#x27;t see any disruption there on the digital scale now for the balance test okay let&#x27;s do the balance test here and here we go watch that laser dot i&#x27;m very being very careful not to bump anything okay i&#x27;m going to flip the magnet over flip it over again this is something i had a hunch about that might work because similar to rotation the magnetic field should should polarize the nuclei of the bismuth atoms try a bigger one this is the one i used the other night that worked i&#x27;m just looking for any air currents here that might cause the thing to move due to the very cold nitrogen here evaporating okay so i&#x27;m not seeing anything there</p>
